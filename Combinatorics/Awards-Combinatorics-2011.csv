This is explored by studying the Euclidean analogs of two problems which were recently investigated in the context of vector spaces over finite fields. The first problem is a natural generalization of the Falconer distance problem to the study of point configurations.  The second problem is drawn from a large class of problems known as the sum-product problems.  The continuous nature of the first problem and the discrete nature of the second allows the researcher to incorporate a variety of methods from various fields in order to better illustrate the general principles involved.  These include methods drawn from arithmetic and geometric combinatorics, number theory, and classical harmonic analysis.  The juxtaposition of the methods from the Euclidean cases with the methods in the context of the finite field geometry could provide a more complete picture of the set expansion phenomenon.<br/><br/>This project involves studying the interaction between several areas of mathematics using a problem-solving approach, in which two problems are considered whose analogs have known solutions in one subfield of mathematics known as finite field geometry.  The problems are examined in two additional related subfields known as discrete and continuous Euclidean geometry.  The goal of the project is to not only find solutions to the two problems in these alternate contexts, but to explore the interplay between a variety of known methods and techniques in order to obtain a more complete understanding of the scope of the general principles involved.  The major areas of mathematics these problems are taken from include additive and geometric combinatorics, number theory, and classical harmonic analysis.  These areas have a variety of applications in encryption, data mining, signal processing, and bioinformatics."

Cluster algebras, discovered by the investigator in collaboration with A.Zelevinsky, have found applications in several mathematical disciplines, including representation theory, Teichmueller theory, discrete dynamical systems, discrete potential theory, Lie theory, tropical geometry, and enumerative and geometric combinatorics. The investigator develops general structural theory of cluster algebras and related combinatorial constructions, and applies it to the study of concrete classes of cluster algebras arising in various applications.<br/><br/>This project is motivated by several classical areas of mathematics listed above. The main tools come from combinatorics, including combinatorial topology, algebraic and geometric combinatorics, and the machinery of quiver mutations. Combinatorics deals with discrete objects such as finite sets, graphs, permutations, partial orders, etc. Many continuous phenomena allow for a discrete representation, lending themselves amenable to combinatorial methods of study. It is often the case that identical or similar combinatorial structures underlie seamingly unrelated mathematical entities, revealing hidden connections between them and allowing to transfer insights and techniques from one discipline to another. A case in point is the theory of cluster algebras, which are the main focus of this project."

The first project focuses on conjectures and relations to algebraic geometry and geometry of numbers that arise in the study of Ehrhart polynomials, which count the number of lattice points in integer multiples of lattice polytopes. Recently, an Ehrhart-theoretic invariant (the degree of the h*-polynomial) has opened up a refined way of looking at lattice polytopes without interior lattice points.<br/>The PI investigates the relations to other invariants such as the degree of the A-discriminant, the spectral value or the nef value of a polarized toric variety and explores possible generalizations beyond the realm of lattice polytopes. The goal of the second project is to enhance our understanding of reflexive and Gorenstein polytopes that play a crucial role in the Batyrev-Borisov construction of families of mirror-symmetric Calabi-Yau varieties. Here, one invariant of specific interest is the stringy E-polynomial of a Gorenstein polytope. A significant part of this research is also concerned with obtaining classification results in order to check conjectures and to search for counterexamples.<br/><br/>The theory of lattice polytopes lies at the intersection of algebraic, convex and discrete geometry, optimization and the geometry of numbers. The definition of a lattice polytope is extraordinarily simple: it is the convex hull of finitely many points in a lattice.<br/>Because of their elementary nature, these convex-geometric objects are ubiquitous in various disguises throughout pure and applied mathematics, and they provide fertile ground for interdisciplinary research. Most prominently, lattice polytopes provide an explicit, combinatorial approach to higher-dimensional algebraic varieties, called toric varieties. This interaction has proven to be successful for algebraic geometry as well as for polyhedral combinatorics and has unexpected applications in other areas, notably in string theory. The PI studies open questions on lattice polytopes motivated from these different viewpoints. The fascination of lattice polytopes lies also in the fact that many problems can be formulated in an elementary way and are well suited for computational approaches which makes the area attractive to students. One component of this project is to finish writing a book on lattice polytopes with Christian Haase and Andreas Paffenholz that will make it as easy as possible for students to get into contact with current research topics."

Holding the meeting in Atlanta is intended to attract more involvement from the CS theory community, which is arguably best-developed in this country.  Conference activities will be widely disseminated by the conference proceedings in Random Structures & Algorithms, a leading research journal, on the conference website, and through archived and/or streaming video of selected lectures.  We hope to attract, and support, a large number of students and postdoctoral researchers, and participants from groups under-represented in the community."

Both belong to the main stream of contemporary discrete mathematics and enjoy a broad range of applications in mathematics and computer science.  Extremal theory of graphs and hypergraphs is at the frontier of combinatorics, demanding more and more sophisticated proof techniques. Some of the notoriously difficult problems have remained open for more than 50 years, stimulating steady progress of research. Randomness continues to play a fundamental role in demonstrating the existence of combinatorial structures with desired properties, in modeling real life large networks, as well as in the design of efficient algorithms.  The aim of the proposed research is to get a better understanding of some phenomena occurring in both these areas, and how they interact. Our specific goals are to study to what extent the minimum degree in graphs and hypergraphs determines their structure and to transfer classical results, of extremal and Ramsey type, to sparse random environments.<br/><br/>The project, owing to its international character, will serve as a means of further development of collaboration between the best researchers from various parts of the world. The investigators will work towards popularizing the results of their research by publishing in high-quality journals and presenting addresses at prestigious international conferences. Having access to students, both graduate and undergraduate, they will be in a position to disseminate their achievements also at these levels of academic education. In particular, the problems described in this proposal will be a good source of doctoral research topics for current and future students."

Cluster algebras have found applications in numerous areas of mathematics in recent years, such as quiver representations, non-commutative geometry, discrete integrable systems, Teichmuller theory and even string theory. In joint work with Sergey Fomin, the PI will explore a model for certain cluster algebras in terms of tensor diagrams. The PI will also study a closely related topic of total positivity in joint work with Thomas Lam. Totally positive parts of algebraic groups are closely related to cluster algebras and Lusztig's canonical bases. The proposed research continues the study of affine total positivity, which is a new and fruitful direction in this area.<br/><br/>The proposed project is rooted in two areas of mathematics:  representation theory and combinatorics. Representation theory is an important area that is fundamental for the study of quantum mechanics and particle physics. Cluster algebras provide a new approach to representation theory and related disciplines. The PI's research focuses on cluster algebras that lie just beyond the current frontier of our understanding (the so called infinite mutation type). The notion, closely related to cluster algebras, of total positivity first appeared in the literature at the beginning of previous century. It is a major tool for understanding oscillations in mechanical systems. The PI's work concentrates on extending this theory to the affine (or infinite dimensional) case."

The proposed research addresses questions pressing for a qualitative, deeper understanding of the applicability of these recent techniques. A second direction of research concerns exploiting submodularity in information theoretic as well as algorithmic contexts. On the one hand, in ongoing collaboration with M.

For example, as far as random graphs are concerned, he will be focusing on the problem of finding sharp thresholds for the existence of factors in random graphs and hypergraphs, a special case of which is  the sharp version of Shamir's conjecture on perfect matching in random hypergraphs. He will also study expansion in random lifts and the sandwiching conjecture concerning Erd\""os-R\'enyi random graphs and random regular graphs. For random matrices, he proposes to study many problems concerning random Bernoulli matrices, such as probability of singularity, distributions of determinants and permanents, and properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Several of these problems have strong connection to problems in theoretical computer science. The PI will also continue his study of structural theorems in additive combinatorics, in particular those which have strong links to other fields, such as number theory and probability.<br/><br/>For a long time, randomness has been used by scientists to model huge and difficult structures that occur in nature. One famous example is Wigner's use of the spectra of random matrices to model energy levels of atoms.  Another is the use of random graphs to model real life graphs such as the Internet. The PI plan is to make a systematic study of random matrices and random graphs, together with some problems in number theory, which, quite surprisingly, have turned out to be related. He strongly  believes  that a systematic study of the proposed problems will eventually lead to the developments of new ideas and tools, which can be useful in many other topics, and to a deeper understanding of the relations between various fields of mathematics."

A related topic studied in the project is the maximum size of point sets with few distances in metric spaces. The context for the development of the project is related to the recently established semidefinite programming bounds on codes in homogeneous spaces. The project also pursues a link between uniformly distributed sets of points known as spherical and Euclidean designs and a more general concept of cubature formulas with the aim to use methods of algebraic combinatorics to study cubature formulas in metric and functional spaces. One of the goals is to establish new universal bounds on cubature formulas in homogeneous spaces. <br/><br/>Finite collections of points in space find applications in reliable and numerical analysis.

As in past conferences, we expect to attract many graduate students and junior researchers.  In total, we expect around 70 participants and around 35 talks.  The topic of the conference is permutation patterns and, more generally, the concept of pattern in mathematical objects such as partitions, words, and other structures such as genome sequences.  A permutation of length n is a rearrangement of the integers 1 through n.  If a permutation sigma can be found by erasing some of the integers in a permutation tau and renumbering the remaining integers in sequential order with 1 through k, then we say that sigma is involved in tau.  The study of permutation patterns is concerned with understanding this involvement relation.<br/><br/>The definition of involvement can be rephrased in a variety of contexts such as geometric or model-theoretic.  In computer science, sets of permutations which are closed under involvement are found in the study of sorting devices such as stacks, queues, and finite networks. The past decade or so has seen a confluence of ideas stemming from combinatorics and the computer science, creating new and developing avenues of research in mathematics, theoretical computer science, computability and complexity theory, and computational algebra.  In addition to the continuing interest in the combinatorics and sorting mechanism problems, some major new directions include the structural theory of permutation patterns (constructions, decompositions, etc.), asymptotics, variations and generalizations such as the concept of generalized pattern avoidance, packing densities, algorithmic and decidability problems, and geometrical methods.<br/><br/>The study of permutation patterns has emerged as a significant branch of enumerative combinatorics over the past couple of decades.  Hundreds of papers on permutation patterns have appeared relatively recently.   The number of researchers in the area is increasing and the attendance in the annual conference on permutation patterns has steadily grown since its inception in 2003.  Research is international across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia.  This is a subject of global interest.<br/><br/>The subject of permutation patterns has a relatively low mathematical overhead.  Some of the commonly used tools used to investigate permutation patterns include generating functions, algorithm design, experimental computation; tools which permeate combinatorics and computer science.  Therefore, this subject is accessible to entry-level researchers.  Our conference will provide opportunities for young researchers to learn about and begin to make contributions to the theory.  The number of graduate students who have attended the last two meetings is an indication that research in this subject area is growing."

The bridge between Representation Theory and Combinatorics is provided by the Frobenius map, which encodes dimension and multiplicity questions as coefficients of polynomials that relate different symmetric function bases; the latter have been shown to count various combinatorial structures such as tableaux, lattice paths, and tree-like structures. In 1987, Macdonald introduced a new symmetric function basis which profoundly enriched the Theory of Symmetric Functions by its deep connections with Representation Theory, Algebraic Combinatorics, Algebraic Geometry, Particle Physics and Statistics. The connection of Macdonald's basis to Representation Theory was formulated in 1988 by the PI in a program to prove the positivity of the q,t-Kotska polynomials (a truly seminal conjecture in Macdonald's paper).  The PI's program was to show that certain modified forms of the Macdonald polynomials are images, under the Frobenius map, of the character of certain bigraded modules; the q,t-Kotska would then yield multiplicities of irreducible representations in the various bi-homogeneous subspaces of these modules.  In 1990 the PI and Mark Haiman constructed these bigraded modules as submodules of the Diagonal Harmonics and showed that the q,t-Kotska conjecture would follow if for each partition of n, the module corresponding to it could be shown to have dimension n!. This came to be known as the n!-conjecture, which was proved in 2001 by Mark Haiman after a decade of intensive research in the Algebraic Geometry of Hilbert schemes.<br/><br/>The proposed research is to study connections between the Representation Theory of Diagonal Harmonics, the Theory of Macdonald Polynomials and the so-called Parking Functions of Computer Science.  The program is a three-pronged attack on the 2002 Shuffle Conjecture, which expresses the Frobenius image of the Character of Diagonal Harmonics as a weighted sum of Parking Functions.  The PI plans to work on the Representation Theory parts of the project and is guiding his PhD students to carry out the Symmetric Function Theory and Combinatorial parts of the subject.  In the decades that followed the Macdonald paper the PI, his collaborators, and his students have obtained a vast collection of results in the theory of Macdonald polynomials which have already yielded proofs of various special cases of the Shuffle conjecture. Whatever the outcome of the present project, as is common when working on difficult mathematical problems, the proposed work will lead to discoveries that may even surpass in significance the solution of the original problem.  <br/> <br/>The research to be carried out under this grant involves transfer of information from pure algebraic constructs to explicit symmetric functions and ultimately to combinatorial objects such as tableaux, paths and trees. The algebraic problems proposed can only be solved by advances in the theory of symmetric functions. Symmetric functions, in turn, are a computational device of wide applicability.  Thus progress in the proposed research should widen the variety of tools available to physicists and engineers for obtaining the hard data needed in their pursuit of applications of science. All the proposed research lies in areas of Mathematics that computers have transformed into experimental sciences.  In this setting even beginning students can experience the joy of non-trivial discovery.  Thus, this work is an ideal setting in which to convey to our new generations of researchers a deeper understanding of the wide range of possibilities offered by computer-guided research."

This area is currently very active, and the methods are central to many applications in other mathematical disciplines as well as other fields of science, such as statistical mechanics, theoretical computer science and information and coding theory.  The proposer aims to study specific central problems in extremal combinatorics including the Turan problem, cycles in graphs, graph and hypergraph coloring problems, and thresholds in random graphs. Central to these problems are well-established mathematical techniques from various areas of mathematics as well as newly developed notions of pseudorandomness in graphs and hypergraphs, inequalities of concentration of measure, and martingales.  For many of these topics, the proofs of the main theorems are also connected to algorithmic complexity questions, and questions about randomized algorithms and derandomization. Many of the problems proposed, such as the extremal problem for even cycles, have long been open; any new advance is likely to have a substantial theoretical impact and at least some practical consequences. While these open problems are important and clearly difficult, new methods and standard combinatorial techniques combined with some new ideas offer new hope for solving them. <br/> <br/>Extremal combinatorics is the study of mathematical structures which have constraints placed on the substructures they may contain. An extremal structure is one which satisfies those constraints, and is optimal with respect to some measure of density. For instance, one may ask for the smallest size of a code that can securely transmit a message while correcting a given number of bit errors.  These extremal structures arise naturally in many areas of science. As another example, given a network one may ask for the minimum number of nodes whose failure would cause the network to disconnect. These questions often lie at the heart of digital and communication security, web searching, reliable data transmission, network dynamics, and the spread of infectious disease or information; as such, they have applications to theoretical computer science, information theory and statistical mechanics, to mention three areas.  Further concrete examples include multiplication of large arrays of numbers for qualitative web searches -- these matrices tend to have billions of rows and columns; the RSA cryptosystem, which underpins much of modern digital security and is based strongly on the belief that factoring integers is difficult. This leads to the question of algorithmic complexity, which is related to the extremal structures: given a network, efficiently find the smallest set of nodes which disconnect the network; or given a code, efficiently decode a received message. The researcher plans to use modern combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to approach some central problems in the area and to study the practical algorithms which these methods generate.  He will collaborate with PhD students and teach advanced courses on these topics."

Both kinds of representation theorists seek to understand representations, but a problem that may seem answered to geometric representation theorists, such as `find a natural representation', is only partially answered to combinatorial representation theorists, who seek to `analyze explicitly a given representation'. <br/><br/>This proposal addresses several problems in geometric and combinatorial representation theory, using tools from combinatorics, algebraic geometry, and topology.

Random structures and processes, while being an important object of study of their own, are also very effective in solving problems of discrete mathematics including those whose statement is purely deterministic. An important area of their successful application is extremal combinatorics where, broadly speaking, one has to maximize or minimize a certain parameter given some combinatorial restrictions. One example of an extremal question is the Turan function, the maximum size of a hypergraph without some fixed forbidden subgraph. This is a fundamental and key question that asks how local restrictions can affect the global structure. Despite decades of active attempts, most Turan-type questions remain wide open, such as the famous tetrahedron conjecture made by Paul Turan back in 1941. During attacks on these difficult problems mathematicians developed a number of useful and general techniques such as, for example, the Regularity Lemma. The more recent concepts of (hyper)graph limits and flag algebras seem to be very powerful tools for studying finite structures and for providing new methods of operating with large discrete objects. The PI will work on a number of combinatorial questions, in particular seeking new ways of applying these techniques. Some promising directions include the Turan function, the stability property, inequalities between subgraph densities (for example, minimizing the number of F-subgraphs in a graph of given order and size), hypergraph jumps, quantitative Ramsey-type questions, and graph embedding problems. Since both graph limits and flag algebras deal with an approximation to the studied problem, one important aspect is to develop methods for obtaining exact results from asymptotic calculations (for example, via the stability approach).<br/><br/><br/>Extremal and probabilistic combinatorics impacts not only mathematics but many other areas such as operations research, information theory, codes, complexity and algorithms. Random graphs and processes have been providing successful models for various complex systems (such as the Internet or social networks). Such models can be used, for example, for estimating parameters that are impossible or impractical to be determined directly and for predicting their future behavior. Graph limits (and graph regularity) provide a method of approximating large-scale objects by those of bounded complexity; this approach has already been explored in the context of parameter and property testing in computer science. The PI will research new ways of applying randomness, regularity, and graph limits to combinatorial problems. Theoretical developments in these areas may have significant practical implications."

More specifically, using work of Fisher and Stephenson as its starting point, it studies how the total number of dimer coverings of the complement of the gaps changes as the gaps are moved around on the lattice graph. The joint correlation of a collection of gaps is a non-negative real number measuring this change, and is the central object of study of this proposal. In earlier work, the proposer proved that the correlation of gaps on the hexagonal lattice is governed, for large separations between the gaps, by a law closely resembling the superposition principle of electrostatics: If each gap is regarded as a point charge of magnitude given by the signed difference between the number of white and black vertices in it (in a fixed white-black coloring of the vertices in which each edge has oppositely colored endpoints), then, for large distances between the gaps, their correlation is proportional to the exponential of the negative of the 2D electrostatic energy of the resulting system of charges. Other previous results concern two naturally defined fields, which the proposer proved approach the electric field in the limit when the lattice spacing approaches zero. In the current project, the proposer presents a program organized in several inter-related groups comprising twenty four specific problems and conjectures. The bulk of this program is aimed at developing further the analogy to phenomena from physics, but the list includes also independent combinatorial problems, such as conjectures on tiling enumeration of new regions and generalizations of classical results on plane partitions.<br/><br/>This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science, deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The specific problems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical physics.  A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant in the study of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid consisting of diatomic molecules---the dimers in the model---along the surface of a crystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two neighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given crystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule. The main issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities that are studied (specifically, the number of different ways the surface of the crystal can be covered by molecules). In some of the instances we encounter, the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities exactly turns out in fact to be more tractable, and allows progress in the asymptotic study."

It has a wide range of applications in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry, computational algebra, optimization, algebraic statistics, and computational biology. The strengths of tropical methods come from the fact that the tropical objects are intrinsically combinatorial, and computations can go farther on combinatorial objects than on algebro-geometric objects.  Better understanding of combinatorial structures in tropical geometry has led to new algorithms and formulas in enumerative geometry and computational algebra.  Moreover, tropical geometric objects have rich combinatorial structures that also arise naturally in discrete geometry and combinatorial algebra, such as graphs, subdivisions and triangulations of polytopes, fiber polytopes, matroid theory, space of phylogenetic trees, and cellular resolutions of monomial ideals, just to name a few.  The project aims to understand combinatorial and topological structures and further the development of new algorithms in three main directions: tropical varieties, tropical curves, and tropical semialgebraic sets.<br/><br/>Tropicalizations of algebraic varieties are piecewise linear, so tropicalization replaces difficult algebraic computations with easier polyhedral computations.  Tropical methods can be used to develop algorithms and software for solving classical problems in computational commutative algebra.  Although tropical varieties have been around for years, very few families of them have known homology.  This project includes a study of the combinatorial topology of natural families of tropical varieties such as tropicalizations of complete intersections, determinantal varieties, Grassmannians, and resultants.  A difficulty is the lack of examples to check conjectures and develop intuitions on.  The PI proposes to build a library of examples for the aforementioned families of varieties and complete classifications when feasible.  Tropical curves are metric graphs that naturally arise in graph theory and electrical network theory.  They are simple combinatorial objects, yet they are powerful enough for proving new theorems about classical algebraic curves.  The proposal aims at a better understanding of projective embeddings and ramifications of tropical curves.  Application of tropical geometry to semialgebraic sets and optimization is a promising but under-explored direction.  This project aims to develop new algorithms for tropical convexity and understand the combinatorics of tropical semialgebraic sets. Many parts of this project are suitable for involvement of students and for interdisciplinary collaborations.  Research tools and software will be developed for discrete geometry and computational algebra.  The computational methods may be useful in other areas such as  semialgebraic optimization, algebraic statistics, and computational biology."

These methods have recently led to substantial progress on related problems. The first topic in this project is estimating Ramsey numbers. The PI will work on proving new bounds for classical (complete) graph and hypergraph Ramsey numbers, and proving linear bounds for Ramsey numbers of sparse graphs. The second topic of this project is a beautiful conjecture of Sidorenko and related subgraph multiplicity problems. The third topic is obtaining new bounds on the triangle removal lemma and its variants. The triangle removal lemma says that any graph with a subcubic number of triangles can be made triangle-free by removing a subquadratic number of edges. Finally, this project includes a number of extremal problems in geometric graph theory which are closely related to each other. These include conjectures which say that quasi-planar graphs have at most a linear number of edges, intersection graphs of planar geometric objects have chromatic number bounded as a function of their clique number, geometric intersection graphs and partially ordered sets are closely related, and geometric intersection graphs have small separators.<br/><br/>Previous work has shown that these and related problems have a wide range of applications. This line of work has also led to the development of powerful methods which have been used in many branches of mathematics and computer science.

It is expected that further work on these problems will lead to new methods and applications.<br/><br/>In addition to research, the PI plans to advance mathematics through education.

The questions are to better understand how combinatorics and geometry (of the fan defining the toric variety, or of the polytope defining the divisor) manifests in the Chow ring, in the homogeneous coordinate ring, and in the associated toric code.

There are a number of classes of convex polytopes whose combinatorial properties, especially their volumes and Ehrhart polynomials, will be investigated. The first of these polytopes generalizes a well-understood polytope whose volume (suitable normalized) is the number of alternating permutations of 1,2,...,n. The second class of polytopes consists of ""half-open"" variants of a hypersimplex and some generalizations thereof. There is a surprising connection with the enumeration of permutations according to their number of descents and number of excedances.  The final class consists of the poorly understood valuation polytopes of posets.  The PI will consider some posets related to group actions on other posets, the primary example being the action of the symmetric group on the lattice of partitions of a set. The resulting poset, a kind of quotient of the partition lattice, is a supersolvable and EL-shellable lattice, and it promises to have a host of interesting additional properties.  Recent work on interval orders suggests extending these results to marked interval orders, a concept previously introduced by the PI. He hopes to find ""marked analogues"" of such recently studied concepts as ascent sequences, permutations avoiding a certain barred pattern, and Stoimenow involutions (or regular linearized chord diagrams). A related problem is to find a theory unifying the connection between certain classes of labelled and unlabelled objects. In 2007 K. Saito proved an intriguing result about trees that generalizes a theorem of Niven and de Bruijn (independently) about permutations. Saito conjectured that his result could be extended to all bipartite graphs. The PI will try to prove Saito's conjecture, first using techniques from the theory of the cd-index of an Eulerian poset.  The PI will continue research with R. Du on the distribution of elements in the cycles of a product of two cycles, inspired originally by a conjecture of M. Bona. In particular, he will consider several open problems arising from his previous work with Du.<br/><br/>Polytopes, permutations, and posets are pervasive throughout mathematics. There are many deep and elegant theorems concerning them, but examples of these objects are limited for which there exist explicit descriptions of their fundamental invariants. New examples would open doors to applications, shed new light on the mathematics involved in the description of the invariants, and provide new connections between previously unrelated objects. Interval orders have numerous applications to such areas as sociology and psychology. An expansion of the theory of marked interval orders may have similar applications.

The meeting will provide an opportunity for mathematicians from the Mid-South to benefit not only from the lectures but also from personal contacts with the speakers.  <br/><br/>The main speaker is Jon Kleinberg from Cornell University. A popular lecturer, he has done great work on networks and is particularly well known for his HITS algorithm, an algorithm for web search that builds on the eigenvector-based methods used by many commercial search engines.  Kleinberg is also known for his work on algorithmic aspects of the small world experiment.  Among other honors, he received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 2005 and the Nevanlinna Prize in 2006, an award that is given out once every four years along with the Fields Medal; it is the premier distinction in Computational Mathematics.  His most recent book, entitled Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2010.<br/><br/>Two lectures will be aimed at a general audience and high school students from the best schools in the Memphis area will be invited to attend. In the first lecture,  Joel Spencer will give a contextual talk positioning Erdos as one of the most significant mathematicians of the 20th century. In the second lecture, Kleinberg will focus on questions related to flow of information through networks, emphasizing mathematical models for information flow in human social networks and their reflections in the on-line world."

The first group of questions concerns Ramsey Theory. One goal here to understand the asymptotic behavior of diagonal Ramsey numbers of 3-uniform hypergraphs. There is a gap of one exponential between the current upper and lower bounds for these numbers and closing this gap is one of the most challenging questions in the area. The author also plans to study the Ramsey numbers of sparse graphs, i.e., graph in which every subgraph has bounded average degree. It was conjectured 35 years ago by Burr and Erdos that Ramsey numbers of these graphs grow linearly in the number of their vertices. This is one of the central problems in Graph Ramsey Theory which attracted a lot of attention. Another set of questions in this proposal deals with Turan-type problems. In particular PI plans to continue his work on the 40 year old conjecture of Erdos on the Turan numbers of bipartite graphs, in which every subgraph has vertex of degree at most r.  He also plans to study the beautiful conjecture of Erdos-Simonovits and Sidorenko which states that the number of copies of bipartite graph H in a n-vertex graph is at least as large as in the random n-vertex graph with the same edge density. This important conjecture has connection to matrix theory, Markov chains, graph limits and quasirandomness.<br/><br/><br/>Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics focusing on the study of discrete objects and their properties. Although Combinatorics is probably as old as the human ability to count, the field experienced tremendous growth during the last fifty years and is one of the most modern in today's Mathematics, with numerous connections to different disciplines and various practical applications, ranging from designing VLSI chips to modeling complex social networks. Is it true that in any company of six people there are three who all know each other, or alternatively are all unfamiliar with each other? Can the countries of any planar map be colored with at most four colors so that no two countries that share a common boundary have the same color? If each link of a complex telephone network fails with probability p, what is the probability that Alice will not be to have a phone conversation with her friend Bob? Questions of this type are in the heart of modern Combinatorics and illustrate various research topics which PI plans to consider."

This is an annual conference that has been held every year since 1988 at varying venues; it brings together students and researchers from across the South Eastern U.S. region to discuss the latest advances in discrete mathematics and computer science. The conference theme is ``building bridges between the old and the new'', a theme that reflects our commitment to the support of the next generation of discrete mathematicians and computer scientists.  This conference plays a unique role as a regional exchange for researchers of all levels, but young faculty and students are especially encouraged to participate.  The conference topics are partially ordered sets, hypergraphs, extremal combinatorics, and applications of these, particularly to theoretical computer science and computational complexity.  Applications of these topics span a broad spectrum of natural and social sciences, and form the theoretical foundation of modern information infrastructure. Combinatorial and graph-theoretic methods are used in problems of biology, computer science, ecology, statistical physics, chemistry, and logistics, including problems concerning transportation and communication networks such as cellular phone networks and the Internet. Computational complexity theory is a branch of computer science that seeks to categorize problems according to the resources required to solve them.  In many cases, combinatorial tools are used to determine the optimal use of resources.<br/><br/>The conference is expected to attract roughly 100 participants and scores of contributed talks.  Four internationally-renowned researchers have accepted invitations to be principal speakers:  Maria Axenovich (Iowa State University), Jeno Lehel (University of Memphis), Dhruv Mubayi (University of Illinois at Chicago), and William T. Trotter (The Georgia Institute of Technology).  The conference is organized by a committee of seven people from the Department of Mathematics at the University of Louisville; the chair of the committee is Andr Kzdy.  <br/><br/>More information can be found at the conference web site: http://www.math.louisville.edu/Cumberland/"

This project will bring new Coxeter-theoretic tools to bear on the study of cluster algebras, in order to greatly expand the class of well-understood cluster algebras, and to prove new results even in finite type.  Much of the research will use the combinatorics and geometry of sortable elements and Cambrian fans, developed by the investigator in collaboration with D.

Coxeter groups are an algebraic abstraction based on reflective symmetry, and they have played a role in some of the important mathematical developments of the past century.  Cluster algebras are a more recent discovery, but have already shown surprising applications in unexpected areas.  The application of Coxeter-theoretic tools is one of several promising approaches to the structural study of cluster algebras.  The interaction also goes in the other direction, as cluster algebras bring to light new ways of understanding Coxeter groups."

In representation theory, the investigator will continue his work on deriving explicit tableau formulas in classical Lie types from the Ram-Yip formula for Macdonald polynomials and the Yip formula for their product; these formulas are in terms of the alcove walk model, which was introduced by Gaussent-Littelmann and the investigator in collaboration with A. Postnikov, and was then developed by other mathematicians. One of the applications is an efficient computation of the energy function, which defines the affine grading on a tensor product of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. This application is based on an interesting connection between Macdonald polynomials, quantum cohomology, and affine crystals. In order to better understand it, the investigator proposes a crystal-theoretic counterpart (based on the alcove model) of the ""quantum=affine"" phenomenon relating the quantum cohomology of flag varieties and the homology of the affine Grassmannian. Other projects in representation theory involve explicit constructions of certain representations, as well as the topology of crystals (as posets) and of a poset which encodes the structure of Mirkovic-Vilonen cycles. In Schubert calculus, the investigator has projects related to the cohomology, quantum cohomology, and quantum K-theory of generalized flag varieties. Most of these projects involve new approaches to positive combinatorial formulas for the Schubert structure constants, which express the product of Schubert classes in the basis of Schubert classes.<br/><br/>A unifying theme of this project is the emphasis on combinatorics and computation. During the last decades, computation has gained an important role in mathematical research. This stimulated the development of combinatorics, as it became clear that combinatorial structures are particularly well suited for encoding complex mathematical objects, while combinatorial methods are well suited for related computations. The investigator will use combinatorial techniques in representation theory (which is a fundamental tool for studying group symmetry, and which has important applications in mathematics and beyond, e.g., to theoretical physics), and in Schubert calculus (which has its origins in enumerative geometry, e.g., counting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions). Certain representations and the related algebraic varieties are modeled by graphs or partially ordered sets. By studying the structure of these discrete objects, which displays remarkable complexity, the investigator will be able to derive important algebraic and geometric information."

Maps appear naturally in many active areas of research including computer science (for encoding meshes of surfaces), algebraic combinatorics (for studying factorizations in the symmetric group), statistical mechanics (as host of a model), and probability (as a discrete approximation of the random surfaces needed in quantum gravity). In the last decade, building on works by Schaeffer, a bijective approach was developed for several classes of maps. Typically, the bijections obtained give a correspondence between a class of maps, and a class of (decorated) plane trees. Because trees are easier to study than maps, bijections have been key to the solution of  several open problems on maps coming from combinatorics, probability theory and theoretical physics.  In this project, the P.I. intends to (1) Unify several bijections: this would simplify a review on the bijective approach to maps, and systematize, to some extent, the process of finding bijections.  (2) Extend bijections to planar maps with boundaries and to maps of higher genus: this would satisfy some algorithmic needs and might inform recent results from representation theory.  (3) Apply a bijective approach to statistical mechanics models on maps: this could provide new models and help understand how metric properties of maps are affected by the Boltzmann probabilities imposed by these models.<br/><br/>The P.I. will actively mentor undergraduate research students and, more generally, foster the mathematical curiosity of young students. The combinatorics of maps is an ideal subject for initiating undergraduate students to research as it requires only a limited mathematical background but can lead to very rich problems. Moreover, the visual nature of maps gives many opportunities to convey mathematical ideas to a young audience during talks.  The P.I. also plans to write a review article which would serve has an entry point for non-specialists willing to learn the bijective approach to maps. Such a survey is particularly needed because maps appear at the frontier of several research communities.   The bijective approach to maps has practical applications in computer science. Indeed, maps are the combinatorial structures underlying the meshes of surfaces, and this creates a need for efficient coding algorithms. Bijections between maps and trees are the basis of the most efficient coding algorithms to date. Thus, extending bijections to new classes of maps is likely to improve the coding methods for the corresponding meshes. Other possible byproducts of bijections are random sampling and drawing algorithms for meshes."

The first project focuses on conjectures and relations to algebraic geometry and geometry of numbers that arise in the study of Ehrhart polynomials, which count the number of lattice points in integer multiples of lattice polytopes. Recently, an Ehrhart-theoretic invariant (the degree of the h*-polynomial) has opened up a refined way of looking at lattice polytopes without interior lattice points.<br/>The PI investigates the relations to other invariants such as the degree of the A-discriminant, the spectral value or the nef value of a polarized toric variety and explores possible generalizations beyond the realm of lattice polytopes. The goal of the second project is to enhance our understanding of reflexive and Gorenstein polytopes that play a crucial role in the Batyrev-Borisov construction of families of mirror-symmetric Calabi-Yau varieties. Here, one invariant of specific interest is the stringy E-polynomial of a Gorenstein polytope. A significant part of this research is also concerned with obtaining classification results in order to check conjectures and to search for counterexamples.<br/><br/>The theory of lattice polytopes lies at the intersection of algebraic, convex and discrete geometry, optimization and the geometry of numbers. The definition of a lattice polytope is extraordinarily simple: it is the convex hull of finitely many points in a lattice.<br/>Because of their elementary nature, these convex-geometric objects are ubiquitous in various disguises throughout pure and applied mathematics, and they provide fertile ground for interdisciplinary research. Most prominently, lattice polytopes provide an explicit, combinatorial approach to higher-dimensional algebraic varieties, called toric varieties. This interaction has proven to be successful for algebraic geometry as well as for polyhedral combinatorics and has unexpected applications in other areas, notably in string theory. The PI studies open questions on lattice polytopes motivated from these different viewpoints. The fascination of lattice polytopes lies also in the fact that many problems can be formulated in an elementary way and are well suited for computational approaches which makes the area attractive to students. One component of this project is to finish writing a book on lattice polytopes with Christian Haase and Andreas Paffenholz that will make it as easy as possible for students to get into contact with current research topics."

A related topic studied in the project is the maximum size of point sets with few distances in metric spaces. The context for the development of the project is related to the recently established semidefinite programming bounds on codes in homogeneous spaces. The project also pursues a link between uniformly distributed sets of points known as spherical and Euclidean designs and a more general concept of cubature formulas with the aim to use methods of algebraic combinatorics to study cubature formulas in metric and functional spaces. One of the goals is to establish new universal bounds on cubature formulas in homogeneous spaces. <br/><br/>Finite collections of points in space find applications in reliable and numerical analysis.

Starting with an empty graph on n vertices, at each discrete moment a new edge is added, its position being chosen uniformly at random among the re alternatives. The basic question is what does the random graph look like after some m edges have been inserted? They were able to give a remarkable concise asymptotic description of this evolving graph, and opened the gates to a flood of research on this and many other random graph processes. Today random graph theory is a thriving area of probabilistic combinatorics that has found many applications in statistical physics (percolation), physical chemistry and theoretical computer science. Quite remarkably, random graph models have become indispensable for the analysis of probabilistic models of growing information (social) networks. The proposer will continue his work on a model of random graph (network) in which the new edges (links) tend to join the more ""social"" vertices (nodes), those with higher than average number of already existing links. However simple-minded, mathematical models of such graphs have a potential to become useful quantitative tools in the statistical analysis of real-life networks and they have proved to be valuable in other areas, such as polymerization theory. The proposal includes problems on other classes of random graphs, such as directed graphs in which each edge has a direction, chordal diagrams--a key notion in knot theory, threshold graphs in which the nodes are assigned weights and the edges develop only between the nodes with the total weight exceeding a threshold value, and random graphs in which each vertex degree exceeds 3. (The latter condition is basically necessary for the random graph to have a Hamilton cycle.) He will also use random graphs with restricted degrees to analyze solvability of a random system of Boolean equations. This problem belongs to a rapidly developing area of combinatorial probability and theoretical computer science that has turned out to be receptive to strikingly diverse approaches, including models and methods of statistical physics.<br/><br/>This research may contribute to development of theoretical models and mathematical techniques that can be used by researchers in various areas who confront a challenge to describe (to predict) the structural behavior of huge networks based on assumptions regarding rules of local (pairwise) interactions between the individual nodes.
