A particular focus is on problems arising from the study of loop groups, or affine Lie algebras.  The PI with collaborators will study the Schubert calculus of flag varieties of affine Lie groups, and the relations to quantum cohomology. This includes understanding the geometry of Schubert varieties and the combinatorics of the polynomials representing Schubert varieties in (co)homology.  Together with collaborators, the PI also plans to develop a theory of total positivity for loop groups, aiming to extend work of Lusztig for finite-dimensional reductive groups.  Connections with the theory of electrical networks, and to graphs embedded in surfaces will be investigated.  Another direction of research is the study of infinite reduced words in infinite Coxeter groups.  The PI will study partial orders on infinite reduced words, and explore probabilistic aspects of random infinite reduced words.<br/><br/>Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures.  Such structures come up in varied contexts throughout science.  One such structure that arises in the proposed work is an electrical network consisting of resistors.  A basic problem is to understand the relationship between the electrical properties of the network and the connectivity properties of the network.  These problems have applications to electrical impedance tomography, a technique in medical imaging.  Another type of discrete structure studied in the proposed work are structures with a large number of symmetries, including for example tilings of high-dimensional space in a regular pattern.  A basic problem with these structures is to classify them and analyze the large scale behavior.  Such structures are important for example in coding theory."

A fundamental problem in representation theory, believed to be important for this approach, is the Kronecker problem, which asks for a positive combinatorial formula for decomposing the tensor product of two irreducible representations of the symmetric group into irreducibles.  The theory of quantum groups and crystal bases, which has been actively developed over the last several decades, is a powerful tool for connecting combinatorics and representation theory.  In the last decade, there have been several attempts, by Berenstein, Zwicknagl, Mulmuley, Sohoni, and others, to use this tool to study the Kronecker and related plethysm problems.  Recently, the investigator and his collaborators Mulmuley and Sohoni have obtained the beginnings of a theory of crystal bases for the Kronecker problem.  The main goal of this project is to push this approach further.  More broadly, this project aims to further explore the potentially deep connections between complexity theory and positivity in algebraic combinatorics as has been initiated by geometric complexity theory.<br/><br/>Objects arising in algebra are typically complicated, mysterious, and have many symmetries.  Algebraic combinatorics is the study of counting and organizing such objects.  This project will explore some surprising connections between this area and complexity theory (the study of algorithms and their limitations).  The tensor decomposition problem is an important and difficult problem that shows up in many fields, including algebraic combinatorics, complexity theory, and statistics, and has applications in medicine, computer vision, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication.  Essentially, it is the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals.  This project offers potential new insights into this problem by applying powerful tools from algebraic combinatorics."

Roughly speaking, a threshold is the point at which some event of interest in a random system becomes likely as some intensity parameter increases.  Understanding when this happens has long been a central concern of probabilistic combinatorics and related areas, particularly theoretical computer science and statistical physics.  For example, thresholds have been a main focus of the theory of random graphs since its initiation by Erdos and Renyi fifty years ago.  They are closely tied to the theory of percolation, a basic model of statistical mechanics dating to work of Broadbent and Hammersley in 1957.  (It was, however, some decades before the connections between these disciplines began to be appreciated).  Asymptotic enumeration of the type considered in this project is concerned with estimating rates of growth of various combinatorially interesting families (e.g. graphs without triangles or functions representable by k-SAT formulae) in situations where traditional generating functions techniques seem to be of little use.<br/><br/>Several of the problems considered in the proposal have roots in related disciplines (one general theme underlying much of the material is that complicated structures can often be usefully approximated by simpler ones), though the focus is primarily on what appears to be  mathematically fundamental. These problems are simple and seemingly basic questions that have long resisted solution.  Attacking such questions requires one to go beyond existing methods, and to find and exploit connections with other parts of mathematics.  Despite the probable difficulty of the main questions considered, recent progress by the PI and coauthors gives hope of further developments and even full resolutions of some of them.  There are also many interesting lesser (sub- or related) problems that may prove more tractable."

It is fueled by the strongly held conviction of the PIs that young mathematicians in combinatorics need exposure to a wide array of mathematics, including traditional as well more recent topics, such as cluster algebras, total positivity, and tropical geometry.  Combinatorics is extremely  well-suited for training young researchers partly because its topics and problems range from those which are elementary and can be introduced to undergraduates to those which are highly non-elementary  and have deep connections to  representation theory, algebraic geometry, topology, and mathematical physics.  A cornerstone of the  RTG is a reorganization of the group?s successful REU program, with the goals of greater efficiency and educating a broader audience, by thoroughly involving grad students and postdocs.  In addition, the  funding will allow for a larger postdoc program, as well as opportunities for postdocs to teach new course offerings in hot topics, and to teach talented high school students in the University of Minnesota Talented Youth Math Program.  It will fund more travel to conferences for grad students and postdocs so that they can keep abreast of developments and disseminate their own research, and it will give them organizational experience via the hosting of two kinds of conferences: a series of  Midwest Combinatorics Conferences, and a repeat-hosting of the annual Grad Student Combinatorics Conference which originated in Minnesota in 2005.<br/><br/>The RTG leverages both the long-term mentoring experience and fresh perspectives among its PIs to create a vertically well-integrated training environment in combinatorics at the University of Minnesota.  It builds on the previous success in summer training of undergraduates in research, by exposing graduate students and postdocs to research problems in parallel with the undergraduates, while involving them in the mentoring process.  In addition, it will offer wider educational opportunities and experiences for postdocs, as well as more opportunities for both graduate students and postdocs to travel extensively to conferences, and learn to organize conferences themselves.  The RTG expands outreach to Minnesota's regional neighbor institutions, through a series of Midwest conferences, outreach talks to schools in the greater Minnesota area, including the Summer Math Program for Women run at Carleton College, and through the University of Minnesota's Talented Youth Math Program for advanced high school students."

As far as the inverse problems are concerned, the PI will be focusing on various settings of the inverse Littlewood-Offord problems. One of his main goals is to obtain a clear picture as to why a multilinear form of independent random variables is highly concentrated on a short interval. For the singularity problem, he proposes to study the least singular value for a number of random matrices of correlated entries such as symmetric matrices and doubly stochastic matrices. In numerous important counting problems in mathematics, understanding the underlying structure has been shown to be fundamental. As our Littlewood-Offord inverse problems connect the concentration of random walks to additive structures such as arithmetic progressions, it is expected that a systematic study of these problems would yield many sophisticated applications. A key part of our project is to develop one of these applications into random matrix theory, establishing the circular law and elliptic law for a broad range of random matrices of correlated entries. These laws support the well-known universality phenomenon observed by physicists and probabilists many years ago: many facts about the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices seem to be universal, they do not depend on the distribution of the entries.<br/><br/>In addition to research, the PI will develop undergraduate and graduate level courses which cover important topics in combinatorics and probability. Some of the topics in these courses will be related to the problems in this project. The PI will continue to write research papers, organize seminars, and give a wide range of talks, from research level to introductory one in order to encourage students into studying mathematics."

Into this research program, the PI will integrate an educational program that will include supporting undergraduates as research assistants on carefully selected projects in tropical geometry and working to increase the participation of graduate students and recent PhDs from US institutions in the annual GAeL conference for early career algebraic geometers.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry studies solution sets of systems of polynomial equations.  Over a nonarchimedean field, one can split the problem of understanding such a solution set into two parts.  What are the possible valuations of solutions?  And what are the solutions with a given valuation?  The set of valuations of solutions has a rich combinatorial and polyhedral structure, and is the primary object of study in tropical geometry.  Recent developments in this field make it possible to resolve subtle questions about the geometry of the actual solution set using the geometry of these sets of valuations. This award supports efforts to refine these new methods and explore deeper applications to open problems in algebraic geometry."

The focus is on Schubert calculus in a generalized setting, and 'stacky' objects with torus actions. The PI will also use geometry and inferential statistics on graphs to try to derive neuronal classification through connectivity. The overarching theme is to bring powerful geometric tools and algebraic invariants to bear on geometrically motivated combinatorial and graph theoretic questions, and to allow the combinatorics to inform the geometric structures. The project also supports the PI's efforts to increase statistical literacy and public education through her work with journalists and the public on basic statistical and scientific reasoning.<br/> <br/>This project promotes the mutual beneficial relationship between geometry and combinatorics, or the theory of counting; an excellent example is describing how to count intersections of certain geometric spaces. Geometric spaces with a lot of symmetry can be described using methods developed in combinatorics, and these descriptions can in turn shed light on the geometry. Similarly, geometric spaces motivate the exploration of specific aspects of combinatorics. The project promotes the use of geometric and statistical techniques to study an important question in neuroscience:  how our brains are organized from a graph-theoretic point of view. Finally, the project supports the PI as Director of Research at STATS (Statistical Assessment Service, www.stats.org), where she works with journalists on how to present mathematical and statistical ideas to the public in an informative and honest way.  These efforts impact how public policy and legislation is formed; they encourages the public to become more educated regarding mathematics and quantitative reasoning concepts, even basic ones such as the difference between correlation and causation; and they show the public that mathematics and academia have an important impact on society."

At the heart of this theory is the interpretation, due to Haiman, of Macdonald polynomials in terms of the algebraic geometry of families of points in the complex plane, that is, of the Hilbert scheme. The PI, joint with Grojnowski, proposes to generalize this to higher dimensions. In order to avoid the algebraic geometric difficulties involved, they study an analog of a small piece of the usual 2-dimensional theory, the theory of the two variable Catalan polynomial.  The project will continue Fishel and Grojnowski's program for defining the combinatorial d-dimensional analogs of the Catalan polynomial.  It will explain detailed computations of the higher dimensional algebraic geometry, and motivated by this, detailed computations with a family of poset structures on the 1-skeleton of the associahedron, a simplicial complex whose vertices are Dyck paths.  The PI expects that further study of these structures will lead to a combinatorial description of the geometric quantities, and to a generalization of much of the theory of Macdonald symmetric functions.<br/><br/>The theory of Macdonald symmetric functions is already a vast body of work, with exciting applications and interactions with representation theory, algebraic geometry, statistics, and even physics (for example, in studying ``the topological vertex'' of string theory).

Here, Warrington will study the combinatorics of the mu-coefficients of KL polynomials through the so-called 'crosshatch pairs,' introduced by the PI. Central to these investigations will be the computer software (in ongoing development) that he is writing and which will be made publically available.<br/>(2) Plethysm is one of three basic ways of 'multiplying' irreducible characters of the symmetric group. The Frobenius map provides a correspondence between irreducible characters of the symmetric group and the Schur functions in the ring of symmetric functions. In light of this, it is often desirable to be able to expand a given symmetric function in terms of Schur functions. This is especially desirable when working with plethysms. However, combinatorial Schur expansions are notoriously difficult to describe. Along with N. Loehr, Warrington intends to continue his intermediate goal of finding expansions in terms of Gessel's fundamental quasisymmetric functions.<br/>(3) q, t-Catalan numbers. The q, t-Catalan numbers and related polynomials illustrate rich connections between the diagonal harmonics module and the combinatorics of weighted lattice paths. Warrington intends to respond in the obvious ways to the fact that conjectures are outpacing theorems in this arena. He will develop new combinatorial tools to directly prove many of the outstanding conjectures.<br/><br/>The symmetric group of permutations is a fundamental object in mathematics. It arises from symmetry and appears with a corresponding ubiquity in mathematics and our world. It plays roles in cryptography, in our theories of quantum chemistry and in such mundane acts as the shuffling of cards.  One of the most fruitful ways of probing the algebraic structure of the symmetric group is through representation theory. Representations are often associated with polynomials whose coefficients count things. Understanding the combinatorial underpinnings, that is, determining precisely what objects are being counted, illuminates the corresponding algebra and geometry. Additionally, the combinatorics of these polynomials is exceedingly rich; the ensuing combinatorics is worth studying for its own sake."

For example, the simplest nontrivial instance of the infinite version of Ramsey's Theorem says that whenever the two-element subsets of the set N of positive integers are finitely colored, there must be some infinite subset of N all of whose two element subsets are the same color.  Many years ago, the principal investigator proved that whenever N is finitely colored, there must exist in one color an infinite sequence together with all of its finite sums of distinct terms without repetition.  The original proof was elementary, but very complicated. Subsequently, other proofs were found that were less complicated.  But in 1975, F. Galvin and S. Glazer showed that this ""Finite Sums Theorem"" is a completely trivial consequence of the fact that the Stone-Cech compactification of N can be given an algebraic structure extending ordinary addition which makes it a compact right topological semigroup, and therefore has idempotents.  Sets with the property that they contain all the finite sums from a sequence are called IP sets.  By virtue of the connection discovered above, a set is an IP set if and only if it has an idempotent in its closure in the Stone-Cech compactification of N. Those that have special idempotents which are called ""minimal"" in their closure are ""central"" sets.  These sets have much stronger properties, many of which are consequences of the Central Sets Theorem.  But central sets have a very complicated elementary description.  Sets which satisfy the conclusion of the Central Sets Theorem are called ""C-sets"", and are much easier to describe in an elementary fashion.  The proposed investigation of these various algebraically characterized large subsets of N should continue to yield new Ramsey-theoretic results.<br/> <br/>A significant portion of the funds in this grant will provide support for graduate students at Howard University, an historically black university.

One of the goals of this proposal is to construct a polynomial-time algorithm for this, provided the entries of the matrices are from a finite field. Techniques pioneered in the Matroid Minor Structure Theory by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle are expected to be crucial components. A second problem is: given a fixed matrix, how many other matrices can have the same set of dependencies? Again, we wish to establish an algorithm to count (and construct) these matrices over a finite field. The proposed approach involves the notion of a stabilizer by Whittle, techniques from a paper by Pendavingh and Van Zwam, and a new notion of connectivity. A third line of research relates to excluded-minor characterizations of matroid classes (similar to Kuratowski's Theorem for planar graphs). We will focus especially on finding the excluded minors of subclasses of the quinary matroids. This third line will have a significant computational component.<br/><br/>A collection of measurements, a stream of digital information, a set of constraints to an optimization problem: many things can be modeled mathematically by a set of points in some space. Often the absolute positions of these points are not important, but their positions relative to each other are. The mathematical notion of a matroid captures this information. However, sometimes too many point configurations map to the same abstract matroid, which is a major obstacle in the study of these point configurations. The main aim of this proposal is a better understanding of this phenomenon. Additionally, a part of this project is concerned with the development of reliable, versatile software for matroid computation, with the intent of integrating this with the open-source Sage Mathematics Software system. Computers can help with finding patterns and structure within a class of matroids, or with finding counterexamples to conjectures."

Such problems often have applications in Computer Science and other areas of Mathematics, but are also elegant and interesting in their own right.  The goal of this project is to further develop the toolbox of available approaches for attacking Combinatorial problems.  This goal will be achieved by studying certain families of problems which can be organized according to the methods used in their solutions. First, we examine applications of analytical (continuous) arguments to discrete problems.  Second, we study extremal problems related to set systems.  Finally, we explore the application of probabilistic methods to purely deterministic problems.<br/><br/>The field of combinatorics encompasses the rigorous mathematical study of discrete structures and processes, such as sets, networks, and even algorithms.  In the past, combinatorial problems were often solved by pure ingenuity. Today, however, a variety of powerful methods have emerged, which draw elements from many other branches of the mathematical sciences.  At the same time, the rapid development of Computer Science has substantially increased the demand for foundational results on discrete systems--these can provide the theoretical basis for future work.  The overarching objective of this project is to use a problem-driven philosophy to inspire innovations in the development of new techniques in Combinatorics.  Unifying the problems in this study is a theme of simple, elegant statements that inspire approaches which arise from across the mathematical spectrum.  Consequently, these problems also serve well as a platform for bringing young people into research."

Three areas  will receive special emphasis: triangulations of compact manifolds (with and without boundary) and closely related spaces,  finite linear quotients of spheres, and matroids.     Compact manifolds are one of the cornerstones of modern mathematics and physics.   In the last century a tremendous amount of research has been directed toward unlocking their topology and geometry.  However, questions of a combinatorial character have remained largely unanswered. What is the minimum number of  facets  required to triangulate a given manifold? How do various  topological invariants  determine how complicated it is to represent the manifold on a computer?  What methods are there to construct manifolds with particular combinatorial properties?   Conversely, given limits on the combinatorics of a triangulation, what does that imply about the possible geometries on the manifold?   Similar questions, where even less is known, apply to spaces with singularities which include algebraic varieties, quotients of group actions, or limits of Riemannian manifolds.  Finite linear quotients of spheres lie at the intersection of representation theory, topology, geometry and combinatorics.   How are the topology and geometry of the quotient space related to the combinatorics and algebra of the representation theoretic data?  Matroids are a combinatorial abstraction of linear independence with a variety of applications including hyperplane arrangements, linear optimization, reliability, order restricted statistical inference, and the aforementioned linear quotients of spheres. The project will concentrate on enumerative properties of matroids.  The questions above are representative of the research that will be conducted by the PI during the project.<br/><br/> How does one study complicated spaces and structures? One approach is to approximate them with simpler objects. For instance, an n-dimensional object might be represented as a collection of n-simplices - the higher dimensional analogues of triangles and tetrahedrons. How complicated are these representations? How many of the smaller pieces are needed? How is this reflected in the shape and geometry of the original object? Are there computationally practical ways of producing these models? These are types of questions addressed in this research."

This project arose from the study of a class of symmetric functions that appears in various contexts such as in the work of Carlitz, Scoville and Vaughan on enumeration of Smirnov words, in the work of Procesi and Stanley on the representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of the toric variety associated with the type A root system, and in the work of the investigator and Shareshian on a q-analog of the Eulerian polynomials.  In an effort to understand the basis for the relationship between these structures, the investigator and Shareshian have proposed a far-reaching generalization of this relationship, which this project will explore.  The conjectured generalization involves a quasisymmetric refinement of Stanley's chromatic symmetric functions,  Tymoczko's representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of the regular semisimple Hessenberg variety of type A, and a q-analog of a generalization (due to De Mari, Procesi and Shayman) of the Eulerian polynomials.  The conjectured relationship would provide an algebro-geometric approach to attacking Stanley and Stembridge's long standing $e$-positivity conjecture for chromatic symmetric functions and  a conjecture of the investigator and Shareshian on unimodality of their q-analog of the De Mari-Procesi-Shayman generalized Eulerian polynomials. The project will also continue the work of the investigator on the interplay between poset topology and enumerative combinatorics.<br/><br/>The research supported by this grant is in algebraic combinatorics, which is an area of mathematics that seeks to develop connections between combinatorics (the science of counting, arranging and analyzing concrete discrete configurations) and fields of pure mathematics that involve sophisticated abstract algebraic structures.  The idea is to use these connections to gain deeper insights and solve problems in combinatorics and in the other fields. The discrete configurations that are studied in combinatorics arise in various fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, biology and engineering; DNA sequences, phylogenetic trees, and communications networks are all examples of discrete configurations. Combinatorial methods are playing an increasingly important role in these fields."

In particular, explicit computational methods will be developed for various kinds of cohomology rings of these varieties.  An example is the use of Groebner basis methods to obtain new formulae for the homology basis of the affine Grassmannian of a special linear group called k-Schur functions, which generalizes the classical expression of a Schur function as the weight generating function of Young tableaux.

Maps appear naturally in many active areas of research including computer science (for encoding meshes of surfaces), algebraic combinatorics (for studying factorizations in the symmetric group), statistical mechanics (as host of a model), and probability (as a discrete approximation of the random surfaces needed in quantum gravity). In the last decade, building on works by Schaeffer, a bijective approach was developed for several classes of maps. Typically, the bijections obtained give a correspondence between a class of maps, and a class of (decorated) plane trees. Because trees are easier to study than maps, bijections have been key to the solution of  several open problems on maps coming from combinatorics, probability theory and theoretical physics.  In this project, the P.I. intends to (1) Unify several bijections: this would simplify a review on the bijective approach to maps, and systematize, to some extent, the process of finding bijections.  (2) Extend bijections to planar maps with boundaries and to maps of higher genus: this would satisfy some algorithmic needs and might inform recent results from representation theory.  (3) Apply a bijective approach to statistical mechanics models on maps: this could provide new models and help understand how metric properties of maps are affected by the Boltzmann probabilities imposed by these models.<br/><br/>The P.I. will actively mentor undergraduate research students and, more generally, foster the mathematical curiosity of young students. The combinatorics of maps is an ideal subject for initiating undergraduate students to research as it requires only a limited mathematical background but can lead to very rich problems. Moreover, the visual nature of maps gives many opportunities to convey mathematical ideas to a young audience during talks.  The P.I. also plans to write a review article which would serve has an entry point for non-specialists willing to learn the bijective approach to maps. Such a survey is particularly needed because maps appear at the frontier of several research communities.   The bijective approach to maps has practical applications in computer science. Indeed, maps are the combinatorial structures underlying the meshes of surfaces, and this creates a need for efficient coding algorithms. Bijections between maps and trees are the basis of the most efficient coding algorithms to date. Thus, extending bijections to new classes of maps is likely to improve the coding methods for the corresponding meshes. Other possible byproducts of bijections are random sampling and drawing algorithms for meshes."

These are generalizations of the group algebra of the symmetric group, the Brauer algebras, braid groups, and Temperley-Lieb algebras, and arise as algebras of operators preserving symmetries in a tensor space. The proposal includes two main projects. (1) The first will unify and expand the theory of affine and degenerate affine Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebras. These algebras arise via the study of knot and link invariants, but also in Schur-Weyl duality with symplectic and orthogonal Lie algebras and quantum groups. For the PI and collaborators, the latter connection has facilitated a completely parallel treatment of the affine and degenerate affine BMW algebras, which has already yielded new findings and simplified previous constructions. The result is a wealth of surprising connections across the literature, including to symmetric functions, central element constructions, and the K-theory and cohomology of orthogonal and symplectic Grassmannians.  (2) The second project will develop the theory of two-boundary centralizer algebras, which were brought to the community?s attention via recent work in loop models and quantum spin chains. By exploring the symplectic symmetry in certain type-A tensor spaces, realizations of the type-C affine Hecke algebras as centralizer algebras may arise. Techniques developed will generalize to two-boundary BMW algebras as the symplectic and orthogonal analog; similarly, two-boundary Hecke-Clifford algebras may be in Schur-Weyl duality with type-Q Lie superalgebras. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of representation theory is to take otherwise intractable algebraic objects, break them into their most basic pieces, and build them back up again, gaining salient information in the process. Combinatorics offers many simple yet remarkably powerful tools for keeping track of those smaller pieces, the reconstructions, and the data gathered. Since the birth of combinatorial representation theory at the turn of the 20th century, we have learned how to harness these tools for use in quantum mechanics, crystallography, molecular biology, voting theory, and many other disciplines. In mathematics, the research proposed by the PI will be of broad interest, including to those studying symmetric functions, Lie theory, quantum groups, braid categories, algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology, mathematical physics, and differential equations."

More specifically, the PI will investigate the structure of graphs pertaining to the graph minor inclusion and its much less understood counterpart for directed graphs.  Recent work of the PI suggests that it should be possible to obtain much improved bounds in key results of the Graph Minors theory.  Such improved bounds will have immediate applications to the design of efficient algorithms.  For directed graphs the main questions are whether the so-called cylindrical grid conjecture is true, and whether the algorithms for digraphs of bounded tree-width that are currently known can be improved to become fixed parameter tractable.  The cylindrical grid conjecture seems to be both a fundamental mathematical problem as well as one that could potentially unlock many algorithmic applications.  The PI also proposes a new approach to attacking Negami's planar cover conjecture, a problem from 1988 that has received a considerable amount of attention.  The original motivation came from computer science, the idea being that if a graph G covers a graph H, then the connections of H can be simulated by G, and yet G could potentially have a simpler structure. Negami's conjecture would characterize graphs that have a planar cover.<br/><br/>This work falls within the area of graph theory, and is closely related to theoretical computer science and mathematical programming (operations research). A graph is an abstract mathematical notion used to model networks, such as telephone networks, transportation networks or the Internet. Various problems arise in the study of such networks, and this proposal is concerned with problems of structural nature.  Why do some networks possess certain specific desirable properties, and others do not? A satisfactory answer can have many applications, ranging from better understanding of the underlying structure, to the design of efficient algorithms, to practical computations.  For instance, one such question answered earlier by the PI settles a question of Georgia Polya from 1913, it also solves a different problem that baffled theoretical computer scientists for quarter of a century, and has applications in economics."

In the twenty first century, Auslander's work has become even more popular with the many fields that are applying and using this theory; particularly important is the fact that the cluster theory of Zelevinsky and Fomin, which is connected to so many different fields, is also intimately related to the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. The proposed Maurice Auslander International Conference plans to bring together mathematicians from representation theory and related areas of combinatorics, invariant theory, non-commutative algebra, commutative algebra, homological algebra, etc. With support from the National Science Foundation, this successful yearly event will expand its participation, extend support to more graduate students and be extended to six days. There will be expository and research lectures about such topics as generalized cluster categories, including those related to surfaces, Poisson structures and their relation to cluster algebras, Brauer-Severi variety of Sklyanin algebras, universal deformation rings, quiver Grassmannians, Calabi-Yau algebras, Christoffel words and Markov numbers, Hopf algebra actions, twisted Plucker coordinates and combinatorial perfect matchings, higher Auslander algebras, MV polytopes and Nakajima quiver varieties. Many breakthrough have been presented at this conference, for example a proof of the well-known Strong No Loop Conjecture was presented for the first time in 2010.<br/><br/>The proposed Maurice Auslander International Conference is intended to be a center of activity for this area of algebra in the United States. The conference will be a combination workshop/conference/student presentation event. Each day of the conference will start with an expository lecture by known international experts in various fields of algebra. This will be followed by at least one student presentation explaining results related to their PhD theses. The rest of the lectures will be traditional conference talks. The goal of the expository talks and student talks is to make current research in algebra accessible to graduate students and postdocs and to give beginning researchers a platform to display their achievements. We also want to introduce international leaders in our field to the young talent that we have in the US. The intent is that our young researchers will become better known in the world and will make outside contacts. Also, there is a strategic national goal that will be furthered. The US is already the leading country in many areas of mathematical research. However, it is lagging in new branches of algebra which are being developed largely in other countries. The proposed conference will help to reverse this trend. We will make these current topics more accessible and more popular.<br/><br/>The 2012 conference will be held April 25-30, 2012, and the 2013 conference is also planned for April.

It consists of two major components.  First of all, there will be 3 minicourses on introductory topics aimed at graduate students staggered throughout the four days. These tutorials will introduce the necessary background for the remaining research talks, which form the second component of the workshop. The organizers of the workshop are Mahir Can (Tulane University), Zhenheng Li (University of South Carolina), Benjamin Steinberg (City College of New York) and Qiang  Wang (Carleton University, Canada).<br/><br/>The theory of algebraic monoids, originated independently by M. Putcha and L. Renner in 1980, is a natural synthesis of algebraic group theory (Chevalley, Borel, Tits) and torus embeddings (Mumford, Kempf, et al). It is a significant part of the theory of spherical embeddings (Brion, Luna, Vust) and horospherical varieties (Popov, Vinberg). Symmetric varieties (De Concini, Procesi) are closely related to algebraic monoids.<br/><br/>Algebraic combinatorics studies discrete structures arising from an algebraic context. It is a broad and important discipline of mathematics with applications in quantum chemistry, statistical biology, statistical physics, theoretical computer science and so forth. In recent years there has been a tremendous progress on the combinatorial aspects of the above mentioned embedding theories, relating their underlying algebraic structures to the classical notions in algebraic combinatorics.<br/><br/>The workshop will provide a unique opportunity to bring together some of the principal investigators from different countries, junior researchers, and graduate students. It will outline future directions of research on algebraic monoids, group embeddings, and algebraic combinatorics. This workshop will prepare graduate students for research in related areas and suggest thesis projects. More information about the workshop can be found at:<br/><br/>http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/12-13/monoids/index.html<br/><br/>This grant will provide funding for U.S. researchers to participate and benefit from this timely international workshop, which will stimulate research on the interplay between algebraic monoids, group embeddings, and algebraic combinatorics. It will help establish collaborations among the participants, including students and faculty from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions, as well as female students and professors. It will potentially help establish connections between U.S. and international academic institutions."

The relation between the zeros of the polynomial Q and the coefficients of P/Q have been demonstrated in a series of works from 2000 to 2011.  Via Cauchy's integral representation, estimating coefficients is reduced to residue integration along the zero set of Q.  There are two main open problems addressed in this proposal.  In the case where the zero set of Q is smooth, we consider the effective computation of the homology class of the chain of integration with respect to a basis of saddle point contours.  In the case where the zero set of Q is singular, only quadratic singularities have as yet been worked out; we consider here two examples of higher degree. The second part of the proposal concerns the relation between the zeros of Q and the coefficients of Q itself.  This work is part of the emerging field of stable function theory.  The main goal here is to extend the Borcea-Branden-Liggett theory of strong Rayleigh distributions to random variables taking more than two values.  A third part of this proposal concerns problems in discrete probability theory, including locating the critical points of a random polynomial or power series, and a problem on totally anisotropic percolation.<br/><br/>The broad impact of this research lies in computational infrastructure for computation in combinatorial applications.  Generating functions are used in many areas of pure and applied mathematics: random graph theory, theory of algorithms, statistical physics, discrete probability theory, population biology and genetics to name a few.  Estimating the coefficients of a generating function is a crucial step in any application of generating function techniques. This work, and particularly the part dealing with automated computation, allows users to compute without having to develop ad hoc methods in each case.  Broad impacts of the second and third parts of the proposal include further understanding of negative dependence among random variables.  There are also educational outcomes from work on curriculum development and K-12 education enabled by this grant."

As far as the inverse problems are concerned, the PI will be focusing on various settings of the inverse Littlewood-Offord problems. One of his main goals is to obtain a clear picture as to why a multilinear form of independent random variables is highly concentrated on a short interval. For the singularity problem, he proposes to study the least singular value for a number of random matrices of correlated entries such as symmetric matrices and doubly stochastic matrices. In numerous important counting problems in mathematics, understanding the underlying structure has been shown to be fundamental. As our Littlewood-Offord inverse problems connect the concentration of random walks to additive structures such as arithmetic progressions, it is expected that a systematic study of these problems would yield many sophisticated applications. A key part of our project is to develop one of these applications into random matrix theory, establishing the circular law and elliptic law for a broad range of random matrices of correlated entries. These laws support the well-known universality phenomenon observed by physicists and probabilists many years ago: many facts about the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices seem to be universal, they do not depend on the distribution of the entries.<br/><br/>In addition to research, the PI will develop undergraduate and graduate level courses which cover important topics in combinatorics and probability. Some of the topics in these courses will be related to the problems in this project. The PI will continue to write research papers, organize seminars, and give a wide range of talks, from research level to introductory one in order to encourage students into studying mathematics."

In bringing together a group of accomplished researchers loosely connected to Combinatorics, the PI hopes to continue to extend the rare opportunity to interactively experience the power and richness of mathematical inquiry to the Mid South community and surrounding areas. This region now has access to a high class conference, much like those which are plentiful (and expensive) on the East Coast or the Bay Area on the West Coast. The formula whereby personal contacts between the lecturers and the other participants is greatly encouraged has been very successful will continue to be an important element of the 2012 meeting. This year's conference features three major segments: The foundational lecture about the Paul Erdos and his work, two Paul Erdos Lectures, and a Combinatorics Conference with excellent invited speakers.<br/><br/>The aim of this conference is to bring together a group of outstanding mathematicians who work on topics related to combinatorics, understood in the widest sense. There will be two main speakers: Vaughan Jones and Avi Wigderson.  Jones is a distinguished professor of mathematics at Vanderbilt University who is best known for his work on von Neumann algebras, knot polynomials and conformal field theory, in particular, for the 'Jones polynomial' of a knot. He was awarded a Fields Medal in 1990. Jones will give a talk on the connection between combinatorics and knot theory. The second major speaker, Wigderson, is not only an excellent pure mathematician, but also one of the best practitioners of theoretical computer science.  Wigderson received the Nevanlinna Prize in 1994 for his work on computational complexity. He will give a lecture on the intimate connection between combinatorics and theoretical computer science.  The speakers at this conference have been chosen because they are excellent mathematicians, enjoyable lecturers, and very approachable people. In addition to Jones and Wigderson, the speakers include Maria Chudnovsky, Henry Cohn, Eyal Lubetsky, Alan Frieze, and Jacob Fox. The audience will be composed of people from a variety of backgrounds with varying levels of expertise: postdocs, graduate students to senior level academics, and industry researchers from all over the world."

He will continue joint work with Michelle Wachs involving the use of quasisymmetric functions in various combinatorial, geometric and representation theoretic settings. The current main goal of this project is to show that the Frobenius characteristic of a representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of a regular semisimple Hessenberg variety is a refinement of the chromatic symmetric function of a graph naturally associated to the variety.  Shareshian will continue joint work with Russ Woodroofe, in which two problems are studied.  The first problem is to show that the order complex of the coset poset of a finite group is never contractible.  This problem has been reduced by Shareshian and Woodroofe to a problem about prime divisors of indices of maximal subgroups of alternating groups.  The second problem is to develop a nongraded analog of Richard Stanley's theory of supersolvable lattices.  The main goal is to find a theory that both encompasses the already well-studied theory of left modular lattices and provides a better understanding of combinatorial properties of subgroup lattices of finite solvable groups.  Finally, Shareshian will attempt to settle a problem in topological combinatorics raised by Michael Aschbacher and Stephen Smith in their work on the Quillen Conjecture about the partially ordered set of p-subgroups of a finite group.<br/><br/>Shareshian studies connections between three areas of mathematics, namely, combinatorics, group theory and geometry.  Combinatorialists study discrete, usually finite, structures, often attempting to enumerate all such structures satisfying a given condition.  Combinatorial problems arise naturally in various areas of intellectual inquiry, including mathematics, computer science, physics and biology.  Group theorists study symmetry by encoding the symmetries of an object by an algebraic system, called a group.  Since humans are naturally drawn to highly symmetric objects and use symmetry to understand many scientific and aesthetic phenomena, group theory is ubiquitous.  It appears, for example, in many problems from physics and chemistry.  Geometers study shapes.  These shapes might live in spaces of high dimension and therefore be inaccessible to understanding through visualization.  Mathematicians often attempt to understand such shapes by associating to them algebraic systems in a way that provides useful information.  In some cases, these algebraic systems are best understood by associating to them combinatorial objects that encode the algebraic information relevant to the geometric problem at hand.  Shareshian examines combinatorial objects arising in this manner."

Problems involving large amounts of data and algorithms for fast simulation of large systems are of interest to researchers in industry and experimentalists in the physical sciences. The proposal aims to rigorously address the question of efficient simulation. The study of Gibbs measures is a classical topic in probability and statistical mechanics. The questions proposed here are of value in establishing connections between the theory of Gibbs measures and theoretical computer science which attempts to understand efficiency of algorithms, including those which make use of randomness.

In recent years such functions have become quite important to several fields of mathematics, and the representation theoretic, analytic, algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial properties of different families of symmetric functions form active areas of current research.  Under this proposal the PI will investigate the combinatorial properties of various families of symmetric functions and other objects of relevance to representation theory and algebra.  One particularly important family of symmetric functions central to the PI's research program is the family of Macdonald polynomials.  These are symmetric functions in a set of variables {x1,...,xn} which depend on two additional parameters q,t and also on an integer partition.  Macdonald polynomials have found many significant applications to date, but there are also several captivating open problems associated with them, particularly with their combinatorial properties.  They are closely related to the space of diagonal harmonics, an important topic in algebraic combinatorics and algebraic geometry.  <br/><br/>Symmetric functions are becoming increasingly important as tools for researchers in mathematics and mathematical physics.  Through the work of Haiman, Cherednik and many others, Macdonald polynomials and diagonal harmonics are linked to mainstream topics such as the Hilbert Scheme from algebraic geometry and the double affine Hecke algebra.  New developments in the combinatorics of Macdonald polynomials and other symmetric functions, and related objects such as the Hilbert series of diagonal harmonics, are potentially applicable to many areas of mathematics and science.  The explicit and concrete nature of recent combinatorial advances in Macdonald polynomials and the space of diagonal harmonics makes these subjects accessible to a broad range of researchers and students.  Thus problems with connections to advanced theoretical mathematics can be attacked using techniques from more concrete and accessible areas such as bijective combinatorics.

Building on the PI's past work studying the homeomorphism type of the totally nonnegative part of the unipotent radical of an algebraic group, the PI now will study the totally nonnegative part of the Grassmannian, in collaboration with Lauren Williams, with the long-range goal of determining the homeomorphism type of the totally nonnegative part of more general flag varieties; such topological analysis inevitably reveals a great deal of combinatorial and representation theoretic information in the process -- for example, to understand the nonnegative part of arbitrary flag varieties would very likely require a vast generalization of Postnikov's theory of reduced and nonreduced plabic graphs.   Another focus of the project is on the development of new techniques and the streamlining of existing ones in poset topology, specifically building upon the PI's past work on discrete Morse theory for poset order complexes.  The motivating application is to obtain, in collaboration with Cristian Lenart, a better understanding of the combinatorial structure of crystal graphs, guided by questions about their poset topology which will enrich and expand upon in new directions the local structure uncovered by Stembridge.   <br/><br/>Combinatorics is the mathematics of how to organize discrete data in ways that make it manageable to analyze.  Topological combinatorics focuses on geometric data.  For example, the set of solutions to a system of equations, such as one might encounter in an engineering problem, often can be split in a natural way into smaller pieces called cells that are much easier to understand.  Topological combinatorics, the focus area of this project, can be used to understand how these cells fit together, focusing on finite data that can be used more easily in calculations.  Specifically, partially ordered sets, or posets, are a combinatorial tool for describing incidences among these pieces.   A long-term project of the PI is to develop efficient techniques for studying these partially ordered sets by a method called discrete Morse theory, which allows one to analyze the geometric object by building it over time, attaching its pieces in succession, and recording what happens at the moments in time when fundamental changes in the structure occur."

Here discrete volume refers to the number of integral points in a polytope P, typically in terms of an integral dilation parameter, giving rise to the Ehrhart (quasi-)polynomial of P. The proposed research will advance our understanding of fundamental structures of Ehrhart quasipolynomials, and it will provide innovative and novel applications of Ehrhart theory. Discrete volume computation for polytopes has been of great interest in recent years, partly because of applications to many mathematical fields, some of which seem distant from Geometric Combinatorics: Number Theory, Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, Optimization, Representation Theory, Statistics, and Computer Science.

Some of the research problems have direct connections to fields outside of mathematics (e.g., computer science) and many are easily explained to a lay person (e.g., graph coloring). Both facts prove the high outreach potential of the proposed research. The PI will make use of this potential, in particular, to attract students to research.
