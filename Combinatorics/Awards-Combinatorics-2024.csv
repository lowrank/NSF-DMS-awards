Discrete geometry, as a branch of mathematics, involves analyzing structures within sets of geometric objects, including points, lines, and circles. The central direction of this project is the study of covering and intersection properties of convex domains such as balls. The PI aims to find new connections between discrete geometry and other mathematical fields. Undergraduate students will be mentored as part of this project.<br/><br/>In the long term, this project aims to explore combinatorial properties of coverings and intersection patterns of convex bodies in higher-dimensional spaces. In the short term, the focus lies on addressing fundamental problems at the interface of discrete geometry and combinatorial convexity, including plank covering problems and Tverberg-type problems. The former direction addresses various variations of Tarski's plank covering conjecture such as affine, polynomial, spherical, and hyperbolic. The second direction is devoted to Tverberg graphs, as well as the colorful and dual Tverberg conjectures. To settle these problems, the PI plans to apply and further develop methods from discrete and convex geometry, combinatorics, linear algebra, functional analysis, and algebraic topology, with a particular focus on optimization techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A knot is a single tangled string with the ends tied; a link consists of several knots tangled together. Knot theory has wide applications in the natural sciences, such as in the study of DNA. A basic difficult question of knot theory is how to tell if two links are different: can one be deformed to the other without untying the ends of the strings? Associating polynomials to links is one way to tackle this problem. The aim of this project is to study polynomials in knot theory and other classical branches of mathematics by associating polytopes to them. Polytopes are geometric objects in arbitrary dimensions with flat sides. The study of 3-dimensional polytopes dates back to ancient times. The project also involves mentoring of graduate students as well as outreach to middle and high school students.<br/><br/>The support of a polynomial is the set of exponent vectors of its monomials appearing with nonzero coefficients. The Newton polytope of a polynomial is the smallest integer polytope containing its support. A polynomial has a saturated Newton polytope if every integer point in its Newton polytope is in its support. These notions extend to other bases besides the monomial basis. The goals of this project are (1) the study of saturation properties of classical multivariate polynomials with respect to various bases, such as the monomial and Schubert bases; (2) the study of the integer polytopes they give rise to; and (3) their applications to outstanding conjectures. An illustrative example of this approach is the recent progress by Hafner, Mészáros and Vidinas on Fox?s conjecture from 1962, which states that the absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of an alternating link form a trapezoidal sequence. There are many combinatorial models for the Alexander polynomial which can be used to define combinatorial multivariate Alexander polynomials. For one such model, the support of an associated combinatorial multivariate Alexander polynomial of a special alternating link is the set of integer points in a generalized permutahedron. Such polytopal results, together with the theory of Lorentzian polynomials developed by Brändén and Huh, enabled the proof of log-concavity, and thus trapezoidal property, of the original Alexander polynomial in the case of special alternating links.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematics abstracts these complicated behaviors, and often reveals hidden structures; abstraction allows one to see the forest rather than the trees. For example, physicists Arkhani-Hamed and Trnka uncovered a high-dimensional mathematical object called the ""amplituhedron"" whose geometry should govern particle scattering. However, as abstraction increases, intuition decreases; it is easy to lose sight of the trees among the clouds. Algebraic combinatorics, as a mathematical discipline, is a tool to represent abstract mathematics in a more concrete way--similar to how a bar graph or scatter plot is a tool to represent a long list of numbers in a more intuitive way. In the case of the amplituhedron, combinatorics provides a way to break the amplituhedron up into smaller, simpler pieces. It also provides a way to visualize each piece, even though the pieces do not fit in three dimensions. It is through this combinatorics that the conjectural relationship between the amplituhedron and particle scattering is most apparent. In one project the PI will work to prove this conjectural relationship with collaborators Even-Zohar, Lakrec, Parisi, Tessler, and Williams. In general, the PI will seek to better understand the combinatorics of amplituhedra and related mathematical objects called cluster varieties. The PI will involve both undergraduate and graduate students in thisd research.<br/><br/>The broader mathematical context for the proposed projects is the theory of total positivity. Classically, a matrix is totally positive if all minors are positive. Lusztig extended the notion of total positivity to partial flag varieties, while Postnikov independently defined the positive Grassmannian. The combinatorics of total positivity is incredibly rich, leading to the definition of cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky. The PI proposes to study two generalizations of total positivity through a combinatorial lens. The first project concerns amplituhedra, which generalize the positive Grassmannian and arise in particle physics. The PI will work to resolve conjectures on the relationship between tilings of m=4 amplituhedra and the computation of scattering amplitudes, as well as various conjectures on tilings of m=2 amplituhedra. The second project concerns cluster structures on braid varieties, which generalize positive partial flag varieties. The PI will further develop the combinatorics of this cluster structure, investigating 3D plabic graphs and their relationship to weaves, and explore applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is concerned with counting discrete objects, which naturally arise in many applications. As one example, software development frequently requires choosing between different algorithms to solve a problem. Combinatorics allows one to count the number of steps each candidate algorithm takes and then choose the best solution. In this way, combinatorics provides a set of basic tools and a collection of argument prototypes that guide the solution of problems throughout STEM. One of the virtues of combinatorics research is that it provides students with concrete opportunities to develop problem-solving, software development, and other key skills.<br/><br/>Algebraic combinatorics, more specifically, focuses on the combinatorial essence of highly structured and often advanced problems coming from topology, representation theory, particle physics, and other areas. Such problems are frequently reduced in some fashion to an intricate combinatorial analysis. One such algebraic problem is to understand quantum groups. These remarkable structures arose around 1980 from connections with integrable lattice models in quantum mechanics, and some of the technically deepest theories in pure mathematics and physics are in this area. One of the main focuses of the present project is to further develop certain combinatorial diagrams called web bases. These combinatorial objects encode the representation category of quantum groups and allow for efficient computations with powerful topological quantum invariants. They connect a remarkably diverse collection of topics, including total positivity, alternating sign matrices, plane partitions, crystal bases, dynamical algebraic combinatorics, and the geometry of the affine Grassmannian. Students will be involved in the research project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, road networks, the human brain, social networks, and interactions between proteins can all be represented as graphs. Computing different properties of these graphs yields valuable information about the original problems, but it is difficult to do so because of the size of the graphs. One technique to study such large graphs is to understand them locally by determining how prevalent certain small substructures are, for example through homomorphism densities. The objective of this project is to further our understanding of graph profiles, objects that record all possible relationships between these local patterns.  This project also seeks to make higher-level math, in particular discrete mathematics, accessible to a greater segment of the population through an educational plan resting on three pillars: diversity, prison education, and research-based courses. <br/><br/>The research component of this project will focus on four directions: (1) to compute graph profiles, including some in more than two dimensions; (2) to study the strengths and limitations of different techniques (e.g., (rational) sums of squares, sums of nonnegative circuits) in proving inequalities over graph profiles; (3) to better understand for which classes of inequalities certification over graph profiles is (un)decidable; (4) to build theory and compute tropicalizations of graph profiles, which are simpler and yet capture all valid pure binomial inequalities, and to use these computations to resolve problems in extremal graph theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, a remarkable paradigm shift has occurred in our understanding of quantum observables in particle physics and cosmology, revealing their emergence from underlying novel mathematical objects known as positive geometries.  The conference will center on the amplituhedron, the first and major example of a positive geometry, which describes particle interactions in a certain quantum field theory (QFT). We aim to explore connections between the amplituhedron and cluster algebras, a mathematical theory with broad applications across various areas of mathematics and mathematical physics.

Simultaneously, cluster algebras ? originally introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky to study total positivity ? have been revealed to have a crucial role in describing singularities of N = 4 SYM scattering amplitudes. Thus, one can use ideas from quantum field theory to connect cluster algebras to positive geometries, and in particular to the amplituhedron. Additionally, QFT can also be used to discover new examples of positive geometries.

Many practical problems can be formulated as questions about piercing sets, where the family of sets may arise in various contexts (e.g., subscribers in a social network, geographical areas, biological cells). An example from cellular communication is as follows: given that the range of a cell tower is 200 feet, what is the minimum number of towers a company has to place, and where should those towers be placed, so that every household has service? Here, the family of sets is the family of disks of radius 200 feet centered at every household, and cell towers are to be placed at every point of a piercing set. Fair division and mass partition are areas in economics and discrete mathematics where one aims to find optimal ways to divide a set of goods equitably among agents with subjective preferences. These methods can be used to divide an estate, a jewelry collection, or a piece of land among heirs, or to split up the assets of a business when a partnership is being dissolved. As is apparent in all the above examples, the questions studied as part of this project are natural, intuitive, and easy to formulate. However, they are often notoriously difficult to answer and require sophisticated tools from different areas of mathematics. This project aims to develop such tools from an area of mathematics called topology. The educational component of this project includes delivering summer schools on ?Topological Methods in Combinatorics? to undergraduate and graduate students, writing a textbook on the subject, and mentoring students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the development of a topological framework based on the KKM theorem and its extensions to address these problems. This topological framework can be described as follows: the configuration space of all possible solutions to the problem (that is, all possible piercing sets/mass partitions/partition of goods) is modeled by a polytope P; if no ""good"" solution is found among the set of all possible solutions P, then one obtains a KKM cover of P; the conclusion of the topological theorem, namely that a large enough collection of the sets in this KKM cover intersects, is then translated to a contradiction to the given properties of the family of sets/mass/goods in question. The main objectives of this project include two primary aspects: first, the discovery of new KKM-type theorems that can be effectively employed within this topological framework, and second, the exploration of innovative ways to leverage this topological method in resolving discrete math problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
