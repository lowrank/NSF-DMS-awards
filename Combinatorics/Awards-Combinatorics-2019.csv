Its primary goals are to analyze phase transitions: for example liquid-to-solid transitions where the physical properties of a substance change abruptly.  The dimer model was originally conceived as a simplified model of two-dimensional matter in which phase transitions can be studied. Recent work, however, has linked the model to many other areas of mathematics, from combinatorics to string theory, where ''brane dimers'' are proposed as fundamental descriptions of spacetime at small scales.  The PIs propose to jointly investigate a number of interrelated topics in mathematics and physics, each of which has the dimer model as its underlying combinatorial structure. This project will lead to the organization of workshops and regular meetings of the PIs and their graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, continuing the PIs' efforts to get young mathematicians and physicists involved in these topics.  The PIs will contribute to the mathematical community through their mentorship of young scholars, research talks in conferences and workshops, papers published in peer-reviewed journals, and books on a selection of these topics.<br/><br/>The dimer model studies the set of all dimers, or perfect matchings, on a planar bipartite graph G on a disk or Riemann surface. Despite the simple definition, there are many open problems about the dimer model, as well as applications to geometry, algebra, and physics. There is a fundamental connection between the dimer model on the disk and the Grassmannian, via the fact that generating functions of dimers satisfy Plucker relations. This fact leads to the cluster algebra structure on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian, and the beautiful combinatorics of the positive Grassmannian.  This project will explore a myriad of generalizations of the objects mentioned above, and will significantly improve our understanding of: the dimer model on non-planar graphs; limiting behaviors of the dimer model on a torus and other surfaces; the connection between dimers on a torus and brane tilings in string theory; soliton solutions to the KP equation and the bipartite graphs realizable as soliton graphs; the relationship between convex polygon tilings and the corresponding bipartite planar graphs with Kasteleyn weightings; the connection between the dimer model and triangulations of the amplituhedron, an object whose volume computes scattering amplitudes; and higher-dimensional dimer models, colored quivers and a generalized notion of cluster mutation, exciting new objects motivated by dualities in supersymmetric quantum field theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the spirit of the great David Hilbert, our project is problem-driven. As he said over one hundred years ago, ''As long as a branch of science offers an abundance of problems, so long is it alive. [...] It is by the solution of problems that the investigator tests the temper of his steel; he finds new methods and new outlooks, and gains a wider and freer horizon. [...] A mathematical problem should be difficult in order to entice us, yet not completely inaccessible, lest it mock at our efforts.''<br/> <br/>In the case of this project, most of the problems to be considered were posed over sixty years ago by Paul Erdos, the greatest problem poser in history, and are related to the distribution of primes and modular arithmetic. In fact, the energy and momentum of this project will be established by a kickoff conference which will bring together outstanding mathematicians who have done dynamic and useful work on some of his most challenging problems. For many decades, the main problems seemed to be out of reach, but a few years ago Hough and Nielsen proved some breakthrough results. Within the scope of this project, in applying methods of combinatorics and probability theory to solve several major problems that have remained, some new mathematical techniques for their solutions could be derived that might then be applicable to many other problems, including those in number theory. This project has the promise to be impactful in a number of ways within and beyond the discipline. For example, the factorization of integers is of great practical importance in cryptography, and reconstruction problems are likely to be of use in biology (e.g., DNA sequencing). The second shortest path problem is related to a proposed diagnostic test for schizophrenia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A graph is made up of vertices which are connected by edges. Graph edge-coloring is a well-established subject in the field of graph theory. It is a basic combinatorial optimization problem:  color the edges of a graph with as few colors as possible such that each edge receives a color and adjacent edges, that is, different edges incident to a common vertex, receive different colors. It has a rich theory, abundant applications, and many beautiful conjectures.  It is studied not only by mathematicians but also by computer scientists. In this project, the PI will develop new re-coloring techniques to attack fundamental conjectures in the field. The project will, at the same time, train graduate students and disseminate results to researchers in the area.<br/><br/>The main topic of this project concerns extensions and variations of the method of Tashkinov trees, which is the most powerful and sophisticated technique for multigraph edge-coloring developed so far.  Previously, almost all edge-coloring techniques were based on Vizing's adjacency lemmas, which have certain limitations.  The Tashkinov tree method generalizes the earlier methods of Vizing fans and Kierstead paths for multigraphs.  Developments around Tashkinov trees have opened new avenues in the study of graph edge-coloring and led to a number of significant new results such as the proof of the well-known Goldberg-Seymour Conjecture.  The investigator is currently developing stronger versions of Tashkinov tree type results for simple graphs, which will lead to substantial progress toward some longstanding conjectures in this field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two algorithmic tasks associated to Gibbs measures are essential in applications: sampling from a given model and efficiently approximating its normalizing constant, the partition function.  This project aims to elucidate the connection between phase transitions in the underlying statistical physics model and the computational complexity of these two problems.  The project features an integrated research and education plan, with the complementary goals of advancing fundamental knowledge of Gibbs measures and improving interdisciplinary mathematical education. The educational plan has activities aimed at three levels: outreach workshops to introduce high school students to mathematical research; the creation of tools for undergraduate instructors to implement effective pedagogical techniques; and the development of new graduate courses in applications of statistical physics across disciplines. <br/><br/>More specifically, the research has three main goals.  First, to develop efficient sampling algorithms for Gibbs measures in the low temperature, phase coexistence regime for models with a bounded number of ground states.  Second, to make the powerful but non-rigorous cavity method from statistical physics into a rigorous mathematical tool for understanding the algorithmic tractability of random computational problems.  Third, to understand fundamental geometric objects in high dimensions -- sphere packings, sphere coverings, and spherical codes -- by utilizing tools and insights from statistical physics.  The pursuit of these three goals will introduce new probabilistic methods in computer science, statistics, and combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combinatorics provides discrete objects that can be used to encode information about an algebraic variety. Conversely, the rich structure of a combinatorial object is often better understood when seen as a discrete shadow of an algebro-geometric phenomenon. The research in this project develops the interplay between these areas utilizing tools which include degenerations of varieties and high-dimensional analogues of polygons.<br/><br/>This project aims to understand various aspects of the interplay between combinatorics and algebraic geometry for Newton-Okounkov bodies, symmetric orbit closures, and subword complexes. Generalizing the relation between polytopes and toric varieties, Newton-Okounkov bodies provide tools from convex geometry to study algebraic varieties. The PI will develop the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies by constructing combinatorial parameter spaces for these bodies together with a wall-crossing formula. The study of symmetric orbit closures is relevant to the theory of Kazhdan-Lusztig-Vogan polynomials and Harish-Chandra modules for a certain real Lie group, mirroring the connection of Schubert varieties to Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and representation theory. The PI will investigate the projections of symmetric orbit closures to Grassmannians. Knutson and Miller introduced subword complexes to study the cohomology of Schubert varieties.

Objects of this type are called polytopal complexes and have been studied since the beginning of mankind. They also provide a schematic way to model real-world interactions. When the interactions are binary, i.e. when they involve only two agents at the same time, the resulting model is one-dimensional, and called a ""network"" or ""graph""; when the interactions are not binary, the model has to be higher dimensional. For example, ""friendship"" is a binary interaction: That is why social networks are, indeed, networks. In contrast, ""co-starring in a movie"" is not a binary interactions: For a group of actors, the fact that ""any two of them co-starred in a movie"" does not mean that ""they all co-starred in a movie"".  To distinguish the two situations, one should place a d-dimensional simplex whenever d+1 actors have co-starred in a movie, thereby creating a higher-dimensional model. The main advantages of using discrete models is that they adapt well to many deep areas of mathematics, bringing to such areas the option to leverage computational tools. Simple questions on the structure of polytopes, such as the Hirsch conjecture, have foundational importance in optimization. Discrete Morse theory, a reduction tool to simplify a given polytopal complex, is employed both in pure mathematics and in big data analysis, to understand high-dimensional shapes. The project builds on these tools and expands their application. Combinatorial and probabilistic approaches may shed light towards classical aspect of geometry, like intersection patterns of lines on smooth surfaces.<br/><br/>Enumerative aspects on the number of polytopes and spheres with given number of facets have importance beyond pure mathematics, in Regge calculus and simplicial quantum gravity. Techniques from metric geometry can provide desired exponential upper bounds. Another problem with importance in applied mathematics is the polynomial Hirsch conjecture, which was proven with metric methods for flag polytopes. Techniques ranging from knot theory to differential and hyperbolic geometry may be applied to better understand obstructions and constructions in Discrete Morse Theory, thereby revealing when and how we can simplify a given shape. A new perspective in this project is to connect discrete Morse theory with the notion of embeddability. A further goal is to lift the classical theory of polytope graphs (for example Balinski's theorem or the Hirsch conjecture) into a more general theory of intersection patterns of algebraic varieties, where algebraic tools such as liaison theory and local cohomology can be employed. Integrating this theory with the study of random simplicial complexes may provide some new random models in commutative algebra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(1) The PI will extend his work on uniform combinatorial models for Kirillov-Reshetikhin (KR) crystals of affine Lie algebras from the single column KR crystals to the arbitrary ones. (2) Uniform combinatorial formulas are sought for the (non-metaplectic and metaplectic) Iwahori Whittaker functions, which are a basic tool in the theory of automorphic forms. Connections with Schubert calculus will also be investigated. (3) The combinatorics of the geometric Satake correspondence (realizing geometrically the irreducible representations of reductive groups) is studied via a combinatorial decomposition of Lusztig's q-analogue of the Weyl character. (4) In Schubert calculus, the PI has several projects related to various cohomologies of generalized flag varieties. In particular, an extension of Schubert calculus beyond K-theory is pursued based on the so-called Kazhdan-Lusztig Schubert classes in hyperbolic cohomology (which gives a stalk version of the elliptic cohomology of Ginzburg-Kapranov-Vasserot); these classes were defined by the PI in previous joint work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two important questions in combinatorics that are of interest in computer science, algebra and optimization are how many ways are there to order objects/tasks with certain constraints and to transport goods through a network. This research studies special cases of these two problems using two fascinating mathematical objects called partially ordered sets and polytopes. The topics of this project are accessible to students and the project includes collaboration with students. Also, the objects studied in the project can be visualized and will be disseminated through videos, student lectures, and STEM outreach activities.<br/> <br/>Partially ordered sets are fundamental objects in combinatorics and computer science. A measure of the complexity of a finite poset with is its number of linear extensions: the number of orderings of its elements compatible with the order of the poset. The first part of this project studies linear extensions for certain families of partial orders that appear in algebraic combinatorics and can be computed efficiently like posets of (skew) Young diagrams and trees (not necessarily rooted). The tools used include new positive formulas coming from geometry to count skew Young tableaux and determinantal identities for counting linear extensions of trees. The second part of the project studies flow polytopes of graphs or networks and the volumes, the number of lattice points and triangulations of these polytopes. This project has two main goals. The first one is to compute the Ehrhart series of flow polytopes using new objects that encode the volume of these polytopes. The second goal is to study a phenomenon that flow polytopes share with another family of polytopes called generalized permutahedra relating the volume of a polytope with the number of lattice points of a related polytope.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This viewpoint arises also in more abstract settings, such as decomposing a data set in a balanced way with linear equations to efficiently handle it, or evaluating a function in a fixed set of points to compute its integral. Note that if we introduce subjective preferences of the involved parties to our fair division problem, the inherent symmetries disappear. Again this loss of symmetry is a natural phenomenon for the class of the problems mentioned so far. This project develops methods to approach such problems, even in the absence of symmetry. Notably, the methods are topological, that is, continuous, whereas the problems have a combinatorial, or discrete, flavor. Thus this research builds bridges between different branches of mathematics, making problems in one branch amenable to the tools of another.<br/><br/>The PI will conduct research on a selection of combinatorial problems that benefit from a geometric viewpoint. Among the themes of research are intersection patterns of sets, both in a purely combinatorial setting (such as hypergraph matchings and design theory) as well as in geometric settings (such as intersections of convex sets and non-embeddability of complexes into Euclidean space), and the study of structured sets in abelian groups (such as sumsets, the structure of sets containing zero-sums, and spherical designs). These are problems, where one is interested in constructing an object or showing its non-existence, but global obstructions emerge---local solutions do not glue together to form the desired object. Geometry and topology provide a suitable framework to organize these non-local phenomena and detect such obstructions in the large. This research focuses on problems that admit geometric generalizations and aims to delimit rigid discrete results from their more flexible geometric counterparts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These have found applications throughout mathematics and mathematical physics. This project proposes to study the geometry of cluster algebras in two senses. The first is to apply tools from algebraic geometry to the study of cluster varieties. This will hopefully enable us to understand the structure of integrals computed on cluster varieties, which are common in applications to particle physics. The second sense is to describe cluster varieties using the geometry of reflection groups. These are the symmetries formed by reflections over collections of mirrors. Such connections are already well known for finite reflection groups, but the typical cluster variety should be related to the properties of infinite reflection groups, and these are still very poorly understood.<br/><br/>More precisely, the first project is to compute the mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology of cluster varieties. This is joint work with Thomas Lam. In previous work, the PI and his collaborator have discovered a ""curious Lefschetz symmetry"" in these mixed Hodge structures. They intend to build a spectral sequence to help compute these mixed Hodge structures, and they intend to study connections between these computations, rational Catalan theory and character varieties. The second project has as its ultimate goal describing cluster fans and cluster complexes in terms of infinite Coxeter groups. Nathan Reading and the PI previously did this for cluster varieties of finite type, which corresponded to finite Coxeter groups, and partially succeeded in doing so in general. The obstacle to further progress was that they needed a lattice into which they could embed an infinite Coxeter group; in the finite case, the Coxeter group itself is such a lattice. The current project, joint with Nathan Reading and Hugh Thomas, proposes to solve this problem by using ideas from the representation theory of quivers. They also intend to find combinatorial models of these lattices, and hope to eventually find applications to cluster varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project includes foundational problems in combinatorics where randomization plays a crucial role. Further development of the existing tools as well as invention of new tools and techniques will be used to solve those problems, and to investigate both practical and theoretic applications. Plans to disseminate the new discoveries at major international conferences of experts are included as part of the project.<br/><br/>The probabilistic method has become a cornerstone of research in modern combinatorics.

The aim is to find threshold functions for the appearance of large graphs in a random graph, to prove universality-type results, and to develop general tools for embedding general graphs into arbitrary graphs and digraphs satisfying some given desired pseudorandom properties. Another salient part of the project is the broad topic of packing problems, which concerns partitioning combinatorial objects into members from a specified family of objects. The study of the classical tree-packing conjecture and related problems has led to the development of new embedding techniques which can be useful in different areas and form a central part of the project. The project also considers the broad topic of random sums, which is known as the Littlewood-Offord problem. Motivated by a central problem in the theory of random matrices, resilience-type versions of these question and also working with sums of dependent random variables are considered, with potential impact on error-correcting codes and cryptography."

How many? What is the shape of the space of all solutions? What is the optimal solution?  The answers depend on the chosen number system --- whether we consider whole, rational, real, or complex numbers; positive or negative numbers; and so on.  Tropical geometry arises by considering algebraic equations and inequalities over the tropical (max-times) algebra where addition of two real numbers is replaced by taking their maximum.  The tropical equations are easier to solve, and surprisingly, some geometric features of the solution set over real or complex numbers can be computed from the solution set over the tropical numbers.  This project aims at developing the tropical geometry for real algebraic geometry (which studies the geometry of algebraic equations and inequalities over real numbers) and polytope theory (which studies discrete properties of linear equations and inequalities).  Applications include development of new computational tools for algebraic computations and optimization, which can be used to solve a variety of problems arising from statistics, economics, and engineering.

Recent work, however, has linked the model to many other areas of mathematics, from combinatorics to string theory, where ''brane dimers'' are proposed as fundamental descriptions of spacetime at small scales.  The PIs propose to jointly investigate a number of interrelated topics in mathematics and physics, each of which has the dimer model as its underlying combinatorial structure.

This fact leads to the cluster algebra structure on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian, and the beautiful combinatorics of the positive Grassmannian.  This project will explore a myriad of generalizations of the objects mentioned above, and will significantly improve our understanding of: the dimer model on non-planar graphs; limiting behaviors of the dimer model on a torus and other surfaces; the connection between dimers on a torus and brane tilings in string theory; soliton solutions to the KP equation and the bipartite graphs realizable as soliton graphs; the relationship between convex polygon tilings and the corresponding bipartite planar graphs with Kasteleyn weightings; the connection between the dimer model and triangulations of the amplituhedron, an object whose volume computes scattering amplitudes; and higher-dimensional dimer models, colored quivers and a generalized notion of cluster mutation, exciting new objects motivated by dualities in supersymmetric quantum field theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polytopes are sets in high-dimensional space with flat sides. The aim of this project is to use polytopes to answer questions about the coefficients of special families of polynomials in many variables. For example, which coefficients are nonzero? How do the coefficients compare to each other in size? If we plot the exponent vectors of the monomials with nonzero coefficients, do they form the integer points of a polytope? If we plot a histogram of the coefficients, do the ratios of consecutive heights form a decreasing sequence? This project also has an educational component, with the core goal of enabling young women to succeed in STEM careers by introducing them to discrete mathematics, an area of growing importance for computer science and data science.<br/><br/>Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials are multivariate polynomials representing cohomology and K-theory classes on the flag manifold, respectively. Despite the beautiful formulas developed for them over the past three decades, the coefficients of these polynomials remain mysterious. It is not even evident how to tell if a given coefficient is nonzero! The PI will investigate convexity properties of the coefficients of Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials. For instance, are the Newton polytopes of these polynomials saturated? Are their coefficients log-concave along lines? Is there a polytope whose integer point transform specializes to Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials?

In particular, combinatorics and geometry have benefitted each other tremendously in recent years, both by the ways in which they are connected directly, and by learning from each other?s philosophies and techniques. This project studies the discrete structure of algebraic and geometric objects, and the algebraic and geometric structure of matroids and polytopes. This interdisciplinary perspective offers unexpected and effective approaches to long-standing problems. This research program constitutes the academic backbone of a vibrant research and training collaboration among primarily undergraduate institutions in the U.S. and Colombia. Through research-based courses, vertically and geographically integrated research projects, and the biannual Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria, students participate in a truly international cooperation while making substantial scientific contributions to combinatorics. Since 2007 this initiative has trained more than 150 pre-Ph.D. U.S. students, more than half of whom are members of underrepresented groups in mathematics, and more than 50 of whom have gone onto Ph.D. programs. The initiative also serves mathematicians worldwide through the distribution of course videos, lecture notes, and research projects.<br/><br/>This project studies three interdisciplinary and interrelated research directions: 1. By studying the geometric structure of matroids, we obtain purely combinatorial results that seem intractable without the geometric perspective, and we establish foundational results in tropical geometry and combinatorial Hodge theory. 2. We measure polytopes of interest by recognizing that they are part of ?the right? family of polytopes, and finding a formula for the measure of all the polytopes in that family. The results have consequences in toric geometry and representation theory. 3. We explore the Hopf-algebraic structure of various families of polytopes. The resulting objects are useful in numerous combinatorial and algebraic applications, and they raise geometric questions of independent interest. At the heart of each of these three projects lies a configuration of vectors - usually a root system - that plays an essential role. The combinatorial theories of polytopes and (Coxeter) matroids are designed to study such configurations, and the powerful toolkit that they offer is the unifying thread of this project. Solutions to the proposed problems will have a strong impact in combinatorics and discrete geometry, and will further our understanding of central questions in algebra and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The specific problems studied fall into the realm of extremal combinatorics: a study of discrete mathematical objects under various local constraints. In recent decades, extremal combinatorics has witnessed significant developments thanks to both practical problems arising from applications and an infusion of ideas and tools from various other branches of mathematics such as probability, algebra, geometry and analysis. For dense systems, a well-developed method called the regularity method allows one to partition a system into well-behaved uniform pieces. However, for sparser systems, no such universally applicable tools exist. This project aims at developing more universal tools for sparse systems through the study of supersaturation of substructures and through finding effective applications of the sparse regularity method. The problems pursued in the project are suitable for graduate students and early career mathematicians whom the PI will actively engage.<br/><br/>The project focuses on Turan type extremal problems, in which we want to determine how dense a system can be when certain sub-configurations are forbidden. These problems are central to the development of extremal combinatorics. For graphs, the problem is well-solved when the forbidden subgraph is non-bipartite (i.e. not 2-colorable). When the forbidden subgraph is bipartite, the problem becomes more intractable due to the host graph being sparse. Much effort in developing this important field is driven by several general conjectures of Erdos and Simonovits, particularly the two so-called Turan exponents conjectures. In a recent breakthrough, Bukh and Conlon solved one of the two conjectures, while the one for single bipartite graphs is wide-open. The PI and his collaborators made initial progress on this second conjecture through the so-called supersaturation approach. The idea is to use supersaturation of certain subgraphs together with local constraints of the host graph to build the forbidden subgraph once the host graph is too dense. This method has the potential of being developed into a general tool to tackle Turan type extremal problems in the sparse setting. The PI looks to fully develop this method and make further progress on the Turan exponent conjecture. Another aim of the project is to find effective ways to apply the sparse regularity method for deterministic Turan type problems in the sparse setting. A third set of problems the PI will pursue are extremal problems on cycles in graphs and hypergraphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A final direction concerns the amplituhedron, which was introduced by physicists in the context of scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang Mills theory.

This paves the way for well-known applications of matroids in topics such as optimization and network theory to draw from the heavily developed, and computationally powerful, machinery of algebraic geometry.

Such systems can be used to describe chemical reactions, as well as the spread of disease, information, and species through a network. These models often become more meaningful when multiple particle types are incorporated. For example, the celebrated First Passage Percolation model describes the spread of a single species through an environment; the incorporation of competing species enriches the model. This project seeks to study more realistic variants of well-known models for chemical reactions, epidemic outbreaks, and the spread of information as to deepen our understanding of important phenomena from across the sciences and further develop the mathematics that helps explain them. The project will involve the undergraduate students training.<br/><br/>This project will consider five different stochastic multi-type interacting particle systems: (1) The Diffusion-Limited Annihilation model is an annihilating particle system in which collisions between opposite type particles result in mutual annihilation. The version in which particles have different speeds is difficult to study and conjectured to exhibit anomalous behavior when different particle types are initially balanced. (2) The Ballistic Annihilation model has three particle types and all collisions result in annihilation. The limiting particle density in different regimes will be characterized. (3) The Chase-Escape model is a competitive stochastic growth model conjectured to have a coexistence phase even when the predatory species is fitter than the prey. The effect of the environment and fitness of the different species on coexistence will be investigated. (4) The A+B->2A model describes a growing system of infected particles. This process was recently generalized to the continuum, which leads to several new questions at the intersection of discrete and continuous probability, which will be addressed. (5) Lastly, the classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed model is well-understood on random graphs near the critical connectivity threshold. A natural extension is to have susceptible individuals rewire their connections away from infected individuals. This more realistic modification may change the size of epidemics. These five processes will be studied using a variety of tools from discrete and continuous probability theory such as the mass transport principal, recursion, couplings, large deviation estimates, and stochastic differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
