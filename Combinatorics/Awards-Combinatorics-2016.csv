The investigators continue their work on extremal graph, set, and hypergraph theory and forbidden configurations. They investigate connections between graph theory and geometry, on the one hand studying Ricci curvature on graphs, on the other hand studying crossing numbers of graphs and related incidence problems. The project will study graph and tree indices originating in chemical graph theory and will apply combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to phylogenetics and to the theory of complex networks. Results of the project will contribute to the better understanding of key phenomena in network science, of discretization of geometric space, of phylogenetics, and of other fields. The investigators will continue the training of Ph.D. students through involvement in the research, introducing them to interdisciplinary and international research collaboration.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to the understanding of ""optimal"" extreme structures and ""typical"" random structures in discrete mathematics. This area is referred to broadly as extremal combinatorics, and some of the main open questions in the area will be studied, including various instances of the Turan problem for graphs, hypergraphs and posets, problems in combinatorial geometry, in the vein of the Erdos unit distance problem and crossing and incidence problems, and combinatorial questions on trees such as the Maximum Agreement Subtree problem as well as topics related to chemistry. This project will build upon sophisticated methods that have been developed to attack these problems, such as the approach via crossing numbers and incidences, the Guth-Katz low degree polynomial method, and the generalization of the notion of Ricci Curvature from differential geometry to graphs, which allows, to some extent, functional analytic tools to be brought to bear."

At its core lie elementary questions that might excite a high school student as much as an expert. For example, imagine that one colors the edges and diagonals of an icosahedron red or blue. Can one always find a triangle whose edges are all red or a triangle whose edges are all blue? While combinatorics has traditionally found applications in computer science, information theory, and mathematical models, this project aims to further investigate its applications to what must be the oldest part of mathematics: number theory. The PI will involve high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in the project. The problems under study are suitable for training in research as they are easily accessible and offer an excellent setting for grasping some of the core techniques used in combinatorics. Parallel to and supported by the research activities of the project, the PI's goal is to write a short book on the application of combinatorics to number theory aimed at undergraduates in mathematics. <br/><br/>Inverse theorems have catalyzed the development of additive combinatorics in recent years. However, some very basic inverse questions remain largely untouched. This project focuses on the study of open questions where combinatorial methods are likely to be of use. Three indicative examples, which are easy to formulate and hence will reach a wide mathematical audience, are: what structural information can be derived for finite sets in a commutative group that have near maximum number of h-fold sums; what can be said about finite sets of integers whose exponential sum has nearly minimum norm; and what can be deduced about the number of distinct differences that are formed from pairs of elements of a finite set, when the number of distinct sums is known? It is hoped that a combination of recent advances in the field and novel ideas will lead to progress. As these questions are representative of the challenges one must overcome in a wider variety of cardinality questions in additive combinatorics. It is hoped that any discoveries will be applied to other contexts as well. The project's methodology has a strong interdisciplinary component, which could unearth new connections between combinatorics and harmonic analysis."

The basic coloring problem is to find such a partition with the fewest color classes. Coloring deals with the fundamental problem of partitioning a set of objects into classes that avoid certain conflicts. This model has many applications, for example, in time tabling, scheduling, frequency assignment, and sequencing problems. The theory of graph coloring is among central topics in discrete mathematics. It relates to other important areas of combinatorics, such as Ramsey theory, graph minors, independence number, orientations of graphs, and packing of graphs. Coloring properties of graphs certainly heavily depend on the cycle structure of these graphs. The goal of this project is to study a series of extremal problems related to colorings of graphs and hypergraphs, where answers depend on the cycle structure. The plan is to make significant advances in developing the theory of graph and hypergraph coloring and studying their cycle structure. The project involves a number of graduate students and young researchers. <br/><br/>The main directions of study are planned to be color-critical graphs with small average degree, list coloring, improper colorings, equitable coloring, bounds on the independence number, hypergraph coloring, existence of cycles of specified length in graphs with high chromatic number, Turan-type problems on cycles in graphs and hypergraphs, existence of many disjoint cycles in dense graphs, packing, and list packing. Work in these directions will exploit and possibly develop recent advances in the field including the results of the investigator and collaborators, in particular, graduate students working with him. Among promising tools are the language of potentials and the notion of list packing. Among expected results are enhancements of classical results on disjoint cycles and on the longest cycles in graphs with restrictions on the vertex degrees."

About 70 participants are anticipated, with about 35-40 contributed talks with no parallel sessions. The conference has been publicized through distribution lists, AMS and other mathematical event calendars, and related conference websites (the conference website is at https://permutationpatterns2016.wordpress.com). <br/><br/>The conference will feature current research in the area of permutation patterns and its applications. Major themes in the conference include the structural theory of pattern classes, asymptotic behavior of pattern classes, generalized pattern avoidance,<br/>packing densities, and algorithmic and decidability problems. Research in the area is influenced by theoretical computer science, and traces its historical origins to the study of sorting machines. Combinatorial interest in permutation patterns focuses on centrally important enumeration and packing problems, for instance the extremal problem to determine how one pattern can be embedded as often as possible in a permutation. The statistics of permutations also enters into the picture, garnering attention from probabilists. The conference is expected to have a wide impact on a variety of different research areas in mathematics and computer science."

The project involves undergraduate and graduate students.  Open-source software under development in the project will be made readily available to other researchers. <br/><br/>This research project aims to extend and develop the flag algebra method to new models in order to solve longstanding open problems, principally in extremal combinatorics.

The stability method can be applied to solve problems, previously impervious to attack, where the extremal construction has an iterative structure. The blow-up technique translates questions on small graphs into the language of graph limits accessible to flag algebras, building bridges from one area of graph theory to another. This project will develop these techniques further for application to a number of important topics, including crossing numbers and small Ramsey numbers. It is expected that the work will draw on tools from linear and nonlinear programming to obtain exact results. The investigators will involve graduate students at their schools in the project and will work with graduate students from other schools during annual workshops."

Results of the work are expected to have application to random sorting networks and to better understanding of the representation theory of the finite general linear groups.<br/> <br/>Classical reflection groups are not only unified in that they are generated by reflections -- they also share common features with general linear groups over a finite field. Particularly gratifying is that, when viewing the finite general linear group as a reflection group, one is led to questions about its representation theory and its invariant theory that (conjecturally) have surprisingly simple and elegant answers. In this project, the ordinary representation theory of finite general linear groups will be explored using the method pioneered by Okounkov and Vershik for studying symmetric groups. Also, the characteristic-p invariant theory of finite general linear groups will be studied using ideas arising from the connection between Catalan combinatorics and the characteristic zero invariant theory of real reflection groups."

Nevertheless, the problem of their regularity has not yet been fully understood. Can a three-dimensional, incompressible, unforced viscous flow that starts smoothly develop a singularity in finite time? This question, one of the Clay Millennial Problems, is as mysterious as its solution would be important. In other parts of harmonic analysis, similar questions arise. One of the most famous problems along these lines is the Kakeya problem: Can a set in some Euclidean space contain a unit line segment in every direction but be of lower dimension than the ambient space? This question is connected to important questions in several areas of mathematics, and an example of such a set could provide insight into singularities of solutions to wave equations and Schrodinger equations. The Kakeya problem also shares many features with other problems in the field of additive combinatorics, the field whose central question is whether a set of numbers giving rise to many additive equations is always an indication of some additive structure in the set or can occur as a sort of malevolent coincidence. This project aims to classify and explain the kind of coincidences that can occur in all these problems.<br/><br/>This project takes aim at three specific problems. First, the principal investigator will study whether the quasi-geostrophic equation in the plane develops singularities. He hopes to do this by studying simplified model problems in which all of the action takes place in a finite-dimensional Lie group, one of the jet groups of the class of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. Second, he would like to show that a Kakeya set in three dimensions has a Hausdorff dimension that is strictly greater than two and a half. He hopes to do this by exploiting as few structural properties of the set as possible. Earlier work used structural properties heavily to obtain good Minkowski-dimension bounds; it is anticipated that a lighter approach will be effective for the problem of Hausdorff dimension. Finally, the principal investigator seeks to develop a good theory for finding structured parts of additively nonsmoothing sets. He will attempt to extend earlier work on the size of capsets with implications for the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture."

Often the sizes of such networks are so large that analyzing their structures by brute force is not feasible. The challenge is to use parameters that can efficiently capture the shapes of networks. Spectral graph theory provides important tools for studying structural properties of graphs and has close connections to computer science and network design. Although the eigenvalues do not determine a graph in general, they contain important structural information that in some situations, could not be obtained by any other means. Association schemes are combinatorial and algebraic structures with high degree of regularity that sit at the core of algebraic combinatorics and have important applications in coding theory, geometry and quantum computing.  In this project, the close connections between the spectral and combinatorial properties of graphs and association schemes will be investigated. This project will involve graduate and undergraduate students at University of Delaware.<br/> <br/>This project encompasses recent progress in spectral graph theory on combinatorial and spectral problems and conjectures involving simplicial rook graphs, Wenger graphs and friendship graphs as well as in the theory of association schemes by answering questions of Brouwer regarding the connectivity of strongly regular and distance-regular graphs and their subconstituents. The project will investigate conjectures of Haemers that almost all graphs are determined by their spectrum, of Godsil and Brouwer regarding the edge- and vertex-connectivity of graphs in association schemes as well as related problems such as understanding the spectral and isoperimetric properties of graphs defined by systems of equations over finite fields or graphs arising in other combinatorial problems."

It is often the case that the largest structures organize themselves in a highly algebraic way, which opens the door to algebraic methods. These so-called extremal structures have a remarkable number of applications to other areas of mathematics and science, including to theoretical computer science, statistical physics and coding theory. A number of recent breakthroughs in the area reveal an exciting future for the proposed work. The PI will work closely with both undergraduate and graduate students in the research project.

This is partially due to their abundant practical applications and their relations to other fields.  For instance, the well-known Four Color Theorem asserts that four colors is always enough to color the regions of a given map such that each region gets one color and two regions sharing some border must receive different colors. This RUI project focuses on intensive research on several graph coloring and choosability problems, which have been frequently used as models for practical applications such as scheduling, traffic control, and the channel assignment problems.  For instance, in scheduling final exam times of all courses at a college, we construct a graph model by representing each course by a vertex, and connecting two vertices (courses) by an edge if a student is taking both courses. The chromatic number of such a graph model provides the minimum number of exam time periods needed in order to schedule all final exams without conflict.  In addition, if some courses set restrictions on certain dates and times, then it becomes a graph choosability problem. Research suitable for undergraduates will be incorporated into Graph Theory and Graduate Seminar courses, providing non-traditional and underrepresented students opportunities to learn cutting edge research methods, and will involve three graduate students yearly to work on research projects.<br/><br/>Graphs provide excellent models for various problems motivated by the channel assignment problem, in which we assign channels to cities or stations such that interference is avoided and the span of channels used is minimized. This RUI project focuses on intensive research on graph coloring and choosability topics with emphasis on utilizing research methodologies and results in number theory, topology, and algebra. The goal is to bring new insight into, and broaden the study of, areas of graph theory that are related to number theory, topology, and algebra, as well as applications to broadcast communication. Specifically, the PI will investigate distance graphs and number theory problems, topological combinatorics, graph choosability, and colorings motivated by the channel assignment problem."

This research project focuses on several questions motivated by current research in the area, including study of the orders of points on varieties and counting solutions to algebraic equations with constraint variables.<br/><br/>Combinatorial problems in finite fields continue to offer many challenges. Of particular interest in this research project are questions involving orders of points on varieties over finite fields (e.g. recent developments related to the Markoff surface).  Part of the motivation for the work is to investigate the problem of strong approximation for Markoff triples and to give estimates on the number of solutions of equations when the variables are restricted one way or another, for instance to multiplicative groups. When classical techniques do not apply, general sum product theory in finite fields and residue rings may be useful. Sum-product results in various settings are of interest in their own right as they lead to new results in analytic number theory, in particular, estimates on Gauss sums and short character sums."

Real world problems involving such networks benefit from the theorems, algorithms, and insight of graph theory. The PI is most interested in graph problems involving structure, coloring, and related notions -- especially problems which connect coloring and structure. This project in particular focuses on four sub-projects involving immersion, edge-coloring, and flows.<br/><br/>The first two sub-projects are both motivated by an immersion-analog of Hadwiger's Conjecture (the Abu-Khzam--Langston Conjecture), which links coloring and immersion. One sub-project seeks to find exact structural characterizations of graphs without specific immersions; the other seeks to better understand how immersions (and colorings) are affected when creating new graphs from old. A second conjecture involving coloring and structure that interests the PI greatly is the Goldberg-Seymour Conjecture on chromatic index. The PI plans to work to improve the method of Tashkinov trees -- the dominant technique used for approximation results towards the conjecture. The final sub-project concerns flows, and is somewhat different in flavor (although flows and colorings are certainly related notions). Here, the objects of interest are 3-flows with large support, and the backdrop is Tutte's famous 3-Flow Conjecture."

This award supports a mathematical investigation of the behavior of such systems using techniques introduced by the researcher in previous work with collaborators. These techniques have led to the resolution of a number of open problems across various mathematical fields, including the Kadison-Singer problem and the existence of Ramanujan graphs of all sizes and degrees. This project aims to further develop substantial connections with research across numerous fields of science, including convex optimization, real algebraic geometry, functional analysis, combinatorics, and probability. The award also supports plans to focus interdisciplinary activities of particular benefit to students associated with the project.<br/><br/>On a technical level, the project focuses on two areas of research: (A) to develop a theory of ''finite free probability,'' a collection of ideas lying in the intersection of random matrix theory, convex optimization, real algebraic geometry, and polynomial geometry, and (B) to generalize the previously mentioned techniques so as to widen their potential application. This includes extending the ideas to bivariate polynomials as well as a non-Hermitian setting. In the direction of (B), the project aims to address some of the obstacles that hinder the application of the current techniques (for example, the need for real rootedness of associated polynomials) by investigating analogous behaviors in more general settings. This would be a necessary part of extending (A) to non-Hermitian settings, for example, as such objects no longer satisfy the conditions necessary to apply the current techniques. Extensions in this direction would also open the possibility of application to new areas such as quantitative geometry."

Grassmannians play an important role for spatial recognition in computer vision, in coding and communication theory, in studying shallow water waves in physics, and in the computation of scattering amplitudes of subatomic particles. This project explores features of remarkably rich subsets of real Grassmannians called totally positive and totally non-negative Grassmannians.

Simple questions on the structure of polytopes, such as the Hirsch conjecture, have foundational importance in optimization. Meanwhile discrete Morse theory, a reduction tool to simplify a given polytopal complex, is employed both in pure mathematics and in big data analysis, to understand high-dimensional shapes. The project builds on these tools and expands their application. Further tools arise from the study of networks, which are polytopal complexes of dimension one. A plan is to integrate in this line of work new random models, with the goal of revealing fundamental properties of intersection patterns of algebraic varieties.<br/><br/>Enumerative aspects on the number of polytopes and spheres with given number of facets have importance beyond pure mathematics, in Regge calculus and simplicial quantum gravity. Techniques from metric geometry can provide desired exponential upper bounds. Another problem with importance in applied mathematics is the polynomial Hirsch conjecture, which was recently proven with metric methods for flag polytopes. Techniques ranging from knot theory to differential and hyperbolic geometry may be applied to better understand obstructions and constructions in Discrete Morse Theory, thereby revealing when and how we can simplify a given shape. A new perspective in this project is to connect discrete Morse theory with the notion of embeddability. A further goal is to lift the classical theory of polytope graphs (for example Balinski's theorem or the Hirsch conjecture) into a more general theory of intersection patterns of algebraic varieties, where algebraic tools such as liaison theory and local cohomology can be employed. Integrating this theory with the study of random simplicial complexes may provide some new random models in commutative algebra."

The aim of this research project is to develop systematic mathematical theory to understand dynamic networks: systems that evolve over time through probabilistic rules. The investigator plans to develop robust mathematical techniques to understand how macroscopic connectivity arises via microscopic interactions between agents in a network. One important direct application is whether a message or a disease is able to reach -- or at risk of reaching -- a significant fraction of the population of interest. Mathematical techniques used to understand such questions have unexpected connections to combinatorial optimization, where one is interested in designing optimal networks between individuals, particularly by considering an important concept known as the minimal spanning tree. The project will also explore swarm optimization algorithms (inspired by the collective behavior of simple individuals such as ants) and their ability to solve hard optimization problems via probabilistic interaction rules through stigmergy (where the network of interacting agents changes the underlying environment which then effects the interaction of the agents). An important component of the project is involvement of students at all levels, including the development of undergraduate research seminars and research projects. <br/><br/>Understanding the metric structure of the giant component and the critical scaling window in inhomogeneous random graph models has been daunting, yet for several decades the community of combinatorial probabilists has seen it as key to understanding more complicated strong disorder systems.

The investigator plans to show convergence to continuum limiting objects based on tilted inhomogeneous continuum random trees and in particular to prove universality for many of the major families of random graph models. Scaling exponents of key susceptibility functions in the barely subcritical regime will be studied. The relation between metric structure of components in the critical regime and the entrance boundary of Markov processes such as the multiplicative coalescent will be explored. The entire program is the first step in understanding the minimal spanning tree on the giant component under strong disorder. These models have spawned a wide array of universality conjectures from statistical physics. The project will also study optimization algorithms and meta-heuristics inspired by reinforcing interacting particle systems and stigmergy, providing qualitative insights and quantitative predictions on hard models in probabilistic combinatorial optimization."

First, by specialization of parameters, the Koornwinder polynomials project to the Macdonald polynomials of all classical and mixed affine types. The proposed research aims to prove analogues in the Koornwinder case of celebrated results on type A Macdonald polynomials; specialization then projects such results onto classical and mixed types. An example is the integrality property of type A Macdonald polynomials, which has deep connections to combinatorics and geometry. The second facet of universality is that of large-rank stabilization.This involves applications to creation operators for the Koornwinder polynomials, specializations to deformed universal characters, duality and stabilization of torus knot polynomials, canonical bases of stable DAHA, and elliptic Kostka polynomials for classical types. The training of graduate students, through their direct involvement as research assistants, is an important component of the project. The project will also involve substantial symbolic computation. All resulting software will be made publicly available in the open-source software system Sage.<br/><br/>The PIs will develop a stable (large rank) limit of the spherical DAHA of Koornwinder type and use this study the combinatorics of Koornwinder polynomials and their lifts to symmetric functions. The aim is to prove foundational results on the stable Koornwinder DAHA and apply these results to solve problems and outstanding conjectures in the following areas:<br/>- Creation operators for Koornwinder polynomials, with applications to Rains' integrality conjecture for Koornwinder symmetric functions<br/>- Duality conjectures for DAHA torus knot polynomials of non-reduced affine type and generalizations of the rational shuffle conjecture beyond type A<br/>- Combinatorial formulas for Koornwinder polynomials in the spirit and specializations of such formulas to classical affine root systems<br/>- Specializations of Koornwinder symmetric functions to q-deformed universal characters<br/>- Explicit formulas for symmetric function operators arising from the stable DAHA"

This method of study originated in questions around the philosophy and foundations of mathematics, but in recent years it has found striking applications in the study of some central objects of classical mathematics and computer science. This project investigates further these connections, in particular in the context of graphs (mathematical ways of describing networks and related systems) and group actions (mathematical ways of describing collections of symmetries of a space). This study has the potential to open up a route for applications of the powerful infinitary model-theoretic machinery to open questions in finite graph combinatorics, and conversely for applications of deep results in combinatorics to open questions in model theory.<br/><br/>Motivated by Morley's conjecture on the possible number of uncountable models of first-order theories, Shelah isolated several important classes of ""tame"" theories and developed a rich machinery for analyzing models and definable sets for some of those classes, particularly for stable theories. Later work by many researchers demonstrated that notions and methods of generalized stability reflect important phenomena in other areas of mathematics. This project will investigate two such connections. 1) Improved Ramsey-type bounds and strong regularity lemmas were obtained for semi-algebraic graphs by Fox et al. and for algebraic graphs in large finite fields by Tao, with numerous applications in the corresponding areas. These results can naturally be viewed as results about graphs definable in certain structures fitting into the classification picture. 2) Study of definable group actions turns out to be closely related to certain questions in topological dynamics, especially around weakly almost periodic dynamical systems and tame systems studied by Glasner and others. The investigator will work on developing further methods of generalized stability and applying them to questions in combinatorics of graphs definable in various ""tame"" structures (stable, o-minimal, distal, dependent) and to study dynamical properties of definable group actions in those structures."

Combinatorics is the art and science of distilling a complex mathematical structure into simple attributes and developing from this a deeper understanding of the original structure.  Tropical mathematics, named after Brazilian mathematician Imre Simon of Sao Paulo on the Tropic of Capricorn, is a young area of mathematics arising from a number system with a pair operations: addition and maximum, instead of the more traditional pair of addition and multiplication.  Tropical mathematics has applications in a wide range of areas including mirror symmetry, computational algebra, optimization, statistics, phylogenetics, and economics. The solutions of algebraic equations and inequalities are the main objects of interest in algebraic geometry; likewise the solutions of tropical algebraic equations and inequalities are the main players in tropical geometry.  There is a precise relationship between algebro-geometric objects and their tropical counterparts, so tropical mathematics provides new insights into classical problems as well.  It also provides a natural language and a new perspective for understanding deep and sometimes surprising connections between different mathematical entities.  This project will make contributions to the foundation of tropical geometry, focusing on the combinatorial structures.<br/><br/>The main geometric objects of study in this field are tropically convex sets and tropical algebraic sets, which can be constructed analogously to the usual convex sets and algebraic sets, but using the max-plus algebra. The investigator will study relationships between various combinatorial structures associated to an algebraic set, namely, its tropical variety, its algebraic matroid, and its Chow polytope.  She will develop Ehrhart theory for enumeration of lattice points in tropical polytopes. In the other direction, the investigator will use tropical point of view to study classical objects in combinatorics and convex geometry. She will continue developing an approach to polytopes and triangulations based on tropical geometry and will investigate the relationship between the cone of positive semidefinite matrices and affine buildings. On the computational front, new algorithms for computing tropical varieties will be developed using numerical algebraic geometry, which has become one of the most powerful tools in algebraic geometry due to its highly parallelizable nature and advancements in numerical computations. These new methods will be useful for problems concerning polynomial systems which are ubiquitous in mathematical models in science and engineering.  Specific applications include finding competitive equilibrium prices in product-mix auctions and discovering causal relationships between random variables in probability."

This award supports research into the understanding of permutations from a mathematical perspective, in particular permutations involving large numbers of objects. Powerful new techniques at the interface of combinatorics and probability allow the large-scale study of the behavior of ensembles of permutations. Experience with other large combinatorial objects has led mathematicians to expect them to behave in certain predictable ways. As a result, when such permutations arise in nature and do not have the predicted properties, scientists know to seek a hidden explanation. For example, this involves the study of the significance of the order of genes on a chromosome, and the knowledge of the behavior of ensembles of large random permutations may tell geneticists when to look for a pattern.<br/><br/>New discoveries have made it possible to learn much more about the nature of large permutations. In particular, the space of permutations of all sizes can be completed by limit objects that are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals. By maximizing a certain entropy integral, one can, in principle, find the limit object that describes nearly all permutations with certain given properties. The proposer and his collaborators will be using both analytic and experimental techniques to exploit this variational principle. One important objective, barely begun, is to plot the landscape of permutations with two fixed pattern densities and determine, for each feasible point, the number and character of the corresponding permutations."

For example, the RSA public-key encryption algorithm is based on a combinatorial result in modular arithmetic. This research project is devoted to developing combinatorial techniques for attacking problems that connect to algebraic and geometric areas such as symmetric function theory, a subject with applications to probability and statistical mechanics.

The project concerns variations on the classical theories that address subtle questions about geometric Gromov-Witten invariants, symmetric functions over a field of parameters, bi-graded representations, and quantum integrable systems. A priority is to develop the necessary combinatorial framework for the contemporary set of problems.

In particular, this project offers potential new insights into the tensor decomposition problem, which is essentially the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals and has applications in medicine, computer vision, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication.<br/><br/>Positivity problems in algebraic combinatorics ask to find positive combinatorial formulae for nonnegative quantities arising in geometry and representation theory. The goal of this project is to develop tools to solve positivity problems arising in two areas of active research, Macdonald theory and geometric complexity theory. Macdonald polynomials are a two-parameter family of symmetric polynomials, which have ties to many areas including geometry, physics, and knot theory. A major breakthrough in this area came with the proof of the Macdonald positivity conjecture, which showed that important structure coefficients related to Macdonald polynomials are nonnegative. It remains a fundamental open question to give a positive combinatorial interpretation of these coefficients. Geometric complexity theory is an approach to P versus NP and related problems in complexity theory using algebraic geometry and representation theory.  A fundamental problem in representation theory, believed to be important for this approach, is the Kronecker problem, which asks for a positive combinatorial formula for decomposing the tensor product of two irreducible representations of the symmetric group into irreducibles. This project will further develop the theory of noncommutative Schur functions, a powerful tool for solving positivity problems, particularly focusing on applications to Macdonald polynomials and the Kronecker problem."

There are many examples in mathematics and science of polynomials which depend on several variables, and which have important applications. In this project the combinatorics associated with these polynomials will be investigated. Macdonald polynomials, which are multi-variate symmetric functions which satisfy an orthogonality relation and play a central role in algebraic combinatorics with applications to special functions, algebraic geometry, and statistical mechanics. Recently, Macdonald polynomials have arisen in mathematical physics and the study of knot invariants connected to string theory. There has been a lot of recent progress on the combinatorics of these objects, especially for special knots known as torus knots, but many important questions remain open. These questions involve both Macdonald polynomials and various operators which act on them, and this project will further develop the theory of Macdonald polynomials and their operators. It seems likely that Macdonald polynomials will play an increasing role in mathematical physics, representation theory, and combinatorics over the coming years, so results on Macdonald polynomials and their operators arising from this project will likely have applications to many areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Macdonald polynomials, which depend on a set of variables, a partition, and two parameters, are closely connected to the study of the Hilbert scheme, and arise in the study of knot invariants and character formulas. This project seeks to build on previous results on the combinatorics of Macdonald polynomials and character formulas described via operators applied to a Macdonald polynomial. A particularly important example is the character of diagonal harmonics. The recently proved ''shuffle conjecture'' gives a nice combinatorial expression for this character. A central focus of this project is to study a recent generalization of the shuffle conjecture called the Delta conjecture. A number of interesting applications of this conjecture to combinatorics have already been found, and a proof would significantly expand our understanding of Macdonald polynomials, and character formulas connected to the Hilbert scheme and knot invariants. Two other projects involve combinatorial objects connected to diagonal harmonics such as Tesler matrices and LLT polynomials (a family of symmetric functions introduced by Alain Lascoux, Bernard Leclerc, and Jean-Yves Thibon), as well as the study of Demazure characters and atoms. These last three projects will involve more direct combinatorial analysis and classical symmetric function theory."

By studying the structure of mathematical proof itself, techniques from the field known as proof theory make it possible to take abstract proofs and to extract detailed calculations from them.  Used in the opposite direction, these techniques can take certain kinds of lengthy calculations and replace them with short, abstract arguments which can then be generalized to prove new results.  The focus of this project is to both further extend these techniques to new areas, particularly recently discovered applications in statistics, as well as continue the application of known techniques to new problems, especially in areas where probability and randomness play a central role.<br/><br/>In this project, Towsner will build on previous applications of ultraproducts to studying the way mathematical objects can be separated into structured and random parts.

This project studies central questions in algebra and geometry where the combinatorial structure of high-dimensional geometric objects plays a crucial role, and offers unexpected, innovative approaches to long-standing problems. This research program constitutes the academic backbone of the San Francisco State University-Colombia Combinatorics Initiative, a vibrant research and training collaboration among primarily undergraduate institutions in the U.S. and Colombia. Through research-based courses, vertically and geographically integrated research projects, and the biannual Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria, students participate in a truly international cooperation while making substantial scientific contributions to combinatorics. Since 2007 the initiative has trained more than 200 pre-Ph.D. students, more than half of whom are members of underrepresented groups in mathematics, and more than 50 of whom have gone onto Ph.D. programs. The initiative also helps train mathematicians worldwide through the distribution of course videos, lecture notes, and research projects.<br/><br/>This project studies important questions in various fields of mathematics, such as representation theory (Kostant partition functions), enumerative geometry (moduli spaces of curves), polyhedral number theory (Ehrhart polynomials), Brunn-Minkowski theory (valuations of polytopes), Hopf-Lie theory (algebraic structures on polytopes), tropical geometry (tropical linear spaces, moduli spaces, and Hodge theory), total positivity (positroids and their algebraic structure), and combinatorial commutative algebra (Frberg's conjecture). These subjects are related in surprising ways, and the techniques from one field become powerful tools in the others. At the heart of many of these questions lies a configuration of vectors -- often a root system -- that plays an essential role. The combinatorial theories of polytopes, (Coxeter) matroids, and hyperplane arrangements are designed to study these configurations, and the powerful toolkit that they offer is the unifying thread of this project. Solutions to the problems under study will have a strong impact in combinatorics and discrete geometry, and will further our understanding of central questions in algebra and geometry."

Such models arise in diverse areas of application; the models in this project are taken from materials science, social science, genetics, and distributed computing.  Specific examples are: an interface between regions of liquid in a pipe; candidates sequentially dropping out of a primary election; tree-search for approximate evaluation of a Boolean function. Common to all these models is an underlying mathematical structure in which initial conditions are random, after which the evolution is governed by a non-random mechanism.  Analyses of evolutions without randomness is often considerably more difficult than analysis of those with randomness.  The focus in this project is on creating tools to circumvent this problem.  In most cases the PI seeks qualitative answers to questions such as: what does the system look like after a long time, how long does it take to reach this state, and how robust is the description to changes in the initial conditions? The project's broader impacts beyond the potential applications to the aforementioned areas, include the training of graduate students in the mathematical sciences at the University of Pennsylvania who will have opportunities to engage in research on highly non-trivial topics in probability theory. The PI will also devote some effort to improving STEM education at a broader level through the development of innovative techniques for calculus instruction and curriculum development. The PI will investigate the systematic mathematical study of certain common practices which have suffered from a lack of methodological validation, as a further broader impact.<br/><br/>The mathematical techniques to be used in this project involve the introduction of time reversals.  In a time reversal, randomness of initial conditions becomes randomness of the time-reversed path.  Once there is randomness in the evolution, it is possible to use techniques from Markov chains, statistical mechanics, and other applications of probability theory. There are a number of Markov chains that describe time reversals of a given system.  Suppose one's concern is to describe the time-zero distribution of a system evolving deterministically from random conditions at time minus infinity.  Among possible Markovian time-reversals, the one that describes this is the one with the maximum entropy.  The PI then plans to compute this using a variational principle."

The conference provides a forum for mathematicians working on problems related to the Hales-Jewett theorem, a cornerstone result in combinatorics. The conference features ten plenary talks by distinguished mathematicians and provides an opportunity for students and junior researchers to meet and learn from leaders in the field.  The meeting provides a venue for exchange of ideas to catalyze new developments in the field, as well as the training of graduate students working in this area. <br/><br/>The Hales-Jewett Theorem is a central theorem in the area of research known as Ramsey Theory. This area has been actively investigated by leading mathematicians for more than one hundred years, with recent spectacular progress. In a large collaborative effort through the Polymath Project, one of the long sought-after goals in the area, the density Hales-Jewett Theorem, was finally proved in 2012. The conference features current research on this topic and others in Ramsey Theory and related areas. Leading researchers will present new results, and during the conference there will be ample time for open discussions on the field's many unsolved problems.

Such graphs are particularly suited to the modeling of large-scale sensor and transceiver networks, which are becoming more common as electronic devices become smaller and cheaper and are interconnected in very large networks. Modeling the behavior of these networks is becoming more and more important, and the analysis of the behavior of these networks when they become extremely large is becoming increasingly relevant in practical applications. This award supports research on the properties of these large-scale networks, as well as training of graduate students and early-career researchers in the mathematics of random graphs. <br/><br/>The study of random geometric graphs originated with questions about the way fluids seep through porous media. More recently, the study of large-scale electronic and communication networks has prompted many questions about random geometric graphs. The basic model of random geometric graphs was proposed by Gilbert over fifty years ago: take points randomly in the plane according to a Poisson point process of unit intensity, and join two whenever they are within a prescribed distance of each other. The central question concerning this model is: for what values of the prescribed distance do we obtain an infinite connected component? Surprisingly, even after fifty years, only rough upper and lower bounds are known for the critical value of the prescribed distance. Some properties of this Gilbert model are known, but many other questions still remain unanswered. This research project addresses some of these questions, as well as other questions about related models of random graph inspired by both percolation theory and large-scale communication networks."

For example, the Wigner semicircle distribution, which arises as a limiting distribution of eigenvalues of random symmetric matrices in the large-size limit, was first observed in the study of nuclear physics. This research project is a rigorous mathematical study of the phenomena of singularity and universality in random matrices.  This research is expected to lead to a more complete and deeper understanding of random matrices, with considerable impact on related areas of science. <br/><br/>Technically speaking, two aspects of random systems will be studied: singularity and universality. This includes the analysis of the repulsion of Wigner matrix eigenvalues and of random polynomial roots, and specifically the study of certain Wegner-type estimates for matrix eigenvalues and, for random polynomial roots, the repulsion phenomenon under minimal conditions on the random coefficients. The goal under the universality aspect focuses on a central limit theorem-type result for the logarithmic determinant of Wigner matrices and certain equidistribution properties of the eigenvectors."

The workshop series focuses on combinatorics and graph theory, which are two very active areas of research in modern mathematics. The geographical location of the workshop is intended as a focal point for the large number of researchers and students in the Midwest and provides opportunities to strengthen research collaborations on a variety of graph theoretical and combinatorial problems. The workshop, which will be advertised to universities throughout the Midwest, will train students and beginning researchers in important classical and emerging techniques of combinatorics and graph theory. <br/><br/>The workshop features two sets of three tutorial lectures, focusing on classical techniques and results in combinatorics that are not always presented in typical graduate sequences, and on emerging techniques on which the speakers are particularly qualified to expound. Tutorial lectures by Professor Edray Goins from Purdue University concern ""q-series, Partitions, Generating Functions,"" ""Modular Forms,"" and ""Applications.""  Tutorial lectures by Professor Margaret Readdy from the University of Kentucky concern ""Quantum Combinatorics,"" ""Coalgebraic Combinatorics,"" and ""Whitney Stratifications and Combinatorics."" In addition, the workshop features short talks by students and early-career faculty members. More details may be found at the workshop website <br/>www.stat.purdue.edu/lmwcgt16/"
