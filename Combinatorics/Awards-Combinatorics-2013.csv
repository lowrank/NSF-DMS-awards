One was combinatorial in nature, and concentrated on the enumeration problems for permutations with a small set (size 1 or 2, typically) of short (length up to 4) forbidden patterns. The other was coming from Theoretical Computer Science, and was concerned with sets arising from common sorting mechanisms and their combinations. In the past 10 years or so these two strands have come much closer together, and this interaction has created a new, fast developing area of combinatorics, with significant interactions with Theoretical Computer Science, the Theory of Computability and Complexity, Algebra, and Computational Biology, to name only a few. Apart from the continued interest in sorting mechanisms and enumeration problems, major new strands of research have emerged including the structural theory of classes, the asymptotic behavior of classes, generalized pattern avoidance, packing densities, algorithmic and decidability problems, and geometrical methods.<br/>"

The first is a study of manifolds possessing stratifications with the same good properties possessed by the Bruhat decomposition of a flag manifold.  In particular, in this project the PI, with Xuhua He and Jiang-Hua Lu, will explore whether certain other famous stratified spaces (e.g. the 'wonderful compactification' of a Lie group) can similarly be given a stratified atlas of Bruhat cells.  The second is about the extent to which the good properties -- Frobenius splitting, Poisson structures, total positivity -- imply one another.  The third project (with Joel Kamnitzer) is about giving a cohomological description of the coordinate rings for Mirkovic-Vilonen cycles in loop Grassmannians.  If one thinks of representation theory as either about coherent sheaves on flag manifolds (finite-dimensional geometry) or constructible sheaves on loop Grassmannians (infinite-dimensional topology), then this project is looking one level deeper, at coherent sheaves on loop Grassmannians.  The fourth project is about extending the 'puzzle' framework of the PI and Tao for Schubert calculus to determine in a positive way the classes of arbitrary positroid subvarieties.<br/><br/>Many of the most beautiful spaces considered by mathematicians, and structures on those spaces, have been discovered through symmetry considerations, but perhaps this is akin to looking for one's keys under the lamppost because the light is brightest there.  One well-known space and structure is the space of 'flags' of subspaces, with a 'stratification' given by looking at the level of intersection with a fixed flag; any linear transformation preserving the standard flag gives a symmetry of the stratification.  My coauthors and I are investigating other spaces in which such symmetries are present only locally, finding unsuspected structure on familiar spaces and stratifications.  One of the successes inspiring this study is a stratification of the space of full rank k x n matrices, stratified according to the position of pivots after Gaussian elimination on each rotation of the columns.  Without the rotation, this is a 19th century idea.  In a separate project, the PI intends to determine properties such as the volume of these strata, extending a century's worth of work on ""Schubert calculus"", the subcase using only the reflection of the columns."

The principal investigators build on their previous work in combinatorics and graph theory in the areas of extremal graph, hypergraph and  poset theory, graph visualization and graph drawing, random graph models and probabilistic combinatorics to attack fundamental questions in extremal set theory, extremal graph theory, and in areas closely related to them. These fundamental questions include the 70 years old Turan problem, one of the toughest problems in extremal combinatorics; the excluded subposet problems, results on which are just solidifying into a theory; and building a Turan hypergraph theory bridging the two areas above, offering new insight for both. Notwithstanding the efficacy of spectral methods in graphs theory and different analogues of it for hypergraphs, there is not yet a coherent spectral hypergraph theory.  Lu and Peng  made an attempt  to unify different versions of Laplacians for hypergraphs. A key direction of the project is building  further the spectral analysis of uniform hypergraphs based on their Laplacian.  For 40 years, the Lovasz Local Lemma has been the  tool to find the proverbial needle in the haystack. The principal investigators introduced a technique to use the lopsided version of the Lovasz Local Lemma for asymptotic enumeration of combinatorial objects. The project will extend the range of asymptotic enumeration problems where this method applies, by finding new classes of problems where the lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma applies. The study of crossing numbers of graphs, and of the structure of generalized Sperner families is also among the goals of the project.<br/><br/>The applied prong of the project  is  expected to have an impact on other sciences. In particular, investigating models for  sequence evolution and phylogeny reconstruction is relevant for the mathematical foundation of bioinformatics, investigating extremal and structural properties of tree indices has relevance for mathematical chemistry, working on crossing numbers of graphs  in different models of drawing is relevant for computer science. Some probabilistic and spectral results of this project will be relevant for network science. The principal investigators continue their interdisciplinary collaborations with colleagues from engineering, biology, statistics, and computer science, and continue the training of successful graduate students."

In tackling these problems, a variety of combinatorial methods will be used, such as probabilistic methods and applications of regularity techniques. The PI also plans to develop new techniques leading to the construction of graphs with certain special properties. The Ramsey type problems suggested in the proposal include the investigation of the asymptotic behavior of hypergraph Ramsey numbers, of induced Ramsey numbers, of size-Ramsey numbers, as well of the Erdos-Rogers function. The PI also intends to study some problems in structural Ramsey theory. The extremal problems that the PI intends to investigate include Ramsey-Turán problems and the study of Hamilton cycles and matchings in hypergraphs, as well as extremal problems regarding random subsets of integers.<br/><br/>This research will serve as a basis for the mentoring activities of the PI. Concepts and questions of combinatorial character appear naturally in other branches of mathematics and, more broadly speaking, in computer science and in the physical, biological, and social sciences, making combinatorial mathematics of interest not only within mathematics itself, but within the sciences as a whole."

He will also study Classical Invariant Theory related to Schur-Weyl duality. This leads to a generalization of a theorem by Schrijver and a ""super"" version of wheeled PROPs. He also will apply Invariant Theory to (Algebraic) Complexity Theory and investigate the complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem. The PI will try to generalize the invariant for polymatroids that he has introduced to knots. He will also continue his collaboration with David Masser on recurrence sequences, and linear equations over multiplicative groups.<br/><br/>A fundamental problem is to determine whether 2 objects are essentially the same. In the Graph Isomorphism, for example, one would like to determine whether two given graphs are the same after reordering of the vertices. The PI is working on an algorithm that can be proven to be efficient for various classes of graphs. One way to distinguish objects is by using invariants. An invariant is a function on objects that may have distinct values for objects that are not the same. The PI has introduced such an invariant for graphs, and would like to extend this invariant to knots. A quiver representation is just a directed graph, where the vertices represent vector spaces and the arrows represent linear maps. Quiver representations are related to quantum groups and string theory, and the PI will investigate some of the theoretical aspects."

A fundamental open problem in combinatorial representation theory is to describe the multiplicities in the decomposition of the tensor product of two irreducible representations of the symmetric group. These multiplicities are called the Kronecker coefficients. The problem of finding a combinatorial interpretation for these coefficients has been open for nearly a hundred years and is one of the main problems in combinatorial representation theory. In a new development the PI and collaborators have established a new connection of this problem to the partition algebra, a centralizer algebra of the symmetric group.  The PI will use this new connection to study several outstanding open problems related to the Kronecker coefficients. The PI will also continue her contributions to combinatorial algebras, which are algebras that can be described via combinatorial methods, e.g., the descent and peak algebras. The significance of the descent algebras arise from their applications to noncommutative and quasi-symmetric functions, and from their connections to the ring of representations of the symmetric group. In this project, the PI proposes to investigate new combinatorial algebras and to use centralizer algebras to better understand the existing combinatorial algebras.<br/><br/>This research is in the general area of algebraic combinatorics. Algebraic objects are often complex and difficult to understand. Combinatorics help make abstract algebraic objects more concrete so that they become more accessible and can be more easily used in other fields. This is achieved through efficient algorithms and elementary models which give insight into the properties of algebraic objects. The proposed projects tackle deep and important problems that will advance the understanding of many fields, including quantum information theory, complexity theory, and algorithms. The results will have applications that would span many fields from physics and chemistry to computer science. In addition, the proposed research is of broad interest in mathematics to those studying symmetric functions, Lie theory, quantum groups, algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology and mathematical physics."

He also is working on a book on Schubert calculus and its various modern extensions which will emphasize the geometric aspects of the theory, in a uniform manner across the different Lie types.<br/><br/>In the late 19th century, Hermann Schubert made a first systematic study of enumerative projective geometry and invented a calculus which enabled him to solve a plethora of enumerative problems in a systematic fashion. An example of the kind of question he addressed is: given four randomly generated lines in Euclidean 3-space, how many lines will intersect all four of the given lines? Schubert's fundamental work was a precursor of the cohomology and intersection theories of the 20th century, and their modern extensions today, with applications to quantum physics (via string theory) and number theory (via arithmetic intersection theory). Moreover, the entire story can be placed in a more symmetric framework, and told using the language of Lie groups and their representation theory, at an increasing level of combinatorial complexity and importance. The investigator has studied these theories over a period of many years and has shown how to achieve combinatorially explicit computations and formulas which give a global picture of the ring structure in each case. Recently, he has succeeded in doing this in a uniform way across all classical Lie types -- in the case of cohomology -- and has thus opened new avenues of research in the rapidly growing field of modern Schubert calculus.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Combinatorics Program."

Three directions of study are proposed: quasirandomness, extremal Turan-type problems, and ramsey theory.  In each of these areas, the PI  will extend classical results in graph theory that have been around for decades to hypergraphs. For example, extending the foundational results of Thomason and Chung-Graham-Wilson on quasirandom graphs to hypergraphs has received considerable attention since the early 1990's and the PI has made further progress recently; he plans to explore the sparse case in this project. The PI (together with coauthors) has recently extended the Erdos-Gallai theorem about paths and cycles in graphs to hypergraphs; further extensions of the new method that was  developed will be explored for other forbidden structures.  Finally, there have been relatively few results in hypergraph Ramsey theory since some basic bounds of Erdos and others from the 1950's and the PI will  use modern approaches to tackle some outstanding problems in these areas. <br/><br/>The  extremal and probabilistic theory of hypergraphs impacts several areas of Mathematics (number theory, combinatorics, logic) as well as other fields like information theory, coding theory, and theoretical computer science. The study of random structures and randomized algorithms has gained particular importance in recent years due to the many large real world networks that have emerged and are being studied. Developing new techniques to study these complex systems will be a major task for future researchers. The theory of quasirandom hypergraphs may form a theoretical foundation for studying large scale behavior of more complicated networks where groups of more than two nodes are connected to each other.  One theme common to most problems that will be investigated in this project is to understand the quantitative relationship between the local and global behavior of a large system.<br/>"

One might use transform methods, especially the Fourier transform to determine the role of frequency in the problem. Often most important, is the role of modeling the problem, which in mathematics means finding simple model problems exhibiting the difficulties of the original problem. In this proposal, we plan to use these methods of hard analysis to work on a number of problems of interest in various areas.<br/><br/>We plan to look for lower bounds in a certain kind of complexity problem by analyzing the complexity of bipartite graphs which are close to extremal for the property of having no complete two-by-two subgraphs.

The PI is one of the organizers of a 3 month program at IPAM centered on uses of the algebraic method in discrete extremal combinatorics, a practice he helped pioneer in his work with Guth on the Joints problem and on the Erdos discrete distance problem. This meeting will bring together scores of mathematicians: senior faculty, junior faculty, but especially postdocs and graduate students, allowing them to fruitfully meet and discuss this exciting and growing field. Such meetings are essential in the development of a workforce of young mathematicians. This grant will help the PI in his training of graduate students and postdocs, in some cases providing a bit of support. Focused training of junior researchers by more senior one, which is carried on through the solution of problems, is crucial to the creation of the dynamic work force we have in the pure mathematics community. The PI is starting a new job at Caltech which he is very excited about. One broad impact that he will have is teaching a course called Math 1a, required of all Caltech freshmen. It is essentially an accelerated elementary analysis aimed at scientists and engineers. That such a course will be taught by a research analyst, making an impact on cutting edge problems through essentially universal ideas in analysis, will enrich the course, giving the students a good feel of what mathematics is really about."

Cluster algebras are commutative algebras with a special combinatorial structure, which are related to various fields in mathematics and physics. The PI will pursue several investigations. For general cluster algebras, he plans to prove the positivity conjecture, which is the oldest unsolved conjecture in the field. For cluster algebras of surface type, the PI will study the properties of canonical bases introduced by him and his collaborators. Moreover, he will use the bases to gain a better understanding of the cluster algebra itself as well as its relationship with representation theory and Teichmueller theory. The Pi will also study automorphisms of cluster algebras which will lead to a better comprehension of the intrinsic symmetries of cluster algebras. The PI will integrate education and research at several levels. He will organize a graduate summer school on cluster algebras at the University of Connecticut. The PI will continue to develop an international network at institutions in Argentina, Canada and the US, which will allow advanced graduate students and postdocs to go abroad for two-week long research visits in order to exchange ideas with local researchers. Moreover, the PI will continue to run the cluster algebra seminar in his department.<br/><br/>When cluster algebras were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002, their original motivation came from representation theory, which is a branch of modern algebra. Studying the symmetries of a model is often more fruitful than studying the model directly, and representation theory has found many applications in physics and chemistry as well as in other mathematical fields. The cluster algebras provide a mathematical framework for fundamental patterns which occur throughout representation theory. Surprisingly, these patterns are also observed in various other branches of science which, a priori, are not related to representation theory. This motivates a further development of the theory of cluster algebras to which this project will contribute. <br/>"

While certain themes in additive combinatorics are classical in number theory, there is also focus on new structural questions that turned out to be important. For instance, the work of Gowers and, later, Green and Tao on arithmetic progressions have put considerable impetus on Freiman's theorem and it's quantitative versions. Parallel to these results, a general `sum-product' theory in finite fields and residue rings was developed. The roots of this research go back for instance to early work of Erdos-Szemeredi  and the finite field version of the Kakeya problem (solved by Z. Dvir). It turned out that results from sum-product and product theory in various settings are of interest in their own right as they lead to new results in analytic number theory (such as estimates of short character sums), in pseudo-randomness and in group theory (growth, expansion and spectral gaps). The PI intends to explore finite field analogues of the Szemeredi Trotter theorem on incidences for algebraic curves (which are a special case of so-called pseudo-line systems). In the finite field setting, such results are presently only available for straight lines. More general results for pseudo-line systems have been obtained over the reals but none of the known approaches seem adaptable to the finite fields situation, so that new ideas are clearly needed here. Results of this type would have major implications in the areas mentioned above because they allow to obtain nontrivial statements on solutions of systems of equations in situations where classical number theory is not applicable. As a particular case, the PI would like to obtain analogues of the Bombieri-Pila results on lattice points on curves restricted to boxes in the prime field setting. Related to 'growth' phenomena in groups, the work of Breuillard, Green and Tao provides a complete description of 'approximate groups' that in some sense generalize Freiman's theorem and also provide a finitary version of Gromov's theorem. At this stage, the results are only qualitative and obtaining quantitative versions would be most interesting, in particular in view of the consequences to group expansion. The PI will continue to work with her collaborators on Poonen's conjecture on the multiplicative order of F-points on curves. Again this is a problem at the interface of combinatorics, algebra and number theory where progress can be expected.<br/><br/>Arithmetic combinatorics and `sum-product theory' in various settings have become increasingly significant to various other fields, such as pseudo-randomness in computer science, classical analytic number theory and the theory of expansion in linear groups. The purpose of this proposal is to continue research on the related issues in combinatorial number theory and their applications in particular, to  problems of estimating the number of solutions of algebraic equations when the variables are restricted. This research involves different groups of people and the interaction of various branches of mathematics, occasionally leading to progress on old problems.<br/>"

It is, thus, not surprising that graph coloring and its related problems have always been in the main line of graph theory research. It was observed by Tutte that the problem of the face-coloring of an embedded (planar) graph can be formulated in terms of integer flows of the graph. Since then the topic of integer flows has been one of the most attractive in graph theory.  Grotzsch proved that every triangle free, loopless planar graph is 3-vertex-colorable. By flow/coloring duality, this is equivalent to the statement that every 4-edge-connected planar graph has a nowhere-zero 3-flow.  The 3-flow Conjecture (by Tutte) asserts that this is still true without the assumption of planarity. Collaborating with his colleagues, the PI successfully proved that every 6-edge-connected graph admits nowhere-zero 3-flow.  According to a result by Kochol that it suffices to prove 3-flow Conjecture for 5-edge-connected graphs. Thus our result is now only ""one step away"" from the final solution of this famous open problem. The PI will continue his research work in this direction. He proposes to extend those newly developed techniques for further studies in the theory of integer flows. Proposed projects will include not only the 3-flow Conjecture, but also 5-flow Conjecture, Tutte orientations, contractible configurations (group connectivity), flows for odd-edge-connected graph, circular flows and Circular Flow Conjecture, etc.<br/><br/>The proposed work belongs to the area of graph theory and is closely related to computer science and operational research. A graph is an abstract mathematical notion used to model networks, such as communication systems, transportation networks or the Internet. Various graph coloring problems have been considered as effective models for radio channel assignment/distribution, and flow problems originally arise in optimizing traffic or network. This proposal is concerned with problems of structural nature. Why do some networks possess certain specific desirable properties, and others do not? Especially, when the reliability (connectivity) of a network decreases, certain flow patterns may disappear. A better understanding of such graphic properties will lead to designs of efficient algorithms, to practical computations."

There are three main phenomena that the PI plans to investigate. The first is the appearance of rigid geometric structures as answers (or conjectured answers) to Turán- and Ramsey-type problems. Here, the goal is to understand why these structures appear, and to find a systematic way to go from a combinatorial problem to such a structure. The second phenomenon arises in the problems of approximation of large point sets. Here, the two sides of the problem lead to two different areas: the lower bounds to algebraic topology, and the upper bounds to logic. The PI will work on extending the existing techniques, with a goal of perfecting them to the point of eliminating the guesswork that they currently require. The final phenomenon concerns geometric incidence problems. The PI will try to generalize the existing topological approaches to finite field setting. The motivation here is the superficial similarity between the proofs in Euclidean space, such as the resolution of the distinct distance problem, and the proofs of sum-product-type results for dense sets in the finite field setting.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to strengthen the ties of combinatorics with areas of mathematics that are not commonly linked with combinatorics.  Besides the immediate benefit of making progress on concrete combinatorial problems, the aim is to create bridges that will allow specialists in different fields to share insights.

Another is the existence of some underlying quantum group symmetry which allows to perform computations via representation theory.

The theory of quantum groups and crystal bases, which has been actively developed over the last several decades, is a powerful tool for connecting combinatorics and representation theory.  In the last decade, there have been several attempts, by Berenstein, Zwicknagl, Mulmuley, Sohoni, and others, to use this tool to study the Kronecker and related plethysm problems.

This subject has grown out of applied problems, with the first questions about the way fluids seep through porous media.

The basic model of random geometric graphs was proposed by Gilbert over fifty years ago: take points randomly in the plane according to a Poisson point process of intensity 1, and join two whenever they are within a distance r of each other. The main question Gilbert asked is the following: for what values of r do we obtain an infinite connected component? Surprisingly, even after fifty years, only rather poor upper and lower bounds are known for the critical value of r. Some properties of this Gilbert model are known, but many other questions still remain unanswered. The proposed project considers some of these questions, and many other questions about related models of random graph inspired by both percolation theory and large scale communication networks.<br/><br/>Random geometric graphs can be used to model many large scale networks that exist in real life, such as the internet, social networks, and are particularly suited to the modeling of large scale sensor and transceiver networks. As electronic devices become smaller and cheaper, it is now not uncommon to have very large networks of interconnected devices. Modeling the behavior of these networks is becoming more and more important, and the analysis of the behavior of these networks when they become extremely large is becoming increasingly relevant in real world applications.

As far as the inverse problems are concerned, the PI will be focusing on various settings of the inverse Littlewood-Offord problems. One of his main goals is to obtain a clear picture as to why a multilinear form of independent random variables is highly concentrated on a short interval. For the singularity problem, he proposes to study the least singular value for a number of random matrices of correlated entries such as symmetric matrices and doubly stochastic matrices. In numerous important counting problems in mathematics, understanding the underlying structure has been shown to be fundamental. As our Littlewood-Offord inverse problems connect the concentration of random walks to additive structures such as arithmetic progressions, it is expected that a systematic study of these problems would yield many sophisticated applications. A key part of our project is to develop one of these applications into random matrix theory, establishing the circular law and elliptic law for a broad range of random matrices of correlated entries. These laws support the well-known universality phenomenon observed by physicists and probabilists many years ago: many facts about the distribution of eigenvalues of random matrices seem to be universal, they do not depend on the distribution of the entries.<br/><br/>In addition to research, the PI will develop undergraduate and graduate level courses which cover important topics in combinatorics and probability. Some of the topics in these courses will be related to the problems in this project. The PI will continue to write research papers, organize seminars, and give a wide range of talks, from research level to introductory one in order to encourage students into studying mathematics."

The first research direction, proposed in this project, involves a radically new idea of using analogies with quantum probabilistic physics. It introduces a new topological context for normal lattice polytopes. The second direction develops essentially new techniques for studying general convex polytopes. It is based on advanced categorial and homological machinery. The first line of research aims at shedding new light and making substantial progress on several outstanding open problems, such as unimodular triangulations and covers, Caratheodory rank, higher syzygies of the corresponding toric rings. The new idea of attacking these challenges draws from a physical interpretation of special discrete point configurations. Concrete suggestions in this direction to the PI were made by theoretical physicists and further connections to the physical context will be paid special attention. The second direction focuses on the category of convex polytopes and their affine maps. The goal is to devise a universal technique, providing a general context for various recent important constructions and results in polytope theory. The categorial approach leads to very concrete problems in classical polytopal combinatorics.<br/><br/>Combinatorics is the science of organizing, arranging and analyzing discrete data. An illustrative example is the set of integer points in a convex polygon in the plane or in a convex polytope in the space. Combinatorics of lattice polytopes studies such point configurations to encode important constructions in algebra, geometry, and topology, while combinatorial methods are well suited for related computations. The interaction of combinatorics and abstract mathematical techniques, central to the proposed research, over the last decades has resulted in a number of fundamental theorems in a variety of disciplines. The proposal explores some of the deepest problems in polytopal combinatorics, employs ideas from a variety of disciplines and unexpected links between them, and offers concrete strategies for attacking central open questions. Applications range from algebraic geometry (the science of solution sets to systems of multidimensional polynomial equations) to integer programming/computer science, probability theory, and physics. The progress would have been unimaginable without computer assisted investigation and experimentation, the increased importance of which is related to the demand for algorithmic understanding of discrete structures. Both proposed research lines incorporate a strong - sometimes, crucial - computational element. Developing and implementing related algorithms is an excellent possibility for involving beginning graduate students.<br/><br/>"

The first problem is the famous Erdos-Hajnal conjecture, and its tournament version due to Alon, Pach and Solymosi. Following recent results, the PI plans to combine structural methods with techniques related to Szemeredi's regularity lemma to make further progress. The second set of problems is a conjecture of Gyarfas and Sumner, and questions related to chi-boundedness. In particular, the PI plans to study tournament versions of some of the related classical questions. The last proposed research direction is the general question of the structure of graphs with forbidden induced subgraphs, where particular emphasis is placed on perfect graphs. The PI's have extensive experience in the area, in combination with recent ideas of ""extreme decompositions'', is likely to lead to new results.<br/><br/><br/>This proposal deals with three problems in graphs theory. All three are about graphs with certain forbidden substructures (called ""induced subgraphs"") excluded; and different aspects of graph behavior are studied in each of the problems. The first two questions considered in the proposal are known conjectures in the field; their solution, or any progress on them, will be of interest to many researchers. The last research direction is more of a ""theory building"" question, where a general approach, that can be used for a large number of problems, will be developed."

Firstly, in the area of random matrix theory, we seek to build upon recent progress in understanding the fascinating universality phenomenon for such matrices, by generalising the ensembles for which universality can be established, and looking for the underlying mechanisms causing this universality.  Secondly, in the area of arithmetic combinatorics, we seek to improve our theory of approximate groups and related structures in noncommutative settings, with potential impact on geometric group theory and finite group theory. <br/>Finally, we wish to extend and understand the exciting new connections between algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and incidence combinatorics which have led to remarkable breakthroughs in the latter subject by applying algebraic methods.<br/><br/>Physical systems are often incredibly complicated, being driven by interactions between countless components of those systems.  However, in many cases, a remarkable phenomenon known as universality occurs, in which the macroscopic statistics of the a wide variety of systems are governed by a single universal mathematical law, almost without any regard to how the components of these systems interact with each other at the microscopic level.  For instance, the famous central limit theorem in mathematics asserts that many statistics (e.g. the distribution of heights in a human population) are described by a single curve known as the ""bell curve"" or ""Gaussian distribution"".  While the central limit theorem is now very well understood, there are other universal laws that are still mysterious, such as the Dyson sine law that has been empirically found to govern such diverse statistics as nuclear scattering, arrival times of buses, and the spacing of the zeta function in number theory.  However, we have recently begun to understand this law for a simple class of models known as random matrix models, though even for these models there is still much work to be done.  We plan to work on further understanding the underlying causes of universality for random matrix models and related models, with the hope of shedding insight on the universality phenomenon for other models as well.<br/><br/>The second aspect of the research program concerns the phenomenon of expansion in various networks, most famously manifested by the ""six degrees of separation"" experiment of Milgram, that asserts that any two people in the world are linked by at most six degrees of acquaintance. <br/> For a mathematical model of this phenomenon known as a Cayley graph, the existence of expansion is closely tied to the absence of a certain type of mathematical object known as an approximate group.  There has been a substantial amount of progress in understanding what exactly approximate groups look like, but the control we have on these groups is still not as precise as we would like.  We plan to study the theory of approximate groups further, with an eye towards applications to other areas of mathematics such as understanding the geometry of groups.<br/><br/>Combinatorial incidence geometry is the study of how simple geometric objects such as lines, circles, and points can be arranged together in as efficient a configuration as possible for various purposes (e.g. to try to arrange a given number of points and lines so that as many points lie on as many lines as possible).  Understanding the limits of how efficiently one can design such configurations is a basic mathematical question which also has practical applications (e.g. in designing frequency configurations for cell phones in order to maximize capacity and minimize interference).  Recently, there has been several breakthroughs in the subject by introducing methods from algebra (particularly algebraic geometry and algebraic topology).  This unexpected development is still not well understood; the algebraic methods can solve some problems almost completely, while making no mark on other ostensibly similar problems.  We plan to study these methods further and understand exactly what their strengths and limitations are."

The proposed program will develop the theory of dual equivalence graphs, a powerful, combinatorial tool for establishing the Schur positivity of quasisymmetric functions, and provide new applications to important classes of functions. The program will deepen the connection between dual equivalence graphs and crystal graphs while generalizing dual equivalence graphs to other classical<br/>types, thereby expanding the applicability of the dual equivalence graph machinery to representation theory of classical groups. The program will also introduce a new family of symmetric functions that will provide a combinatorial understanding of the stable Kronecker coefficients, which, in turn, should lead to a better understanding of the Kronecker coefficients.<br/><br/>Symmetric function theory plays an important role in many areas of mathematics including algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, Lie groups and Lie algebras, algebraic geometry and the theory of special functions. Results in this area have applications to many other areas of mathematics as well as to physics and computer science.

There are many aspects of polytopes one can study. This proposal is focused on the volume and number of lattice points of polytopes as well as two tools for connecting these subjects: Ehrhart polynomials and valuations. Based on her previous work, the PI plans to investigate polytopes with the property that their Ehrhart coefficients can be written in terms of volumes or more generally are positive, study the Ehrhart coefficients of k-integral polytopes (a family of polytopes defined in the PI's recent work) from different perspectives, and further develop two methods for volume computations. The PI will also study the intermediate generating function, which is a valuation on polyhedra, and work on generalizing Linke's real Ehrhart theorem to a theory on valuations.<br/><br/>Polytopes are higher-dimensional generalizations of polygons. An important topic of study for polytopes is their volume. Also important are their lattice points, i.e., points whose coordinates are whole numbers. Two tools for studying these concepts are Ehrhart polynomials and valuations. They have connections not only to combinatorics, but also to algebra, algebraic geometry, statistics and number theory. Progress in any direction the PI proposes can lead to either explicit descriptions of formulas for volumes or numbers of lattice points, or better understanding of other aspects of polytopes, and therefore benefits related areas. The proposed research has the potential to lead to new algorithms and applications outside of pure math. For instance, both lattice points counting and volume computations have direct relevance to aspects of statistical sampling, and some of the valuations discussed in the proposal have applications in optimization. In fact, the PI's recent work already leads to a new algorithm for computing volume. In general, these problems are sufficiently accessible that they may be integrated into course material and student research projects."
