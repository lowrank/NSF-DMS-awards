"0902296","Degenerations of algebraic varieties, with applications to combinatorics and representation theory","DMS","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM, Combinatorics","08/01/2009","06/01/2012","Allen Knutson","NY","Cornell University","Continuing Grant","Tie Luo","07/31/2013","$351,320.00","","allenknutson@gmail.com","341 PINE TREE RD","ITHACA","NY","148502820","6072555014","MPS","1264, 7970","0000, OTHR","$0.00","Knutson's proposal makes use of degeneration of algebraic varieties to study algebraic combinatorics, particularly combinatorial representation theory. Littelmann's path model in representation theory already has such an interpretation: Chirivi gave a degeneration of each flag manifold G/P (plus ample line bundle) to a reduced, seminormal union of toric varieties. Unfortunately, this used properties of Lusztig's canonical basis, so was specific to representation theory applications. Knutson hopes to replace these properties with Samuel-Rees-Nagata degenerations, to achieve similar reducedness results for degenerations of much more general varieties.<br/>One specific application is in computing branching rules from a group G to a symmetric subgroup K, using a K-equivariant degeneration of G/P, and Knutson, jointly with Jiang-Hua Liu, states a conjectural rule based on this.<br/><br/>Many interesting numbers and polynomials are associated to irreducible algebraic sets, where ""irreducible"" essentially means ""not glued from smaller pieces in a nontrivial way"". A circle x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 is such an example, as its equation does not factor, and one can associate the degree 2 to this equation. But if we degenerate it to x^2 + y^2 - 0 = 0, then the equation does factor (over the complex numbers), giving the union of two lines x = +/- iy. Those two equations are degree 1, and from the degenerative geometry we obtain the combinatorial result 2 = 1 + 1. Knutson uses this technique to study much more interesting irreducible sets, e.g. the space of all maximal nested chains of subspaces in a vector space; degenerating them to highly reducible unions of simple pieces replaces their geometric complexity with combinatorial complexity, and gives much more interesting formulae for their degrees (and generalizations thereof). In some of the work proposed, he specifically plans to pursue this technique to understand how quantum-mechanical systems with noncompact symmetry (e.g. under special relativity transformations, which allow boosts by speeds up to but not including light-speed) decompose when one only considers their compact symmetries (e.g. under rotation, by angles that are trapped on a circle and cannot run off to infinity). This is the same sort of problem (though the hoped-for results would be wholly complementary) as studied recently by the ATLAS team in the study of the representations of E_8.<br/>"

The project aims to develop computationally efficient approaches to enumeration of integer points in higher-dimensional polyhedra (such as polyhedra of non-negative matrices with prescribed row and column sums), optimization of multivariate polynomials on the unit sphere, computing simple approximations of complicated convex bodies (such as polytopes associated with hard problems of combinatorial optimization), and construction of symmetric polytopes with many faces. Related structural questions concerning random integer points in polyhedra and concentration of permanents of doubly stochastic matrices will be investigated. <br/><br/>In combinatorics and discrete optimization we are often interested in the structure of very large, yet finite sets, where direct enumeration is prohibitively expensive or impossible because of the size of the sets and methods of classical analysis are not applicable because of the discrete character of objects. The project aims to develop computationally efficient asymptotic approaches to several hard problems which concern counting and optimization in large discrete sets and describing the structure of a typical object from such a set. Several of the considered problems are of interest to statistics, physics, and engineering. <br/>"

Such algebraic expressions are called invariants. For example, the distance to the origin does not change under the rotation of the plane around the origin. The distance to the origin is an invariant. The PI will study a new approach to classical invariant theory. In collaboration with mathematicians and engineers at UIUC, the PI will study applications of theory of subspace arrangements to computer vision and image compression.<br/><br/>The PI will work on various other topics in commutative algebra, algebraic combinatorics, number theory. Cluster algebras were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky. These algebras have deep connections with the theory of quiver representations. The PI will explore this further in collaboration with Weyman and Zelevinsky. To a matroid or polymatroid one can associate various quasi-symmetric functions. The PI will  study universal properties of such invariants.The PI will collaborate with Masser to find an effective version of the Mordell-Lang problem in positive characteristic. <br/><br/><br/>"

They also propose to find sharp estimates for the size of sum-sets in various sets and for sum-product estimates (both 2-fold and k-fold) for integers and prime fields, as well as to describe the structure of sum-free sets.  The graph theory part of the proposal contains questions about triangle-free graphs, the Burr-Erdos Conjecture, and the Komlos-Sos Conjecture.<br/><br/>The PIs propose to develop new tools to deal with some challenging and important classical problems of Discrete Mathematics.  The PIs have extensive background and experience related to these questions, some of the advanced tools used today in Discrete Mathematics were originally developed by the PIs.  The proposed topics in additive numbers theory and in graph theory are applicable in mathematics and the sciences, especially in Fourier analysis and in practical algorithms, in number theory, in geometry, in graph theory and combinatorics, and in designing and analysing efficient computer algorithms (complexity theory).  The subject of Discrete Mathematics is the investigation of finite mathematical objects and their structures.  Discrete Mathematics is a rapidly growing area of mathematics with many theoretical and practical applications.  Arithmetic Combinatorics is a field investigating the interplay between Number Theory and Discrete Mathematics, using deep combinatorial and Fourier analytic methods to understand additive structures of sets of positive integers.  Graph Theory is the study of networks, modelling connection patterns in various mathematical and applied settings.<br/>"

For example, as far as random graphs are concerned, he will be focusing on the problem of finding sharp thresholds for the existence of factors in random graphs and hypergraphs, a special case of which is  the sharp version of Shamir's conjecture on perfect matching in random hypergraphs. He will also study expansion in random lifts and the sandwiching conjecture concerning Erd\""os-R\'enyi random graphs and random regular graphs. For random matrices, he proposes to study many problems concerning random Bernoulli matrices, such as probability of singularity, distributions of determinants and permanents, and properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Several of these problems have strong connection to problems in theoretical computer science. The PI will also continue his study of structural theorems in additive combinatorics, in particular those which have strong links to other fields, such as number theory and probability.<br/><br/>For a long time, randomness has been used by scientists to model huge and difficult structures that occur in nature. One famous example is Wigner's use of the spectra of random matrices to model energy levels of atoms.  Another is the use of random graphs to model real life graphs such as the Internet. The PI plan is to make a systematic study of random matrices and random graphs, together with some problems in number theory, which, quite surprisingly, have turned out to be related. He strongly  believes  that a systematic study of the proposed problems will eventually lead to the developments of new ideas and tools, which can be useful in many other topics, and to a deeper understanding of the relations between various fields of mathematics."

The two main projects explore central problems in the subject. The first project seeks uniformly stated combinatorial rules in Schubert calculus, via an expanded theory of Young tableaux. The famous Littlewood-Richardson coefficients arise in this context, but also in the theory of representations of general linear groups and of symmetric groups, eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices and short exact sequences of finite abelian p-groups. The PI will find combinatorial rules for these coefficients and their Schubert calculus extensions, building on joint work with H. Thomas. The second project aims to further develop a combinatorial and computational framework, introduced jointly with A. Woo, to understand the singularities of Schubert varieties.<br/><br/>The main tools applied and further developed in this project come from combinatorics, including algebraic and geometric combinatorics, and combinatorial commutative algebra. Combinatorics concerns discrete objects such as permutations, partial orders and graphs, as well as techniques of enumeration. In many instances, such as with Schubert varieties, continuous objects can be parameterized by discrete data, opening the door for combinatorial analysis. Moreover, one often witnesses that the same combinatorial objects govern a priori different mathematical settings. The Littlewood-Richardson coefficients are a prime example of this. The project seeks to similarly find further cross-flow of ideas between areas of mathematics, as well as with other scientific disciplines.<br/>"

Specifically, she seeks ways to use the combinatorics of a face poset or closure poset together with limited topological information (e.g. information about codimension one cell incidences) to determine topological information such as rational homology or even in some cases homeomorphism type.  A main goal is to prove that various stratified spaces whose closure posets are thin and shellable are in fact regular CW complexes.  She also aims to construct boundary maps on important classes of posets such as geometric lattices, motivated by potential applications e.g. in theoretical computer science.  She will also study representations of simple Lie algebras via an analysis of local structure within the poset that indicates which weight space generators appear with nonzero coefficient upon application of a raising or lowering operator to other weight space generators.<br/><br/>In computer science, there is a strong interest both in finding effective algorithms when this is possible, and also in understanding when this is not theoretically possible.  It is often difficult to know how to even begin to obtain these impossibility results, but topology combined with combinatorics does have the potential to yield such results, and there have been some striking successes in the past.  One of the proposed projects is somewhat in this vein -- to prove impossibility results for the question of which graphs (i.e. which models for networks of computers) admit data sorting algorithms by greedily swapping pieces of neighboring data that are out of order.  In another direction, geometric structures such as the Schubert varieties of representation theory/algebraic geometry often have combinatorial data associated to them which is organized into what is called a partially ordered set.  Much is known about how properties of the geometric structure force properties on the partially ordered set.  The PI seeks a better understanding of how much can be said in the other direction, perhaps allowing some manageable extra data such as information about how edges are attached to 2-dimensional faces, how 2-dimensional faces are attached to 3-dimensional faces, and so on.  This could have applications to finding new ways of figuring out what very complicated, high-dimensional geometric objects look like.  In addition to continuing to mentor students and run seminars, the PI will also continue organizing conferences designed to foster fruitful new interactions and collaborations between those working in topological combinatorics and in related areas such as combinatorial representation theory and combinatorial commutative algebra.<br/><br/>"
