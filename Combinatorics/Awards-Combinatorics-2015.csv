This is the study of discrete objects and maps between them together with algebraic properties that govern the structures of these objects. The combinatorial problems which arise are related to representation theory (study of symmetries), physics (energy levels of particles and their structure coefficients), and geometry (intersections of curves in space). Among the main tools used in this research are crystal graphs, which describe these structures in the ""zero temperature limit"" and yet encapture all of the important properties. Since combinatorics is concrete, it is very amenable to computational investigations. The robust implementation of algorithms derived from the project will lead to the development of new code for the open-source computer algebra system Sage. The dissemination of this new software through Sage will not only advance the proposed research program, but has already led to cross-fertilization between various areas in mathematics and computer science (for example through a semester program at ICERM), and this is expected to continue. This project involves the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The combinatorial study of affine Schubert calculus has led to new tableaux related to weak and strong Bruhat order in analogy to semistandard Young tableaux. Crystal base theory has a long tradition of answering representation theoretic questions in combinatorial terms, such as multiplicities of tensor products or positive character expansions. Applying crystal bases to the theory of weak tableaux, the PI and her collaborators were able to answer certain longstanding questions about structure constants of flag Gromov--Witten invariants and quantum Schubert structure coefficients. The PI seeks to complete this theory and apply it to strong tableaux. This would prove, for example, that k-Schur functions, which are affine versions of the usual Schur functions and form a set of representatives for the Schubert classes of the cohomology of the affine Grassmannian, expand positively in terms of Schur functions. The complete theory will facilitate the study of combinatorial expressions for generalizations of Littlewood--Richardson coefficients, fusion coefficients, and their q-analogues as well as one-dimensional sums, using algebras motivated by geometry and physics and relations to Macdonald theory, Demazure crystals, and Kirillov--Reshetikhin crystals. In addition, the PI and her collaborators have recently successfully developed a theory of Markov chains governed by R-trivial monoids. This has led to an abundance of new conjectures about eigenvalues, multiplicities, and mixing times as well as new Markov chains (for example, on linear extensions of posets) that will also be studied further."

This is the twenty-eighth in a sequence of annual conferences that bring together students and researchers from across the Southeastern region to discuss the latest progress in discrete mathematics and computer science.  Four featured speakers of international standing will give one hour plenary presentations covering significant advances in discrete mathematics. Estimated attendance is around 100 participants; about forty contributed talks of length 20--25 minutes are planned.  The Cumberland Conference series features talks by leading experts, promotes applications of discrete mathematics (particularly in computer science), provides settings that are conducive to collaboration, and supports students and groups underrepresented in mathematics. The conference series has developed a unique role as a regional exchange for researchers at all levels, providing an accessible forum for junior faculty and students to present their work.  This award supports the participation of the four principal speakers, of other participants without federal support, and of students and attendees from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Discrete mathematics is a rapidly developing and expanding field of mathematics due to the fact that discrete models are appropriate for a great number of phenomena in communication, network and information science, life sciences, and engineering.  The number of researchers and the number of universities offering courses in discrete mathematics is steadily increasing, and so does number of graduate students and undergraduate research students in this field.  The Cumberland Conference has established a unique role as a regional forum open to a wide group of students and researchers in discrete mathematics and computer science.  This conference plays a significant part in the professional development of graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s, for whom this conference provides an opportunity to present their work, learn of recent advances, form collaborations, and do networking. This year's conference will continue this tradition. Four internationally-known featured speakers will attract a wide audience, while researchers from around the region will present high quality talks. The conference will cover diverse areas in combinatorics, graph theory, and areas overlapping with computer science.  This is the first time that the Cumberland Conference will be hosted in South Carolina. It provides an important opportunity to graduate students in South Carolina and nearby to attend a major conference in discrete mathematics."

Ramsey theory is that part of combinatorics that deals with the question of what sort of homogeneous structures one can expect to find in some one cell of a finite partition of specified sets (or sometimes in any suitably ""large"" subset). For example, the simplest nontrivial instance of the infinite version of Ramsey's theorem says that whenever the two-element subsets of the natural numbers N are finitely colored, there must be some infinite subset of N all of whose two-element subsets are the same color. Ramsey theory has applications in a wide variety of areas of mathematics as well as in theoretical computer science, communications, and information theory. The principal investigator will continue to mentor graduate students in projects on finite Ramsey Theory; this award consists solely of support for graduate students, facilitating the training through research involvement of the next generation of mathematicians.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will continue his research in Ramsey theory, including the interactions between this part of combinatorics and the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification of a discrete semigroup. The principal investigator proved many years ago that whenever N is finitely colored, there must exist in one color an infinite sequence together with all of its finite sums of distinct terms without repetition. The original proof was elementary, but very complicated. Subsequently, other proofs were found that were less complicated. But in 1975, F. Galvin and S. Glazer showed that this ""Finite Sums Theorem"" is a completely trivial consequence of the fact that the Stone-Cech compactification of N can be given an algebraic structure extending ordinary addition which is a compact right topological semigroup, and therefore has idempotents. Sets with the property that they contain all the finite sums from a sequence are called IP sets. By virtue of the connection discovered above, a set is an IP set if and only if it has an idempotent in its closure. Those that have special idempotents which are called minimal in their closure are central sets. These sets have much stronger properties, many of which are consequences of the Central Sets Theorem. But central sets have a very complicated elementary description. Sets that satisfy the conclusion of the Central Sets Theorem are called C sets, and are much easier to describe in an elementary fashion. Investigation of these various algebraically characterized large subsets of N should continue to yield new Ramsey theoretic results."

The questions raised spill over into other areas, such as classical asymptotic enumeration, algebraic topology, and probability proper. One major theme of the project is the effort to understand the ""threshold"" intensities at which various properties of interest appear in (large) discrete random systems. This is a classical area (going back to the beginnings, roughly 60 years ago, of studies of random graphs on the combinatorial side and percolation on the probabilistic); but it is also an area that has seen major progress in recent years, and one that enjoys close ties with several other disciplines, including statistical physics and the theory of computation. Though the questions under study are purely mathematical, work in this subject area has sometimes had quite unforeseen consequences, both in and beyond mathematics. This research project centers on simple and seemingly basic questions with ""pedigrees,"" that is, substantial histories of resisting solution. Attacking such questions is a way of forcing oneself to go beyond existing methods, which often leads to finding and exploiting new connections with other parts of mathematics and related areas. <br/><br/>Several of the main problems under study are concerned with understanding the extent to which various classical facts and theorems remain true in a random setting; for example: (a) When (i.e., for what p = p(n)) is the ""clique complex"" (whose simplices are the vertex sets of the cliques) of the random graph G(n,p) likely to have vanishing k-dimensional homology (e.g., over the integers or the integers mod 2)? (b) When does a random collection F of k-subets of an n-set X have the (""Erdos-Ko-Rado"") property that a largest subcollection not containing two disjoint sets consists of the members of F containing some fixed element of X? In these and other cases, further progress appears to depend on better understanding underlying issues of independent interest. The proposal also suggests some very general possibilities, for example, one on behavior of independent events as a guide to more complicated situations, and another (due to Kalai and the PI) which would in principle determine (up to an unavoidable logarithmic error factor) the threshold for a completely arbitrary increasing property (of subsets of some finite universe; the ""threshold"" being, roughly speaking, where the property goes from unlikely to likely). Though most of the headline problems are of probabilistic-combinatorial origin, there are substantial connections with other areas --- some combinatorial, others, particularly when it comes to methodology, more distant; for instance: (a) the proof of an old conjecture on presence of certain trees in a random graph eventually depended (very much inter alia) on developing precise estimates for a sampling-without-replacement version of classical renewal theory; (b) the currently most promising line of attack on the general threshold conjecture mentioned above is more Fourier-analytic than combinatorial and originates (though much has happened since) in work of the PI and coauthors nearly thirty years ago on a problem from theoretical computer science."

The main focus of the project is to prove that many natural distributions of random variables do not have large mass on a single point.  With this new tool, the investigator hopes to provide answers to long-standing questions such as: In a typical case, how many roots of a polynomial of degree n are real? <br/><br/>The principal investigator aims to develop a theory for the anti-concentration phenomenon.

At its core lie elementary questions that might excite a high school student as much as an expert. For example, imagine that one colors the edges and diagonals of an icosahedron red or blue. Can one always find a triangle whose edges are all red or a triangle whose edges are all blue? While combinatorics has traditionally found applications in computer science, information theory, and mathematical models, this project aims to further investigate its applications to what must be the oldest part of mathematics: number theory. The PI will involve high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in the project. The problems under study are suitable for training in research as they are easily accessible and offer an excellent setting for grasping some of the core techniques used in combinatorics. Parallel to and supported by the research activities of the project, the PI's goal is to write a short book on the application of combinatorics to number theory aimed at undergraduates in mathematics. <br/><br/>Inverse theorems have catalyzed the development of additive combinatorics in recent years. However, some very basic inverse questions remain largely untouched. This project focuses on the study of open questions where combinatorial methods are likely to be of use. Three indicative examples, which are easy to formulate and hence will reach a wide mathematical audience, are: what structural information can be derived for finite sets in a commutative group that have near maximum number of h-fold sums; what can be said about finite sets of integers whose exponential sum has nearly minimum norm; and what can be deduced about the number of distinct differences that are formed from pairs of elements of a finite set, when the number of distinct sums is known? It is hoped that a combination of recent advances in the field and novel ideas will lead to progress. As these questions are representative of the challenges one must overcome in a wider variety of cardinality questions in additive combinatorics. It is hoped that any discoveries will be applied to other contexts as well. The project's methodology has a strong interdisciplinary component, which could unearth new connections between combinatorics and harmonic analysis."

Combinatorial questions arise in many areas of mathematics, and combinatorics has applications that include optimization, computer science, and statistical physics.  The enumerative problems under study in this project are related to parking functions (which originally arose in the study of hash functions in computer science) and the cyclic sieving phenomenon (a concept in enumerative combinatorics that interprets certain polynomial evaluations as counts of fixed points).  The research aims to both prove results in enumerative combinatorics and understand these results in terms of deeper algebraic structures.  This interaction between combinatorics and algebra promises to yield new results in both fields.  The enumerative side of the research is well-suited to broader impacts in the form of graduate and undergraduate research projects.<br/><br/>This project studies problems in algebraic combinatorics.  The first of these is the cyclic sieving phenomenon as it applies to the action of a K-theoretic analog of the promotion operator on a K-generalization of rectangular standard Young tableaux.  The idea is to prove new instances of the (enumerative) cyclic sieving phenomenon related to this action using representation theory.  The second problem concerns a generalization of parking functions attached to the symmetric group to a wider class of ""parking spaces"" attached to a reflection group W.  We study a family of conjectures regarding these objects which would yield uniform proofs of various facts in Coxeter-Catalan theory which are at present only understood in a case-by-case fashion.  The third project studies rational Catalan combinatorics, which is a generalization of classical Catalan combinatorics motivated by the study of rational Cherednik algebras.  We propose to both extend various results from the rich enumerative domain of the classical setting to the rational case and study a genuinely new feature of the rational case that we call ""rational duality."""

More recently, discrete geometry has seen tremendous growth, and numerous unexpected connections to other fields of mathematics are being discovered.  One of the main goals of this project is to further explore these connections, and to apply new tools and techniques to several long-standing open problems.

The PI will continue a sequence of recent works on Ramsey-type problems for hypergraphs defined algebraically, which includes the famous Happy Ending Problem of Erdos and Szekeres, and finding large independent sets in intersection graphs of geometric objects.  Another major goal of this project is to explore various extensions of the Szemeredi-Trotter theorem and its applications to additive number theory.  Specific problems include characterizing dense point-line arrangements and estimating the number of incidences between points and d-dimensional varieties."

The objective of this project is to support the participation of junior US researchers in two workshops organized within this thematic semester:  ""Positive Grassmannians: Applications to integrable systems and super Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes,"" held July 27 - 31, 2015, and ""Module spaces, integrable systems, and topological recursion,"" held January 9 - 13, 2016. <br/><br/>The planned semester at the Centre de Recherches Mathématiques will represent the state of the art in the studies of the Anti-de-Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. A special focus will be those aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence that allow for exact solutions, such as the appearance of integrability in the planar limit of super-Yang-Mills theory, lower dimensional models, higher-spin theories, as well as topological field and topological string theories. The semester will be a unique forum that brings researchers with expertise in the AdS/CFT correspondence together with experts in integrability. This interdisciplinary activity will involve participation of many distinguished mathematicians, physicists, and mathematical physicists. The semester will provide training in these very important domains for a significant number of junior US researchers (postdocs, junior faculty, and graduate students) who participate. <br/><br/>More detailed description of the workshops supported by this award can be found in the webpages: <br/>http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2015/Amplitudes15/index_e.php  http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2016/Moduli16/index_e.php <br/>The description of the entire thematic semester is presented in the webpage: http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/Holography2015/"

Under previous grants, the investigator constructed and studied so-called ""elliptic"" analogues of these functions (a significant generalization that includes most of the generalized hypergeometric functions and generalized Painleve transcendents in the literature), as well as their implications for the more classical special functions.  The current project continues this work, and aims to provide a more solid conceptual framework by relating elliptic special functions to noncommutative algebraic geometry, which is a relatively recent variant of algebraic geometry, one of the fundamental disciplines within mathematics.<br/><br/>This connection is based on a new construction of noncommutative rational surfaces in terms of difference operators on elliptic curves (giving a discrete analogue of D-module theory), giving rise to a (functorial) relation between linear elliptic difference equations and sheaves on the noncommutative surfaces.  The Painleve equations (and generalizations) are most naturally interpreted as flows in moduli spaces of differential equations, so one expects their elliptic analogues to be related to moduli spaces of difference equations, and thus to moduli spaces of sheaves.  In particular, the investigator expects to be able to leverage the existing literature on noncommutative algebraic geometry to understand the structure of such moduli spaces, as well as various natural maps between them (e.g., twisting by line bundles).  In addition, since the new construction of highly-blown-up noncommutative rational surfaces is considerably more concrete than the previously existing constructions, the investigator expects the project to contribute significantly to our understanding of such surfaces in their own right (as well as their derived categories). Finally, several of the difference operators that arise in the construction are univariate analogues of operators that appeared in earlier work of the investigator on elliptic analogues of Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials; this leads to a multivariate analogue of the construction with connections not just to those elliptic analogues but also to certain integrable systems and to an elliptic analogue of the ""double affine Hecke algebras"" of Cherednik."

Combinatorics is the study of discrete, typically finite, mathematical structures.  Such structures arise often in mathematics and the natural and social sciences, leading to various applications.  For example, networks of various types are modeled by combinatorialists as graphs, which are simply collections of points, some pairs of which are considered to be related.  Despite the simplicity of such models, mathematicians have derived many deep and applicable theorems about them.  Perhaps surprisingly, there are close connections between combinatorics and other fields of mathematics in which non-discrete objects are studied, including topology and geometry.  The work of PI Shareshian involves the close study of such connections, with the aim of solving problems about both discrete and non-discrete structures.<br/><br/>PI Shareshian studies connections between combinatorics and other fields of mathematics, including algebra, topology, and geometry.  In joint work with Michelle Wachs, he aims to prove that the graded Frobenius characteristic of a refined version of Stanley's chromatic symmetric function for a unit interval graph is in fact the cohomology of an associated regular semisimple Hessenberg variety, and to use such a result to attack a longstanding conjecture of Stanley and Stembridge about such symmetric functions.  Shareshian studies connections between the structure algebraic objects and the combinatorial structure of lattices naturally associated to such objects.  For example, he aims to provide a result on Lie algebras roughly analogous to his earlier result that a finite group is solvable if and only if the order complex of its subgroup lattice is shellable.<br/><br/>"

In tackling these problems, the PI will use a range of combinatorial methods that have recently led to substantial progress on related problems. Examples include probabilistic methods, density increment arguments, transference arguments, analytic tools, and embedding techniques. The first area in this project concerns Szemerédi's regularity method. Within this area, one of the main goals of the project is to obtain new bounds on the triangle removal lemma and its various extensions and variants. The triangle removal lemma states that any graph with a subcubic number of triangles can be made triangle-free by removing a subquadratic number of edges. Another major goal of the project is to further push the regularity method to sparse graphs and other combinatorial structures, and to obtain new applications. Specific problems include optimizing the pseudorandomness conditions needed to obtain sparse counting lemmas, proving analogous sparse regularity results in other combinatorial structures such as cubes, and providing new applications in number theory and discrete geometry such as extensions of the Green-Tao theorem on long arithmetic progressions in the primes. The second area in this project is estimating Ramsey numbers. The PI will work on proving new bounds for classical (complete) graph and hypergraph Ramsey numbers, and to prove linear bounds for Ramsey numbers of sparse graphs.<br/><br/>This project studies fundamental problems in combinatorics related to the structure of large networks. Examples of large networks include the Internet, Facebook, the brain, imperfect crystals, and designed chips. The structure of these networks can be critical in understanding how the networks function. Previous work has shown that the subjects under study in this project have a wide range of applications. Furthermore, this work has led to the development of powerful methods that have been used in many branches of mathematics and computer science. For example, previous progress on estimating Ramsey numbers led to the development of probabilistic techniques that have had a tremendous influence on computer science, such as in the design of randomized algorithms. It is expected that further work on these problems will lead to new methods and applications."

This workshop will bring together experts from around the world who study three subjects that are not obviously related but have deep connections between them. The organizers aim to foster cross-collaboration among mathematicians, computer scientists and physicists in order to identify common problems, tools and techniques among seemingly disparate applications of mathematics. Experts in algebraic combinatorics apply tools from algebra, graph theory and optimization to study error-correcting codes, spherical codes and highly regular designs for use in statistics and computer science. Quantum information theorists face problems of measuring and (approximately) replicating finite-dimensional quantum systems in their work on quantum algorithms, quantum cryptography and quantum state tomography. Signal processing experts employ compressive sensing to efficiently reconstruct a sparse signal through undersampling in a carefully designed manner. Data scientists now use ideas from compressive sensing for dimension reduction and the efficient handling of very large data sets. The URL for this workshop is http://users.wpi.edu/~martin/MEETINGS/WPILinesWorkshop.html<br/><br/>Beginning with the breakthrough work of Candes, Tao and Donoho in 2004, significant advances have been made over the past decade or so in the reconstruction of sparse signals while sampling below the Nyquist-Shannon limit. Beyond signal processing applications such as MRI, this theory has found new utility in the handling of big data. Matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP) and random projections now enable effective dimension reduction which greatly enhances our ability to make useful inferences from large-scale data sets. Meanwhile, systems of lines play an important role in quantum information theory where mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVMs) promise to provide optimal measurements for finite-dimensional quantum states. Unfortunately, very little is known about how to construct these objects. All of these applications can be couched in the language of algebraic combinatorics where spherical codes and Grassmannian packings naturally arise in the theory of association schemes, in algebraic coding theory and the study of graph eigenvalues. By bringing people together from compressive sensing, quantum information theory, and algebraic combinatorics, this workshop will enable the application of tools and results from each area to the other and help identify the outstanding problems common to all three subdisciplines."

This proposal aims to further develop the toolbox of available approaches, through investigating central problems in extremal combinatorics. Simultaneously, it integrates these research problems and themes into educational and outreach activities that extend from the graduate to the K-12 level, and from coast to coast.  The PI is the national coach of the USA International Mathematical Olympiad team.

This project focuses on topics of extremal nature, which investigate the relationships between useful parameters of discrete systems, and characterizes their extreme values over various families of those systems.  Such problems often have applications in computer science and other areas of mathematics, but are also elegant and interesting in their own right.  The proposed work on Ramsey theory includes specific problems which may lead to the development of new probabilistic approaches, and new connections with the theory around Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma.  The proposed work on Turan theory highlights a particularly natural maximum-degree version of the fundamental Kruskal-Katona theorem, which is surprisingly still open.  In addition, it proposes questions which inspire work on finding Regularity-free approaches, and on analytical and computational methods.

Preeminent among these structures are finite binary sequences (strings of zeroes and ones) that are used in the communications networks, cryptographic systems, remote sensing, acoustic design, and efficient operation of scientific instrumentation.  Other finite structures arising from polynomials, sets, and graphs also find use in a wide variety of technological and scientific endeavors.  To achieve an engineering goal or understand a natural process, one must often find the structures that are extremal (minimal or maximal) with respect to a certain feature.  For example, we might seek a family of binary sequences that resemble each other as little as possible in order avoid mutual interference in a multi-user communications network: this is the problem of low correlation.  The solutions to such extremal problems often involve mathematical objects with a large amount of structure. This research project aims to investigate some problems in extremal combinatorics and the mathematical structures involved in these extremal problems.<br/><br/>The organizing principle of this project is to investigate important problems in pure mathematics involving highly structured discrete objects, many of which are of great interest in science and technology.  For example, the problem of minimizing aperiodic autocorrelation of binary sequences is of vital importance in engineering applications like remote sensing and communication.  Later, physicists noted that the minima describe the ground states of certain systems in statistical physics.  Yet the problem is also related to questions in harmonic analysis raised by Littlewood in 1966 and still actively researched, with recent contributions from the principal investigator that are being further developed.  Problems such as this are rich in connections to other branches of mathematics, because the optimal or best known discrete structures for them often come from fields like number theory, algebra, or geometry.  For example, the sequences with lowest known asymptotic aperiodic autocorrelation derive from the Fekete polynomials in analytic number theory.  The Weil sums studied in this project originate in number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry: they provide a method for counting points on curves over finite fields.  In technology, they determine the nonlinearity of functions used in cryptography, the weight distribution of error-correcting codes, and the cross-correlation properties of linear recursive sequences over finite fields.  New techniques to bound the maximum number of instances of a pattern in a finite set of points in the plane utilize diverse techniques that range from order relations to topological arguments.  The interplay of all these ideas, pure and applied, leads to a mutual enrichment of mathematics, engineering, and science."

Amalgamations, in particular, take a difficult problem with little structure and simplify to a problem that is easier to handle. Coding theory is also connected to graph theory and design theory through mathematical objects like the Fano plane. Coding theory has boundless applications, many of which are related to sending and receiving electronic signals correctly. The interconnectivity of designs, graphs, and codes, strengthens the need to explore these subjects together. Furthermore, growth in the mathematics (and in sciences in general) comes not just from research, but also from outreach and teaching as well.

One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science, deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The specific problems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical physics.  A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant in the study of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid consisting of diatomic molecules---the dimers in the model---along the surface of a crystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two neighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given crystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule. The main issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities that are studied (specifically, the number of different ways the surface of the crystal can be covered by molecules). In some of the instances we encounter, the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities exactly turns out in fact to be more tractable, and allows progress in the asymptotic study.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with the exact and asymptotic enumeration of dimer packings with gaps. More specifically, using work of Fisher and Stephenson as its starting point, it studies how the total number of dimer coverings of the complement of the gaps changes as the gaps are moved around on the lattice graph. The joint correlation of a collection of gaps is a non-negative real number measuring this change, and is the central object of study of this proposal. In earlier work, the proposer proved that the correlation of gaps on the hexagonal lattice is governed, for large separations between the gaps, by a law closely resembling the superposition principle of electrostatics: If each gap is regarded as a point charge of magnitude given by the signed difference between the number of white and black vertices in it (in a fixed white-black coloring of the vertices in which each edge has oppositely colored endpoints), then, for large distances between the gaps, their correlation is proportional to the exponential of the negative of the two-dimensional electrostatic energy of the resulting system of charges. Other previous results concern two naturally defined fields, which the proposer proved approach the electric field in the limit when the lattice spacing approaches zero. In the current project, the proposer presents a program organized in several inter-related groups comprising twenty seven specific problems and conjectures. This program is aimed at developing further the analogy to phenomena from physics (in particular to heat flow in a block of material, which turns out to correspond to the interaction of gaps with boundary) and also understanding the connections with independent combinatorial problems, such as conjectures on tiling enumeration of new regions and generalizations of classical results on plane partitions."

This project concerns the application of algebraic combinatorics, in particular its subfield the theory of symmetric functions, to solve such problems. <br/><br/>This project is centered around the tools used, namely, the theory of symmetric functions and the associated combinatorics. Various complexity problems in representation theory concern the computation of certain structure constants and multiplicities that are expressible via the Kronecker and plethystic coefficients of the symmetric group, which can be defined using Schur functions. In statistical mechanics, the partition functions of some integrable lattice models like lozenge tilings are often Lie group characters, and their asymptotic study reveals probabilistic behavior like Gaussian unitary ensemble eigenvalue distribution near the boundary or the existence of limit shapes and surfaces. This project aims to expand these applications to study other models and distributions. Studying combinatorial and algebraic properties of Schubert polynomials, as representatives of the cohomology classes of flag varieties, can lead to combinatorial interpretations for the corresponding structure constants. Further, computational properties of their stable versions, the Stanley symmetric functions, could lead to understanding of the mysterious limit behavior of random sorting networks, corresponding to the reduced decompositions of permutations into adjacent transpositions."

The PI aims to resolve some of these questions by (1) using computer simulation to identify new phenomena and (2) applying tools from analysis, combinatorics, and probability to rigorously understand the new phenomena.<br/><br/>The models alluded to above share a common theme; each is a diffusion processes on the integer lattice whose scaling limit can be interpreted as the solution of a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE).  The PI is primarily interested in three models: the Abelian sandpile, random walks in random environments, and first passage percolation.  The PI will study the interplay between the asymptotic statistics of the diffusion process and the regularity properties of the solutions of the limiting PDE.  Since the two sides here are tightly coupled, it is often possible and fruitful to transfer results between them.  The strategy will be to carefully adapt the regularity machinery of the limiting PDE to the discrete setting, since this occasionally leads to the discovery of new phenomena."

The study of random structures and randomized algorithms has gained particular importance in recent years since they have proved to be useful tools in dealing with the many large real world networks that have emerged and are being actively investigated.  Developing new techniques to study these complex systems is a major task that will likely continue for many years, and the theory of sparse combinatorial structures may form a theoretical foundation for understanding their large scale behavior.  Various new methods in this theory will be applied in this project.  One direction is to prove analogues of classical theorems in the sparse environment.  Another direction is to apply the methods to various enumeration problems.  At a high level, most of the problems that will be investigated seek to understand the quantitative relationship between the local and global behavior of a large system.  Additionally, the methods are well-applicable in percolation, which is connected to statistical physics.  Much of this work will be done with graduate students, and some of the work may be integrated into courses to help bring students into this exciting area of research.<br/><br/>One of the most important trends in combinatorics over the past twenty years has been the introduction and proof of various random analogues of well-known theorems in extremal graph theory, Ramsey theory, and additive combinatorics. Recently, powerful general transference theorems, which the PI has helped to develop, have been used to attack such questions.  Even though these tools have proved useful in resolving several central conjectures, many of their potential applications have not been fully explored.  For example, these methods seem to be applicable to many enumeration problems.  The investigators will address several problems of this type, and they also expect that this project will lead to new exciting questions and directions.  In particular, the investigators will investigate the following related areas: (i) Extremal questions in sparse structures; (ii) Embedding in subgraphs of sparse random and pseudo-random graphs; (iii) Ramsey-Turan questions; (iv) Applications of flag algebras; and (v) Problems in bootstrap percolation."

Examples of such networks include not only traditional networks like transportation networks and computer networks, but also social networks (like Facebook) and biological neural networks (like human brains). Since graphs are mathematical models of these networks, the study of these large-scale networks demands a better understanding of the behavior of large graphs. The topics under study in this research project are concerned with fundamental properties of large graphs. Results on these questions will have strong impact on many areas of graph theory. In particular, structure results coming out of this project could lead to more efficient algorithms for related problems on large graphs. These algorithms would in turn impact the study of large-scale networks from the real world.<br/><br/>To be precise, the PI will study the following three fundamental problems: <br/><br/>(1) He will characterize graphs that do not contain a large K_{3,n}-minor.

The PI proposes to show that a 6-connected K_{3,n}-free graph must have a small genus or small tree-width.) <br/><br/>(2) He will establish a splitter theorem for large 4-connectd graph. (These types of results are very fundamental and, as useful tools, they will have a very wide range of applications.) <br/><br/>(3) He will characterize Petersen-free graphs that can be drawn on the projective plane. (There are reasons to believe that this class of graphs provide important building blocks for general Petersen-free graphs. A positive result here could shed new light on the general problem of characterizing Petersen-free graphs.)"

The idea is to use these connections to gain deeper insights and solve problems in combinatorics and in the other fields. The discrete configurations that are studied in combinatorics arise in various fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, biology, and engineering; DNA sequences, phylogenetic trees, and communications networks are all examples of discrete configurations. Combinatorial methods are playing an increasing role in these fields.<br/><br/>A common thread running through the various parts of this project is that of palindromicity and unimodality of polynomials. Many important enumerative sequences arising in algebra, combinatorics, and geometry are palindromic and unimodal, but proving unimodality can be quite challenging. Proofs of unimodality appearing in the literature have made striking use of combinatorial, analytic, algebraic, and algebro-geometric techniques. In the PI's current work, unimodality issues have led to the discovery of intriguing connections between certain combinatorial and geometric structures and to the discovery of elegant new q-analogs of classical enumerative formulas. For example, palindromicity and unimodality of a generalized Eulerian polynomial (due to De Mari, Procesi and Shayman) play a role in the PI's and Shareshian's ongoing work on chromatic quasisymmetric functions, which are a refinement of Stanley's chromatic symmetric functions. One aim of this project is to prove a conjecture of the PI and Shareshian on a relationship between the chromatic quasisymmetric functions and Tymoczko's representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of the regular semisimple Hessenberg variety of type A. This could establish, among other things, a longstanding e-positivity conjecture of Stanley and Stembridge for chromatic symmetric functions. A property stronger than palindromicity and unimodality, known as gamma-positivity, is of current interest in combinatorics and discrete geometry, as many important classes of enumerative polynomials are gamma-positive. Part of this project is concerned with a q-analog of gamma-positivity recently studied in joint work with Dilks and Krattenthaler. Another part of the project continues the work of the PI on the interplay between poset topology and enumerative combinatorics. One aim is to prove a conjecture of the PI and her former student Gonzalez D'Leon connecting the topology of certain subposets of the poset of weighted partitions to gamma-positive h-polynomials of graph associahedra."

To ensure the original message is received by the recipient, some overhead is added, resulting in a so-called error-correcting code. There is always a trade-off between the number of errors that can be corrected and the amount of overhead that gets added to the message. This project is concerned with the study of mathematical abstractions of these error-correcting codes. Through these abstractions, called matroids, More will be learned about the optimal tradeoff between error-correcting capacity and overhead. Part of the investigations will use the open-source software SageMath, and it is expected that improvements to that software will be contributed. Graduate student involvement in the research is anticipated. <br/><br/>Not only error-correcting codes, but also constraints in an optimization problem, path systems in a graph, and many other mathematical structures can be modeled by geometric configurations of points, known as matroids. Matroid theory gives a unique perspective on these structures through the introduction of concepts like connectivity and minors, both of which generalize concepts from graph theory. A matroid representation is a collection of vectors capturing the same geometric information as the abstract matroid. Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle have developed a powerful theory regarding the structure of matroids representable over a finite field. The first goal of this project is to study consequences of their result in coding theory, extremal matroid theory, and matroid flow problems. The second goal is to give a characterization of the class of dyadic matroids in terms of minimal obstructions known as excluded minors. Dyadic matroids are representable over both the field with 3 and with 5 elements, and arise, for instance, in the study of bidirected networks. The third goal is to study alternative representations, in particular multilinear and skew-partial field representations, which are useful in the theory of secret sharing, and connectivity related matroids, which arise naturally from the study of matroid structure. Computational science is increasingly used in matroid theory research. Especially the second line of research outlined above will benefit from versatile, reliable software for matroid computation. Recently Pendavingh and Van Zwam developed such software, which is part of the open-source, freely available SageMath software system. A final goal of the project is to improve on this functionality."

Polytopes are ubiquitous in mathematics and play important roles throughout science and engineering.  The simplest n-dimensional polytopes have only n+1 vertices and are called simplices: triangles, tetrahedra, and their higher-dimensional generalizations.  While it is straightforward to determine the volume of a simplex in any dimension, the volume of a general polyhedron in high dimension can be challenging to compute.  One way to calculate volume is to dissect a polytope into simplices. This research project studies dissections, volumes, and integer points of special families of polytopes known as flow and root polytopes.  Flow and root polytopes naturally appear in problems in several areas of mathematics, such as representation theory and algebraic geometry. Results of this project will have impact in these areas of mathematics as well as in scientific and engineering applications.<br/><br/>A number of important conjectures and questions in algebraic combinatorics have flow polytopes and root polytopes at their core. These special polytopes can be systematically dissected into simplices. The project will investigate a conjecture of Haglund about the bigraded Hilbert series of the space of diagonal harmonics that can be stated in terms of a sum of a certain weight function over the integer points of a flow polytope. The research will also study the subword complexes introduced by Knutson and Miller, conceived to illustrate the combinatorics of Schubert polynomials and determinantal ideals, by relating them to root polytopes."

These are generalizations of the group algebra of the symmetric group, the Brauer algebras, braid groups, and Temperley-Lieb algebras, and arise as algebras of operators preserving symmetries in a tensor space. The proposal includes two main projects. (1) The first will unify and expand the theory of affine and degenerate affine Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebras. These algebras arise via the study of knot and link invariants, but also in Schur-Weyl duality with symplectic and orthogonal Lie algebras and quantum groups. For the PI and collaborators, the latter connection has facilitated a completely parallel treatment of the affine and degenerate affine BMW algebras, which has already yielded new findings and simplified previous constructions. The result is a wealth of surprising connections across the literature, including to symmetric functions, central element constructions, and the K-theory and cohomology of orthogonal and symplectic Grassmannians.  (2) The second project will develop the theory of two-boundary centralizer algebras, which were brought to the community?s attention via recent work in loop models and quantum spin chains. By exploring the symplectic symmetry in certain type-A tensor spaces, realizations of the type-C affine Hecke algebras as centralizer algebras may arise. Techniques developed will generalize to two-boundary BMW algebras as the symplectic and orthogonal analog; similarly, two-boundary Hecke-Clifford algebras may be in Schur-Weyl duality with type-Q Lie superalgebras. <br/><br/><br/>The goal of representation theory is to take otherwise intractable algebraic objects, break them into their most basic pieces, and build them back up again, gaining salient information in the process. Combinatorics offers many simple yet remarkably powerful tools for keeping track of those smaller pieces, the reconstructions, and the data gathered. Since the birth of combinatorial representation theory at the turn of the 20th century, we have learned how to harness these tools for use in quantum mechanics, crystallography, molecular biology, voting theory, and many other disciplines. In mathematics, the research proposed by the PI will be of broad interest, including to those studying symmetric functions, Lie theory, quantum groups, braid categories, algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology, mathematical physics, and differential equations."

Hypergeometric functions in several variables share this importance. For instance, polynomial equations of degrees five or higher cannot be solved in terms of radicals, but they can always be solved using multivariate hypergeometric functions, regardless of the degree. Working in several variables, however, presents substantial challenges. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by developing new combinatorial and algebraic techniques. An important attribute of all hypergeometric functions and differential equations is that they depend on parameters; varying the parameters can cause substantial changes, and in most cases, neither these effects nor the mechanisms that control them are completely understood. The specific questions addressed in this project involve the investigation of the parametric behavior of hypergeometric functions and differential equations.<br/><br/>In the late twentieth century, Gelfand, Graev, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky introduced a generalized theory of hypergeometric functions and differential equations based on toric varieties. Powerful algebro-combinatorial tools of independent interest were developed by these authors in the hypergeometric context, which have provided vast and elegant generalizations of some very classical statements about hypergeometric functions in one variable. The goal of this project is to use techniques drawn from polyhedral geometry, commutative algebra, D-module theory and complex analysis to study these hypergeometric functions and differential equations. The development of new tools for this study also motivates and inspires specific projects within combinatorial commutative algebra. Another major theme is to use hypergeometric tools and intuition to obtain results beyond the hypergeometric world."

The conference will showcase the recent advances and achievements related to such problems and it will provide strong momentum and set directions for further research in such diverse areas as amenability, virtual Haken conjecture, CAT(0) cube complexes, random groups and random subgroups, Borel equivalence relations and cost, sofic groups, interval exchange groups, iterated monodromy groups, and many others.

A matrix is a collection of numbers arranged in a square grid.  Matrix mutation takes a matrix and changes it according to certain rules to make a new matrix.  The rules themselves seem strange and counterintuitive, but matrix mutation is happening behind the scenes in many very important mathematical areas, including Teichmüller theory, Poisson geometry, quiver representations, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic combinatorics, and even partial differential equations (in the equations describing shallow water waves).  Matrix mutation appears in certain kinds of algebra (manipulating multivariable functions in a setting called a ""cluster algebra""), combinatorics (modeling cluster algebras by discrete objects) and geometry (measuring distances in two-dimensional spaces).  A key component of this project is to study matrix mutation, with a focus on the ""mutation fan.""  A fan is a way of cutting space into pieces (subject to certain rules).  For example, if we draw three different lines through (0,0) in the xy-plane, they cut space into six pieces, and those pieces define a fan.  If we take two of the pieces that are right next to each other and glue them together to make one piece, the resulting five pieces are a simple example of a mutation fan.  <br/><br/>One part of the project concerns universal geometric coefficients and mutation fans.  Specifically, the goal is to construct the mutation fan for matrices arising from Cartan matrices of affine type and from surfaces, and to construct universal coefficients in those cases. Furthermore, the research will pin down the relationships between mutation fans and other fans, like tropicalized cluster algebras, fans of semi-invariants, and scattering diagrams.  A second part of the project concerns the dominance relation on exchange matrices.  A matrix B dominates a matrix B' if they have the same (weak) sign pattern and each entry of B is weakly larger than the corresponding entry of B'. The goal of this part of the project is to understand a phenomenon observed in many examples, namely (1) that dominance relations among matrices often lead to refinement relations among mutation fans and (2) that there is often an algebraic relationship between the two cluster algebras. The third part of the project concerns cluster algebras and Coxeter-Catalan combinatorics in affine type.  Here the goal is to construct the affine-type analogs of almost-positive root models for cluster algebras, and to relate them to affine doubled Cambrian fans."

The conference will provide opportunities for research faculty and graduate students to learn about the latest developments in these areas, and explore different visions for future work. The list of speakers will include representatives from both the theoretical and applied communities; the interactions with experts from the applied communities will prove particularly beneficial for faculty and graduate students specializing in the area of discrete mathematics, who wish to learn more about the contemporary applications of algebraic combinatorics.<br/><br/>The conference webpage is at www.math.mtu.edu/~tonchev/aca015.htm"

Algebraic geometry is also a tool for applications, since physical objects can be described by polynomial equations, and relations between concepts in science and engineering may be modeled by polynomials. Whatever their source, once polynomials enter the picture, the theoretical base, trove of classical examples, and modern computational tools of algebraic geometry may be brought to bear on the problem at hand. This research project aims to strengthen the role of algebraic geometry as a tool for applications, in two ways. First, a major focus will be on developing the interface between algebraic geometry and applications. Second is work on combinatorial aspects of algebraic geometry, for this develops tools and ideas to better understand objects in algebraic geometry with special structure, and these highly structured objects are those that appear most commonly in the interactions between algebraic geometry and other fields, both within mathematics and in the applied sciences. This project will also involve training of students and postdocs, the investigator's outreach activities at the local level through a mathematics circle, and his continued interaction with mathematics in Nigeria. <br/><br/>Oftentimes, objects from algebraic geometry that arise in other parts of mathematics or science have strong combinatorial structures (e.g., toric varieties or Grassmannians) or else the application demands real solutions. Consequently, the research in areas of combinatorial and real algebraic geometry in this project will serve both to advance our basic understanding of these topics and to help build a foundation for applications. This project involves research in three topics within algebraic geometry: real toric varieties, tropical geometry, and Schubert calculus. In each of these areas the investigator will work with collaborators and students on projects ranging from developing foundations to understanding key examples to work inspired by problems from applications. Of particular note are the goals of developing a rich and robust theory of irrational toric varieties, understanding the geometry and topology of complements of tropical objects, establishing positivity in type C Schubert calculus via a useful theory of shifted dual equivalence, and understanding Galois groups in the Schubert calculus. <br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory and Combinatorics programs."

The PI particularly focuses on developing  novel ways of combining geometric and topological techniques and intuition with combinatorial methods.  In recent years, the PI has become particularly focused on finding  effective ways to study topological-combinatorial structures on spaces of real-valued matrices satisfying naturally arising constraints, for instance matrices in which the determinant as well as all minors are nonnegative.  Such spaces arise both in areas of theoretical mathematics such as representation theory and also in applications areas.  For instance, they play an important role to our understanding of the relationship between current and voltage in electrical networks.  The more theoretical results can sometimes give surprisingly powerful insights into such applications.   The project also includes a study of how configurations of distinct points may move around in space without bumping into each other, taking an abstract, representation theoretic perspective.  The PI will also continue her work in helping develop the STEM pipeline both through the training of graduate students in combinatorics and also through organizing workshops and other activities to help inspire and foster the development of the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The specific projects include: (1) analysis of the homeomorphism type of fibers of maps to totally nonnegative varieties; (2) stability properties for configuration spaces related to the partition lattice via a mixture of poset topology and symmetric function theory; (3) analysis of combinatorial topological structure on   spaces of electrical networks; and (4) development of poset-theoretic approaches to polytope diameter bounds for particularly nice classes of polytopes, motivated by complexity questions from operations research regarding linear programming.  Many of these projects are collaborative.  This work builds upon the PI's past research in topological combinatorics, and particularly in poset topology and in combining ideas of geometric topology with those of combinatorics to study combinatorial topological structure of stratified spaces."

Large networks like the Internet, molecular lattices and social networks (such as Facebook) naturally arise in many different areas of real life. The PI aims to look at these from a new perspective: we consider them as approximations of an infinite object. For molecular lattices this is a very natural approach, but via a recently developed theory of sparse graph convergence we can tackle a much broader class of problems, creating new links between mathematics, statistical physics and computer science.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate two essentially different, but still related topics. The first one is the study of extremal values of algebraic invariants of graphs with a special emphasis on those problems where the conjectured extremal graphs are not finite. Despite the lack of finite extremal solutions, using the recently emerging language of Benjamini--Schramm convergence, one can find and analyze the extremal solutions. This then leads to new asymptotic results on finite graphs. The second topic is the study of certain special infinite graphs and lattices via graph limit theory and analytic and algebraic combinatorics. The general theme is to consider a graph invariant of algebraic nature and analyze its limiting behaviour using analytic tools. Often the invariants come from graph polynomials like the matching, chromatic and independence polynomials and have various ties to statistical mechanics."
