Here, an incidence is a small sub-configuration in which some coincidence occurs (for  example, many points lying on a single line or many lines passing through a single point). Structures that include many incidences are important in many settings such as coding theory, data storage, computational complexity, and pure mathematics.  The study of these structures was accelerated several years ago in work by the PI, who introduced the ''Polynomial Method'' to this area. This method works by modeling a given configuration as a set of solutions to an algebraic equation. This allows one to use tools from algebraic geometry to analyze the underlying incidence structure. Despite its success, several important problems remained largely impervious to the polynomial method. This project is aimed at making progress on problems in which the polynomial method fails (partially or completely) by augmenting or modifying the method or, in some cases, replacing it all together. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The main research objectives of the proposal include (1) extensions of the polynomial method to tackle incidences of high-dimensional flats and the use of these bounds to give new explicit constructions of graphs with pseudo-random properties, (2) extending the polynomial method to problems defined over rings with zero divisors, where the original method fails completely, (3) understanding the Kakeya problem for arithmetic progressions - one of the approaches to the famous Euclidean Kakeya conjecture, and (4) studying ''approximate'' (or noisy) incidence problems over the real numbers by developing robust analogs of the polynomial method. Within these areas, the project focuses on several concrete challenges and open problems, each requiring new techniques that go beyond the polynomial method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A basic question is ""What do the frequencies of these waves tell us about their interference and vice versa?"". The interference of the waves has to do with the magnitude of their superposition, and the concentration of the interference can be made large by choosing the frequencies according to a strict pattern. One of the questions pursued by the PI is the converse: are these patterns necessary to achieve a very concentrated superposition. This is called the Inverse Littlewood Problem. The second question under investigation is an uncertainty principle. Suppose we have two families of waves that can be used to decompose a signal, and these two families are very incompatible. This incompatibility means we expect that a simple wave from one family looks much more complicated as a superposition from the second. A specific instance of this is whether a multiplicative character (a very simple wave in one family) can be decomposed as an additive convolution (a fairly simple superposition in another family). This is called Sarkozy's Problem.<br/><br/>There is a long history of comparing the distribution and arithmetic structure of sequences in number theory. Classically, the connection is observed by way of the Fourier transform. Towards a better understanding of this phenomenon, the PI plans to build upon recent results that relate the dimension of a finite subset of a lattice to estimates on the L^1-norm of its associated Fourier series. This area of investigation began with a conjecture of Littlewood on how small the L^1 -norm of the Fourier transform of a finite set of integers could be. The problem was resolved independently by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s. Recently, questions have turned to classifying the extremizers in this problem, and the PI has recently proved that they must be, in an appropriate sense, low-dimensional. In this project he will develop the method further, by weakening hypotheses and applying these results to problems in arithmetic reliant the L^1 norm. In the finite field setting, the PI and Petridis have made substantial progress on a problem of Sarkozy concerning sumsets and the quadratic residues. They have resolved the conjecture for almost all primes. The PI will develop the ideas further so as to resolve the conjecture in earnest. Beyond this, he will adapt the method to other problems, which in turn will lead to progress on Vinogradov?s conjecture on the least non-residue.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop new ideas and techniques in probabilistic combinatorics by studying concrete questions in the field.

In doing so, the proposed research addresses long-standing open questions in phase transition of dependent random graph processes. The goal of this research is to show that a variety of dependent random graph processes exhibit similar phase transition behavior. Another major thrust of the proposed research is to transfer these new analytical tools from constrained random graph processes to resolve open questions in extremal combinatorics, including Ramsey and Turan type problems. These new mathematical tools can also be used to tackle related problems arising in network science, number theory, computer science, and engineering.

One goal is to establish fundamental phase transition properties such as location/existence of critical points, bounds on the second largest component, and analyticity of scaling limits. A second goal is to justify the universality paradigm, i.e., prove that the phase transition of a range of dependent random graph processes such as the random d-process belong to the same universality class. To this end we will develop a general proof framework which allows us to show, among others, that the largest giant component grows at a linear rate in the supercritical phase. Another goal is to improve/sharpen the analysis of constrained random graph processes such as the H-free process. Here one key ingredient is a more robust analysis framework based on semi-randomization (that works under much weaker technical assumptions), which will allow us to significantly broaden the scope of applications in Ramsey and Turan theory. Each of these goals is related to analytic, combinatorial, and probabilistic properties, and this project focuses on development of new mathematical theory at the intersection of these areas, and will enable us to attack important and challenging questions pertaining to explosive percolation and other well-known and notoriously difficult open problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Graphs are abstract mathematical objects that have been extensively used to model problems in different subjects, such as in network theory, integrated circuit design, and scheduling theory. A general approach for solving problems on complicated graphs is to first decompose the original graph into more tractable pieces, solve the problems on those pieces, and finally construct the answer for the original graph from the answers for those smaller pieces. Different problems require different decomposition techniques and many decomposition theorems have been developed and successfully applied to solve long standing conjectures. However, it is unclear whether those developed decomposition theorems are sufficient to solve other open problems. The purpose of this project is to address this fundamental issue by developing new structure decomposition theorems to enrich the toolkit and applying them and other developed theorems to solve major conjectures in graph theory and theoretical computer science. This project includes many research problems that are suitable for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. Progress made on this project will advance knowledge in mathematics and contribute to education.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to prove new decomposition theorems and apply them to solve open problems in graph theory and computer science. An objective is to prove a global tree-like decomposition theorem for graphs in immersion-closed families and apply it to solve an open problem related to a conjecture of Abu-Khzam, Langston, Lescure and Meyniel on graph coloring. In addition, a recent newly developed notion for layered tree-decomposition will be considered in order to generalize algorithmic results on minor-closed families to strictly wider classes of graphs, such as graphs embeddable in a fixed surface with some crossings allowed. Another objective of this project is to solve a conjecture of Dvorak and Norin on island decomposition which is motivated by a strengthening of a relaxation of Hadwiger?s conjecture on coloring graphs in minor-closed families. The strategy for attacking the above problems is to further investigate the structure of graphs, where new ideas will be involved, and the PI's earlier results and other structure theorems in the literature will be exploited.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recent decade has seen tremendous development in the subject that both established the field as an area in its own right and unveiled its deep connections to numerous branches of pure and applied mathematics. This research project will provide a new combinatorial perspective on a classical family of moduli spaces, namely del Pezzo surfaces. Computational challenges in this direction are its driving force. The primary goal is to deepen understanding of these objects and develop new techniques to analyze such abstract spaces through concrete computations in tropical geometry. New findings will contribute to the rapidly growing open source mathematical software Sage. Several topics investigated in this project witness the interdisciplinary nature of the subject and are suitable for research in collaboration with graduate students.<br/><br/>Tropical geometry provides a framework for solving algebro-geometric problems using concrete combinatorial tools: algebraic varieties are replaced by weighted, balanced polyhedral complexes. These objects preserve just enough data about the original varieties to remain meaningful, while discarding much of their complexity. Their combinatorics depends strongly on the embeddings of our varieties. The objective of this research is to develop effective combinatorial methods to study moduli space of del Pezzo surfaces and related geometric objects from the perspective of degenerations, tropical and nonarchimedean geometry. The project has three components. First, to establish effective methods for constructing faithful tropicalization and characterizing the combinatorics of del Pezzo surfaces and their moduli in low degrees to harness geometric and topological invariants via polyhedral combinatorics. Second, to interpret well-known classical enumerative geometry results on del Pezzo surfaces of low degrees in the tropical setting. Finally, the PI will apply polyhedral techniques to establish new obstructions to lifting curves from the tropical to the algebraic world, addressing ""superabundance"" of tropical curves, and explore questions involving unirationality and transition maps between various known coordinate systems on del Pezzo surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The modern theory of polytopes connects diverse areas of pure mathematics and is used in applied mathematics as well. Polytopes are used to determine solutions of transportation problems, model possible outcomes of elections, and investigate biological phenomena. The special class of lattice polytopes have deep connections with combinatorial enumeration, which is the precise counting of complicated but finite sets. This award will lead to a deeper understanding of lattice polytopes and their relation to enumeration and counting, using tools primarily from number theory and algebra. In addition to expanding basic research in mathematics, this award will broaden and strengthen the mathematical sciences workforce by supporting the training of graduate students in both pure and experimental approaches to mathematics.<br/><br/>This research is focused on two broad goals: (A) prove theoretical results about combinatorial properties of lattice polytopes and (B) generate and analyze data about lattice polytopes resulting from computational experiments. The first project in this proposal focuses on unimodality problems for Ehrhart h-star-polynomials, with particular emphasis on challenging conjectures due to Stanley, Hibi-Ohsugi, and De Loera-Haws-Koeppe. The study of Ehrhart h-star-unimodality has led to a significant increase in our understanding of lattice polytopes, and focusing on these difficult conjectures will lead to further advances. The second project in this proposal involves a comprehensive study of geometric and algebraic aspects of a family of lattice simplices related to weighted projective spaces. By investigating Hilbert bases, Ehrhart h-star-vectors, Poincare series, and geometric h-star-polynomial factorizations for these lattice simplices, a refined understanding of their properties will emerge that can inform our study of lattice simplices in general. The third project focuses on the class of generalized permutahedra and their relationship to Hopf algebras. The combinatorial enumeration of faces of these polytopes is known to be a subtle and interesting problem, and this project will create an extension of traditional face enumeration to refined face enumeration using symmetric functions and combinatorial Hopf algebras for this class of polytopes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of the workshop is to foster the international collaboration of researchers in several areas connected to representation theory and algebraic combinatorics, including Lie superalgebras, quantized enveloping algebras, and algebraic combinatorics. The rationale for this activity is recent advancements that indicate new links between the aforementioned areas, and its goal is to investigate open problems that are spawned by these advancements and examine new strategies for solving them. The workshop will also have a substantial pedagogical component in the form of three mini-courses that will cover background and recent exciting progress in its focus areas.

A natural and important problem that lies at the intersection of the aforementioned areas is to define and investigate the properties of q-deformations of Capelli operators in a uniform way. In addition, for (non-quantized) symmetric spaces of Lie superalgebras that are associated to BC-type root systems, an analogous relation between invariant differential operators and interpolation polynomials is yet to be established.

Such a minimal set of elements is called a cover of the family. Many practical problems can be formulated as questions about covers of families of sets that arise in different contexts (for example, subscribers in a social network, geographical areas, biological cells). An example from public health is: How many medical clinics should be placed in a given state, and where, so that every resident has a clinic within 50 miles of home? Here the sets in question are disks of radius 50 miles centered at every household, and clinics are to be placed in every point of a cover.  As apparent from this example, the questions studied in matching theory can be basic and intuitive, easily formulated, and are combinatorial, or discrete, in flavor. Nevertheless, they are often notoriously difficult to answer and require sophisticated tools from different areas of mathematics (such as algebra, probability, and topology) for their solution. This project focuses on developing improved methods (primarily topological ones) to approach several fundamental open problems in matching theory. As the methods developed come from other areas of mathematics, this project also contributes to building bridges between different branches of mathematics, making problems in one branch amenable to the tools of another. The project involves a graduate student in the research.<br/> <br/>This project studies matching theory in abstract finite hypergraphs, as well as hypergraphs arising from geometrical structures, whose edges are (generally, infinite) sets in a Euclidean space. Two intriguing longstanding conjectures on abstract hypergraphs motivate this project: one (Gyrfs-Lehel) concerns covers of hypergraphs consisting of cross-intersecting families of sets, and the other (Tuza) deals with covers of hypergraphs of triangles in graphs. Both conjectures received considerable attention over the years, mostly using elementary approaches, which now seem insufficient for their solution. One goal of this project is to develop new tools from other areas of mathematics for tackling these conjectures and related problems. Hypergraphs arising from geometrical structures are of special interest to researchers, as they appear in many different practical applications; consequently, questions in matching theory of geometrical hypergraphs have been widely studied (under different names) for decades. Within this direction, the project focuses on a conjecture of Wegner on covers of families of axis-parallel rectangles in the plane (and families of axis-parallel boxes in higher dimensions). The second main goal of this project is to develop a topological method in higher dimensions for the resolution of Wegner?s conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It deals with them from an aesthetic and a computational angle. In many cases the objects are networks and the project aims to learn the typical values of various associated parameters. One particular example of this concerns the length of the largest cycle in a randomly chosen graph. One question the PI hopes to resolve is the following: suppose we only sample from networks where each vertex is incident with at least three edges. How many random edges are needed so that with high probability there is a cycle that goes through each vertex once and only once i.e. a Hamilton cycle. As a typical example of a computational problem consider the following: the edges of a network are given random weights and one wishes to find a minimum weight spanning tree i.e. a set of edges that connects the vertices of the network. Suppose that in addition, the edges have random costs and there is a budget for the tree that cannot be exceeded. The PI provides an algorithm for this problem that with high probability finds a near optimal solution very quickly. The PI notes that with an infinite budget, the problem is easily solved, but for a finite budget, the problem is hard in the worst-case. In addition this project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project deals with structural and algorithmic questions associated with random graphs, hypergraphs and matrices over a finite field.

Using these objects as building blocks and gluing them face-to-face, one may construct more involved objects known as polytopal complexes. For instance, any object obtained by gluing triangles, pyramids, and their higher-dimensional analogs is known as a simplicial complex, while an object obtained by gluing cubes of various dimensions is known as a cubical complex. The reason to study polytopes and polytopal complexes is explained by the fact that many continuous objects can be approximated by these more discrete structures. These objects also often show up in problems related to optimization, statistics, and engineering. For instance, the space of motions of a robot sometimes can be described by a cubical or simplicial complex. Simplicial complexes are also useful in describing patterns of intersections of convex sets, which, in turn, has applications in such subjects as neuro-biology (e.g., in the study of neurons which are simultaneously active in response to some stimulus). This research project aims to deepen understanding of various aspects of simplicial complexes. The award provides support of research training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The research project aims to attack several fundamental questions related to (1) studying the face numbers of centrally symmetric simplicial polytopes and spheres (2) extending the results on the face numbers and Stanley--Reisner rings of triangulations of manifolds to the setting of pseudomanifolds, and (3) exploring the effect of various topological invariants (beyond the usual Betti numbers) on the face numbers of manifolds and pseudomanifolds. For instance, while (as of a few months ago), the upper bound problem for centrally symmetric simplicial spheres is now completely resolved, there is not even a plausible upper bound conjecture for centrally symmetric polytopes; while we understand reasonably well the face-vectors of simplicial manifolds with and without boundary, very little is known about face-vectors of triangulations of spaces with singularities. While Betti numbers play a prominent role in the study of face-vectors, our knowledge on how other topological invariants (e.g., the fundamental group, characteristic classes, etc.) affect the face-vectors is next to nothing. The aim of this project is to attack these and related problems and in the process develop the necessary new combinatorial, geometric, and algebraic tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is now one of the most central areas in modern combinatorics. The subject was founded by Frank Ramsey in 1930 while studying the decidability of logical systems and his foundational result is now known as Ramsey?s theorem.  His theorem was rediscovered in 1935 by Paul Erdos and George Szekeres while studying a seemingly unrelated geometric question. Given these diverse origins, it is not surprising that Ramsey?s theorem has had a wide range of applications in other areas of mathematics including logic, geometry, number theory, and theoretical computer science.<br/><br/>The goal of this focused research group is to obtain new bounds for classical Ramsey numbers. The group will use a wide range of tools and techniques in the area including the probabilistic method, the stepping-up lemma, and the theory of pseudorandom graphs.  Very recently, Mubayi and Verstraete established a surprising connection between the Ramsey numbers and pseudorandom graphs based on the work of Alon and Rodl, thus moving the emphasis of the field from random graphs to pseudorandom graphs. Moreover, substantial progress has recently been made on hypergraph Ramsey numbers, where we now know the tower growth rate for many of these numbers.  It is expected that further work on these problems will lead to new methods and applications as well.

This project applies the tools of algebraic combinatorics to study solutions of complicated systems of equations, called algebraic varieties.

The PI has long been interested in work that cuts across mathematical boundaries.  He has had success both in applying ideas from other mathematical disciplines (algebra, geometry, topology, probability, Fourier analysis, information theory) to settle well-known combinatorial problems, and, on the other hand, in bringing combinatorial ideas to bear on problems from other areas (e.g. geometry, computer science, probability, statistical mechanics).  He has---as in this project---most often been interested in simple but seemingly basic questions with histories of resisting solution, motivated especially by the idea that tackling such questions necessarily forces one to go beyond existing methods. In addition the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project treats combinatorial topics representing some of the PI's main current interests, most with some probabilistic aspect.  A common setting is the collection of subsets of a finite set, or (the same object viewed differently) the ""Hamming cube"" of binary strings of a given length.  The more probabilistic questions are largely concerned with thresholds and/or dependence among events; the less probabilistic ones belong to ""extremal"" combinatorics.  All involve notions that have been at the hearts of their respective areas for decades.  For example, thresholds---roughly, the intensities at which various phenomena first appear in a random system---have been central to probabilistic combinatorics and related parts of statistical physics since about 1960, and the PI's most consistent focus in recent years.  Intersection properties of set systems and isoperimetric problems (these are among the less probabilistic topics) are of similar vintage and centrality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Or, what is the maximum number of lines through the origin pairwise separated by the same angle? In contrast to the simple appearances of these problems, many of these problems, including the ones considered in this project, remain unsolved for an extended period or have been partly solved only recently following great efforts. This project aims to further develop the toolbox of available approaches, most of which are analytic or algebraic in nature. Simultaneously, the project integrates these research problems and themes into educational and outreach activities that extend from the high school level to the graduate.<br/><br/>The first topic of this project concerns extensions and variations of Tarski's plank problem: How to efficiently cover a convex body in the plane using planks? Generalizations of Tarski?s plank problem are central to geometric analysis and convex geometry, and continue to generate interest in the geometric and analytic aspects of coverings of a convex body. The second topic concerns equiangular lines ?- a collection of lines through the origin pairwise separated by the same angle. Investigation of the equiangular lines problem turns out to be fruitful and unearthed many challenging problems in algebraic graph theory. Solutions to some problems have practical consequences in Operational Research, Quantum Computation and Communication Theory.

The study of hyperbolic polynomials originated in the context of partial differential equations in the 1950's and has been used to understand problems in convex optimization, operator theory, and combinatorics. There are still many important open questions about such polynomials, and because of their prevalence and concrete nature, structural results often have far-ranging applications.

This area is rapidly developing and has close connections to many other areas of mathematics, as well as to theoretical computer science. This research project aims to make progress on questions in extremal combinatorics using methods from algebra and probability theory. The research focuses on some longstanding open questions and conjectures, as well as several related problems. The work will lead to the development of new mathematical tools and techniques and push the limits of known methods. Moreover, through her teaching and mentoring, the investigator strives to encourage students to learn about mathematics and to pursue careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The questions studied in this project fall into two rough topic areas. The first of these areas is centered around the slice rank polynomial method that was introduced in 2016. This method has led to several spectacular results in additive combinatorics, but many related questions remain open. The investigator intends to study specific problems exemplifying the current limitations of the slice rank polynomial method. One aim of this project is to find ways to make the method more flexible and more widely applicable. The second topic area of the project concerns the inducibility problem, which was posed over forty years ago and is still wide open. Given a fixed graph H, and a large integer n, this problem asks about the maximum number of induced copies of H that an n-vertex graph can contain. A major open question in this area is the case where the graph H is a path or a cycle. Using probabilistic techniques, the PI plans to investigate this question as well as other inducibility-type problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chip-firing games, which are based on redistributing items throughout a network or graph, have appeared in a wide variety of mathematical and computational areas over the past three decades.  They originated in dynamical systems as part of the abelian sandpile model, the first known example of a system to display an important property known as self-organized criticality. A more recent perspective has treated chip-firing games on graphs as a discrete, combinatorial tool for studying algebraic curves. This has led to a deeper understanding of the connections between the mathematical fields of graph theory and algebraic geometry.  A key concept in this framework is the divisorial gonality of a network, which measures how difficult certain chip-firing games are to win on that network; this number has already been connected to key invariants from graph theory, such as treewidth. This project will deepen understanding of chip-firing games from a computational perspective, first designing and then implementing efficient algorithms for studying these games and their difficulty. Once implemented, these tools will be used for research in such disparate fields as algebraic geometry, graph theory, and dynamical systems, as well as in classrooms as pedagogical tools. In addition to these mathematical applications, the chip-firing problems that are known to be computationally difficult will serve as a good benchmark for computational methods and techniques. This project involves undergraduate students in the research, providing those students with key skills for future careers in both pure and applied areas of STEM.<br/><br/>The project will consider several versions of gonality, on both finite and metric graphs: divisorial gonality, the minimum degree of a positive rank divisor on a graph; geometric gonality, defined in terms of harmonic morphisms to a tree; stable divisorial gonality, which allows for refinements before computing the divisorial gonality; and higher gonalities, which ask for the minimum degree of a divisor with prescribed rank. Although purely combinatorial in nature, these topics connect deeply to such areas of algebraic geometry as tropical geometry, Berkovich theory, and Brill-Noether theory. There are three main components of the overarching project: (1) To study the theoretical aspects of computing graph gonality and related topics vis-a-vis computational complexity.  This includes studying the computational complexity of bounding the different versions of gonality, both in general and for special classes of graphs; designing algorithms for computing gonalities; and studying questions with important computational consequences, like finding upper and lower bounds on gonalities. Key tools here will be modifications of such existing algorithms as Dhar's burning algorithm. (2) To implement computational tools for studying chip-firing games on graphs. This will include tools for both combinatorial and metric graphs, which will also be made freely available to both researchers and teachers. (3) To apply these tools to study chip-firing games, graph theory, and algebraic geometry.  Such projects include studying gonality of random graphs, investigating long-standing conjectures on graph gonalities, performing computations relevant to algebraic curves, and investigating embedded aspects of tropical geometry.  In some cases, the computations themselves will be of paramount importance; in other cases, they will simply guide the direction of research in fruitful directions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research also has many applications: the key object of this work, the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), has been studied as a model for traffic flow, as well as in biological processes such as translation in protein synthesis and kinetic biopolymerization. In the longer term, the proposed project has the potential to have an important impact on these applications. Some of the topics of the proposed project are accessible to younger researchers, with several projects intended for work with students. Workshop organization, outreach, and activities aimed at improving climate in STEM are also planned. This project is jointly funded by the Combinatorics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/><br/>The principal goal of this project is to study the remarkable connection between particle models such as ASEP and orthogonal polynomials. The first part of this work concerns Macdonald polynomials of type A as an application of the combinatorics of the ASEP on a circle, through recently discovered formulas that use multiline queues to connect probabilities of the ASEP to symmetric and nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials. It is proposed to use those new formulas to explore Schur positivity of modified Macdonald polynomials: one line of attack is to study the quasisymmetric Macdonald polynomial. The second part of this project concerns the extension of the results obtained for Macdonald polynomials of type A to the type BC setting to discover formulas both for Koornwinder polynomials and probabilities of the multispecies ASEP with open boundaries. Thus far such formulas exist only for the two-species ASEP case corresponding to a special case of Koornwinder polynomials, studied in earlier works. It is proposed to merge those results with the multiline queue approach to find a new object that incorporates boundary conditions and admits any number of species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
