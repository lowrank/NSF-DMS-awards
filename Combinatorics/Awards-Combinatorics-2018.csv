Questions about the local/global relationships in large structures impact several areas of mathematics (number theory, combinatorics, logic) as well as other fields like information theory, coding theory, theoretical computer science, and the social sciences. The study of these objects has gained particular importance in recent years due to the many large real world networks that have emerged and are being studied.  Developing new techniques to study these complex systems will be a major task for future researchers and the PI plans to contribute to this through his theoretical work.<br/><br/>The PI will focus on two particular areas: Ramsey theory and Extremal problems for hypergraphs. Within Ramsey theory, he plans to work on fundamental problems in the area posed by Erdos, Hajnal, and Rado starting the 1950's about the tower growth rate of classical hypergraph Ramsey numbers. Several other related problems posed by Erdos-Gyarfas-Shelah,  Erdos-Rogers, and Erdos-Hajnal will also be explored. His planned projects in extremal hypergraph theory include the following: solving  an old conjecture of Kalai on the extremal number of hypergraph trees that generalizes the well-known Erdos-Sos conjecture for graphs; studying the relationship between problems in convex geometry and abstract extremal hypergraph problems; developing an approach towards improving the longstanding bound of Kostochka on the sunflower problem; improving the known supersaturation results for cycles in linear hypergraphs, which has applications to a problem in additive number theory studied by Bourgain and Katz-Tao; and studying a question posed in various forms by Razborov and Lovasz-Szegedy about whether a large class of  problems in extremal combinatorics can be solved using methods stemming from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hence a better understanding of cluster algebras is not only interesting in its own right, but also has significant potential application in other areas of mathematics and beyond. The project will provide training for students through involvement in the research.  <br/><br/>Rigid modules, invariant curves, and knots are fundamental objects in many branches of mathematics. This project takes a cluster-algebraic approach to studying these objects. The research goal, largely motivated by homological mirror symmetry, is to study invariants for indecomposable modules over hereditary algebras, for quiver Grassmannians, and for alternating knots. The project aims to develop new combinatorial and geometric objects to reveal more concrete relationships between cluster algebras and other areas of mathematics. The educational goal of this project is to train undergraduate and graduate students in topics at the intersection of algebra, combinatorics, geometry, topology, and representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team, consisting of the Principal Investigator (PI) and a PhD student will study association schemes and configurations in real and complex space.  The project is motivated by applications in the theory of error-correcting codes, cryptography, quantum information theory, knot theory, extremal networks, finite geometry and spherical and projective codes. Association schemes and related tools play a fundamental role in these and other areas, for example guiding us to the best known efficiency bounds for binary error-correcting block codes used in most digital communications devices. As digital technologies grow in scale and complexity, we see increasing need for algebraic tools of this sort that extract important structural information efficiently from data. The project's broader impacts include training of highly qualified personnel and outreach to students and teachers in local schools.<br/><br/>Progress on association schemes over the past 50 years has been phenomenal, and the variety of new applications that the theory handles has increased with each passing decade. Yet some fundamental problems, regarding cometric association schemes for example, remain unresolved with few new ideas emerging until recently. This project explores powerful mathematical tools, ranging from algebraic geometry to algebraic topology, to forge a stronger and more versatile theory of association schemes that will be equipped to attack existing open questions - both theoretical and applied - as well as future challenges that are likely to be framed in this general combinatorial language. Specific problems to be attacked include: efficient description of the ideal of polynomials vanishing on the set of columns of the first primitive idempotent of a cometric scheme; constructions (via finite geometry and design theory) and bounds for systems of lines with few angles; bounds on efficiency parameters of association schemes and codes; determining the structure of additive completely regular error-correcting codes.

Graph theory concerns mathematical techniques for analyzing abstract networks, especially very large networks that are relevant for applications in computer science. Additive combinatorics concerns structures in sets of numbers, such as the prime numbers. Previous foundational work, including some done by the PI, has shown that tools and insights from one of these areas can be helpful in solving problems in the other. The PI will continue to prove results that further build the connections between these two subjects.<br/>  <br/>The first topic of this project concerns extensions and variations of Szemerédi's theorem. Szemerédi's theorem is a cornerstone result in combinatorics, stating that subsets of integers with positive density must contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Developments around Szemerédi's theorem have led to important and powerful tools in graph theory such as Szemerédi's regularity lemma, as well as concepts in additive combinatorics such as Gowers uniformity norms and higher order Fourier analysis. A major goal of this project is to extend Szemerédi's theorem, including understanding polynomial and multidimensional generalizations, popular differences, and variants inside other settings such as permutations.

The topic of the conference has its origins in 19th century enumerative geometry, when mathematicians computed numbers of geometric figures satisfying various conditions.  The subject grew into a testing ground for Intersection Theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern mathematics.  This workshop will bring together researchers and students coming from different backgrounds, to present various points of view on the subject of Schubert Calculus.<br/><br/>A large part of Schubert Calculus concerns the cohomology rings of Grassmannians and flag manifolds, as well as their generalizations. The subject has deep connections to combinatorics, representation theory, and algebraic geometry, and the last 15 years have seen remarkable developments in the techniques of Schubert Calculus.  A guiding problem is to find combinatorial formulas for the multiplication of Schubert classes in flag varieties; several new cases of this problem were solved.  New research has extended our understanding of Schubert calculus to the infinite-dimensional affine (and Kac-Moody) flag varieties, simultaneously deepening the connection with representation theory.  Major goals of this conference include sharing new results and introducing a new generation of students to the techniques, applications, and open problems in the field.

Second, it trains the next generation of students for careers in mathematics, sciences, and engineering, focusing on solid foundations in discrete mathematics, and developing mathematical skills for handling geometric objects efficiently. Visualizing complex systems and large data sets has become routine, including user-friendly handling of virtual objects in low dimensions. Designing efficient computer tools in this context is a challenging task, it calls for a thorough understanding of how geometric objects and relations between them are represented, as well as highly qualified developers and scientists who are familiar with the capabilities and limitations of these mathematical tools.<br/><br/>Representing graphs in space is constrained by topological, metric, and algebraic properties. Topological constraints are typically captured by unavoidable patterns in the intersection graph of curves or surfaces, and is closely related to Ramsey-type results in combinatorial geometry. Metric constraints correspond to patterns in distances, slopes, angles, and areas that can be realized simultaneously. Algebraic constraints play an important role when edges are represented by algebraic curves (including straight lines). This project will study the intersection patterns of geometric objects, where the intersection relation is represented by an undirected graph, and it will also examine the intersections created by embeddings of geometric graphs, topological graphs, hypergraphs, or simplicial complexes into Euclidean spaces of low dimensions. Related enumerative problems will be considered, as well, where metric and topological constraints combined with classical combinatorial problems yield new challenges. Quantitative bounds for the realization spaces of basic geometric objects (such as points, line segments, lines, and quadrics) have applications in cartography, computer science, optimization, and solid modelling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another application of probabilistic reasoning in discrete mathematics is based on the fact that one can decompose deterministic objects into pieces that share many properties with randomly generated objects.

Broadly, it describes profound interactions between algebraic combinatorics, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, representation theory, and theoretical physics because these subjects are wedded to the study of symmetries in nature and mathematics. The phrase therefore also encompasses ties to probability and semigroup theory through representation theory.

This project addresses substructures with respect to three closely related graph containment relations: minors, topological minors, and immersions. Problems related to these containment relations have been proposed since more than 70 years ago. Great successes about graph minors were obtained during recent decades and led to numerous applications to disciplines other than combinatorics, such as theoretical computer science, electrical engineering and biology. However, several problems about graph minors and their strengthening or variations with respect to topological minors and immersions remain unsolved. This project addresses major conjectures in this area. Positive solutions will lead to immediate applications in theoretical computer science and optimization. More potential applications are expected based on fruitful applications of earlier work about graph minors. This project includes plenty of research problems that are suitable for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Topics addressed in this project including graph coloring, Erdos-Posa property, well-quasi-ordering and general structural properties. One objective of this project is to solve or at least make significant progress on a group of questions about variations or relaxations of Hadwiger's conjecture on coloring graphs with no large clique minor, topological minor or immersion. Another objective is to prove a relationship between the maximum size of half-integral packing of topological minors and the minimum size of hitting sets, which is a strengthening of Thomas' conjecture on half-integral packing minors. Furthermore, Nash-Williams' conjecture on well-quasi-ordering graphs by the strong immersion relation will be considered. The strategies for attacking these conjectures are proving new structure theorems for excluding a fixed graph with respect to these three containment relations and exploiting tools that were developed in the PI's earlier work and in the literature for solving problems about graph minors."

Prior work established exactly this for a different kind of graph containment, namely graph minors, and this result has been of great interest and has had very many applications. This project seeks analogous results for induced subgraphs. <br/><br/>The project investigates two such connections: the Gyarfas-Sumner conjecture, that for any tree and any complete graph, all graphs that contain neither of them can be vertex-partitioned into a small number of parts each containing no edge; and the Liebenau-Pilipczuk conjecture, that for any tree, all graphs not containing it or its complement admit two disjoint linear sets of vertices, either completely joined or with no edges between them. In both cases, ""tree"" cannot be replaced by any more general kind of graph. The first conjecture is one of several problems about so-called ""chi-boundedness;"" the Gyarfas-Sumner conjecture is the main chi-boundedness conjecture that is not yet resolved. The second conjecture grew from attempts to resolve the Erdos-Hajnal conjecture. The latter asserts that for any graph, all graphs not containing it have a clique or stable set of polynomial size, unlike general graphs, in which the largest clique or stable set might only have logarithmic size.  It is planned to investigate several conjectures of the form that for any graph, all graphs not containing this fixed graph or its complement have two large sets of vertices, either completely joined or joined by no edges (not sets of linear size, just of polynomial size).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematical theory behind such questions is at the foundation of many areas of mathematics, including combinatorial number theory and geometry. Applications are found in diverse areas of science, including theoretical computer science, coding and cryptography, algorithmic complexity, as well as other areas of mathematics. Extremal structures are particularly valuable in the construction of error-correcting codes.

The project includes training of graduate students through their involvement in the research.<br/><br/>This project concerns research in combinatorics, focusing on Turan-type extremal problems and applications. By exploring the connection between pure Turan-type problems and other areas of mathematics, the project aims for new insights to solve some important open problems. Such connections have resulted in recent success, such as the polynomial method for breakthroughs on the mathematical cap set problem, a Turan-type problem closely related to the complexity of multiplication of two square matrices, which is at the heart of many practical applications. In this project, some new approaches are explored, whereby we embed a Turan type problem in a geometric setting, and then use the imposed geometry to obtain information regarding the original problem.

The large volume of data generated today motivates the need for distributed storage systems which can provide long-term storage of data with highly reliable retrieval and availability of information to users. A distributed storage system consists of a network of storage nodes. A stored file may be retrieved by accessing these nodes. In such a system, individual nodes may be unreliable; for instance, they may become unavailable due to routine maintenance. For this reason, how information is stored across the network is highly relevant. The goal is to create a storage system that allows for recovery of lost data while limiting both network traffic and the number of disks accessed. This project addresses the problem by appealing to the underlying structure of a family of error-correcting codes defined using algebraic geometry. The codes have robust structure that yields powerful local properties and potential to balance storage overhead, reliability, network traffic, and repair bandwidth.  <br/> <br/>This project considers the use of codes obtained via algebraic geometric constructions in highly relevant applications. The following problems will be studied: coding for distributed storage via algebraic geometric and combinatorial points of view, with the goals of minimizing node access and repair bandwidth; and explicit construction of locally correctable codes, quantum codes, and secret sharing schemes using algebraic geometric tools. Code structure will be explored, and decoding codes which are directs sum may be handled by decoding or repair within its factors. Full use will be made of the automorphism group of the code as well as natural nested structures inherited from the underlying algebraic geometry. Much of the work in this proposal is focused on algebraic geometric constructions utilized in situations where limiting network traffic in the decoding process is desirable; the aim is to accomplish this by capitalizing on the natural underlying structure of algebraic geometric codes rather than appealing exclusively to locality. In doing so, the performance guaranteed by the code construction is maintained (meaning code parameters do not suffer from local requirements) while making the codes more amenable to current applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying the symmetries of a model is often more fruitful than studying the model directly, and representation theory has found many applications in physics and chemistry as well as in other mathematical fields. The cluster algebras provide a mathematical framework for fundamental patterns which occur throughout representation theory. Surprisingly, these patterns are also observed in various other branches of science which, a priori, are not related to representation theory. This project will provide new directions of research in an already highly active research area. The investigator will establish and develop relations between cluster  algebras and other areas of mathematics. These new connections allow explicit computational results as well as structural development. The project contains the instigation of new ideas as well as the investigation of longstanding open questions.<br/><br/>The project focuses on cluster algebras and  their relation to combinatorics, knot theory, number theory and  representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras. The investigator will pursue several investigations. He will apply his recent discovery of a relation between cluster algebras and continued fractions to study classical problems in number theory from a new point of view and to apply the machinery of continued fractions to develop new tools in cluster algebras. He will also establish and develop a new connection between cluster algebras and knot theory providing explicit combinatorial formulas for Jones polynomials and other knot invariants.

The principal investigator recently made a breakthrough by using probabilistic techniques to solve a famous problem of Paul Erdos in combinatorial number theory, and part of the investigation will develop applications of this result.  The problems studied have applications to cryptography and quantum computation.  Funding is to be used to support the research of a group of undergraduate and graduate students and to support outreach efforts aimed at high school and undergraduate students interested in problem solving and beginning research.<br/><br/>The project includes problems on automorphic forms, sieve methods, and the analysis of random walks on groups.  The  projects are split between topics in pure analytic number theory, such as the use of automorphic forms to study the lattice shape of the ring of integers of number fields, projects which use techniques common in analytic number theory, like the theory of exponential sums and oscillatory integrals, to study the asymptotic mixing of Markov chains and other limit problems in probability, and projects which use more purely probabilistic techniques.  A significant part of the project extends the theory of zeta functions of prehomogeneous vector spaces in studying low degree number fields.

Conjectures that relate such a broad range of topics are often especially compelling to mathematicians, and can lead to particularly powerful results. To give one example, mathematicians often find it useful to ""count points"" on spaces that parametrize mathematical objects. So-called HLV conjectures mentioned below predict not only a formula for doing this for certain spaces commonly called ""character varieties,"" but also generalize them in a way that is connected to their topology. Other conjectures in this family connect closely related spaces with some extremely compelling formulas involving diagrams, called parking functions, that are elementary to test by hand. While this project is based on algebraic methods, a full mathematical understanding of this topic is expected to reveal the geometry behind many deep open problems, some of which have roots in physics. The investigator also plans to involve undergraduate and graduate researchers in the project. This activity will focus on combinatorial methods that require minimal student prerequisites, and on the creation of algebra software for conducting computational experiments, an especially effective approach for student researchers unfamiliar with these topics. The development of general computer software is another impact of this project, which is expected to be useful to researchers in computational fields.<br/><br/>Some of the topics this project examines are the cohomology of the affine Springer fiber, Khovanov-Rozanksy knot invariants, some famous conjectures of Hausel, Letellier, and Rodriguez-Villegas (HLV), conjectures relating four-dimensional gauge theory to conformal theory due to Alday, Gaiotto, and Tachikawa (AGT), and related combinatorial extensions of the proof of the shuffle conjecture, such as the nabla-positivity conjecture. On one side of these conjectures, nearly all these topics have in common (conjectured) relationships with sheaves on the Hilbert scheme of points in the complex plane. On the other side, they are connected by the presence of a Riemann surface whose significance is hidden on the Hilbert scheme side, except through formulas. For instance, this Riemann surface would be the punctured disc C^* in the example of the Springer fiber, the punctured surface of genus g defining the character variety in the case of the HLV conjectures, or the two-dimensional surface on which the conformal field theory takes place in the case of AGT. The goal of this project is to make progress towards mathematical proofs of these conjectures, discover new ones, and ultimately understand the general mathematical picture. A major aspect of the approach is to extrapolate from explicit combinatorial formulas when they are available, such as the sort that appear in the shuffle conjecture, often called ""nabla formulas"" in Macdonald theory. Understanding this connection is of considerable interest to number theory, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. A second aspect is the creation of sophisticated computer software for testing new conjectures, as well as for generating data to make predictions about the general relationship with geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research supported by this award will center on using modern degeneration techniques, especially those from the field of tropical geometry, to study classical spaces from algebraic geometry. The main goal of tropical geometry is transforming questions about algebraic varieties into questions about polyhedral complexes. A process called tropicalization attaches a polyhedral complex to an algebraic variety. The polyhedral complex, a combinatorial object, encodes some of the geometry of the original algebraic variety. The research develops further tools for the study of algebraic varieties in terms of their so called ""nonarchimedean analytification"". Overall this project will refine, abstract, and generalize these new methods and explore deeper applications to open problems in algebraic geometry. In conjunction with this research program, the PI will continue to direct the SUMRY program for undergraduate research in mathematics at Yale, providing not only research opportunities for the undergraduate participants, but also mentorship opportunities for the graduate students and postdocs leading small group projects. <br/><br/>The PI will extend the tropical independence methods developed in proofs of the Gieseker-Petri theorem and the maximal rank conjecture for quadrics, developing new notions of tropicalization of linear series and combining piecewise linear methods with reduction of rational functions to pursue further progress toward the maximal rank conjecture and strong maximal rank conjecture. He will continue his work using the combinatorial topology of moduli spaces of stable tropical curves to extract information about the top weight cohomology of moduli spaces of curves, looking for additional structures such as hidden filtrations whose graded pieces are representation stable with respect to the action induced by permutation of the marked points.

The first kind of problems, partitions of measures, is a cornerstone of the interaction of equivariant topology and discrete geometry.  The PI will focus on the effect of additional geometric constraints to classic problems in the field.  The second is Tverberg theory, which focuses on understanding the convex hulls of finite sets of points from a combinatorial point of view.

Despite its technical nature, some questions explored in the project are suitable for undergraduate and high school students, and the investigator will work with these students through the various programs, such as the Program for Research in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science for High School Students (PRIMES) and the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), available at his institution.<br/><br/>The project addresses several questions about the positive Grassmannian, a beautiful geometrical object with a rich combinatorial structure.  It is closely related to matroid theory, Schubert calculus, symmetric functions, and cluster algebras, as well as the study of scattering amplitudes of elementary particles.  Several sub-projects are concerned with an extension of weakly separated collections and purity phenomenon to oriented matroids.  This area of research is related to the study of combinatorics of zonotopal tilings and cluster algebras.  The project explores questions about the chip-firing game for root systems.

Several questions concern generalized permutohedra, which are certain convex polytopes whose volumes and numbers of integer lattice points produce many classical combinatorial sequences.  The research on generalized permutohedra involves a new analogue of the Tutte polynomial for hypergraphs and a remarkable duality, with links to the theory of knots and tropical geometry.  The project also includes questions regarding the algebra of Chern forms and related power ideals. These are objects from commutative algebra involving combinatorics of graphs, forests, hyperplane arrangements, parking functions, and matroids.

As objects change and interact, so do the inherent symmetries. How do symmetries combine, restrict, project or transform into other symmetries? How do we decompose a complex system of irreducible components? In general we want to describe this interaction quantitatively -- how many components of each type are contained in another bigger symmetry structure. While the computational complexity of the problem in general hints that no ""closed-form"" answer would exist, it is the goal of this project to find these numbers approximately and see how a typical structure looks like. These problems appear in many disguises, and lie at the intersection of combinatorics, algebra, representation theory, probability and statistical mechanics, and computational complexity theory. <br/><br/>More precisely, the PI aims to solve problems in algebraic combinatorics involving ""structure constants"" and Young tableaux. Structure constants are generally defined as the multiplicities of irreducible symmetric or general linear group representations in the decomposition of tensor products or compositions, or, more generally, the nonnegtive integral coefficients in the decomposition of various symmetric functions in certain bases. The PI aims to determine the behavior of such constants -- asymptotics, positivity, relation to each other, combinatorial interpretation. Among the flagship problems and ultimate goals are: combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients, Foulkes' conjecture on the relative order of plethysm coefficients, asymptotics of Littlewood-Richardson and Kronecker coefficients, the asymptotic number of skew (semi)Standard Young tableaux in various growth regimes for the parameters, limit behavior of lozenge tilings of ""skew"" (general, nontrapezoidal) domains, inequalities of multiplicities in Geometric complexity Theory leading to obstructions distinguishing between polynomials, positivity of e-expansions for q-analogues of chromatic symmetric functions and Schur positivity for LLT polynomials.

Large networks are ubiquitous in both the natural and social sciences and we have access to more-and-more data about them. However, most existing methods for analyzing this data are too slow for even moderately large networks. Hence the need to devise, new, robust tools for network analysis. One way of building new tools is to advance our understanding of the underlying structure of large networks. This approach has led to tremendous success in the case of networks with relatively many connections (so called dense networks). However, most real-word networks do not fall into this category (they are so-called sparse), and our understanding of their structural properties remain rather limited. The goal of this project is to advance the understanding of large sparse networks through the study of similarities between networks, and via the use of continuous models - so called graph limits - to approximate large networks. This approach has proved extremely successful in the case of dense networks.  Progress in the sparse case has been slow mainly because the ""right"" notion of similarity seems elusive, and a host of different concepts have emerged over time whose relationship to each other remains unclear. <br/> <br/>The project will focus on the graph limits, networks defined on probability measure spaces, so-called graphings.  It will investigate classical graph theoretic notions on such objects. The few known results indicate that graphings frequently exhibit surprising differences compared to classical graphs. Yet, one can often find natural assumptions under which classical results extend to the measurable context without any change.  The central motivating question of the project is the approximability of graphings by finite graphs. To this end, various combinatorial and algebraic properties of graphings will be explored in detail to allow comparison to finite graphs. The combinatorial aspects include understanding how standard theorems in graph theory about the existence of matchings, vertex- and edge-colorings  generalize to graphings. Algebraic aspects include the study of spectral properties of graphings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Special efforts would be made to attract first-generation college students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to continue research on universality for nodal intersections, arithmetic progressions in multiplicative groups of finite fields, non-linear Roth type theorem, orders and density of points, on varieties over finite fields, and the theory of incomplete and short character sums. Besides the usual tools in (discrete) Fourier analysis and probability, techniques from arithmetic combinatorics were used, particularly, various versions of factorization in generalized arithmetic progressions and quantitative Nullstellensatz, sum-product theory for the exponential sum and character sum estimates, (including mixed character sums, character sums over very short intervals, and these sums with various moduli or arguments). It turns out that results from sum-product in various settings are of interest in their own right as well as they lead to new results in analytic number theory and some of the problems proposed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combinatorialists try to uncover patterns and building blocks in such structures, in order to explain their global behavior. Combinatorial tools are therefore of central importance in many other fields of science, such as computer science, statistical mechanics, statistics, and probability. This project focuses on the encoding of several discrete geometrical structures (planar graphs, polytopal decompositions of space, etc.) by simpler mathematical structures. Such an encoding, which provides a genuinely different description of the same structures, can greatly simplify the analysis of the objects under consideration. Indeed, certain patterns and probabilistic behavior which were hidden in the original description, may appear more clearly in the alternative description.<br/><br/>This projects aims to develop bijective tools in order to solve several fundamental open problems in combinatorics, with motivations coming from probability, theoretical physics, and computer science. One of the major goals is to set the foundation for a multi-authored proof of a deep relation between three very important probabilistic constructions: random planar graphs, the Gaussian free field, and SLE curves. The proof will be built upon a bijective encoding of percolation-endowed planar triangulations by some two-dimensional lattice walks. Other goals of this project are related to proper coloring of graphs (explaining bijectively a counting formula for properly colored planar graphs), integrable system approach to the symmetric group (""diagonalizing"" the KP differential equations governing the factorizations in the symmetric group), hyperplane arrangements (bijections for the faces of the deformations of the Coxeter arrangement), and graph drawing algorithms (simultaneous generalization of Schnyder woods and transversal structures).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI will further develop the bridge between algebraic geometry and matroid theory, thereby allowing insight and progress in one subject to carry over to the other.  This paves the way for well-known applications of matroids in topics such as optimization and network theory to draw from the heavily developed, and computationally powerful, machinery of algebraic geometry.  The PI will also run a summer enrichment program, focusing on interactions between math and law, for disadvantaged minority students at a nearby underfunded public high school.<br/><br/><br/>The PI's program of bringing more algebraic geometry into matroid theory consists of three projects. (1) Matroids can be viewed as modules over the two-element Boolean semifield or as tensors in a tropical exterior algebra. By extending this framework the PI will<br/>geometrize various combinatorial constructions and results in the matroid literature. Motivating problems focus on transversal matroids and matroid irreducibility. (2) The maximal torus action on the Grassmannian beautifully brings together topology, combinatorics, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. The PI is extending portions of this story to diagonal subtori. This opens several paths of investigation, including the possibility of extending the K-theoretic interpretation of the Tutte polynomial from matroids to their multiset generalization, discrete polymatroids. (3) The PI is applying the tropical scheme theory he co-developed to construct a functorial moduli space of matroids. This entails a careful understanding of how matroids vary algebraically in families and could lead to an eventual Schubert calculus on the Dressian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These problems appear to have little in common with each other, nor do they seem to have any obvious applications, and yet a deeper look reveals many subtle connections between them and possible applications to other areas of applied and theoretical science. For example, the question ""how many alternating sign matrices of order N exist?"" which was asked by mathematicians in the 1980s in connection with an obscure algorithm proposed by the logician Charles Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll) in the 19th century turned out to have connections to ""square ice,"" an exotic form of water ice that was detected experimentally a few years ago by British researchers. Similarly, the Witten zeta function, which the investigator plans to study in connection with the enumeration of certain types of symmetry, was previously studied by other researchers (including the physicist Edward Witten) in a different context related to problems in quantum field theory. It is these sorts of connections that the investigator hopes to shed light on through his research, and which make pure mathematics such a fruitful area of study for the advancement of human knowledge.<br/><br/>The specific problems the investigator proposes to study are questions at the interface of enumerative, algebraic and asymptotic combinatorics, with connections to other branches of mathematics, notably representation theory, probability theory, asymptotic analysis, and number theory. For example, one problem involves a new direction in asymptotic representation theory, namely that of finding asymptotic formulas for the number of n-dimensional representations of a Lie group as n grows large. The investigator's recent paper solved this problem for the group SU(3) using a difficult analysis of the so-called Witten zeta function associated with the group, which highlighted some intriguing connections between the problem and seemingly unrelated questions in analytic number theory and the theory of modular forms. In an additional part of the project, the investigator proposes to author a monograph on alternating sign matrices, which have been the subject of great interest since their discovery in the 1980s and are related to many contemporary research topics in combinatorics, probability theory and statistical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, how many points in the plane meet two given lines simultaneously or how many lines in space meet four given lines? To answer the latter, Schubert considered the case where the first line intersects the second and the third intersects the fourth, in which case the answer is 2 (the line connecting the two points of intersection and the line of intersection of the two planes spanned by the two pairs of intersecting lines). He then asserted, by his principle of conservation of number, that the general answer, if finite, must also be 2. David Hilbert, in his 15th problem for the twentieth century, set out the task of making rigorous Schubert's principle of conservation of number. Cohomology resolved this and lead us to modern Schubert calculus and intersection theory, which has ramifications in geometry, topology, combinatorics, and even plays a central role in string theory. Yet today, Schubert's original question remains unanswered: how can one effectively compute intersection numbers for linear subspaces?<br/><br/>Lascoux and Schutzenberger in 1985 defined polynomial representatives for the Schubert classes in the cohomology ring of the complete flag variety. These Schubert polynomials give explicit polynomial representations of the Schubert classes whose structure constants enumerate flags (sequences of nested linear subspaces) in a suitable triple intersection of Schubert varieties, which are precisely the nonnegative integers Schubert calculus aims to compute. The principal investigator will  lift powerful tools and techniques from symmetric function theory to the full polynomial ring and apply them to Schubert polynomials with the ultimate goal of finding a combinatorial formula for these intersection numbers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference is the only officially sanctioned satellite meeting in North America associated with the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM), which will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from August 1-9, 2018. Holding a satellite meeting in Miami provides a unique opportunity to advance the 2018 ICM theme of pan-hemispheric cooperation in mathematics and its applications via a highly visible event at a major US research university, thereby enriching mathematical and scientific dialogue between mathematical scientists based in the United States and their counterparts in its Latin American neighbors. Customarily, ICM satellite meetings center on a narrowly focused topic within a particular mathematical sub-discipline and are held in the host country or surrounding region. ""A Pan-Hemispheric Celebration of Mathematics"" will be broader in scope than most ICM satellite meetings and will highlight four important areas at the forefront of current mathematics: algebraic geometry and topology; combinatorics; differential geometry and geometric analysis; and mathematical biology. The meeting will feature a vibrant mix of pure and applied perspectives with strong interdisciplinary connections, particularly to physics, biology and computer science.<br/><br/>The meeting will be organized around extended plenary lectures in each of the focal areas, given by leading experts in the field. These plenary lectures will be supplemented by parallel invited special sessions, with the event structured so as to offer participants a dual opportunity to learn broadly about important developments at the frontier of four important areas and to delve more deeply into one of them. Funding from NSF will be used to attract a diverse range of non-speaker participants, with a goal of advancing pan-hemispheric dialogue. The conference is part of ongoing efforts in this direction and draws its organizing committee from faculty at the University of Miami, the Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (Cinvestav) in Mexico and the Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada (IMPA) in Brazil.

The large volume of data generated today motivates the need for distributed storage systems which can provide long-term storage of data with highly reliable retrieval and availability of information to users. A distributed storage system consists of a network of storage nodes. A stored file may be retrieved by accessing these nodes. In such a system, individual nodes may be unreliable; for instance, they may become unavailable due to routine maintenance. For this reason, how information is stored across the network is highly relevant. The goal is to create a storage system that allows for recovery of lost data while limiting both network traffic and the number of disks accessed. This project addresses the problem by appealing to the underlying structure of a family of error-correcting codes defined using algebraic geometry. The codes have robust structure that yields powerful local properties and potential to balance storage overhead, reliability, network traffic, and repair bandwidth.  <br/> <br/>This project considers the use of codes obtained via algebraic geometric constructions in highly relevant applications. The following problems will be studied: coding for distributed storage via algebraic geometric and combinatorial points of view, with the goals of minimizing node access and repair bandwidth; and explicit construction of locally correctable codes, quantum codes, and secret sharing schemes using algebraic geometric tools. Code structure will be explored, and decoding codes which are directs sum may be handled by decoding or repair within its factors. Full use will be made of the automorphism group of the code as well as natural nested structures inherited from the underlying algebraic geometry. Much of the work in this proposal is focused on algebraic geometric constructions utilized in situations where limiting network traffic in the decoding process is desirable; the aim is to accomplish this by capitalizing on the natural underlying structure of algebraic geometric codes rather than appealing exclusively to locality. In doing so, the performance guaranteed by the code construction is maintained (meaning code parameters do not suffer from local requirements) while making the codes more amenable to current applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
