The theory of Ehrhart polynomials is of broad interest to the mathematics community due to connections with commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, discrete and convex geometry, and number theory.  The PI studies roots and coefficients of Ehrhart polynomials, with particular focus on reflexive polytopes.  The PI also investigates problems regarding graph and poset homomorphism complexes, continuing the application of algebraic topology to combinatorics.  The PI studies possible homotopy test graphs and investigates connections between poset homomorphism complexes and poset order dimension.  Finally, in joint work with Richard Ehrenborg, the PI studies simplicial subcomplexes of the boundary complexes of associahedra arising from triangulations of non-convex polygons.<br/><br/>Mathematics has historically been driven by the interplay between discrete and continuous structures.  Contemporary problems arising from the interaction of combinatorics, algebra, and topology continue this tradition.  The study of polytopes began in antiquity, with roots in the solid geometry of Euclid.  Ehrhart theory is a contemporary approach to studying polytopes from a combinatorial and algbraic perspective, producing from a polytope with integer vertices a polynomial counting lattice points in integral dilates of that polytope.  The roots and coefficients of these polynomials are known to carry some combinatorial and geometric data, but there are many open questions about exactly how far this line of investigation can be taken.  The study of graphs began in the 1700's with investigations by Euler, and has found modern day applications in most areas of science and engineering.  Studying chromatic numbers of graphs by moving to the continuous world leads to investigations of topological spaces with symmetries arising from symmetries of the graphs under consideration.  Investigations in this direction have been successful so far, and many open questions remain.<br/>"

Specifically, she proposes to work on centrally symmetric polytopes, simplicial complexes and posets whose geometric realization is a manifold, and cubical complexes. As previous works suggest, this will require applying existing and developing new combinatorial, algebraic, topological, and possibly analytical techniques, thus strengthening connections between different parts of Mathematics.<br/><br/>Cell complexes provide a convenient way to build various shapes from smaller and simpler blocks, such as for example pyramids or cubes. A natural question then is what restrictions on the number of building blocks are imposed by specific shapes.

All of the proposed work will have a computational focus which will further develop computer proof techniques.  All of the proposed work will have a human impact component.

These discoveries concern both new objects (e.g. Durfee symbols and k-marked Durfee symbols) and new aspects of venerable problems (e.g. MacMahon's partitions without sequences, Alder's Conjecture, etc.).  First the proposers consider symmetry studies of the relevant generating functions for the k-marked Durfee symbols.  The next topic is the asymptotics related to partitions with short sequences.  Then the proposers study partial fraction methods whose genesis lies in Ramanujan's Lost Notebook (a manuscript studied extensively by the senior PI).  In addition the proposers look at questions arising from recent discoveries concerning lecture hall partitions and conclude with further investigations of the long standing Alder Conjecture on which the co-PI has made a major breakthrough.<br/>     <br/>The proposal continues the training of graduate students, one of whom has started a plausible combinatorial approach to the symmetry study mentioned in the first paragraph.  While these topics are based on studies in the theory of partitions (a branch of additive number theory), it is notable that partitions with short sequences have interesting implications in probability theory.  Also there has been a spate of recent work revealing fascinating relations between k-marked Durfee symbols and recent developments in the theory of modular forms.<br/>"

More specifically, using work of Fisher and Stephenson as its starting point, it studies how the total number of dimer coverings of the complement of the holes changes as the holes are shifted around on the lattice graph. The joint correlation of a collection of holes is a non-negative real number measuring this change, and is the central object of study of this proposal. In earlier work, the proposer proved that the correlation of holes on the hexagonal lattice is governed, for large separations between the holes, by a law closely resembling the superposition principle of electrostatics: If each hole is regarded as a point charge of magnitude given by the signed difference between the number of white and black vertices in it (in a fixed white-black coloring of the vertices in which each edge has oppositely colored endpoints), then, for large distances between the holes, their correlation is proportional to the exponential of the negative of the 2D electrostatic energy of the resulting system of charges. Other previous results concern two naturally defined fields that the proposer proved approach the electric field in the limit when the lattice spacing approaches zero. In the current project, the proposer presents a program organized in several inter-related groups comprising two dozen specific problems and conjectures. The bulk of this program is aimed at developing further the analogy to electrostatics, but the list includes also independent combinatorial problems, such as conjectures on tiling enumeration of new regions and problems arising in the study of card shufflings.<br/><br/>This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The specific problems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical physics.  A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant to the study of of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid, consisting of two-atom molecules---the dimers in the model---along the surface of a crystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two neighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given crystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule. The main issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities that are studied (speciffically, the number of different ways the surface of the crystal can be covered by molecules). In some of the instances we encounter, the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities exactly turns out to allow progress in the asymptotic study."

The connection between Representation Theory and the Theory of Special functions is provided by a process that goes back to Frobenius. Combinatorics plays a role in that certain important integers such as dimensions and multiplicities are obtained by counting tableaux, paths, trees, etc. These connections provide an invaluable vehicle of discovery, since results and mechanisms which may be obvious in one of these areas often translate into highly  non trivial and unexpected facts in one of the other areas. The power of the combinatorial viewpoint should be easily understood  from the truism `` A picture is worth a thousand words''. Combinatorial interpretations translate mathematical information be it algebraic, analytical, logical or otherwise into visual information. The proposed activities involve computation of Kronecker coefficients, determination of Hilbert series, constructions of explicit basic sets of rings of invariants, factorization of certain algebras as free modules over rings of invariants,  decompositions of graded representations into their irreducible constituents. These are all activities that have a bearing in several branches of Mathematics and Physics. All the proposed research lies in areas which are particularly suitable to computer experimentation. Experience  shows that, in this setting, even students with limited background can experience the joy of non trivial discovery. <br/><br/>Kronecker coefficients, which are integers yielding the multiplicities of irreducibles in tensor products of representations, are difficult to compute directly from their original definition. New methodology that is being developped by the proposer in collaboration with A. Goupil and M. Zabrocki obtains polynomial generating functions of these coefficients, from which the coefficients themselves can be easily extracted. Constructing these  Kronecker ``polynomials`` and seeking for their combinatorial interpretation will be one of the activities to be carried out under this grant. Hilbert series of graded vector spaces are generating functions of dimensions of the successive homogeneous components of these vector spaces. The proposed reseach will develop algorithms for the calculation of Hilbert series of rings of invariants. Invariants are polynomials which remain unchanged under the action of certain groups of matrices. Hilbert series are computed primarily to obtain information useful in the construction  of  basic sets of invariants.  The proposer in collaboration with N. Wallach  explored and expanded a way to obtain Hilbert series by constant term algorithms. Subsequent collaboration by the proposer with G. Xin succeeded in refining these algorithms to the extent that certain Hilbert series that hiterto required hours of computer time were recently obtained in a few seconds. The acquisition of explicit formulas and when not available the development of efficient algorithms yielding mathematical constructs are the primary activities that will be carried out under this grant. Significant success in these endeavours should be beneficial to other researchers in the applied sciences.<br/><br/>"

Broadly speaking, extremal combinatorics addresses the existence of and theoretical bounds on the sizes of combinatorial objects with certain local restrictions imposed. Many of the important problems, while simple to state and attractive, are often representative of more general phenomena in mathematics, and lead to many unexpected and useful applications in other areas.  For example, the topics of expander graphs and Ramanujan graphs have had a major impact on coding, complexity and information theory.  These problems also lead to new theoretical methods, perhaps the most remarkable instance of which is the probabilistic method pioneered by the renowned mathematician Paul Erdos.  Extremal combinatorial methods lead to the construction of new and more efficient codes for correcting errors in data transmission, the reduction of the number of bits required for Monte-Carlo algorithms, such as randomized algorithms for primality testing. In fact, the spectacular recent breakthrough of a deterministic algorithm for primality testing is highly connected to preceding randomized algorithms which were long known to exist. In my proposal I plan to study further theoretical and practical applications, including the problem of time-complexity of matrix multiplication, quadratic sieve-type integer factoring algorithms, and questions in other areas of mathematics.  In mathematics, this work has implications in functional analysis, projective geometry, spectral graph theory, coding theory, and algorithms.  While these open problems are important and clearly difficult, some major inroads are possible by combining probabilistic and combinatorial techniques with some new ideas.<br/><br/>Combinatorial mathematics lies at the heart of many modern-day operations, such as digital security, web searching, and reliable data transmission.  Examples include multiplication of large arrays of numbers for qualitative web searches -- these matrices tend to have billions of rows and columns; the RSA cryptosystem, which underpins much of modern digital security, and is based strongly on the belief that factoring integers is difficult; finally, transmission of data over noisy or unreliable channels is at the core of coding theory, where one attempts to design novel ways of encoding a message so that even if the message is perturbed in transmission, the receiver can still figure out with high probability what the original message was.  One of the major ingredients for constructing such good error-correcting codes is the existence of combinatorial objects known as expander graphs.  Using explicit constructions and variants of these objects, together with basic probabilistic arguments, one can compress a message in an optimal way such that the receiver has an excellent chance of figuring out what the original message was. Constructions of graphs with such extremal properties is fundamental to the proposed research. In addition, the researcher plans to use combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to approach the problems of matrix multiplication and integer factoring, both of which are central to the concrete examples listed above.  The researcher plans to investigate both the practical and theoretical applications of the above-mentioned combinatorial and probabilistic methods."

Back in the sixties, in a series of pioneering papers Erdos and Renyi created what is now known as random graphs theory, a fast growing research area remarkable for fruitful interplay of enumerative combinatorics and modern probabilistic models and techniques. While Erdos-Renyi random graph process is based on assumption that a new edge location is chosen uniformly at random, it has been recognized that in some applications (internet networks) a more realistic assumption is of a bias toward more ""popular"" vertices (nodes), a so-called preferential attachment hypothesis. The proponent has proved that in this counterpart of the E-R process the random graph undergoes a rapid transformation, from a sea of small components (clusters) to a giant cluster in a sea of small clusters. The proponent plans to study the subsequent phases of the graph process, such as formation of a k-core, and the moment the graph first becomes connected. The proponent will study vertex and edge percolation processes on random graphs with a given degree distribution, and solvability of the random Boolean equations based on his previous studies of the E-R process at the critical stage. The program includes joint research with Alan Frieze (""mixing"" time of a random walk on an incipient giant component of the E-R graph), and Nick Wormald (directed version of the E-R process).

The past beneficiaries of such a collaboration were Adam Hammett and Craig Lennon who successfully defended their PhD theses on problems from the program funded by the NSF in 2004&#8722;2007. The proponent is confident that systematic interaction with his current students, John McSweeney and Jia Yeum, will lead to solving two problems included in the proposed program, one on the expected coalescing time for the allocation model,and another on probability of solvability of the random equations."

The formulas connect Macdonald polynomials with other special q-symmetric functions recently studied by combinatorialists, namely the LLT polynomials of Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon, and the k-Schur functions of Lapointe, Lascoux and Morse.  From the point of view of Lie theory, all these developments are connected with general linear groups and therefore with the root systems of type A.  The guiding themes of the proposed research will be to unify these recent combinatorial discoveries, to connect them with underlying algebraic, geometric and representation theoretic phenomena, and to extend them to Lie groups and root systems of other types.<br/><br/>In a broader optic, combinatorics is the part of mathematics that deals with the passage from the abstract to the concrete.  Thus Lie theory in the abstract is the theory of continuous symmetries.  However, by one of the great theorems in mathematics, concrete combinatorial data--the root systems--govern the structure of the most important Lie groups.  While the link between Lie groups and root systems is classical, there are also other, more subtle, combinatorial structures associated with Lie theory, which mathematicians are still striving to understand.  One way to seek such understanding is to begin by exploring the combinatorial side, which by nature lends itself to explicit computation and the search for patterns, and afterwards to try to explain the observed combinatorial phenomena by reference to more abstract underlying concepts from group theory, geometry and representation theory.  This is the mode of understanding which Haiman seeks to pursue in the proposed research.<br/>"
