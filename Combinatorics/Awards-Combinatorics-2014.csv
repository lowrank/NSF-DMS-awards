Phase transitions are one important theme -- vanishing thresholds for homology or homotopy groups as some parameter varies, for example. Also of interest are more geometric notions, such as isoperimetric inequalities and hyperbolicity. Random cell complexes provide high-dimensional analogues of expander graphs, a subject that has been a very active lately, with connections to random matrix theory. The probabilistic method provides a powerful and general framework for generating objects with extremal geometric properties, and progress in this area will lead to intriguing new examples and counterexamples in topological combinatorics and geometric group theory.<br/><br/>This research draws on several areas of mathematics to study subtle qualitative features of randomly generated shapes. These interactions are of intrinsic interest within mathematics itself, and the work is also being done with a eye towards practical applications in the emerging area of topological data analysis. The educational activities supported by the grant will be naturally integrated with the research, and the PI will mentor graduate and undergraduate researchers working on projects related to the grant. The PI will continue to be involved with various outreach activities: Colorado Math Olympiad, Canada/USA Mathcamp, math circles, undergraduate math clubs, and problem solving seminars."

Its most frequently used tools include generating functions, symmetric polynomials, Standard Young Tableaux, and the incidence algebra of a partially ordered set. These high-powered algebraic tools often show that some classes of remote-looking objects in fact have the same size. That is when bijective combinatorics comes in the picture. If two classes of objects that seem to be unrelated contain the same number of elements, then it is quite possible that those classes are not unrelated after all, and there is a bijection between them. These bijections are sometimes quite challenging to find, but once they are found, they enhance our understanding of the classes at hand."

The focus of combinatorics is the structure of discrete (as opposed to continuous) sets of objects. Combinatorics is critical to many areas of mathematics, and plays a key role in computational, scientific, and engineering applications. In part due to the legacy of Paul Erdos, combinatorics is a research field driven by collaboration. In order to provide graduate students in combinatorics a collaborative research opportunity and nurture long-lasting research collaborations, we will organize the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Workshop Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics. <br/><br/>This award will support the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains Workshop Graduate Research Workshop in Combinatorics (GRWC), which will be held in Denver, CO from July 28th-August 8th, 2014, will involve approximately 30 graduate students, 4 postdoctoral researchers and 10 faculty in an intense two-week collaborative research experience.  Participants will work to solve important, relevant problems from graph theory, enumeration, combinatorial matrix theory, finite geometry and other modern sub-disciplines of combinatorics.  Students will prepare open problems prior to the workshop under the guidance of a faculty mentor from the organizing committee, which consists of faculty from the University of Colorado Denver, University of Denver, Iowa State University, the University of Wyoming and the University of Nebraska Lincoln. These problems will then either be presented at the workshop by their proposers or hosted on the workshop's secure problem wiki, and will be worked on by small groups of participating students, postdocs and faculty.

Monge in 1781 and rediscovered and crucially developed and applied to areas in economics by L. Kantorovich, eventually earning him the Nobel prize in 1939.  The renaissance of the classical Monge-Kantorovich mass transport topic in the late 1980's is attributed to independent developments by the French mathematician Y. Brenier (studying fluid dynamics),  U.S. mathematician J. Mather in dynamical  systems, and British meteorologist Mike Cullen.  The mathematics of the optimal transport and its extensions has made a tremendous impact on several fields including calculus of variations, functional analysis, geometry, and probability. In recent years the geometry of optimal transport, particularly its link with the so-called Ricci curvature in Riemannian geometry, and connections to functional and isoperimetric inequalities  has been extensively investigated resulting in deep and beautiful connections to the above-mentioned topics. The new book by the recent Fields medalist C. Villani is a testament to this explosive development.  What is currently lacking in our understanding, and is actively being sought by various isolated groups,  is the analogous development of the topic in discrete spaces -- developing appropriate ""discrete calculus"" on graphs and finite Markov chains. The PI and his collaborators (including students and postdocs) have identified several concrete directions to make progress, as well as find new applications, in this important and exciting topic.<br/><br/><br/>In recent collaboration, with various collaborators, the PI has initiated a fruitful line of frontier research in developing discrete aspects of the exciting topic of Optimal Transport & Applications. Besides strengthening and refining classical notions, this work identifies several interesting new directions to pursue -- new notions of (Brunn-Minkowski) convexity in graphs, new concentration inequalities (dimension-free, infimum-convolution and transport-entropy inequalities) refining Talagrand's convex distance concentration (and extensions by Marton and others) on non-product spaces, as well as connections to classical sumset inequalities in additive combinatorics. Much of this is motivated by the attempts to understand appropriate metrics and geodesics in optimal transport (of measures) on discrete spaces. Developing the necessary discrete calculus and relating the recently introduced notions of discrete Ricci curvature, displacement convexity and Wasserstein-type metrics in finite graphs and Markov chains, is a technically as well as conceptually challenging objective of the proposal. Connections to other functional inequalities (such as versions Talagrand, Marton transport inequalities) and their equivalent dual formulations provide an important motivation. A second objective is to explore the full extent of applications of the methods developed and the recent theorems proved. While classical theorems (such as the log-Sobolev inequality for the Gaussian measure, Strassen's martingale existence theorem, Talagrand's theorem on the symmetric group) have already been re-derived in the recent initiative of the PI and his collaborators, the full potential needs to be more thoroughly investigated. Concentration inequalities on the noncrossing partition lattice and consequences are a concrete example of new questions that have arisen from this investigation. Another goal of the PI is to compare and constrast the various independent suggested notions of (RiccI) curvature and displacement convexity in discrete spaces."

Many practical error correcting codes are constructed via algebraic curves over finite fields. These codes have been extensively studied from both theoretical and practical point of views. However, many questions still remain open, particularly on code structures, code constructions and decoding complexity. This project will strive to study structural properties and decoding algorithms for codes from algebraic geometry with the aim of making these codes more amenable to applications. The project is multi-disciplinary lying at the crossroads of mathematics, computer science,and electronic engineering. It bridges pure mathematics, particularly discrete mathematics and algebraic geometry, with practical applications in digital communications. Any new result or any good algorithm for codes could be used to improve communication capability in practice. <br/><br/>Algebraic geometry (AG) codes have a tremendous amount of algebraic structure. Exploiting this algebraic structure enables construction of codes, efficient encoding, and efficient decoding. While many advances in decoding algorithms for AG codes has been made in the last decade, most of these apply only to one-point AG codes. Multipoint codes can have much better parameters than comparable one-point codes. This project will study how to realize this advantage in term of encoding and decoding algorithms. Another important issue relates to explicit constructions of bases for AG codes, especially those from curves in higher dimensional spaces (function field towers). This project studies both list decoding beyond half distance and fast unique decoding below half distance. Techniques include power series and Grobner bases. For many AG codes, even if decoding is only up to half distance, their error control capability is much higher than Reed-Solomon codes which are widely used in practice. To make AG codes more suitable for practical implementations, the project aims to reduce the decoding complexity and memory requirements via power series representations."

A typical problem in optimization involves optimizing a function over the set of all solutions of a given linear system --- a system that usually contains hundreds or thousands of equations in many variables. Geometrically, the corresponding set of points is a high-dimensional object, called a polytope. Moreover, in recent years the study of polytopes with certain symmetry has led to surprising implications in statistics, probability, information theory, and signal processing, and is also expected to have impacts in such subjects as medical imaging and digital communications. In engineering and computer science, e.g., robotics, one often needs to describe a space of ""allowed motions"": this space can usually be approximated by a collection of points, segments, triangles, pyramids, and higher dimensional analogs of pyramids nicely glued together --- an object known as a simplicial complex.  The problems aimed at deepening our understanding of polytopes and simplicial complexes are at the heart of this proposal.<br/> <br/>The primary aim of this proposal is to attack several long-standing problems and conjectures in the theory of face numbers of various classes of simplicial and, more generally, CW complexes. Specifically, research on this project will involve the use of algebraic, geometric, topological, and combinatorial methods to attack fundamental enumerative questions related to (1) simplicial spheres and, more generally, complexes embeddable in a sphere of a given dimension, (2) balanced triangulations of spheres and manifolds, (3) flag and banner complexes, and (4) centrally symmetric polytopes.  The main flavor of questions we are interested in is how the topology of the underlying space (e.g., being a triangulation of a certain manifold) or a certain combinatorial restriction, such as symmetry or balancedness, affects the possible face numbers of complexes in question. Although most of the problems proposed here are combinatorial in nature, recent advances are carried out by a subtle combination of algebraic and geometric arguments (among them Lefschetz algebras, generic and not-so-generic initial ideals, local cohomology, rigidity, etc.). Thus solutions to the proposed problems may impact not only combinatorics and discrete geometry but also such fields as combinatorial algebra, algebraic topology, and Riemannian geometry."

Recently, the paper of Kechris, Pestov, and Todorcevic connecting Ramsey theory with topological dynamics led to the recent boom in research regarding applications of Ramsey theory applied to finding minimal flows; and the recent book of Todorcevic on Ramsey Spaces has prepared a path for a surge in progress on Ramsey theory.

It will serve as a unifying point for the subject of infinitary Ramsey theory and increase future collaborations.    It will also provide entry to the field for young researchers with diverse backgrounds.  As such, the field of infinitary Ramsey theory will be strengthened, very likely speeding up the rate of progress in this area and areas in which it is applied.

Combinatorics deals with discrete objects such as finite sets, graphs, permutations, partial orders, etc. Many continuous phenomena allow for a discrete representation, lending themselves amenable to combinatorial methods of study. It is often the case that identical or similar combinatorial structures underlie seemingly unrelated mathematical entities, revealing hidden connections between these and allowing the transfer of insights and techniques from one discipline to another. A case in point is the theory of cluster algebras, which are the main focus of this project.<br/><br/>This award supports the PI's research on combinatorial structures arising in algebra and geometry, with an emphasis on the theory and applications of cluster algebras.

Zelevinsky, have found applications in several mathematical disciplines including representation theory, Teichmueller theory, mathematical physics, and enumerative and geometric combinatorics.

The method of jammed or irreducible graphs goes back to Schutte and van der Waerden, Fejes Toth, and Danzer, and is directly related to the rigidity theory. The method of positive definite constraints that has been used to analyze the properties of point configurations, and to derive bounds on their size, relies on classical works of Schoenberg, Bochner, and Delsarte. The PI and co-PI intend to solve the Tammes problem for values of n larger than 13, classify irreducible graphs on a two-dimensional sphere, and describe optimal sphere packings on other surfaces (including a square flat torus with n larger than 8) and in higher dimensions. The investigators will also attempt to quantify the impact of the positive definite relaxation on the description of point sets and the accuracy of the known Delsarte bounds on codes. Through the proposed analysis of few-distance sets, the PI and co-PI will contribute new tools to a classic combinatorial problem; while geometric ideas used in the study of such sets could lead to new approaches to finding constraints on strongly regular graphs and primitive association schemes. Delaunay triangulations provide an important tool for analysis of sphere packings and coverings; the PI and co-PI intend to extend known results to a larger set of point configurations and to find new all-dimensional functionals for which a Delaunay triangulation is always optimal."

In previous research, the PI developed simpler models that give an alternative way to compute these formulas and avoid the longer recursive procedure.

The study of expander graphs has been drawing tools from deep mathematics, such as number theory, representation theory, and topology. In recent years the study of expanders also provided new problems for pure mathematicians. This interplay of mathematics and computer science has been very productive. The current proposal aims at taking the theory of expanders one step further by initiating a systematic study of high-dimensional expanders, which are simplical complexes of high dimensions having similar properties of expanders. The problems in the high-dimensional case are more difficult, but the theory we hope to develop can be expected to be powerful in applications. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs plan to consider various ways to extend the definition of expanders, e.g., via spectrum, cohomology  or  topology. Of particular interest are the Ramanujan complexes, which generalize the Ramanujan graphs. Their extremal properties (proved by methods of representation theory and number theory) together with their remarkable symmetry are expected to be useful in solving several problems. Of special importance is Gromov's topological overlapping property.

When we have complicated systems with dozens of equations in hundreds of variables, methods from geometry can be one of the few ways to analyze important quantitative and qualitative aspects of the system, like where it has a maximum or how many pieces it has.  This research project develops important geometric tools for describing complicated systems of equations.  It then applies these tools to specific systems of equations with important applications in mathematics, physics, computer science, and other fields.<br/><br/>The PI proposes to solve three linked questions in modern Schubert calculus: the first studies the cohomology of the affine Grassmannian; the second studies the intersection homology of Schubert varieties; and the third studies the cohomology of a family of subvarieties of the flag variety called Hessenberg varieties, in order to answer major open questions about the flag variety.  To do this, the PI will use GKM theory, a combinatorial and algebraic algorithm to describe equivariant cohomology, as well as a recent extension of GKM theory called generalized splines.  The goals of the project will be 1) to develop theoretical tools and algorithms in generalized splines and 2) to apply these tools to perform specific computational and combinatorial calculations in the various cohomology rings we study.<br/>"

These connections provide a powerful vehicle of discovery, since results and mechanisms which may be quite obvious in one area often translate into highly nontrivial and unexpected facts in one of the other areas. This type of activity is also highly suitable for training young researchers and providing them with the opportunity to discover the manner in which some research can be carried in our Computer Age. Combinatorial interpretations translate mathematical information, be it algebraic, analytical, logical or otherwise, into visual information. Under this setting, even students with limited background can be brought to experience the joy of discovery.  For these reasons the PI, plans to continue the practice of bringing all current research efforts right into the classroom through graduate courses and seminars.  In fact most of the work of the students and collaborators of the PI carried out under prior NSF support resulted from such classroom activities. <br/><br/>The subfield of Algebraic Combinatorics, that is the focus of the research carried out under this award was created by the PI's representation theoretical approach to the (1988) conjectures by Macdonald concerning his now-famous symmetric polynomial basis.  The 1990's joint work of the PI and Mark Haiman led to a conjectured formula for the Frobenius characteristic  of the space ``Diagonal Harmonics'' in terms of the Macdonald polynomials.  Early computer explorations by the PI and Haiman  yielded data which revealed a surprisingly intimate connection of Diagonal Harmonics with  ``Parking Functions'' (a colorful combinatorial structure created by computer scientists.) These discoveries led to the formulation by Haglund et al. of the Shuffle Conjecture which gives the Frobenius Characteristic of Diagonal Harmonics a beautiful explicit formula in terms of Parking Functions. Around the year 2000, Mark Haiman proved the original conjectures formulated jointly with the PI by Algebraic Geometrical tools.  This brought the attention of the Algebraic Geometers to this field of investigation.  This attention resulted in a truly surprising enrichment of the field with a variety of new tools and open problems.  Very recently the PI and his collaborators, using these new findings succeeded  in formulating an infinite family of ``Shuffle Conjectures''  connecting a whole Lie Algebra of Symmetric Function Operators to new ``Parking Function'' like objects.  Under the support of this award the PI  plans to use the vast collection of tools developed in two decades of efforts in this area to work on these problems in collaboration with his present PhD students Emily Leven, Yeonkyung Kim and Marino Romero. Preliminary results obtained by the PI and his present students have been very promising. In fact, recently Leven has succeeded in solving an infinite subfamily of these new conjectures. Historically, difficult problems have been the source of fundamental mathematical discoveries. Our particular area of investigation should be no exception in this respect."

Extremal Combinatorics deals with the problems of finding the maximum or minimum value of a function over a class of finite objects. Such problems are often related to other branches of mathematics and other fields of science, including biology, chemistry, computer science, information and coding theory. <br/><br/>The proposed research concentrates on extremal problems for hypergraphs. Since hypergraphs have more complicated structures than graphs, generalizing results from graphs to hypergraphs is usually far from straightforward and frequently gives rise to new phenomena. For example, there are multiple ways (depending on how to define degrees and cycles in hypergraphs) to extend the classical result of Dirac on Hamilton cycles to hypergraphs -- none of them has an easy proof. The Dirac problems, and related matching and packing problems have received considerable attention lately. Modern tools, e.g., the absorbing method and the regularity method, have helped to generate new results, and yet many fundamental problems in the area remain unsolved.  The PI plans to tackle many outstanding problems in the area, developing the extremal theory of hypergraphs."

The mathematical methods in extremal combinatorics are now central tools in combinatorics, and give rise to many applications in other areas of mathematics as well as other fields of science, such as statistical mechanics, biology, theoretical computer science and information and coding theory. The proofs of the central theorems are also connected to algorithmic complexity questions, as well as questions on randomized algorithms and derandomization. For instance, given a network one may ask for the minimum number of nodes whose failure would cause the network to disconnect, and how efficiently one can exhibit such a set of nodes -- this is one of the central topics in graph theory. These questions often lie at the heart of digital and communication security, web searching, reliable data transmission, network dynamics, and the spread of infectious disease or information, and so on.<br/><br/>This award supports research in combinatorics, focusing on the very active area of extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. The aim is to study specific central problems in extremal combinatorics, such as the Turan and Ramsey problems for both graphs and hypergraphs, matching and coloring problems and the extension of these problems into the context of models of random graphs and hypergraphs. In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in the number of new tools available for studying these problems, including the various notions of pseudorandomness in graphs and hypergraphs, martingale concentration inequalities and probabilistic sieving methods, as well as regularity lemmas, to mention a few. The problems which the PI propose to study, such as the extremal problem for bipartite graphs, remain open, and any new advance is likely to have a substantial theoretical impact and practical consequences. While these open problems are important and clearly difficult, the new methods and combinatorial techniques mentioned above together with new ideas look very promising for the resolution of these problems.<br/> <br/>"

Crossing numbers date back to World War II, when the mathematician Paul Turán worked on a labor camp moving carts filled with bricks from kilns to storage places using a railway system. In his own words ''...the work itself was not difficult; the trouble was only at the crossings. The trucks generally jumped the rails there, and the bricks fell out of them; in short this caused a lot of trouble and loss of time which was rather precious to all of us..."" He realized that the situation could be improved by a railway system with the smallest number of crossings. The general problem with an arbitrary number of kilns and storage places turned out to be extremely difficult and has not been solved to date. A generalized abstraction of this problem is to consider drawings where some points are to be connected by curves and the goal is to minimize the number of crossings. Crossing numbers are important to everyday life and technology. Drawings of graphs are a helpful tool to visually represent connections and interrelations among objects or subjects, such as maps, genealogy tress, or organizational charts. To ease the understanding of such information, drawings with few crossings are highly desirable. Crossing numbers are also important to the development of electronic circuits, such as computer processors, whose components must be connected by non crossing electrical links in order to avoid short circuits. The accessible nature of related problem statements and their important applications make this project suitable to the direct involvement of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Minimizing the number of crossings in a drawing of a graph in the plane is a major problem in topological and geometric graph theory. Crossing numbers of the complete graph are particularly important because, using random embeddings, bounds on the crossing number of the complete graph imply bounds on the crossing number of arbitrary graphs. Separation of points by a straight line (halving lines, k-edges, k-sets) has extensively been used to understand the complexity of finite sets of points in the plane. The PI and coauthors recently developed a separation concept for topological drawings of the complete graph in the plane. They used this concept to settle a long standing crossing number conjecture for several families of drawings. The goal of this project is to use this separation concept as a new approach to the Harary-Hill conjecture on the topological crossing number of the complete graph and its variations to other topological settings. Being able to separate points in topological graph drawings opens up a world of possibilities; problems involving k-edges, halving lines, and convexity will be studied for the first time on this topological framework. The project will significantly advance the understanding of the fundamental structure of topological drawings of graphs in the plane."

The main purpose of this conference is to bring together graduate students in combinatorics with the following goals: to educate participants about the many areas of combinatorics; to share current research topics and open questions; to have participants meet and network with fellow combinatorics graduate students from across the country; and to provide the opportunity to work together on current research. This format also allows for vertical integration in that young graduate students who are just beginning their graduate careers are able to meet and learn from more senior graduate students about their experiences in and approaches to doing research.<br/><br/>This conference is unique in that it is both designed specifically for graduate students, and it is organized and run essentially by the graduate students themselves. Combinatorics faculty at Auburn and the invited speakers will act as mentors for the students through this process. Giving young researchers the opportunity to come together to share their ideas and methods with each other and to learn about different areas of combinatorics is a major theme of this conference. There is a multitude of areas of research in combinatorics, including graph theory of many types, design theory, coding theory, enumeration, and set systems. Many schools have a specific focus and their graduate students are not aware of problems or proof techniques from other areas. This conference is designed to help graduate students appreciate the breadth of combinatorics, with students from many different backgrounds presenting and sharing their results and proof techniques in an informal supportive environment. In so doing, these graduate students are likely to forge professisonal relationships which we expect to extend well into their post-graduate careers, thereby adding to the mix of creative research in subsequent years."

Randomness has long played an important role in the construction of sophisticated mathematical objects and randomness plays a central role in many algorithms in computer science.   Part of this research focuses on objects that are generated by a sequence of dependent random choices.  Such processes can be good models for the dynamics of real-world phenomenon, like the spread of a disease in a network, the evolution of social networks such as facebook or twitter, or phase transitions in materials.  We are particularly interested in the solution of challenging computational problems in the context of random structures, and this work will hopefully be useful in drawing back the shadow of the negative results of complexity theory.<br/><br/><br/>The study of random combinatorial structures has emerged as an important component of Discrete Mathematics.  This research project focuses on various structural properties of random graphs and hypergraphs. One area of emphasis is the study of the existence of Hamilton cycles in various sparse random graph models. It is natural to conjecture that any suitably random model that ensures that a graph has minimum degree 3 will have a Hamilton cycle with high probability.  While this has been established in a few setting, a number of very natural open questions remain, and the development of a unified theory of Hamiltonicity of sparse random graphs is a long range goal of this research.  This project also includes the study of algorithmic questions.  For example, we will put significant effort into the study of Cuckoo hashing.  Here the main question is whether or not the insertion of a new item into the hash table takes constant expected time. Our approach here will be to show that an associated graph has a fast mixing time, applying the theory of mixing times for Markov chains."

The symposium will include several mathematical talks, including a keynote address given by Lenore Blum of Carnegie Mellon University. There will be parallel sessions in algebra, dynamical systems, geometry and topology, logic, mathematical biology, partial differential equations, and statistics. In addition, there will be a problem session to encourage new collaborations; problems that cut across disciplines are particularly encouraged. The symposium encourages participation of women in various stages of their academic careers, ranging from graduate students to full faculty. <br/><br/>It is not uncommon for women with research talent to drop out of the research community. The talks and the problem session will lead women to new and exciting projects. An extended lunch and other breaks will give participants at various stages in their careers the opportunity discuss mathematical problems, or simply exchange stories.

The Triangle Lectures in Combinatorics workshops play numerous roles: they enhance the national infrastructure for research and education by creating and strengthening a regional network of interacting researchers; facilitate the dissemination of cutting-edge research ideas, methods and results among researchers in the Southeastern United States; promote the teaching and training of graduate students by exposing them to the perspectives of leading researchers; increase awareness and understanding of combinatorics, on the part of faculty and students in the Southeast; support the development of young faculty at various schools and help them build local support and research networks; broaden participation of underrepresented groups, particularly women; and foster research interactions among participants, leading to new research results.<br/><br/>Combinatorics is a growing and important area of mathematics.  The focus of combinatorics is the structure of discrete (as opposed to continuous) sets of objects.  Combinatorics is critical to many areas of mathematics, and plays a key role in computational, scientific, and engineering applications.  The states of North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee have significant research strength in combinatorics and adjacent areas.  In particular, there are remarkably many tenure-track researchers, senior researchers, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate students in combinatorics and related fields at various colleges and universities within driving distance of the Research Triangle region of North Carolina (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill).  A relatively large proportion of these researchers are from underrepresented groups.  The lecture series provides valuable opportunities for interactions among these researchers."

The rules of the sandpile are simple: given a configuration of ""chips"" on an infinite chessboard (i.e., the integer lattice), one can ""topple"" any square with at least 4 chips, by sending one chip from this square to each of its four neighboring squares.  When begun from a single large stack of chips and continued until no square has more than 3 chips, the result is a striking fractal configuration.  Studying this process has lead to the discovery of surprising connections between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics, and this project aims to leverage these new connections both for the sake of a deeper understanding of the sandpile process, and to enrich our understandings of these other areas as well.  This area of mathematics has connections with phase transitions and conformal field theory in physics as well.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project concerns the so-called Abelian sandpile model of Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld.  By identifying new connections between integer superharmonic functions, Apollonian circle packings, and certain regular tilings of the Euclidean plane, we are now able to characterize the scaling limit of the sandpile and analyze its local fractal structure. This project has two primary goals.  The first is to extend our knowledge of the sandpile: for example, we would like to strengthen the kind of convergence we can prove the sandpile process admits, characterize solutions to long-studied instances of the Dirichlet problem for the sandpile, and extend our knowledge of the scaling limit of the sandpile process beyond the universe of the square lattice.  On the other hand, we would like to bring new perspectives developed for our analysis of the sandpile to bear on other areas, with the possibility of confirming number-theoretic conjectures regarding Apollonian circle packings, or characterizing tilings of the plane with certain symmetry properties."

Discrete surfaces (also known as maps) are fundamental mathematical structures which play an important role in several branches of  mathematics, and theoretical physics and are also of practical importance in computer science (for computer graphics and circuit layout).  The goal of the project is to solve several open problems about discrete surfaces by finding encodings of maps by simpler mathematical structures such as trees and lattice paths. In particular, these encodings shall be used to study the properties of large random discrete surfaces,  and to design algorithms for discrete surfaces. Some broader impacts of the project are the  mentoring of undergraduate research projects, the organization of weekly seminars and conferences, and the dissemination of scientific discoveries through survey articles.<br/><br/>The PI intends to solve several problems related to maps using a bijective approach. In recent years many bijections were found between classes of maps and simpler mathematical structures such as trees. This represented a breakthrough in the understanding of maps, which helped solve previously unreachable problems such as describing the metric properties of random maps and random surfaces. In a collaboration with Eric Fusy, the PI has found a ""master bijection"" generalizing and unifying most known bijections for maps. The PI plans to pursue his research in the following directions:<br/><br/>- Extend the master bijection approach to new classes of maps, namely, hypermaps and irreducible maps. This will complete the unification of the bijective theory of maps, and encompass bijections for maps endowed with a statistical mechanics model.<br/><br/>- Study the metric properties of random maps by using a recent bijective result about  ``charged maps''. <br/><br/>- Write a survey article about the bijective approach to maps. <br/><br/>- Design drawing algorithms for graphs using  canonical orientations. <br/><br/>Other goals of the PI which are not directly related to maps are a combinatorial proof of Okounkov determinantal formula for Schur measures, and the parametrization of the space of branched polymers."

One of the goals of this proposal is to construct a polynomial-time algorithm for this, provided the entries of the matrices are from a finite field. Techniques pioneered in the Matroid Minor Structure Theory by Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle are expected to be crucial components. A second problem is: given a fixed matrix, how many other matrices can have the same set of dependencies? Again, we wish to establish an algorithm to count (and construct) these matrices over a finite field. The proposed approach involves the notion of a stabilizer by Whittle, techniques from a paper by Pendavingh and Van Zwam, and a new notion of connectivity. A third line of research relates to excluded-minor characterizations of matroid classes (similar to Kuratowski's Theorem for planar graphs). We will focus especially on finding the excluded minors of subclasses of the quinary matroids. This third line will have a significant computational component.<br/><br/>A collection of measurements, a stream of digital information, a set of constraints to an optimization problem: many things can be modeled mathematically by a set of points in some space. Often the absolute positions of these points are not important, but their positions relative to each other are. The mathematical notion of a matroid captures this information. However, sometimes too many point configurations map to the same abstract matroid, which is a major obstacle in the study of these point configurations. The main aim of this proposal is a better understanding of this phenomenon. Additionally, a part of this project is concerned with the development of reliable, versatile software for matroid computation, with the intent of integrating this with the open-source Sage Mathematics Software system. Computers can help with finding patterns and structure within a class of matroids, or with finding counterexamples to conjectures."

In tackling these problems, the PI will use a range of combinatorial methods that have recently led to substantial progress on related problems. Examples include probabilistic methods, density increment arguments, transference arguments, analytic tools, and embedding techniques. The first area in this project concerns Szemerédi's regularity method. Within this area, one of the main goals of the project is to obtain new bounds on the triangle removal lemma and its various extensions and variants. The triangle removal lemma states that any graph with a subcubic number of triangles can be made triangle-free by removing a subquadratic number of edges. Another major goal of the project is to further push the regularity method to sparse graphs and other combinatorial structures, and to obtain new applications. Specific problems include optimizing the pseudorandomness conditions needed to obtain sparse counting lemmas, proving analogous sparse regularity results in other combinatorial structures such as cubes, and providing new applications in number theory and discrete geometry such as extensions of the Green-Tao theorem on long arithmetic progressions in the primes. The second area in this project is estimating Ramsey numbers. The PI will work on proving new bounds for classical (complete) graph and hypergraph Ramsey numbers, and to prove linear bounds for Ramsey numbers of sparse graphs.<br/><br/>This project studies fundamental problems in combinatorics related to the structure of large networks. Examples of large networks include the Internet, Facebook, the brain, imperfect crystals, and designed chips. The structure of these networks can be critical in understanding how the networks function. Previous work has shown that the subjects under study in this project have a wide range of applications. Furthermore, this work has led to the development of powerful methods that have been used in many branches of mathematics and computer science. For example, previous progress on estimating Ramsey numbers led to the development of probabilistic techniques that have had a tremendous influence on computer science, such as in the design of randomized algorithms. It is expected that further work on these problems will lead to new methods and applications."

Permutation Patterns is a subject that has become an established branch of Combinatorics over the last two decades. Much of the research in the area has centered on classes of permutations that are avoiding, i.e., each permutation in such a class avoids certain sets of subsequences. It turns out that pattern avoidance arises naturally in theoretical computer science to characterize the set of possible outputs of many natural sorting devices, such as stacks; in fact Knuth's result that a list is one-stack sortable if and only it avoids the pattern 231 is considered to be one of the cornerstones of the rich theory of permutation patterns. Current new research involves areas such as complexity theory and theoretical computer science. The conference series ""Permutation Patterns"" has been held annually since 2003, and has attracted a community of researchers in enumerative, analytic, algebraic and probabilistic combinatorics, all with common interest in research questions that revolve around pattern avoidance or containment in permutations or words.<br/><br/>The numbers of women, undergraduate and graduate students, and early career faculty who attend this conference have increased steadily over the years. Indeed, nurturing and mentoring of such mathematicians has been a significant part of the conference mission.

For example, the tools developed to solve open problems in the theory, now famously named the probabilistic method, provided a new way of thinking and serves as a link between combinatorics, analysis, number theory and geometry. Also, the random objects themselves found applications in fields such as theoretical computer science and statistical physics. As an instance, they are utilized as a theoretical framework for studying massive networks (e.g., internet, social networks, and neural networks) which are becoming of growing importance. Yet despite the great amount of work devoted to this topic over the past fifty years, many interesting unresolved questions, especially regarding the global structure of random graphs, still remain to be answered. Furthermore, the successful development of the theory of random graphs served as a natural motivation for the study of pseudorandom graphs, which can be informally described as deterministic graphs that behave like truely random graphs. Problems in the theory of pseudorandom graphs often are motivated by practical problems and are connected to deep philosophical questions such as, ""Can we imitate true randomness?"".<br/><br/>In this project, the PI plans to study open problems in the field of random and pseudorandom graphs to further develop the theory and deepen the understanding of these fasicnating objects. The main problems that the PI plans to focus on are the conjectures of Krivelevich and Sudakov on Hamiltonicity of pseudorandom graphs, and of Kahn and Kalai on the threshold of appearance of fixed spanning subgraphs in binomial random graphs. These problems were chosen because they are representative problems that address the challenges that we are currently facing in understanding the global properties of random and pseudorandom graphs. The PI also plans to study related problems in combinatorics such as Sidorenko's conjecture, explicit construction of Ramsey graphs, and Turan-type problems in hypercubes."

Broader impacts include a sharpening of mathematical tools for applications in industry, training of highly qualified graduate students for academia and industry, and undergraduate research opportunities. <br/><br/>The interaction between linear and abstract algebra and combinatorics has been a very fruitful area of study and continues to find applications beyond pure mathematics, in physics, computer science, and statistics. In this project, the PI and his team study association schemes and coherent configurations. The first part of the project is a study of association schemes with the so-called Q-polynomial property, a property formally dual to the notion of a distance-regular graph. While distance-regular graphs have been well studied, until the last decade little attention was paid to schemes with the Q-polynomial property that did not also arise from distance-regular graphs. Recent results suggest that these objects are of interest in and of themselves, and that the surprising structure of these schemes merits further exploration. The PI will continue the search for new examples of Q-polynomial schemes, with particular emphasis on those that arise from groups. The search will be complemented by work to characterize Q-polynomial schemes. The second part of the project concerns extending results of association schemes to the more general notion of coherent configurations, a natural generalization of association schemes. In particular, the PI will explore further applications of the recently discovered semidefinite bound in coherent configurations."

Its study has far reaching applications in computer science, information theory, engineering, or even social science. The project focuses on the following central problem  in extremal combinatorics: how large/dense can a discrete system be before certain substructures are set to emerge?  Such a study is critical to our analysis of discrete networks. In the analysis of  discrete networks, graphs and hypergraphs are two of the main mathematical models. In the past several decades, powerful tools have been developed in the study of graphs and hypergraphs, especially for those that are dense. However, in general, there is a lack of effective tools for sparse graphs and hypergraphs. The project aims at  developing some useful tools for the study of  extremal problems for sparse graphs and hypergraphs via a study of several specific problems.<br/><br/>The first objective of this project  is to adapt tools from classical extremely set theory for general sparse hypergraphs. The PI and collaborators have recently applied tools from classical extremal set theory such as the delta system method and shadow analysis to solve Turan type problems for some general sparse hypergraphs. The PI will exploit this connection and look to adapt and develop tools for a more widely applicable setting.  A second objective is to investigate how the shadow structure of a sparse hypergraph  affects its Turan and Ramsey properties.  One particular problem  in this direction is to study Turan and Ramsey problems for hypergraphs that are obtained from graphs through expanding  edges into hyperedges via new vertices.  Another problem of particular emphasis is the Turan problem for hyperforests on which the PI and collaborators and other groups have made substantial recent progress, generalizing several classic results.

During the last decades, computation has gained an important role in mathematical research. This stimulated the development of combinatorics, as the various discrete structures it studies (such as graphs and partially ordered sets) are particularly well suited for encoding and manipulating complex mathematical objects. The PI will use combinatorial techniques in representation theory (which is a fundamental tool for studying group symmetry, and which has important applications in mathematics and beyond, e.g., to theoretical physics), and in Schubert calculus (which has its origins in enumerative geometry, e.g., counting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions, but is currently related to modern areas such as quantum cohomology). By developing and studying combinatorial models for certain representations and related algebraic varieties, the PI will pursue efficient related computations; furthermore, this work is expected to lead to a better understanding of the mentioned mathematical objects and of the subtle connections between them. Some of the models developed in the project will be implemented in the open source computer algebra system SAGE. <br/><br/>This research project uses combinatorial structures and methods to solve problems in two main areas: the representation theory of Lie algebras and modern Schubert calculus on flag manifolds. An important avenue of this research is concerned with the alcove model, developed by the PI in collaboration with A. Postnikov; this is a combinatorial model for integrable highest weight representations of symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras, as well as for certain multiplication formulas in the K-theory of flag manifolds. New applications of the alcove model were given in recent work of the PI with S. Naito, D. Sagaki, A. Schilling, and M. Shimozono. These highlight interesting connections between Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules for affine Lie algebras, Macdonald polynomials, and the quantum K-theory of flag manifolds. The PI will further explore some of these connections. He will also pursue applications of the alcove model to formulas for Whittaker functions on p-adic groups, which are a basic tool in the theory of automorphic forms. In modern Schubert calculus, the PI will work on: unifying and extending various combinatorial models for the Schubert structure constants in ordinary cohomology, Schubert calculus beyond K-theory (e.g., in elliptic cohomology), and combinatorial aspects of the geometric Satake correspondence (which gives a geometric construction of irreducible Lie algebra representations, based on the affine Grassmannian)."

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together researchers and students interested in the theory of Hadamard matrices and their applications, as well as related areas such as combinatorial design theory, coding theory, quantum information theory and computer security. The participants will learn about the latest developments in these areas, and explore different visions for setting directions for future work.<br/><br/>Hadamard matrices are indispensable in engineering applications related to mobile communications, data transmission, and error-control codes. In 1893, the great French mathematician Jacques Hadamard posed a problem, which later became known as the Hadamard matrix conjecture, namely, that every positive integer divisible by 4 is the order of a square matrix with entries plus or minus one, and having pairwise orthogonal rows. Although many infinite classes of such matrices are known and a rich theory has evolved, this problem remains unresolved and has risen in the field of combinatorics to a status comparable to that held until recently by Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory."

The seminar is held at Colorado State University on a biweekly basis. It provides a forum for researchers from Colorado State University, Colorado University at Denver, and the University of Wyoming to exchange ideas and present their research results. The annual mini-conferences are held on a rotating basis at one of the participating universities in the Rocky Mountain area. <br/><br/>Combinatorics is an area of mathematics that studies discrete structures. It is often a stepping-stone to applied disciplines such as Computer Science, Information Theory, and Engineering. As such, it is well suited to open up an important branch of academia to a broader audience, thus helping to foster STEM education. This meeting series not only advances research in algebraic combinatorics but also  contributes to education in these important parts of science and technology.  This award supports participation in the meetings by approximately ten speakers and student participants annually during the three-year period August 2014 through July 2017.<br/><br/>Seminar web site: www-math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/algcomb.html"

More specifically, the PI will study the scaling limits of such models, which capture macroscopic effects of microscopic structure.  The PI is interested in three important classes of models arising from statistical physics.  First, there are cluster growth models for corrosion of metals and crystal formation.  Second, there are models of electrical properties of randomly composited materials.  Third, there are models which lie in the intersection of the previous two categories, such as those for fluid flow in porous media.  Many unresolved questions surround these models and are now of great interest in probability theory.  The PI aims to resolve some of these questions by (1) using computer simulation to identify new phenomena and (2) applying tools from analysis, combinatorics, and probability to rigorously understand the new phenomena.<br/><br/>The models alluded to above share a common theme; each is a diffusion processes on the integer lattice whose scaling limit can be interpreted as the solution of a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE).  The PI is primarily interested in three models: the Abelian sandpile, random walks in random environments, and first passage percolation.  The PI will study the interplay between the asymptotic statistics of the diffusion process and the regularity properties of the solutions of the limiting PDE.  Since the two sides here are tightly coupled, it is often possible and fruitful to transfer results between them.  The strategy will be to carefully adapt the regularity machinery of the limiting PDE to the discrete setting, since this occasionally leads to the discovery of new phenomena."
