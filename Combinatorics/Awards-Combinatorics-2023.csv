Combinatorics is the area of mathematics concerned with enumerating, understanding and characterizing mathematical structures that occur within discrete objects.  The results of this project will contribute to the growing connections between combinatorics and other mathematical disciplines.  This includes extending sharing theorems of classical Coxeter groups, using combinatorial methods to generalize and understand identities involved with the representation theory of Shimura varieties, and continuing the PI's successful program involving noncommutative polynomials that have applications to understanding polytopes, Whitney stratified spaces and the totally nonnegative flag variety.  Results from this award have the potential to give insight into discrete structures in other sciences including the noncommutative nature of DNA sequencing in biology, mathematical methods in coding theory and topological surfaces related to robotic motion.  The PI has been vigorously involved in research, educational and outreach activities to foster the growth of the mathematical workforce.  As a response to the isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this includes co-organizing a new regional lecture series to reinvigorate collaboration between students, postdocs and faculty.  Support of the PI's research program reinforces the NSF's goals of scientific progress, building new talent, fostering innovation and improving society.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project includes four subprojects involving combinatorics broadly defined, plus ongoing graduate research projects.  Results from the award will contribute to the growing connections between combinatorics with geometry, topology, algebra and number theory, and to make fundamental contributions to classical areas of combinatorics.  Project I involves the PI's new work with Ehrenborg and Morel on extensions of sharing theorems to Coxeter arrangements, and using Herb's theory of 2-structures to give dissection proofs and generalizations to intrinsic volumes.  Extensions to other geometric settings will be studied, including regular complex polytopes and the Nandakumar--Rao conjecture.  Project II involves the PI's joint work with Ehrenborg and Goresky on topological face enumeration of Whitney stratified spaces, more generally, zeta functions of quasi-graded posets.  This widens the research program to understand and make progress on face vector inequalities for polytopes and singular spaces.  The PI and Ehrenborg develop a non-homogeneous extension of the classical cd-index to labeled digraphs satisfying a balanced condition to generalize the setting of Eulerian graded posets and include the family of Bruhat graphs as a special case.  Project III includes a conjecture for balanced digraphs which implies the Billera--Brenti nonnegativity conjecture for the cd-index of Bruhat graphs.  Project IV concerns extending the combinatorics of the generalized Harish-Chandra character formula.  The PI will continue her educational, regional and national activities to support the long-range goal to attract, retain and train more under-represented groups in the mathematical sciences and ultimately increase the number of STEM-educated individuals in the workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polytopes are geometric objects that include polygons, pyramids, cubes, octahedra, and their higher-dimensional analogs. They have been looked at and studied since antiquity; at present, they play a role in such diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics as optimization, statistics, combinatorics, representation theory, symplectic geometry, to name just a few. Using polytopes as building blocks and gluing them along their faces, one creates polytopal complexes. If the polytopes used are line segments, triangles, pyramids, and their higher-dimensional generalizations, one obtains a special class of polytopal complexes known as simplicial complexes. These objects appear naturally in robotics, discrete geometry, and topology, since they provide a simple way to approximate continuous spaces, such as manifolds, by discrete objects. Simplicial complexes are also useful in describing patterns of intersections of sets. Specifically, patterns of intersections of convex sets have applications in such subjects as neuro-biology (e.g., in the study of neurons which are simultaneously active in response to some stimulus).  This research project aims to deepen our understanding of various aspects of polytopes and simplicial complexes. The award will also provide support of research training for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The primary aim of this project is to gain new insights and enhance our understanding of combinatorial, algebraic, geometric, and topological invariants of simplicial complexes and polytopes through the study of their face numbers, face rings, and stress spaces, and, in the process, to develop new tools to achieve this. Specifically, research on this project will attack several fundamental questions related to (1) the upper bound type problems originated in but going far beyond the classical upper bound theorem for spheres, (2) the lower bound type problems for simplicial complexes, especially simplicial spheres, with an additional structure such as flagness, and (3) finding new construction techniques to produce many simplicial polytopes and spheres with interesting extremal properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to obtain quantitative improvements to a myriad of both classical and cutting-edge results that rely on the interplay between structure and randomness in additive combinatorics, number theory, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry. In turn, these improvements should have applications in multiple areas of computer science such as coding theory, property testing, and derandomization. This project further aims to expand access to combinatorics research, both by involving students in research projects, and by creating educational opportunities for students and the general public. <br/><br/>The research in this project has two main aspects. The first is focused on polynomials, aiming to improve the best bounds known for results that build on the structure-vs-randomness phenomenon, and in particular, on regularization of polynomials. A main theme here is leveraging recent progress in the study of tensor ranks, and in the study of quantitative versions of classical theorems about polynomials (e.g., Stillman's conjecture, finite-field Nullstellensatz). The second aspect of this research is focused on general functions that, nonetheless, behave like polynomials to some extent. A central aim here is to improve or develop new variants of general-purpose tools such as the arithmetic regularity lemma, with the goal of making progress towards the Polynomial Gowers Inverse conjecture and other central questions in higher-order Fourier analysis and additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ancient Greeks studied polytopes such as the Platonic solids as they are ideal to model nature. In modern days, scientists have found many applications of polytopes in diverse fields such as optimization and computer science. This research project focuses on the combinatorial ?invariants? of polytopes. For example, count the number V of vertices, E of edges, and F of facets of an arbitrary 3-dimensional polytope. Then no matter which polytope we choose, we always end up with getting the identity ?V-E+F=2?. The goal of this research project is to develop new methods to study various invariants of polytopes and spheres that arise from face numbers or other combinatorial data. These tools may further extend our understanding of the interplay between combinatorics, algebra, and geometry. <br/><br/>One of the central conjectures in geometric combinatorics was the g-conjecture; that is, to characterize the face numbers of simplicial polytopes and spheres of all dimensions. This conjecture was only proved very recently, and its resolution requires deep results from other fields such as commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. This project is dedicated to new methods to study polytopes and manifolds with particular geometry or topology. One goal is to investigate various combinatorial models such as the Stanley-Reisner ring and the stress spaces, and how the algebra translates into combinatorial relations among the face number. Another goal is to investigate how preset geometry and topology (for example, central symmetry) affects the combinatorics of polytopes or polyhedral complexes, and vice versa.

They are also important in particle physics, where they are related to scattering amplitudes in certain quantum field theories. Hence a better understanding of cluster algebras is not only interesting in its own right, but also has significant potential application in other areas of mathematics and beyond. The project will provide training for students through involvement in the research.<br/><br/>In more detail, when a topological space is expected to admit a cell decomposition, it is desirable to find an actual decomposition.

This definition might remind the reader of a commonly known puzzle called ?sudoku? which is a 9 by 9 Latin square with some additional constraints. The study of Latin squares dates back to the 1700s to the work of Euler. Latin squares have connections to various subfields in mathematics. For example, they are multiplication tables of quasigroups from algebra, they are used as error-correcting codes when one wishes to transmit data via a noisy channel such as power lines, etc. No matter how one fills a 3 by 3 Latin square, it is always possible to pick three cells, no two of which share a row, a column or a symbol. Such a collection of cells is called a transversal. In contrast, it is not possible to find a transversal in a two by two Latin square. A famous conjecture from the 1960s due to Ryser asserts that for odd n, it is always possible to find a transversal in an n by n Latin square. In the graph theoretic language, this is equivalent to the problem of finding a so-called rainbow matching in a properly edge-colored complete bipartite graph with partition sizes equal to n. This project aims to explore various problems which are related to finding certain rainbow structures in colored graphs. The current project, while combinatorially stated, has connections to other fields of mathematics, such as discrete  geometry and algebra, and solutions will likely involve some use of algebraic and probabilistic methods thus creating further connections between combinatorics and other fields of mathematics. Graduate students will be trained as part of this project.<br/><br/>In this project we will explore questions related to the existence of various spanning and non-spanning colored structures in colored graphs. A rainbow subgraph of a colored graph is a subgraph in which each edge has a distinct color. We plan to work on questions that have two common themes at heart. The first one is understanding the structure and properties of an object, for example, a graph, given it does not contain some forbidden sub-object, for example, a rainbow subgraph.  These can be viewed as Turan-type problems adapted to the colored setting, where one wants to find, say the maximum number of edges in a properly edge-colored graph on a given number of vertices without containing a fixed rainbow subgraph.  The second type of problems we will study is to find out under what restrictions a colored graph has certain spanning or almost-spanning rainbow subgraphs, such as long or Hamiltonian paths, spanning or almost spanning trees, a perfect or almost perfect matching. The problems to study include but are not limited to the existence of large rainbow matchings in graphs, existence of large matchings in hypergraphs, the existence of rainbow bases for vector spaces and matroids, Turan-type problems and their rainbow analogues such as the appearance of a rational number as a Turan exponent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, these rich interactions have led to several remarkable developments between these two fields, and the goal of this project is to essentially capitalize as much as possible on this momentum. <br/><br/>The first part of this project concerns Ramsey theory around the Erd?s-Szekeres problem about the existence of large convex polytopes in finite configurations of point sets in general position, with an eye particularly towards establishing new upper bounds for various classical Ramsey numbers for graphs and hypergraphs.

Surprisingly, many breakthroughs in this area use tools from equivariant topology, which may, at first glance, seem far detached from the original goal.  This project will reinforce the connections between computational geometry, combinatorics, and topology.  Success in the objectives of this project will illuminate new connections between these areas.  The project will also establish a program to prepare students from minoritized groups for summer research opportunities in mathematics. <br/><br/>The topological problems of this proposal deal with high-dimensional mass partition problems, such as the Stone-Tukey theorem.  The project focuses on establishing connections with general fair partition problems (related to envy-free partitions) and problems related to the intersection patterns of convex sets.  These are areas in which crucial results use similar methods.  This project will show that said similarity is a consequence of a deeper connection between the families of problems listed.

For instance, in most recommendation systems, the rows of the matrix represent customers, and the columns represent products, the entries are the (potential) rating of a customer for the corresponding product. Since data comes with noise, it is important to measure the impact of noise on the information we would like to deduce (in most cases, in terms of some matrix parameters). Given the popularity of the spectral method in data science, the problem has been studied by scientists across many fields for a century. However, in modern data science, it has been observed that very often, the data matrix has some structure, such as being low rank. The PI aims to develop a new theory with this restriction, which would improve many classical mathematical results, and at the same time, would lead to better estimates and faster algorithms for many real-life problems. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>Consider a matrix (which represents data). In practice, we often have access to a noise version of it, where each entry is added with some noise (or the whole matrix is added to a noise matrix). Classical perturbation theorems, such as Weyl or Davis-Kahan, provide us with estimates for the difference between key parameters of the original matrix (such as leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors) and their noisy counterparts. These results are sharp in worst cases analysis. However, in modern data science, data often has a low-rank structure, and noise is random. Under these assumptions, the PI has observed that one can provide much better bounds. Under this project, the PI will obtain optimal bounds under the above assumption, in various norms. The PI and his students will also attack several well-known algorithmic problems, such as matrix completion and Gaussian mixtures, using the spectral method combined with these new tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combinatorics is a subfield of mathematics concerned with the study of discrete structures.  This project will investigate graphs and matroids, which are two classical topics in combinatorics.  A graph is essentially the same as a network, a concept which is now widely known due to the popularity of social networks.  On the other hand, a matroid is a structure which abstracts the notion of linear independence in mathematics, e.g. whether or not three given points in a plane lie on a common line.  Combinatorics admits many important connections with algebraic geometry, which is the study of solutions to polynomial equations, and tropical geometry which is a combinatorial version of algebraic geometry. One of the strengths of tropical geometry is that some difficult questions in algebraic geometry can be reduced to problems in combinatorics.  There is a complementary strength of this theory: it provides a new perspective on classical combinatorial objects such as graphs and matroids, which can be viewed as tropical curves and tropical linear spaces, respectively, thus opening these fields up to new techniques and questions.  This project will investigate graphs and matroids from the perspective of tropical geometry.  The project will also provide research opportunities and support for graduate students, as well as outreach activities to rural high schools in Vermont.<br/> <br/>A graph can be viewed as the tropicalization of a curve over a non-Archimedean field.  Divisor theory for curves then translates to the classical study of chip-firing.  This has allowed for deep insights into chip-firing such as the Riemann-Roch theorem for graphs.  The PI aims to further understand divisor theory for graphs, connections to graph orientations, combinatorial representation theory, and the Tutte polynomial.  Tropical geometry is concerned with the study of balanced polyhedral complexes even when they do not arise as the tropicalizations of varieties.  This perspective has been very fruitful in recent years as all matroids, not only the realizable ones, fit into this framework.  The PI will further investigate Hodge theory for matroids as well as tropical connections to more classical aspects of polytope theory such as associahedra and other families of generalized permutahedra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use algebraic objects and methods to produce new combinatorial results, leveraging braid varieties--a sort of algebraic space associated to a knot--as a unifying tool.  Funds will additionally support training graduate students and outreach efforts, including work on an interactive online discrete mathematics textbook.<br/><br/>In more detail, this proposal suggests a framework for producing combinatorial results using braid varieties over finite fields, Hecke algebra traces, rational Cherednik algebras, and a new relationship with noncrossing combinatorics.  The framework has already proven successful in producing substantial new results: the PI's recent joint work with Galashin, Lam, and Trinh resolved two decades-long open problems in Coxeter-Catalan combinatorics, simultaneously producing the first definition of rational noncrossing Coxeter-Catalan objects, while also giving the first uniform enumeration of noncrossing objects.  Connections to Macdonald theory--diagonal harmonics and q,t-combinatorics--are also expected when working over the complex numbers.  At different levels of generality, different techniques become available.  For finite Coxeter groups, it is possible to compute everything in a case-by-case manner using an explicit decomposition of the Hecke algebra, and there are many interesting combinatorial and representation-theoretic problems open for immediate attack.  Special classes of elements in finite type have favorable representation-theoretic properties that allow for uniform approaches.  For affine Weyl groups, the main tool is a trace formula for translations, due to Opdam.  For example, the proposed framework recovers some Tessler matrix identities due to Haglund in this setting.  For general Kac-Moody Weyl groups, we are reduced to general recursive and cluster-theoretic methods.

These enumeration questions counting linear subspaces satisfying certain geometric conditions have been considered since the late 1800s and have sparked many advances in mathematics including the development of modern intersection theory. Solutions to these enumeration questions connect to areas outside of mathematics through Gromov-Witten invariants and quantum cohomology. The formalism for solving such problems, known as Schubert calculus, is now rigorous, though the original question of enumerating linear subspaces remains largely unsolved. This project will develop simple combinatorial rules for computing these numbers. The vertically integrated research program will incorporate training for undergraduates, masters and doctoral students, and postdoctoral scholars. <br/><br/>The first milestone is to develop rules in the cohomology ring of the classical flag manifold that occur in the product of an arbitrary Schubert class by one pulled back from a Grassmannian projection. The second milestone will utilize combinatorial crystal graphs to extend this rule to products of Demazure characters. The ultimate goal of this ambitious project is to generalize these two cases to give rules for the product of any two Schubert classes, thereby resolving the fundamental Schubert problem for the complete flag manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project mainly concerns the area of graph theory, an active area of combinatorics which has been booming in recent years because of its connection to other areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. Many graph theory problems also have practical motivations. Most of the world can be represented as large networks consisting of nodes and the connections between certain pairs of them. For example, a social network such as Facebook has over 2 billion users as nodes and friendship relations as connections; a biological network like the brain has over 100 billion neurons as nodes and synapses as connections. Understanding those networks and designing fast algorithms on them provides much practical value, examples include understanding how news spreads in a social network, understanding brain functions or diseases and improving artificial neural networks for machine learning applications. This project considers several fundamental questions in extremal graph theory. The project also provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>There are multiple techniques the PI plans to use and further develop, including regularity methods such as Szemeredi's regularity lemma and weak regularity lemmas; analytic tools such as graph limits, random processes and entropy methods; and various other combinatorial tools. The first project is related to Szemeredi's regularity lemma, which is an extremely powerful tool in modern graph theory which spurred a dramatic change of how we view and study graphs. It is a major direction of research to study which applications of the regularity lemma have considerably better bounds. The PI will work on several classical questions where the goal is to improve our understanding of the power and limitation of the regularity method through understanding the bounds in various important applications. Another major project is to determine when random constructions using the probabilistic method give optimal or nearly optimal bounds. Several classical topics include Sidorenko's conjecture, Ramsey theory, and related questions in graph limits. The goal is to better understand this general direction through studying several closely related and concrete problems and gain more insight on the connections between these topics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will focus on developing a high-dimensional version of graph embeddings and decompositions.

Groups are fundamental objects in mathematics and ubiquitous in real life; for example, the numbers on a 12-hour clock form a group of 12 elements. The addressed problems are of combinatorial nature; for example, if we take any subset of a group, then as long as the subset is ''large'' in some sense (without any assumption on its structure), we predict that some pattern will emerge.

The PI will also be involved in K-12 outreach.<br/><br/>The groups studied in this project are: (1) The integers and their polynomial ring analogs, for which techniques from number theory apply, (2) finite groups, including vector spaces over finite fields, for which techniques from algebra apply, and (3) more general amenable groups, for which techniques from Fourier analysis and ergodic theory apply. Problems studied in this proposal include the following: If a subset A of a group G is large in some sense (e.g. A has positive density, or comes from a finite partition of G), then can one find structures in sumsets such as A-A and A+A-A? This question is intimately related to various notions of recurrence in ergodic theory and topological dynamics. If A is a sparse set, e.g. a subset of the primes, then this question will lead to patterns hitherto unexplored in the primes.

The CAAC is an annual three-day interdisciplinary conference for mathematicians that brings together algebraists interested in discrete mathematics and combinatoricists interested in algebra. The conference focuses on the interplay between algebra and combinatorics and their applications to other areas of mathematics and science. The 20th iteration of CAAC will bring together the mathematical research communities of Canada and the United States, as well as some mathematicians from other continents. CAAC strives to be an inclusive conference that promotes collaboration, development of young talent, and progress in this field.<br/><br/>CAAC 2023 will feature presentations on a wide array of topics in combinatorial algebra, algebraic combinatorics, and their applications. These topics include Newton-Okounkov bodies, chromatic symmetric functions, enumeration, cluster algebras, monomial ideals, dynamical algebraic combinatorics, plethysm, toric varieties, and geometric vertex decomposition. There will also be a poster session for early-career participants to share their work. More details are available on the conference website, https://sites.google.com/view/caac2023/home.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
