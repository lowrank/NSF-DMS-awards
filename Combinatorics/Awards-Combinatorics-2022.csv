They provide simplified abstract models for large complex networks ? such as telecommunication networks, social networks, the Internet, and neural networks ? for which an explicit deterministic description is often impractical or not available. Interest in the subject has grown in recent years due to the ubiquitous proliferation of such networks and the need of a theoretical framework for their analysis. Many fundamental properties of graphs can be formulated in terms of their spanning substructures ? such as spanning trees, Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings. Such structures are quintessential in graph theory and play a central role in other fields such as computer science, combinatorial optimization, and statistical physics. This research project aims to extend mathematical understanding of spanning structures in several models of random graphs by addressing fundamental open questions in the field. In addition, this project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The analysis of spanning structures in random graphs is a central theme with a long tradition in probabilistic combinatorics. However, many basic questions that are well understood for the classical Erd?s-Rényi graphs remain wide open for other fundamental models of random graphs. The investigator plans to settle some of these open questions concerning the existence, emergence, and packing of spanning structures (and their rainbow counterparts) in several models of random graphs, including random geometric graphs, preferential attachment graphs, and random lifts. The constrained nature of these models makes their analysis significantly different from (and often more challenging than) that of Erd?s-Rényi graphs. To overcome these obstacles, the research incorporates novel approaches that combine geometric, probabilistic, and combinatorial ingredients.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Combinatorics program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While Algebraic Geometry has often been considered a solely pure area of mathematics, the community of researchers of CCAAGS-22 promotes its applied and computational nature. Participants of CCAAGS-22 combine Algebraic Geometry with the techniques and methods from symbolic and numeric computation, algorithms, complexity theory, as well as problems motivated by applications in multiple fields. These methods have already seen applications in biology, coding theory, cryptography, combustion, computational geometry, computer graphics, quantum computing, control theory, geometric design, complexity theory, machine learning, nonlinear partial differential equations, optimization, robotics, and statistics, among others. The interaction between algebraic geometry and any of these other disciplines is beneficial for both sides.<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers and promotes interdisciplinary work in a fast growing area. After the lack of contact during the pandemic, this is a long overdue event. It is particularly useful for junior researchers whose careers strongly depend on making connections and networking.

Graphs are combinatorial objects that have been extensively studied in mathematics and used for modeling systems in engineering, statistics, biology, economics, and many other disciplines. Graphs can be used to represent spaces or networks and to encode distance between points in spaces or machines in networks. Asymptotic dimension is a notion that concerns large-scale behaviors of such spaces or networks studied in metric geometry, geometric group theory, and distributed computing. The PI and his collaborators recently used tools from structural graph theory, a central research area in combinatorics, to establish results about asymptotic dimension, showing possibilities for attacking open questions in different areas in mathematics. This project aims to further explore this direction by developing novel structural theorems about graphs motivated by their potential applications to computer science and metric geometry, including but not limited to questions about asymptotic dimension. This project contains an education component, including student mentoring, research opportunities for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students, and course development, with outreach activities designed for K-12 students and the public.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop novel graph structural theorems and apply them to solve open questions in combinatorics, theoretical computer science, and other areas in mathematics. The first direction is to study metric spaces supported by minor-closed families of graphs. Embedding problems and related applications in computer science for such metrics have attracted wide attention. One goal of this project is to develop new structural theorems for minor-closed families to attack those problems. The second direction is to study graph classes with polynomial expansion. Such graph classes have been extensively studied in computer science and geometric graph theory due to its tight connection to separator theory.  A goal of this project is to develop decomposition theorems for such classes without involving separator theory to pave a novel way for studying those classes. A potential application is to determine the sparsity hierarchy for graph classes with finite asymptotic dimension. The third direction addresses the emerging induced graph minor theory, which combines graph minor theory and induced subgraph theory, two major directions in structural graph theory. An objective of this project is to study this area by extending the existing graph minor theory for sparse graphs to theory for dense graphs via notions inspired from asymptotic dimension and metric geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are two natural ways to describe the local structure of a graph: by asking what graphs occur as minors, and by asking what graphs occur as induced subgraphs. The theory of graph minors was developed by Robertson and Seymour, and gives a very satisfactory picture. However, the picture for induced subgraphs is more complex and much less is known. The goal of this project is to extend the theory of induced subgraphs. What can we say about the graphs that have no induced subgraph of some special type? Graduate students will be trained as part of the project.<br/><br/>A central problem in the field is the Erdos-Hajnal conjecture. It has been known since the results of Ramsey and of Erdos and of Szekeres in the 1930s that every graph has a clique or stable set of size at least logarithmic in the number of vertices.  However, Erdos and Hajnal conjectured in the 1980s that forbidding any induced subgraph H causes a dramatic jump, resulting in cliques or stable sets of polynomial size.<br/>Recently the PIs (joint with two others) settled the smallest open case, which had been a famous question since the problem was first proposed in the 1980's; and even more recently they have made substantial progress on the next smallest case. These two steps both used new techniques, and it is hoped that these techniques will lead to further progress on this and related problems. More broadly, what is the structure that results when some graph is excluded as an induced subgraph? We don't expect to get a structure that is necessary and sufficient for excluding a particular graph (this already seems hopeless for excluding a six-vertex graph); but it is more likely that there is a structure that is necessary for excluding a given graph and sufficient for excluding some larger graph. This would be the first step towards a general structural theory for induced subgraphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its optimal value is called the chromatic index. In addition to its great theoretical interest, ECP arises in various applications such as the scheduling problem and fiber-optic communication.  It has attracted tremendous research efforts in several fields, such as graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and theoretical computer science. Holyer in 1981 proved that it is NP-complete in general to determine the chromatic index, so there is no efficient algorithm for solving the ECP exactly unless NP=P. Hence, extensive research has been focusing on near-optimal solutions, good estimates of the chromatic index, and some conditions under which the ECP can be precisely solved in polynomial-time.  The Goldberg-Seymour conjecture, confirmed recently by the PI and his collaborators, implies that we can approximate the chromatic index within one of its true value in polynomial time. The proposed research lies in determining the families of graphs whose chromatic index can be found in polynomial-time, which the PI has been and will continue working on with his current and former graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>A noticeable lower bound for the chromatic index is the maximum degree. The relationship between these two invariants is well studied, with many beautiful results.  Apart from the maximum degree, there is another lower bound for the chromatic index, called density. Some longstanding conjectures have been brought forward on the roles that density plays when determining the chromatic index, however, most of which lack techniques to attack.  The combination of these two lower bounds gives a classification of all (multi)graphs: a graph is of the first class if its chromatic index equals the maximum value of these two lower bounds and is of the second class otherwise. Clearly, the first class graphs are those whose chromatic index can be computed polynomial-time, and all class one simple graphs are of the first class. This project aims to show several commonly known families of graphs belonging to the first class. There are three longstanding unsolved problems in this direction (stated initially in different terms): simple graphs with a large maximum degree are of the first class (Hilton?s Overfull Conjecture); all planar graphs are of the first class (Seymour?s Exact Conjecture); the graph obtained from a regular simple graph by doubling each edge is of the first class (The Generalized Fulkerson Conjecture).  The methods developed by the PI and his collaborators recently have shown some potential for more substantial progress toward these problems. Additionally, the PI plans to extend the techniques developed for edge-coloring to tackle some problems in graph total-coloring, including Goldberg?s conjecture on the equality of the total chromatic number and the chromatic index.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some instances of these counting problems are difficult to count exactly and one can instead study bounds, asymptotics, and large-scale behaviors of these numbers as well as using geometric structures encoding the objects that are counted. Abstractly these problems can be studied with the following mathematical objects: ""integer flows on a graph"", ""Schubert polynomials of permutations"", and ""graph vertex colorings"", respectively that have connections to other fields of mathematics and other areas like computer science, and physics.<br/><br/>More concretely, this project studies problems in enumerative, algebraic, and asymptotic combinatorics with connections to representation theory and geometry. The project has three parts. The first part is about finding a ¨q-analogue¨ of a constant term identity of Zeilberger to compute volumes of flow polytopes and establishing a connection between this identity and the famous Selberg integral. The second part is about studying the large-scale behavior of Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials using existing combinatorial models like rc-graphs, bumpless pipe dreams, and excited diagrams. The last part is about studying chromatic symmetric functions of Dyck paths, which are the object of the famous Stanley--Stembridge--Shareshian--Wachs conjecture.

Both problems have significant theoretical importance and have broad applications in fields such as combinatorial optimization and computer science. In general, finding an optimal edge partition of a certain kind is an NP-complete problem, so is determining the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph. Under the background of two famous conjectures from the two areas, this project dedicates to developing sufficient conditions that guarantee an optimal edge partition of a given type or the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph and developing novel techniques for both areas of research. The project also contains research problems that are suitable for students.<br/><br/>Specifically, the PI will continue her investigation of two longstanding conjectures: the Overfull Conjecture of Chetwynd and Hilton from 1986 and the Toughness Conjecture of Chvatal from 1973. The PI and her collaborators have recently made significant contributions to both conjectures, but they remain open. For the Overfull Conjecture, extending some techniques that she and her collaborators developed recently, the PI will first investigate it for large graphs of order n and minimum degree arbitrarily close to half of n and explore algorithmic aspects.  Then she will attack the conjecture for large graphs with only maximum degree constraints by applying and extending results obtained from the first step. She will also expand the techniques to attack the related Linear Arboricity Conjecture. For the Toughness Conjecture, the PI will gain more insights into it by working on a series of problems in finding spanning substructures under a given toughness condition. The problems include two challenging questions posed by Bauer, Broersma, and Schmeichel in a survey on graph toughness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a large fast developing area with deep ideas and powerful tools. The area also is closely related to other parts of mathematics, computer science and operation research. We consider two types of basic extremal problems on graphs and hypergraphs: on the existence of paths and cycles of a given kind and on special partitions of the set of vertices or edges of a (hyper)graph (mainly involving its cycle structure). Since cycles and paths are very natural substructures of graphs and hypergraphs, understanding problems on their existence will help in resolving other extremal problems. The PI plans to involve into work on the problems of the grant several graduate students and very recent graduates  of the University of Illinois. The research guidance for them contributes to their professional development and reputation.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study a series of extremal problems related to paths and cycles in graphs and hypergraphs and to colorings, especially when the answers depend on the cycle structure.  In fact, in most coloring problems the cycle structure is important. In a number of problems we will consider (hyper)graphs with restrictions on degree structure. Examples are: (hyper)graphs with bounded maximum degree, or with bounded maximum average degree, or with given degeneracy, or k-regular, or with high minimum degree. Among important topics are  Turan-type problems on cycles and paths in graphs and ordered graphs, problems on different kinds of cycles and paths in hypergraphs,  extremal problems on different types of coloring, Ramsey-type problems for cycles and paths, DP-colorings, list coloring,  improper colorings, graph reconstruction problems when the known subgraphs have less than n-1 vertices, saturation problems for hypergraphs.

This project seeks to develop new theory for such random graph processes, in order to better understand their properties, improve existing methods of analysis, and rigorously justify their applications. In doing so, the proposed research addresses long-standing open questions in phase transition of dependent random graph processes. The goal of this research is to show that a variety of dependent random graph processes exhibit similar phase transition behavior. Another major thrust of the proposed research is to transfer these new analytical tools from constrained random graph processes to resolve open questions in extremal combinatorics, including Ramsey and Turan type problems. These new mathematical tools can also be used to tackle related problems arising in network science, number theory, computer science, and engineering. The educational component includes annual K-12 math teacher workshops, research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students,and a multidisciplinary workshop/summer school for junior researchers and undergraduates.<br/><br/><br/>The main theme of this project is the development of new theory and applications for time-evolving random graph processes with dependencies (that grow step-by-step according to specific rules or structural constraints). One goal is to establish fundamental phase transition properties such as location/existence of critical points, bounds on the second largest component, and analyticity of scaling limits. A second goal is to justify the universality paradigm, i.e., prove that the phase transition of a range of dependent random graph processes such as the random d-process belong to the same universality class. To this end we will develop a general proof framework which allows us to show, among others, that the largest giant component grows at a linear rate in the supercritical phase. Another goal is to improve/sharpen the analysis of constrained random graph processes such as the H-free process. Here one key ingredient is a more robust analysis framework based on semi-randomization (that works under much weaker technical assumptions), which will allow us to significantly broaden the scope of applications in Ramsey and Turan theory. Each of these goals is related to analytic, combinatorial, and probabilistic properties, and this project focuses on development of new mathematical theory at the intersection of these areas, and will enable us to attack important and challenging questions pertaining to explosive percolation and other well-known and notoriously difficult open problems in the area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those extremal objects often have unique properties and structures, giving insights in many mathematical fields. Over the last twenty years, several new techniques, many using the assistance of computers, have been extraordinarily successful in studying extremal objects. One of the recent powerful methods is based on the theory of flag algebras. This method enables researchers to translate extremal combinatorics questions into instances of semidefinite programs, which can then be explored with the help of a computer and academic as well as commercial software. This translation has led to recent breakthroughs on longstanding open questions. The method is versatile and can be applied in various settings such as graphs, hypergraphs, permutations, oriented graphs, point sets, embedded graphs, and phylogenetic trees. The aim of this focused research group is to resolve three prominent types of open questions by Erd?s, Turán, and Zarankiewicz using these techniques.<br/><br/>The three types of questions to be studied share the general flavor of generalized Turán problems, and solving them would have far reaching consequences. The first type are extremal hypergraph questions, the second type concerns finding maximum cuts in graphs with certain properties, and the third type are questions related to the crossing number of graphs. For all three, the use of flag algebras has recently led to significant progress but not to full solutions. This project will combine the expertise of the investigators with a concentrated effort and further method development to resolve these open questions.

It is a field that is currently experiencing intensive progress, in sometimes unexpected directions. In recent years, many important classical questions have seen spectacular advances based on new techniques; conversely, methods developed in analytic number theory have led to the solution of striking problems in other fields. The main goal of this research project is to make progress on the distributional properties of primes and other related arithmetic objects, by developing further the classical analytic tools and the more modern additive combinatorial tools, and by understanding how to effectively combine these two different tools together. It is hoped that the need for stronger results to cater for applications in analytic number theory will drive the development of additive combinatorics, and vice versa. The grant will also be used to help train graduate students in the area.<br/><br/>More specifically, the PI will continue his work surrounding additive problems with primes. These works will involve developing both analytic tools and combinatorial tools. On the analytic side, the PI will continue to investigate the theory of Gowers norms for multiplicative functions and for the von-Mangoldt function, which are higher-order extensions to classical exponential sum estimates involving these functions. On the combinatorial side, the PI expects to develop tools from additive combinatorics for locating arithmetic structures within dense sets of integers and discover new mechanisms for using them to exhibit such structures in the primes. The additive combinatorial ideas behind these tools, such as pseudorandomness and Gowers uniformity norms, have a strong link with topics in theoretical computer science such as extractors and expanders, property testing, and error-correcting codes.

One major direction of the project is to deepen our understanding of the nature of random discrete structures. This is of central interest in probabilistic combinatorics, and the study of random discrete structures is also closely related to several other disciplines, including statistical physics and theoretical computer science. This area has gone through major progress in recent years, and the PI has been working towards a deeper understanding and further development of the new tools and techniques. The project also includes classical enumeration problems on several discrete structures that are closely related to computer science. Studying these problems has been developing lots of interesting and beautiful techniques that cut across mathematical boundaries. <br/><br/>The project focuses on problems roughly relating to two topics. The first topic is the threshold phenomena of random discrete structures. A big goal here is to prove the Kahn-Kalai Conjecture, which concerns relationships between thresholds and expectation thresholds in random graphs and related systems. Other problems are mostly open questions about thresholds for increasing properties. In attacking these problems, the PI has been aiming to test the strength and limitations of the methods in the resolution of a conjecture of Talagrand, a fractional version of the Kahn-Kalai Conjecture. The second topic is asymptotic enumeration problems on the Hamming cube (and related structures), and related isoperimetric questions on the cube which are now of independent interest. Various tools (such as the graph container method, its combination with polymer models and cluster expansion method, stability for isoperimetric properties of the cube) are expected to be exploited and improved to solve the problems here.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will help in the training of the next generation of mathematicians in algebraic combinatorics and graph theory working on fundamental problems in quantum computing (a highly critical area whose growing importance has far-reaching consequences).An important intellectual scientific challenge of the past several decades is the quest to understand and harness the power of quantum information and computation. It is known that a quantum-assisted computation can perform sensitive tasks that are difficult for classical computers. To achieve this scientific challenge, quantum information science requires a broad participation ranging from physicists studying exotic quantum systems to mathematicians exploring abstract structures which lead to unexpected applications. The supported activity will foster and encourage the scientific participation and interaction of researchers from interdisciplinary mathematical areas to advance knowledge in quantum information science.<br/><br/>The existence of a quantum computer is a well-known threat to cryptographic systems widely used in protecting sensitive information for financial, medical, and national security applications. On the other hand, the use of quantum technology for secure communication has also been demonstrated to be effective. It is important that the U.S. maintains and expands its current edge in this expanding and fast-moving scientific field. This grant will support early-career and junior U.S. scientists working in mathematics, physics, and computer science, to participate in an international research meeting on quantum information science.

Graph theory is often called upon for modeling relations between data items. However, for large and dense graphs, maintaining pairwise distances between all pairs of vertices would be computationally prohibitive. A spanner is a sparse substructure that approximates distances in the original network?the approximation ratio is called the stretch factor. Spanners have increasingly been used for the efficient representation of distances between vertices in both practice and theory. Their performance is particularly impressive in geometric settings, where the stretch factor can be arbitrarily close to one. Recent results in computing have made significant progress in developing efficient algorithms over the last few years and raised new combinatorial questions about the asymptotic behavior of the minimum weight, size, and diameter of a geometric spanner in terms of its stretch factor. This project will study optimization on geometric spanners from a combinatorial standpoint. The involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the project will contribute to training a highly skilled workforce familiar with the asymptotic behavior of large graphs and prepared to tackle new challenges in our data-driven society.<br/><br/>This project studies several closely related questions concerning geometric spanner networks from the perspective of extremal combinatorics. One group of questions involves the asymptotic behavior of spanners as the stretch factor tends to one. It aims to determine the dependence of the minimum weight of a t-spanner on the stretch factor t for n points in geometric scenarios: in a d-dimensional unit cube, in spaces with doubling dimension d, or in a section of the integer lattice. It will explore tradeoffs between the graph-diameter of a spanner and its minimum lightness, sparsity, or weight. When Steiner points are allowed, tradeoffs between the number of Steiner points and other optimization criteria are also of great interest. Another group of questions involves spanners for intersection graphs of geometric objects, which are relevant in applications in wireless network design. The project aims to derive upper and lower bounds on the minimum size of t-spanners, for small values of t, for the intersection graphs of balls, hyperrectangles, and other geometric objects in d-space. New insights into the behavior of near-optimal spanners and the limitations of feasible spanners under various parameter settings will guide the development of efficient approximation algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those extremal objects often have unique properties and structures, giving insights in many mathematical fields. Over the last twenty years, several new techniques, many using the assistance of computers, have been extraordinarily successful in studying extremal objects. One of the recent powerful methods is based on the theory of flag algebras. This method enables researchers to translate extremal combinatorics questions into instances of semidefinite programs, which can then be explored with the help of a computer and academic as well as commercial software. This translation has led to recent breakthroughs on longstanding open questions. The method is versatile and can be applied in various settings such as graphs, hypergraphs, permutations, oriented graphs, point sets, embedded graphs, and phylogenetic trees. The aim of this focused research group is to resolve three prominent types of open questions by Erd?s, Turán, and Zarankiewicz using these techniques.<br/><br/>The three types of questions to be studied share the general flavor of generalized Turán problems, and solving them would have far reaching consequences. The first type are extremal hypergraph questions, the second type concerns finding maximum cuts in graphs with certain properties, and the third type are questions related to the crossing number of graphs. For all three, the use of flag algebras has recently led to significant progress but not to full solutions. This project will combine the expertise of the investigators with a concentrated effort and further method development to resolve these open questions. It is planned to find connections to more traditional methods such as the stability method and linear algebraic methods. A substantial number of students and early-career researchers will be trained and supported at the three institutions, and several focused workshops are planned.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polytopes, one of the central subjects of geometric combinatorics, have numerous applications not only in branches in pure math such as algebra, algebraic geometry and number theory, but also in other fields like statistics, economics, and optimization. The simplest way to understand polytopes is that they are high-dimensional generalizations of polygons, and they can be constructed by taking the intersection of half spaces. Familiar three-dimensional polytopes include tetrahedra, cubes, octahedra, and dodecahedra. There are many aspects of polytopes one can study. Counting integer points is a fundamental enumerative problem, which has real-life applications in counting the number of integer solutions of a set of linear constraints in multiple variables. This is related to one of the two major research directions in this project. The other major direction is on construction of polytopes satisfying certain conditions. In general, many of the problems addressed in this project have a combinatorial nature, which makes them sufficiently accessible that they may be integrated into course material and student research projects. In particular, research described in two parts of the project involves simple combinatorial objects, and the PI plans to build one topic into an undergraduate research project.<br/><br/>In the 1960s, Ehrhart discovered that the number of lattice points in dilations of polytopes is counted by a polynomial, called Ehrhart polynomial. The first part of the project is focused on the study of Ehrhart positivity, valuations of polytopes, and related questions. Topics include (1) studying Ehrhart positivity problems on Tesler polytopes and Birkhoff polytopes; (2) investigating the uniqueness of Berline-Vergne's valuation; (3) studying Fischer-Pommersheim's alpha-construction for McMullen's formula; (4) exploring the connection between Ehrhart positivity and properties of h^*-polynomials. In the second part, the PI will focus on problems related to constructions of polytopes. Instead of defining a polytope directly, one can start with a fan (or a poset), and ask whether there exists a polytope whose normal fan (or whose face lattice) is the given one. The case of posets is called the realization problem, which builds a nice bridge between the study of combinatorial objects (posets) and geometric objects (polytopes). Based on her recent work on nested generalized permutohedra and their connection with permuto-asscociahedra, the PI will study the realization problem on ""hybrid-posets"".<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This grant constitutes the academic backbone of the San Francisco State University-Colombia Combinatorics Initiative, a vibrant research and training collaboration featuring research-based courses, research projects, and summer schools. Since 2007 the initiative has trained more than 250 pre-Ph.D. students; more than half of the US participants are members of underrepresented groups in mathematics, and more than 80 have gone on to Ph.D. programs. The initiative?s practices of excellence and inclusion are shared broadly by the PI and many others, and they serve as a model for other math and science programs nationwide and beyond.<br/><br/>This project studies two research directions at the intersection of combinatorics and geometry: 1. We construct and study several geometric models of a matroid. Using tools from tropical geometry, Hodge theory, and intersection theory, we derive novel combinatorial properties of matroids that do not seem accessible purely combinatorially. 2. Measuring polytopes is very difficult in general, but it can be done when the polytopes have sufficient combinatorial or algebraic structure. We construct and measure families of polytopes arising in various mathematical settings, and use those measurements to compute algebraic and geometric quantities of interest. In both of these research directions, relevant objects are often built from a configuration of vectors ? usually a root system.

In combinatorial representation theory we seek to make algebraic objects more accessible by relating abstract algebraic objects to combinatorial objects such as graphs and matrices.  The combinatorial objects are often easier to understand and more importantly they lead to more efficient computation.  In this proposal we are interested in using combinatorial objects to understand products of representations.  One product investigated in this proposal is the tensor product of representations of symmetry groups.  The goal is to devise an algorithm that uses combinatorial objects to understand the decomposition of this product into simpler representations.  The decomposition of tensor products is an important problem that has applications to a plethora of fields such as algebraic combinatorics, complexity theory, and statistics, and has applications in medicine, computer vision, physics, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication. Essentially, it is the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals. <br/><br/>There are three longstanding unsolved problems in combinatorial representation theory that seek to decompose representations into irreducible representations.  These include the Kronecker problem, the Plethysm problem and the Restriction problem.  These problems are interrelated and making progress in the understanding of any will lead to breakthroughs on the others. Zabrocki and the PI introduced a new basis of symmetric functions that arose from connections to the partition algebra and led to the introduction of new combinatorial objects in the study of the Kronecker problem.  This new basis of symmetric functions has provided a better understanding of the connection between the three open problems and the combinatorial objects introduced have made the problems more accessible.  In this proposal the PI and collaborators, including graduate students, will continue to develop algorithms using diagram algebras and symmetric functions that we hope will lead to advances in the understanding of the Kronecker problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Those extremal objects often have unique properties and structures, giving insights in many mathematical fields. Over the last twenty years, several new techniques, many using the assistance of computers, have been extraordinarily successful in studying extremal objects. One of the recent powerful methods is based on the theory of flag algebras. This method enables researchers to translate extremal combinatorics questions into instances of semidefinite programs, which can then be explored with the help of a computer and academic as well as commercial software. This translation has led to recent breakthroughs on longstanding open questions. The method is versatile and can be applied in various settings such as graphs, hypergraphs, permutations, oriented graphs, point sets, embedded graphs, and phylogenetic trees. The aim of this focused research group is to resolve three prominent types of open questions by Erd?s, Turán, and Zarankiewicz using these techniques.<br/><br/>The three types of questions to be studied share the general flavor of generalized Turán problems, and solving them would have far reaching consequences. The first type are extremal hypergraph questions, the second type concerns finding maximum cuts in graphs with certain properties, and the third type are questions related to the crossing number of graphs. For all three, the use of flag algebras has recently led to significant progress but not to full solutions. This project will combine the expertise of the investigators with a concentrated effort and further method development to resolve these open questions. It is planned to find connections to more traditional methods such as the stability method and linear algebraic methods.

Broadly speaking, methods for finding simultaneous solutions to multiple equations have significant implications for progress in physics, computer science, and engineering. These solutions may be expressed in terms of the intersection of certain geometric spaces. The motivating question in enumerative geometry is to predict the number of geometric figures with specified properties that satisfy a list of conditions. For example, we may seek the number of curves that contain a set of points and are tangent to a list of lines. Surprisingly, while it can be very difficult to determine the precise list of figures that satisfy the conditions, it is often possible to predict the number of such figures. The search for exact formulas for the number of solutions in enumerative geometry is an active area of research with relations to numerous fields, including geometry, combinatorics, representation theory, complexity theory in computer science, and mirror symmetry in theoretical physics. This grant will support continued work in these areas by the investigators and their graduate students. <br/> <br/>An effective approach to solving enumerative geometric problems is to understand the intersection theory of moduli spaces of geometric figures. The field of Schubert calculus loosely applies to these investigations among large classes of varieties in homogeneous spaces. Various cohomology theories can be used to extract enumerative information. For example, singular cohomology is useful for counting the number of points in intersections of geometric figures, quantum cohomology is designed for counting curves meeting other figures, and equivariant cohomology produces more general geometric invariants that depend on a group action. Cohomology theories of spaces with group actions often have naturally defined bases, and geometric invariants related to such bases tend to possess intriguing positivity properties, often related to beautiful combinatorial structures that capture the essential aspects of the geometry. The investigators will study these phenomena in the context of several geometric spaces, including flag varieties and their cotangent bundles, bow varieties, and Hessenberg varieties. Techniques include intersection theory, equivariant localization, symmetric functions, Hecke algebra actions, and geometric representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
