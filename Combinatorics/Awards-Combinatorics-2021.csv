It aims to develop a multi-tier Research Training Program at the University of South Carolina (UofSC) designed to prepare the future workforce in a multidisciplinary paradigm of modern data science. The education and training models will leverage knowledge and experience already existing among the faculty and bring in new talent to foster mathematical data science expertise and research portfolios through a vertical integration of post-doctoral research associates, graduate students, undergraduate students, and advanced high school students. A primary focus of this project is to recruit and train U.S. Citizens, females, and underrepresented minority (URM) among undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs through research led training in Data Science. The research and training infrastructure implemented through this RTG program will not only support the planned majors and master?s degrees, but also provide systemic educational curricula for students and researchers from other areas whose research would benefit from Data Science within UofSC and in the vicinity. The training materials created by this RTG program will also be widely available to other institutions across the country. The RTG project will help build a highly educated workforce for academia, government and industry, in the area of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. <br/><br/>This project is a response to emerging demands of modern technology-oriented societies for an innovative workforce with expertise in all areas related to Data Science. Based on a comprehensive view of Data Science, the program aims at providing students and postdocs with the necessary concepts that enable them to form their own research agenda. Our program covers, on the one hand, emerging developments in network science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and optimization methodologies from computer science and statistical perspectives primarily for the Big-Data regime with applications such as autonomous systems. In addition, problems typically posed in a Small-Data regime can relate these concepts to relevant methodologies, such as Physics Informed Learning, needed to understand mathematical models, usually formulated in terms of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), so as to understand key techniques for synthesizing models and data in the context of Uncertainty Quantification. Properly interrelating these activities in the broader Data Science landscape, will enable students to successfully tackle new problem areas at later stages of their career and address important challenges in sciences and engineering. The corresponding theoretical training is reinforced by accompanying practical training modules that are able to engage students across all levels as well as young researchers in synergistic activities, even reaching out to local industries. It is a feedback-loop between research and education that distinguishes the project. The educational component is designed with an ultimate goal of developing an innovative research training program to educate future workforce in a structured curriculum that offers a major, a master?s degree and a 4+1 dual degree in Data Science at UofSC. The project facilitates team-teaching by relevant experts and uses direct links to research projects that students will participated in. The built-in vertical and horizontal pedagogical synergies as well as the hierarchical mentoring scheme expose participating students to extensive educational and research experience offered by the program. This project is jointly funded by Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering in Mathematical and Statistical Sciences (CDS&E-MSS), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Workforce Program in the Mathematical Sciences, among others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representation theory is the study of algebraic structures by realizing their elements as linear maps on vector spaces or modules and decomposing them into their smallest constituents. Both probability and representation theory lend themselves to combinatorial analysis. For example, in probability the events could be discrete states and in representation theory the index set of a representation is often a combinatorial object such as a partition. The main premise of this proposal is the development of new combinatorial techniques for answering fundamental questions in both probability and representation theory. This project also has a substantial computational component (contributing to and using the rapidly growing open-source mathematical software SAGEMATH). The outcome of this research will impact areas beyond those of their original motivation. For example, it relates to invariant theory, complexity theory, and voting procedures. These investigations are fueled by extensive computational experimentation. Robust implementation of algorithms derived from the project will lead to new, open-source code for the SAGEMATH computer algebra system. The dissemination of this new SAGEMATH software will not only advance the proposed research program, but will (and has already) cross-fertilize various areas in mathematics and computer science. In addition, the project will support a diverse group of graduate students and encourage the participation of female students and researchers. The PI also plans to organize workshops, engage in promoting open access publishing, and disseminate results via lecture series.<br/><br/>The project is aimed at solving open problems on five topics in combinatorial probability and representation theory. The five proposed projects will be attacked with various teams of collaborators and include: (1) Mixing times of Markov chains using the recently developed new theory for computing stationary distributions for any finite Markov chain. This approach uses sophisticated methods in semigroup theory. (2) A new uncrowding algorithm for hook-valued tableaux in relation to canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials in K-theory. (3) The generalization of a crystal associated to stable Grothendieck polynomials. This approach will likely yield new K-theoretic insertion algorithms. (4) Insertion algorithms for the partition algebra and its subalgebras. The partition algebra is a centralizer algebra. New insertion algorithms are required to match the underlying representation theory in various cases. (5) Symmetric chain decompositions of crystal bases can answer questions about plethysm coefficients and have applications to physics, invariant theory and complexity theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The notion of a graph is extremely general and expressive, as it can model arbitrarily complicated pairwise interactions among any collection of objects. This makes graphs important for essentially all aspects of human interests (ranging from, for example, social interactions, to science, internet search, engineering, and pure mathematics). This also makes the world of graphs immensely rich and complicated. It is therefore highly desirable to develop methodologies that could enhance one?s ability to understand and utilize graphs. This joint research project is devoted to further elucidate the geometric perspective of graphs, which provides deep and often unexpected insights on their structure. A graph induces a geometry on its nodes by defining its associated notion of distance to be the minimum number of hops along edges of the graph that is required to reach one node to another. One of the main questions that will be investigated is how the local structure of a graph, namely how it looks near each of its nodes, imposes restrictions on the behavior of its global properties. For example, if the graph does not contain short cycles (a phenomenon that is common in many cases of interest), then near each node one sees a tree. However if the graph is finite, then these local trees cannot maintain their tree-like growth indefinitely, that is, they must somehow eventually merge. It is remarkable how little is presently known about how having a local tree-like structure influences the global structure of a graph. This joint research project will tackle the abundance of longstanding mysteries about the global ramifications of being locally a tree. There is a wealth of further local-global geometric mysteries about graphs, such as fundamental questions about codes (existence and limitations thereof), which are subsets of a high-dimensional graph called the discrete cube in which all nonzero pairwise distances are large. Other issues that will be studied in this joint research project include finding algorithms to efficiently partition graphs, low-dimensional representations, representation of the graph distance as a superposition of much simpler distance functions, etc. This joint NSF-BSF project will provide an opportunity to enhance the interaction between U.S. and Israeli researchers who have been attacking such questions separately from different angles. It will address specific questions in these directions, and will also develop overarching methodologies to understand graphs through the lens of the global geometry that they induce.   <br/> <br/>The idea that geometry may provide deep and often unexpected insights in discrete mathematics has been immensely fruitful. Suffices it to mention how isoperimetric inequalities have evolved into sophisticated concepts such as expander graphs which play a fundamental role in areas ranging from group theory to theoretical computer science and many other topics in between. More specifically, this joint research project will investigate the global geometry of graphs. One of the main questions that will be investigated is to what extent a finite graph can look locally like an infinite regular tree.<br/>Such a finite graph clearly has no short cycles, i.e., it has a large girth. Also its diameter should be small. How large can the girth be? How small can the diameter be? Can a graph simultaneously have a large girth and a small diameter? To what extent can the metric on a large girth graph be approximated by a superposition of cut metrics or by a Euclidean metric? Arguably, the most important metric space for combinatorics is the discrete cube and its powers. Understanding the independence number of these graphs is a classical open question: The rate versus distance problem for binary codes. The best bounds that are presently available are nearly a half a century old. The most important codes both in theory in practice are linear codes. Strangely enough, no tighter upper bounds are known for linear codes. This joint research project will study a strengthening of Delsarte?s classical linear program that distinguishes linear from general codes. Major open questions on algorithmic graph partitioning will also be investigated in this joint research project, as well as fundamental issues in dimension reduction, spectral graph theory, and the search for a meaningful model of random metric spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of this project is to better understand some classes of polynomials that, like determinants, are ubiquitous in mathematics.  Hyperbolic polynomials and, even more generally, log-concave polynomials are real polynomials that share many useful functional properties of determinants. The study of hyperbolic polynomials originated in the context of partial differential equations in the 1950's and has been used to understand problems in convex optimization, operator theory, and combinatorics. There are still many important open questions about such polynomials, and because of their prevalence and concrete nature, structural results often have far-ranging applications. The educational component of this project includes a series of summer workshops for undergraduate and graduate students providing them a background in an important and active area of mathematical research as well as exposure to its applications in other fields. <br/><br/>Recently, close connections between log-concave polynomials and matroids, which are combinatorial models of independence structures, were developed. Coefficients of these polynomials give discrete probability distributions that can be efficiently sampled. This research aims to use real algebraic and discrete geometry to further develop our understanding of these classes of polynomials, with a view towards applications in approximation algorithms, combinatorics, convex optimization, and operator theory. This award will also support workshops for undergraduate and graduate students to train them in areas including real algebraic geometry, the geometry of polynomials, tropical geometry, and their applications outside of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A basic question is ""What do the frequencies of these waves tell us about their interference and vice versa?"". The interference of the waves has to do with the magnitude of their superposition, and the concentration of the interference can be made large by choosing the frequencies according to a strict pattern. One of the questions pursued by the PI is the converse: are these patterns necessary to achieve a very concentrated superposition. This is called the Inverse Littlewood Problem. The second question under investigation is an uncertainty principle. Suppose we have two families of waves that can be used to decompose a signal, and these two families are very incompatible. This incompatibility means we expect that a simple wave from one family looks much more complicated as a superposition from the second. A specific instance of this is whether a multiplicative character (a very simple wave in one family) can be decomposed as an additive convolution (a fairly simple superposition in another family). This is called Sarkozy's Problem.<br/><br/>There is a long history of comparing the distribution and arithmetic structure of sequences in number theory. Classically, the connection is observed by way of the Fourier transform. Towards a better understanding of this phenomenon, the PI plans to build upon recent results that relate the dimension of a finite subset of a lattice to estimates on the L^1-norm of its associated Fourier series. This area of investigation began with a conjecture of Littlewood on how small the L^1 -norm of the Fourier transform of a finite set of integers could be. The problem was resolved independently by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s. Recently, questions have turned to classifying the extremizers in this problem, and the PI has recently proved that they must be, in an appropriate sense, low-dimensional. In this project he will develop the method further, by weakening hypotheses and applying these results to problems in arithmetic reliant the L^1 norm. In the finite field setting, the PI and Petridis have made substantial progress on a problem of Sarkozy concerning sumsets and the quadratic residues. They have resolved the conjecture for almost all primes. The PI will develop the ideas further so as to resolve the conjecture in earnest. Beyond this, he will adapt the method to other problems, which in turn will lead to progress on Vinogradov?s conjecture on the least non-residue.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cluster algebras and the associated combinatorial and algebraic constructions were discovered at the turn of the century. Their importance for applications in other areas of mathematics and physics is becoming increasingly apparent. In algebraic combinatorics, it is often the case that similar combinatorial structures underlie seemingly unrelated mathematical phenomena. As a result, hidden connections are revealed, allowing the transfer of insights and techniques from one discipline to another. This project aims to extend and deepen these connections.

Algebraic geometry is the study of solution sets of polynomial equations called algebraic varieties. It has applications in many fields as diverse as high energy physics, coding, cryptography, and mathematical biology. Understanding how the shape of the solution set changes as the coefficients are varied is one of the oldest and central questions in the field. Such continuous deformations, which appear in all branches of algebraic geometry and its applications, are called algebraic families. An important example is the geometric Langlands program, which is concerned with understanding principal bundles on curves, a very special class of families. Bundles are also main players in gauge theory in high energy physics. Algebraic families are the central focus of this project. The research aims to introduce new methods to classify and compute with algebraic families. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Toric varieties are a large class of varieties whose geometry is intimately connected with combinatorics of convex lattice polytopes. They play a central role in contemporary algebraic geometry. Tropical geometry, a relatively recent area of research, concerns study of piecewise linear geometry and has roots in convex optimization. Tropical geometry translates numerous questions in algebra and geometry into combinatorial and convex geometric questions that are often more tractable. The theory of buildings is an area of combinatorial geometry that has deep connections with topology and differential geometry. It aims to unravel hidden combinatorial geometric structures in matrix groups and related spaces. The topics of this research revolve around the common theme of studying families of algebraic varieties over a toric variety, or a toric family for short.

In this setting, exact formulas become unwieldy and unusable; asymptotic algebraic combinatorics leverages algebraic methods to obtain useful approximations that are typically not accessible. The algebraic approach to asymptotic combinatorics is especially pertinent in the age of big data, where discrete structures loom large over the information landscape, but the tools to handle them are in short supply.

Over the past half century, it has grown from humble origins into a rich field with deep connections to and applications in disparate fields across mathematics and the sciences. A central mathematical framework that has spurred combinatorics' development from its inception is the challenge of understanding geometric spaces by their decomposition into constituent pieces. Recent breakthroughs of this type have led to deeper understanding of fundamental problems in theoretical physics, probability theory, algebraic geometry and many other fields. Since the 19th century, mathematicians have applied this framework to better understand collections of two-dimensional arrays of data called matrix spaces. This project will use combinatorial tools to determine properties of matrix spaces broken down into pieces determined by imposing redundancy conditions on the underlying data. In addition, funds will support undergraduate research, training graduate students and outreach efforts including work with a prison education program.<br/><br/>To a mathematician, the spaces this project studies are quite simple: matrices, idempotent matrices, symmetric and skew-symmetric matrices. The pieces of matrix spaces considered in this project, called matrix Schubert varieties, are comprised of matrices satisfying rank restrictions on specified submatrices. Matrix Schubert varieties are invariant under certain row/column operations -- this extends to a natural group action. By taking this group action into account, geometric and topological properties of matrix Schubert varieties solve central questions in enumerative algebraic geometry and intersection theory. Using a collection of tools from combinatorics and commutative algebra known collectively as 'Grobner geometry', this project will describe polynomial representatives that encode the geometric properties of matrix Schubert varieties.

The research supported by this grant will develop new topological and geometric methods to tackle problems further afield, primarily discrete, non-continuous problems. This promises new insights at the confluence of combinatorics, geometry, and topology. Students at all stages will be involved in the research effort supported by this grant.<br/><br/>Among the general goals of the research program are the following: In applications of equivariant topology one often requires that a certain parameter has to be a prime power, and methods fail outside of this prime power case. Recent research of the PI has suggested that one may effectively circumvent this prime power requirement via a synthesis of topological and combinatorial techniques. This will be further developed. The application of topological methods brings about geometric generalizations of combinatorial problems. To understand the limitations of topological techniques one has to study those types of problems, where geometric results deviate considerably from their combinatorial special cases. A central goal will thus be to delimit rigid combinatorial results from their flexible geometric counterparts.

An important theme of mathematics in the last hundred years or so is that Coxeter groups and related geometric objects provide a very accessible and useful key to unlock many other mathematical theories.  This project explores the applications of Coxeter groups to Artin groups (including the ""braid group"", which describes the mathematics of braided strands), scattering diagrams (a key tool for ""mirror symmetry"" in string theory), and cluster algebras (a newer theory that also functions as a key to other mathematical theories).

A second part of the project is to extend (from finite type to affine type) the deep connections between the noncrossing partition lattices (which appear in the theory of Artin groups) and generalized associahedra/scattering fans.  Closely related to this goal is the project of constructing planar diagrams that realize noncrossing partition lattices of classical affine types.  The third part of the project is (in its most ambitious formulation) to extend the weak order on a finite Coxeter group to an infinite lattice (not semilattice) for completely general Coxeter groups and then carry out the Cambrian fan construction of cluster scattering diagrams in complete generality.  In finite type, the weak order can be understood in terms of shards and the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Semidistributive Lattices (FTFSDL).

This project seeks to study more realistic variants of well-known models for chemical reactions, epidemic outbreaks, and the spread of information as to deepen our understanding of important phenomena from across the sciences and further develop the mathematics that helps explain them.

The version in which particles have different speeds is difficult to study and conjectured to exhibit anomalous behavior when different particle types are initially balanced. (2) The Ballistic Annihilation model has three particle types and all collisions result in annihilation. The limiting particle density in different regimes will be characterized. (3) The Chase-Escape model is a competitive stochastic growth model conjectured to have a coexistence phase even when the predatory species is fitter than the prey.

The kissing number problem was the subject of a famous discussion between Isaac Newton and David Gregory. Such questions later led to a variety of topics in combinatorics and other areas. Nowadays, point configurations is an interdisciplinary topic with applications in many areas such as mathematical optimization, approximation theory, coding theory, information theory, materials science, and crystallography. The goal of the project is to study configurations that are optimal under certain conditions. By this project, the investigator also plans to reach a wide audience of undergraduate students via the collaboration with the Center of Excellence in STEM Education of the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. The goals of the Center are focused on strengthening STEM academic programs and increasing the number of STEM graduates, particularly those from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The unifying theme for all the topics and problems considered in the project is the optimality of point sets. For one set of questions, the main approach relies on the fact that under some conditions optimal point configurations are constrained by space symmetries via linear or semidefinite conditions. The method of finding upper bounds on few-distance sets in two-point homogeneous spaces, established by the principal investigator, will provide new tools to address classical combinatorial problems. It is expected that the generalized version of this approach may lead to new bounds in sphere packings and can be applicable in many different contexts. For the other set of questions, symmetries of combinatorial and number-theoretic objects (graphs, lattices, etc.) imply certain geometric optimality of corresponding point sets. The approach suggested for this project is to use analytic methods and the hypothetical optimality of unknown configurations to construct them or prove their existence/non-existence.

They can model aspects of many different problems and scenarios, and they are used throughout mathematics. A permutation pattern is a subset of a permutation that appears in a particular order. For example, it might have an increasing subsequence of some length, or it might avoid having a large number followed by two smaller numbers. The presence or absence of particular patterns can be critical to features of the data that the permutation is modeling, which has led to great interest in the analysis of permutation patterns for the past several decades. The goal of this project is to establish a broader context to the traditional study of permutation patterns. Historically, research in this area has been almost entirely in terms of a binary question: does a permutation contain a given pattern or does the permutation avoid it? Recent evidence has shown that the specific number of times that a pattern appears is of great importance, and consequently a more granular notion of pattern containment should be studied. Specifically, the question should instead be: how many times does the permutation contain the pattern? This project will address that higher-order question in several ways, with implications for combinatorics and its connections to algebra, topology, and computer science.<br/><br/>The first part of the project will extend what is already known about higher-order containment in a special but important case. A relationship was recently established between individual occurrences of two patterns and repeated letters in reduced decompositions. This is a critical step enabling the study of how pattern occurrences can impact objects like the Bruhat order, the connection between length and reflection length, and the frequency of letters in a reduced decomposition. It also gives a new avenue for enumerating permutations that contain fixed numbers of pattern occurrences. The second phase of the project will bring the perspective of higher-order pattern containment to other pattern sets. Several sets seem especially amenable to this pursuit, and their analysis will pave the way for studying higher-order pattern containment more generally.

The PIs, one in the US and the other in UK, will work on questions at the interface of graph theory and theoretical computer science. The line of inquiry that guides this research project is the following: what is the global difference between general graphs and graphs that do not contain particular configurations (known as an induced subgraphs)? This is a fundamental question and the mathematical understanding of it is very limited. The project will study the impact of the absence of those configurations on algorithmic properties of the graph: what questions (that are known to be difficult in general) become tractable if we are given this kind of additional information about the input? This project will also provide graduate student training both in the US and UK.<br/><br/>In recent years significant progress has been made in the theoretical computer science community toward designing methods that address NP-complete problems in graph theory when certain restrictions are placed on the input. These are beautiful and powerful results that have significantly deepened the understanding of the limits of efficient algorithms. This project aims to combine the power of structural graph theory with these recent developments and apply them to several longstanding open questions. The project will study the impact of excluding an induced subgraph on the complexity of such well-known algorithmic tasks as finding the chromatic number, the stability number, and the clique number of a graph (as well as their weighted analogues). Progress on any of these aspects will advance the understanding of the structure of families of graphs defined by forbidden induced subgraphs, contribute to answering important open questions, and have significant algorithmic consequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moduli spaces, geometric objects whose points parameterize other geometric objects,  are of fundamental importance both in algebraic geometry, and in connecting algebraic geometry to other areas of science. For example, the connection with physics arises from the fact that the evolution of strings in space-time may be interpreted as an appropriate measurement on a moduli space of stable maps to space-time. The geometry of moduli space is extremely sophisticated, but it often comes with a rich recursive structure: in simple terms, more complicated moduli spaces contain within themselves a skeleton built of simpler moduli spaces. Over the last few decades this phenomenon has led to the development of several combinatorial approaches to the study of intersection theory of moduli spaces. The main goal of this project is to develop a thorough understanding of the intersection theory of a particular class of moduli spaces, called admissible cover spaces. Admissible cover spaces provide a rich and interesting connection between algebraic geometry and representation theory of finite groups, and have significant applications to mathematical physics and mirror symmetry. The goal will be achieved through a combination of several techniques and perspectives, including methods coming from tropical geometry, logarithmic geometry and mathematical physics. The PI, together with collaborators, will work in parallel both to further develop and to apply these techniques to the study of the structure of moduli spaces of admissible covers. This project provides research training opportunities for students.<br/><br/>Specific projects contributing to achieving the main goal are organized in three groups. The first group of projects explores the structure  of classes of  hyperelliptic curves with marked Weierstrass points and pairs of conjugate points. The aim is to generalize the notion of Cohomological Field Theory, and to exploit this structure to obtain graph formulas for these classes. A better understanding of the structure of admissible cover loci is a tool to recover enumerative information hidden in Gromov-Witten invariants of curves. The second group of projects aims to give a solid combinatorial framework for the tautological intersection theory of  a directed system of birational models of the moduli space of curves, obtained by blowing up all boundary strata (and proper transforms thereof). Besides being of independent interest, we expect this calculus to be an important tool in understanding families of classes of admissible covers, whose intersection with the boundary is transversalized in these birational transforms. These techniques allow new perspectives on the computation of double Hurwitz numbers, and the generalization to similar enumerative geometric problems on moduli spaces of twisted log-canonical divisors. Tropical geometry plays a fundamental role in organizing the birational modifications of the moduli space of curves that we expect to use in the study of cycles of admissible covers. The last  group of projects builds on foundational work in tropical geometry that the PI conducted in collaboration with Gross and Markwig. Having defined a theory of tropical psi classes, the goal is now to establish a rigorous tropicalization statement relating algebraic and tropical classes, with the expectation that these will play a significant role in connecting algebraic and tropical intersection theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representation theory has numerous applications in physics and chemistry as well as other mathematical fields. The cluster algebras provide a mathematical framework for fundamental patterns that occur throughout representation theory. Surprisingly, these patterns are also observed in various other branches of science which, a priori, are not related to representation theory. This project will enhance the understanding of cluster algebras and provide new research directions in an already highly active research area.

A classical question in knot theory asks whether two knots can be obtained from each other by continuously transforming the rope. One way to distinguish two knots is to compute their knot invariants. Some of the most powerful knot invariants include the HOMFLY polynomial and its recent generalization known as Khovanov?Rozansky homology. For instance, the HOMFLY polynomial is used in molecular biology to study how DNA molecules are folded in space. In this project, we relate these knot invariants to objects arising naturally in algebraic combinatorics, a field which applies algebraic methods to study discrete objects such as binomial coefficients or triangulations of a polygon. The number of possible triangulations of a polygon is counted by the famous Catalan number sequence. One of the main results of the project gives a natural geometric interpretation of Catalan numbers, by means of relating them to Khovanov?Rozansky knot homology and the HOMFLY polynomial. The objects that appear along the way are interpreted from the point of view of statistical mechanics, which deals with macroscopic observations of a physical system consisting of a large number of particles. For example, the geometric spaces in question are directly linked to the Ising model at critical temperature, which describes ferromagnetic properties of a flat metal plate at the Curie point. The award also provides funding for the involvement of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs in the PI's research.<br/><br/>The Grassmannian is stratified by spaces known as positroid varieties. In a joint project with Thomas Lam, the Principal Investigator (PI) studies the mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology of positroid varieties. The main result states that the bigraded Poincaré polynomial of the top-dimensional positroid variety is given by the (rational) q,t-Catalan number, introduced in the works of Garsia?Haiman and Loehr?Warrington. The proof proceeds by associating a link to each positroid variety, and relating its cohomology to the Khovanov?Rozansky homology of the associated link. The point count of the positroid variety is therefore given by a coefficient of the HOMFLY polynomial of the link. The PI has recently shown that the point count is given by certain observables in the stochastic six-vertex model. Separately, positroid varieties were connected to the Ising model in the joint work of the PI with Pavlo Pylyavskyy. In this project, the PI uses this relation to give a direct formula for boundary correlations of Baxter's critical Z-invariant Ising model. This formula is applied to questions of universality and conformal invariance of the model, studied by Smirnov et al.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such continuous deformations, which appear in all branches of algebraic geometry and its applications, are called algebraic families. An important example is the geometric Langlands program, which is concerned with understanding principal bundles on curves, a very special class of families.

The topics under study include the combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients of Askey-Wilson polynomials and their multivariate generalization, the interplay between exclusion processes and MacDonald (Koornwinder) polynomials, the combinatorics of q-Jacobi polynomials and Lecture Hall tableaux, and the relations between Rogers-Ramanujan identities and cylindric partitions. The project will involve graduate students in research.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project concerns several interrelated questions surrounding the combinatorics of Askey-Wilson polynomials and their multivariate generalization. The first research direction concerns the positivity of the coefficients and the expansion of these polynomials in the Schur basis. The project will explore the interplay of lattice paths combinatorics, tableaux combinatorics, algebra, and probability to address these questions. The second direction aims to employ multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and generalized versions to understand the combinatorics of Macdonald polynomials of different types and generalization to quasisymmetric analogues. The PI aims to use techniques coming from statistical physics, combinatorial algebras, and multiline queue/vertex model combinatorics to develop this combinatorial theory. A third direction is to study the Lecture Hall Schur functions and their skew analogues, their connections with q-Jacobi multivariate analogues and generalizations, and tiling models coming from Lecture Hall objects and their asymptotic properties. A final direction concerns the Rogers-Ramanujan identities and their connection to cylindric partitions and Hall Littlewood polynomials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, AlCoVE was launched as a way to bring together the algebra and combinatorics communities in a virtual setting.  We aimed to re-create as many of the beneficial aspects of in-person conferences as possible, including the mentoring and networking benefits that conferences usually provide.  The 2020 conference drew hundreds of participants from all around the world, and we are now continuing to run AlCoVE as an annual online conference, improving our virtual social events through technology funded by the NSF.  AlCoVE strives to be an inclusive, global conference that promotes collaboration and progress in this field, while simultaneously increasing accessibility and helping to reduce the carbon footprint of mathematics research.<br/><br/>AlCoVE 2021, to be held on June 14-15, will feature presentations on a wide array of topics in algebraic combinatorics and its applications.  These topics include enumeration, lattices and posets, generating functions and q-series, symmetric function theory, computational algebraic geometry, polytopes and Ehrhart theory, combinatorial optimization, and topological combinatorics.  There will be a poster session for younger researchers to share their work as well, and dynamic social events to foster networking, collaboration, and social events.
