Because the field is concerned with the development of tools for analyzing, organizing, and arranging discrete data, combinatorial methods are essential in many scientific areas such as genomics, computer science, statistics, and physics. The methods can often be traced back to research inspired by problems in algebra and geometry. For example, the RSA public-key encryption algorithm is based on a combinatorial result in modular arithmetic. This research project is devoted to developing combinatorial techniques for attacking problems that connect to algebraic and geometric areas such as symmetric function theory, a subject with applications to probability and statistical mechanics. The investigation will make use of a computational symbolic algebra system and will further develop the SAGE open-source mathematics software suite. <br/><br/>This research project spans combinatorial problems in representation theory, algebraic geometry, and physics. The inspiration comes from the central importance of constructions such as tableaux and Bruhat posets in the classical studies of representations of the complex linear group and Schubert calculus. The precision of combinatorics is carried to more abstract problems by a distinguished Schur basis for the algebra of symmetric functions. The project concerns variations on the classical theories that address subtle questions about geometric Gromov-Witten invariants, symmetric functions over a field of parameters, bi-graded representations, and quantum integrable systems. A priority is to develop the necessary combinatorial framework for the contemporary set of problems. The venture goes hand in hand with an investigation of refined physical, geometric, and algebraic theories attached to the combinatorics. The resulting combinatorial constructions will lend computational facility to related application areas."

The project involves the study of ""state sums"" -- a catchall term from statistical mechanics to describe certain sums of products (typically of polynomials) -- and the study of topological quantum field theory, which arose in physics and has turned out to have connections to several areas of modern mathematics. Many important quantities in algebraic combinatorics can be computed as state sums; these are often sums over all the labelings of a quadrangulated surface with compatible tiles, like assembling a jigsaw puzzle. The remarkable fact is that these totals are frequently independent of the quadrangulation, suggesting that they may have some more fundamental definition. This project investigates a source from topological quantum field theory that might unify these state sum results, while suggesting ways to probe them more deeply. Specifically, changing a quadrangulation on a surface relates to evolving it through space, which suggests exploring both higher- and lower-dimensional analogues. This program has many subprojects suitable for graduate students in mathematics and statistical mechanics, who will be involved in the research.<br/><br/>This research program comprises two projects. The first project uses inspiration from quantum field theory and geometric representation theory in an endeavor to elucidate polynomial formulae arising in algebraic combinatorics.  Formulae for interesting polynomials often take the form of sums of products of linear polynomials. For example, the ""Schubert polynomial"" associated to a permutation can be written as a sum over certain 2-d diagrams for the permutation. The project will look more deeply into these polynomial formulae, in two steps. The first step is to see a polynomial as a matrix coefficient inside a time-evolution operator in a (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theory. Since long-time-evolution is a composite of many short-time evolutions, the matrix might be expressed as a product of simpler matrices, giving exactly the sum over products. The second step is to regard the Hilbert spaces of these quantum field theories as homology groups of certain algebraic varieties, after the manner of geometric representation theory. This would naturally imply some commutation properties of these matrices, such as the Yang-Baxter equation.  The second project aims to develop a generalization of Schubert calculus to chains of linear subspaces."

This project addresses substructures with respect to three closely related graph containment relations: minors, topological minors, and immersions. Problems related to these containment relations have been proposed since more than 70 years ago. Great successes about graph minors were obtained during recent decades and led to numerous applications to disciplines other than combinatorics, such as theoretical computer science, electrical engineering and biology. However, several problems about graph minors and their strengthening or variations with respect to topological minors and immersions remain unsolved. This project addresses major conjectures in this area. Positive solutions will lead to immediate applications in theoretical computer science and optimization. More potential applications are expected based on fruitful applications of earlier work about graph minors. This project includes plenty of research problems that are suitable for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Topics addressed in this project including graph coloring, Erdos-Posa property, well-quasi-ordering and general structural properties. One objective of this project is to solve or at least make significant progress on a group of questions about variations or relaxations of Hadwiger's conjecture on coloring graphs with no large clique minor, topological minor or immersion. Another objective is to prove a relationship between the maximum size of half-integral packing of topological minors and the minimum size of hitting sets, which is a strengthening of Thomas' conjecture on half-integral packing minors. Furthermore, Nash-Williams' conjecture on well-quasi-ordering graphs by the strong immersion relation will be considered. The strategies for attacking these conjectures are proving new structure theorems for excluding a fixed graph with respect to these three containment relations and exploiting tools that were developed in the PI's earlier work and in the literature for solving problems about graph minors."

This project aims at developing and advancing mathematical tools and techniques for analyzing various random graphs, including ""dynamic"" models (i.e., graphs that grow step-by-step in a random way). The dynamic aspect is conceptually important since (a) many real-world networks also grow over time, whereas (b) the majority of the existing mathematical random graphs literature focuses on ""static"" models. This project thus contributes to the interdisciplinary effort of understanding networks, which are nowadays omnipresent in real life as well as in data science, complex networks, and many other disciplines. <br/><br/>This project explores a topic which is central to the theory of random graphs: the phase transition phenomenon in the component structure (from only ""small"" components to a ""giant"" component dominating most of the graph). The PI will investigate this fundamental and striking phenomenon in several difficult-to-analyze random graph models, with particular emphasis on (the finite-size scaling behavior of) the size of the largest component in models with non-trivial dependencies between the edges. Two principle aims are (i) to advance our general understanding of the phase transition, and (ii) to improve the mathematical proof techniques in the area, in particular to make them more robust (so that they apply to a wider range of models)."

It deals with the problems of finding the maximum or minimum value of a function over a class of finite objects. Such problems are often related to other branches of mathematics and other fields of science, including biology, chemistry, computer science, information and coding theory. <br/><br/>Classical extremal problems, such as Sperner's theorem and Turan's theorem, consider the size of a set system or graph. On the other hand, results such as Dirac's theorem on Hamilton cycles and the Hajnal-Szemeredi theorem, consider the minimum or maximum degree of a graph. The proposed research considers degree versions of several classical results in extremal set theory, including the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem and the Kruskal-Katona theorem. An obvious difficulty towards solving these problems is that the shifting method, an important tool in extremal set theory, can not be applied. The project also considers degree versions of two well-known difficult problems in extremal (hyper)graph theory: the clique density problem and hypergraph Turan problem. Lastly, extending Dirac's theorem to hypergraphs has attracted much attention in recent years, and the PI will continue his research on this topic. The tools that the PI will apply to attack these problems include the algebraic method, probabilistic method, flag algebra method, absorbing method, and regularity method."

Various graph coloring problems have been considered as effective models for radio channel assignment/distribution, and flow problems originally arise in optimizing traffic or network. This project is concerned with structural problems in networks.  <br/><br/>Integer flow theory, introduced by Tutte as a dual of the graph/map coloring problem, is the major subject of this proposed project.

Another aim of this project involves new kinds of probabilistic analyses of algorithms. These may, for example, give guidance on which algorithms may be efficient for ""typical"" inputs, and which will not. Finally, this project supports the education and mentorship of undergraduates through opportunities for engagement in research. <br/><br/>This proposal concerns two principal research directions. The first concerns a pseudorandom diffusion process -- the Abelian sandpile -- which is at the same time both extremely simple in its mechanics, and extremely complex in its behavior. The rich fractals produced by the model had frustrated decades of inquiry. This project aims to extend the mathematical framework recently developed by the principal investigator and collaborators; for example, to understand the effect the choice of underlying lattice has on the behavior of the sandpile. The second area concerns new kinds of probabilistic analyses of point configurations and networks. For example, the question of the length of the shortest cycle through a collection of points in the plane is the Traveling Salesman Problem for Euclidean space, a problem of both classical theoretical interest and immediate practical utility (in transport problems, drilling problems, etc.). A major educational goal of the project is the mentorship of undergraduate research; the investigator has experience in designing courses and research seminars that have been effective for this goal."

The PI will tackle these problems using a wide range of mathematical tools and techniques from probability, topology, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.  One of the main goals of this project is to study the interplay between combinatorial and algebraic methods, and to further develop these methods by studying some of the most central open problems in the field.

While this method originates in foundational questions, over the years profound applications to the study of many central objects of classical mathematics and computer science were discovered. This project will investigate an emerging connection to the area of graph theory. Graphs are the basic discrete mathematical objects used to model networks and related systems. In combinatorics, one often investigates the asymptotic behavior of various quantitative properties (such as the density of the edges, or the size of a certain regular pattern) for large finite graphs. Model theory provides a method of converting asymptotic quantitative questions about properties of a family of graphs into qualitative questions about the shape, volume or dimension of a certain limiting infinite object (via the so-called ultraproduct construction). Infinitary model-theoretic machinery to study such limit objects will be used to address questions in finite graph combinatorics, and conversely rich body of results in combinatorics will be used to attack open questions in model theory.<br/><br/>As demonstrated in the previous work of the principal investigator and other researchers, recent advances on pseudo-randomness and Ramsey-type phenomena for restricted families of graphs (e.g. semialgebraic regularity lemma by Fox et al., Tao's algebraic regularity lemma over finite fields, regularity lemma for graphs of finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension by Lovasz-Szegedy, etc.) admit a uniform model-theoretic treatment well-aligned with the methods and ideas in Shelah's classification theory. This project initiates a systematic program of investigating these connections, centered around the study of Keisler measures and various model-theoretic notions of dimension (e.g. coming from forking independence or pseudofinite counting) in tame classes of first-order structures (stable, distal, dependent, simple, NTP2, etc.), as well as the finer questions on generalized ""incidence bounds"" and their relation to Zilber's trichotomy phenomena."

These advances have made polynomial optimization a viable tool in many applications. An important example is computer vision, for which a key goal is to estimate and characterize the three-dimensional shapes within a scene, given a set of two-dimensional images.

For the second project the focus is on algebraic vision, for which the aim is to apply techniques from algebraic geometry and polynomial optimization to questions in computer vision, with potentially important practical application. Concurrently, the study of applied formulations has the potential to inspire new mathematical theories. Research in algebraic vision continues to create strong ties to the computer vision community and will help create an intellectual exchange between mathematics and vision, benefiting both fields and providing a stimulating training environment for mathematics students looking toward careers in industry. The long-term aim of the last project is to develop the computational aspects of polynomial optimization in the presence of symmetry.  Numerous problems in applications come with symmetries, and the ability to exploit this feature often determines whether or not the problem can be solved."

Thus, this project seeks to vastly improve our understanding of Stanley-Reisner rings (and modules) of complexes, especially when they are not Cohen-Macaulay or even not Buchsbaum.

This led to a new subfield that is sometimes called ""the Polynomial Method"". The philosophy behind this subfield is that collections of objects that exhibit an extremal behavior often have hidden algebraic structure. As a simple example, if a finite set of points in the plane contains many pairs that are at a distance of 1 from each other, one might expect this set to have a grid structure. Once the algebraic structure is found, it can be exploited to gain a better understanding of the original problem. To expose the algebraic structure, one defines polynomials on the studied objects and explores their properties by using algebraic tools, often from Algebraic Geometry. For example, for a problem involving a finite set of points in the plane, one might wish to study the properties of a minimum-degree polynomial that vanishes on the point set. Beyond solving various longstanding problems, this new subfield is also leading to the discovery of interesting connections between Combinatorial Geometry and other fields, such as Harmonic Analysis and Theoretical Computer Science. This project is based on the assumption that the new ""algebraic era"" in Combinatorial Geometry has not yet reached its peak. It investigates further problems that seem approachable via algebraic techniques, and aims to further develop the current algebraic tools.<br/><br/>The first part of this project involves studying several main open problems in Discrete Geometry by using algebraic methods. Specifically, studying the distinct distances problem in R^d, the characterization of point sets that determine few distinct distances, and the problem of deriving stronger and more general bounds for incidence problems. Part of the importance of deriving stronger incidence bounds is that many problems can be reduced to incidence problems (including problems from Combinatorics, Harmonic Analysis, and Number Theory). The second part of the project concerns connections between Discrete Geometry and Additive Combinatorics, also by using polynomial methods. This partly involves further studying known connections between the two fields, but focuses mainly on establishing a new type of connection. This connection consists of defining geometric variants of additive energy and extending some of the known additive energy results to these variants (such as the Balog-Szemeredi-Gowers theorem and higher moment energies)."

Combinatorics deals with discrete objects such as finite sets, graphs, and permutations; many continuous phenomena allow for a discrete representation, lending themselves amenable to combinatorial methods of study as well.  Cluster algebras and the combinatorics underlying them were discovered only relatively recently, but their importance for application in other areas of mathematics and physics is becoming increasingly apparent. It is often the case that similar combinatorial structures underlie seemingly unrelated mathematical entities, revealing hidden connections between them and allowing the transfer of insights and techniques from one discipline to another. This project aims to extend and deepen these connections.<br/><br/>This research is motivated by several classical areas of mathematics. The main tools come from combinatorics, including combinatorial topology, the machinery of quiver mutations, symmetric functions and Young tableaux, and combinatorial ring theory. Cluster algebras, and the combinatorics of quiver mutations underlying them, have found applications in several mathematical disciplines including representation theory, Teichmüller theory, mathematical physics, and enumerative and geometric combinatorics. A new application of cluster theory to the study of isolated singularities of plane algebraic curves will be studied. Another research direction concerns the theory of noncommutative Schur functions and related questions of combinatorial ring theory. The project will also investigate applications of algebraic combinatorics to planar projective geometry and algebraic complexity theory."

Applications of these objects then appear in many branches of mathematics, computer science, and the natural sciences.  In some settings, it can be very useful when these objects possess quasirandom properties.  As such, quasirandom graph and hypergraph theory constitutes a well-studied area of modern combinatorics. Important and applicable results here include Regularity Lemmas, which guarantee that all large graphs and hypergraphs admit decompositions into relatively few parts, where most of these parts are quasirandom.  Moreover, it is also known that these decompositions can be efficiently constructed.  Constructive regularity lemmas form the primary area of the research supported by this award.  the PI studies applications of algorithmic (hypergraph) regularity lemmas to constructive combinatorial problems arising in theoretical computer science.  Moreover, the research proposes that several distinct theories of quasirandom hypergraphs are essentially interchangeable, which would say, in particular, that all of them are constructive.  These projects, and others, will contribute to an existing and long-studied regularity-based infrastructure within graph theory, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science.  These projects also serve as a basis for the mentoring activities of the current researcher at a large metropolitan university, and the funds help to support public students working in this area.  <br/><br/>The Szemeredi Regularity Lemma (1975) guarantees that all large graphs G can be partitioned into a number of classes, where most of these classes are epsilon-regular, and where the number of classes depends only on the choice of epsilon.  For over four decades, this result has been highly impactful and influential in Combinatorics, and its varied use became known as the Regularity Method.  Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma was extended in important ways.  One extension due to Alon et al. gives a polynomial-time algorithm for constructing the partition it guarantees.  Other work by several authors extended it to a hypergraph setting, where the partitions which arise are necessarily technical, and where different authors considered different points of view.  Rodl et al. considered a concept of r-discrepancy, while Gowers considered a concept of deviation.  Recent work of the PI, Rodl and Schacht showed that the deviation-based Regularity Lemma can be made constructive. The project seeks to show that the underlying concepts of discrepancy and deviation are essentially equivalent, and therefore both regularity lemmas can be made algorithmic.  (This is known to be true for 3-uniform hypergraphs, where discrepancy and deviation are also equivalent to a third concept known as minimality.)  The PI also considers a handful of applications of the work above to several constructive combinatorial problems, including coloring, packing, and testing problems for hypergraphs, among others."

In combinatorial representation theory one seeks simpler ways to represent them in order to understand, organize and apply them to other subjects. This project deals with tensor products of representations, which is a way to combine representations. The main problem that the project seeks to understand is how to decompose tensor products into sums of simpler representations. One can think about it as the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals. The tensor product decomposition is a difficult problem but also very important, because it shows up in many fields, including algebraic combinatorics, complexity theory, and statistics, and has applications in medicine, computer vision, physics, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication.<br/><br/>A fundamental open problem in combinatorial representation theory is to describe in the decomposition of the tensor product the multiplicities of two irreducible representations of the symmetric group; these multiplicities are called Kronecker coefficients. The problem of finding a combinatorial interpretation for these coefficients has been labeled as one of the ""main problems in combinatorial representation theory."" The PI and collaborators have been able to connect the Kronecker coefficients to the partition algebra. This connection led to the discovery of the ""universal characters"" of the symmetric group, which are symmetric functions that specialize to characters of the symmetric group when evaluated at roots of unity. These symmetric functions connect several difficult problems in combinatorial representation theory and will lead to the resolution of several of these problems."

The research supported by this award will center on using modern degeneration techniques, especially those from the field of tropical geometry, to study classical spaces from algebraic geometry. The main goal of tropical geometry is transforming questions about algebraic varieties into questions about polyhedral complexes. A process called tropicalization attaches a polyhedral complex to an algebraic variety. The polyhedral complex, a combinatorial object, encodes some of the geometry of the original algebraic variety. The research develops further tools for the study of algebraic varieties in terms of their so called ""nonarchimedean analytification"". Overall this project will refine, abstract, and generalize these new methods and explore deeper applications to open problems in algebraic geometry. In conjunction with this research program, the PI will continue to direct the SUMRY program for undergraduate research in mathematics at Yale, providing not only research opportunities for the undergraduate participants, but also mentorship opportunities for the graduate students and postdocs leading small group projects. <br/><br/>The PI will extend the tropical independence methods developed in proofs of the Gieseker-Petri theorem and the maximal rank conjecture for quadrics, developing new notions of tropicalization of linear series and combining piecewise linear methods with reduction of rational functions to pursue further progress toward the maximal rank conjecture and strong maximal rank conjecture. He will continue his work using the combinatorial topology of moduli spaces of stable tropical curves to extract information about the top weight cohomology of moduli spaces of curves, looking for additional structures such as hidden filtrations whose graded pieces are representation stable with respect to the action induced by permutation of the marked points. The PI also aims to develop foundations for a tropical theory of vector bundles, by generalizing the theory of convergence Newton polygons for vector bundles with connection on algebraic curves to vector bundles with integrable connections on higher dimensional varieties, using toric vector bundles as a test case.  <br/><br/>"

Each MAAGC workshop has brought four outstanding mathematicians from across North America to give talks about new advances in algebraic combinatorics, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and other related fields.  In addition to these invited lectures, there is a poster session for junior participants, a panel discussion featuring concrete and timely professional advice for mathematicians at varying stages in their careers, and plenty of unstructured time for forging mathematical collaborations.<br/><br/>MAAGC workshops are designed to strengthen and connect the scientific communities in algebra, geometry, and combinatorics by facilitating positive interactions among students, postdocs, and faculty at research universities as well as small colleges in the Mid-Atlantic.  We aim to include even more graduate student and postdoctoral participants throughout the region, providing early career researchers the opportunity to learn about recent trends in the field, disseminate their own work, build professional connections, and advance new mathematical results.  The majority of the budget is thus dedicated toward funding students and young researchers without other means of financial support, prioritizing participants who also present posters.

This is a growing field whose beginnings were prompted by the dawn of the computer age.  Its practitioners have the same goals as the invariant theorists of the 19th century. The emphasis is on constructions and algorithms. At the start of the 20th century Hilbert showed how much easier it is to prove the existence of a mathematical object than  to construct it. At the time when all constructions had to be done by hand it was very alluring to abandon constructions. Abstract mathematics flourished with powerful new results and methods  to the present date.  Computers combined with emergence of powerful symbolic software brought back interest and ability to construct. The power of combinatorial constructs emerged at the same time to create a field of growing promise. What is a combinatorial construct? The answer is simple: it  is a visual realization of a mathematical construct. The old saying ""A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words"" cannot be more appropriate in this case. When we translate a mathematical construct into a single visual image a variety of properties of the construct emerge that were not as evident in the original purely mathematical formulation. We must see to believe how these properties predict identities relating some of the most abstruse mathematical constructs. The interplay between algebra and combinatorics is at the heart of the research activities supported by this award. <br/><br/><br/>Research of the last two decades has shown in a unequivocal way that symmetric function theory  is a powerful computational tool not only for theoretical investigations also  but for obtaining computer data in various branches of mathematics. Therefore the most significant by-products of the planed research are new symmetric function tools and identities. Early computer explorations by the principal investigator  and  Haiman  yielded data which revealed  a surprisingly  intimate connection between the space of Diagonal Harmonics, Parking Functions, and the Theory of Macdonald polynomials. This development produced a variety of problems and conjectures some of which are still open. Parallel to this development the researchers in the Theory of Torus Knots obtained symmetric function constructs identical to those derived in our field  using Parking Functions. The proposed work aims to exploit this connection. The resulting discoveries can  positively affect  areas that have been connected with the present field: Representation Theory, Symmetric Function Theory, Combinatorics, Algebraic Geometry, and Computational Algebra.  Algebraic Combinatorics is particularly suitable  for  computer experimentation.  This  activity is  highly effective for training  young researchers and allowing them to discover the manner in which  research  can be carried in our Computer Age. Under this setting, even  students with limited background can be brought to experience the joy of  discovery. The variety of discoveries that  research in the proposed areas has already created, and has the potential of creating, is an enrichment of the  Mathematical Magics  that can inspire future  generations of young researchers."

The recent decade has seen tremendous development in the subject that both established the field as an area in its own right and unveiled its deep connections to numerous branches of pure and applied mathematics. Moduli spaces are spaces of parameters that classify algebro-geometric mathematical objects, such as varieties, maps between varieties, and vector bundles. This research project aims at providing a new combinatorial perspective on classical moduli spaces and their interplay with nonarchimedean analytic geometry. Computational challenges in this direction are its driving force. The primary goal is to deepen understanding of these objects and develop new techniques to analyze such abstract spaces through concrete computations in tropical geometry. Several topics investigated in this project witness the interdisciplinary nature of the subject and are suitable for research in collaboration with graduate students.<br/><br/>Tropical geometry provides a framework for solving algebro-geometric problems using concrete combinatorial tools: algebraic varieties are replaced by weighted, balanced polyhedral complexes. These objects preserve just enough data about the original varieties to remain meaningful, while discarding much of their complexity. Their combinatorics depends strongly on the embeddings of our varieties. By contrast, the Berkovich space or the space of valuations is independent of all such choices. By choosing appropriate coordinates, the geometry and topology of these valuations are reflected in rich combinatorial properties on the polyhedral side, including connectedness, shellability, etc. Thus, the intricacies of the original space turn into exciting combinatorial problems. Tropicalizations resulting from these nice embeddings are said to be faithful. The project aims at developing certificates for local faithfulness by means of initial (Groebner) degenerations of the variety. The notion of faithfulness near that point then turns into desirable properties of this degeneration. Not surprisingly, validating these properties requires a deep understanding of the combinatorics and geometry of the initial degenerations. Thus, the need to find effective methods for constructing or detecting faithfulness is at the core of tropical geometry. The project will develop such program for several important classes of examples: Grassmannians, moduli of curves, del Pezzo surfaces, Fano schemes and cluster varieties."

Ideas and techniques from combinatorics are increasingly being used in other areas of pure mathematics such as algebraic geometry and representation theory, as well as applied areas such as mathematical physics and complexity theory. The central theme of this project is to adapt definitions of classical types of objects in algebraic combinatorics, usually defined perhaps only for partitions or the complete graph, to apply to general diagrams or graphs. Often studying this generalized setting reveals geometric and algebraic connections of which only a shadow is visible in the original setting.<br/><br/>This project includes several directions for research. One direction of study is to investigate the structural relationships between Specht modules for general diagrams, the cohomology classes of diagram Schubert varieties, and the geometry of matching ensemble polytopes. Another topic is to investigate certain weighted lattice point sums on flow polytopes of graphs, which in the case of the complete graph are related to the combinatorics of parking functions and the Hilbert series of the space of diagonal harmonics. A third topic is to study various generalizations of Schubert polynomials from a geometric and representation-theoretic perspective."

The conference will provide a high quality program of speakers in the area of permutation patterns with opportunities for collaboration between junior and senior researchers, as well as between participants from around the world. The conference will feature two plenary one-hour speakers and a number of contributed talks, each of thirty minutes long. Researchers will present their new results and there will be time for open discussions to explore unsolved problems in the field. This award supports travel to the conference by students and early career mathematicians from the United States. This conference is part of a series of annual conferences devoted to the area of permutation patterns. Ever since the first conference in 2003, which was hosted by the University of Otago in New Zealand, it has been held every year at different institutions around the world: in North America, Europe, Asia and Australasia. About 70 participants are anticipated, with about 35-40 contributed talks with no parallel sessions. The conference has been publicized through distribution lists, AMS and other mathematical event calendars, and related conference websites (the conference website is at https://pp2017.github.io/). <br/><br/>The conference will feature current research in the area of permutation patterns and its applications. Major themes in the conference include the structural theory of pattern classes, asymptotic behavior of pattern classes, generalized pattern avoidance, packing densities, and algorithmic and decidability problems. Research in the area is influenced by theoretical computer science, and traces its historical origins to the study of sorting machines. Combinatorial interest in permutation patterns focuses on centrally important enumeration and packing problems, for instance the extremal problem to determine how one pattern can be embedded as often as possible in a permutation. The statistics of permutations also enters into the picture, garnering attention from probabilists. The conference is expected to have a wide impact on a variety of different research areas in mathematics and computer science."

While the use of randomness in computer science is ubiquitous, many important computational and algorithmic problems remain to be studied using this foundational concept. Despite the complexity of many theoretic as well as practical modern algorithms, randomness is frequently able to remedy the worst-case examples focusing on the average case examples and randomized algorithms which make use of local information. This includes such intensively studied problems as the so-called Travelling Salesperson problem, by concentrating on geometric versions where efficient algorithms are feasible. An important aspect of the project is the involvement of students in the research, which is expected to have a broad impact on mathematics and on computer science beyond the theoretical foundations of the project.<br/><br/>A special focus of this project is to identify problems that involve random walks on graphs and digraphs. Based on significant recent progress, a thorough investigation of so-called hashing schemes will be undertaken, examining search algorithms on graphs that employ only local information. The classical random walk is a prime example of such an algorithm. The current available analysis for preferential attachment graphs, which are connected to random models of the world-wide web, will be extended to more general models of graphs. A statistical test has been devised for detecting bias in a sample claiming to be from the steady state of a Markov chain. Another line of research is on-line purchasing problems. In such problems, the edges of a graph are given random costs and are presented sequentially and they must be selected or rejected. The accepted edges are used to build a structure, and the goal is to build this structure as economically as possible."

In the last few decades the method has experienced tremendous development, propelled by applications in many areas of science, and in particular in theoretical computer science. The project includes foundational problems in combinatorics where randomization plays a crucial role. Further development of the existing tools as well as invention of new tools and techniques will be used to solve those problems, and to investigate both practical and theoretic applications. Plans to disseminate the new discoveries at major international conferences of experts are included as part of the project.<br/><br/>The probabilistic method has become a cornerstone of research in modern combinatorics. This project studies the main open problems and applications, including the Kahn-Kallai conjecture and related problems regarding the threshold behavior of graph properties in random graphs. The aim is to find threshold functions for the appearance of large graphs in a random graph, to prove universality-type results, and to develop general tools for embedding general graphs into arbitrary graphs and digraphs satisfying some given desired pseudorandom properties. Another salient part of the project is the broad topic of packing problems, which concerns partitioning combinatorial objects into members from a specified family of objects. The study of the classical tree-packing conjecture and related problems has led to the development of new embedding techniques which can be useful in different areas and form a central part of the project. The project also considers the broad topic of random sums, which is known as the Littlewood-Offord problem. Motivated by a central problem in the theory of random matrices, resilience-type versions of these question and also working with sums of dependent random variables are considered, with potential impact on error-correcting codes and cryptography."

One example of such a question is to determine the possible number of intersection points among a given number of lines in the plane. This project investigates such combinatorial questions using methods from algebraic geometry. Some combinatorial invariants have been shown to have algebraic geometric nature, that is, there are algebraic varieties associated to special combinatorial objects, and it is possible to express combinatorial invariants using the corresponding algebraic varieties. Once such algebraic geometric nature is realized, one can translate combinatorial questions into questions about algebraic varieties, with the potential to reduce them to known results in algebraic geometry. The underlying algebraic geometry structures beneath combinatorial objects can also lead to deeper understanding of the combinatorial objects. <br/><br/>Matroid theory is a fundamental subject in combinatorial geometry. The first goal of this project is to explore the algebraic geometric nature of the numerical invariants of matroids that are realizable over some field. More precisely, the project aims to express the numerical invariants in terms of the (étale or singular) cohomology ring of some associated algebraic varieties, obtaining new properties of the matroids. The more ambitious goal is to develop combinatorial generalizations of theorems in algebraic geometry and to derive properties for non-realizable matroids."
