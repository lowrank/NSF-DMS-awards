Their very definition makes hypergeometric functions amenable to treatment by analytic and combinatorial methods. The study of their differential equations from a D-module theoretic point of view is the subject of this project. A breakthrough in the late 1980s due to Gelfand, Graev, Kapranov and Zelevinsky provided a new connection between hypergeometric functions (in several variables) and the theory of toric varieties, a subfield of algebraic geometry with a strong combinatorial flavor. This link has made available a variety of algebraic, homological and combinatorial tools to study hypergeometric differential equations and their solutions. The goal of this project is to advance the theory of hypergeometric functions and differential equations.<br/><br/><br/>The solutions of hypergeometric differential equations comprise a rich and interesting class of functions. Familiar functions, such as the trigonometric functions, belong to this class. The importance of these functions lies in their usefulness, not only within mathematics, but in physics and engineering as well. The present research will provide advances in the theory of hypergeometric differential equations; its underlying philosophy is to view hypergeometric functions as bridges between different areas of mathematics."

This workshop dovetails with the special session ""Advances in Algebraic & Geometric Combinatorics"" occurring at the American Mathematical Society meeting the following two days in Lexington, KY where sixteen of the workshop participants will be giving talks.  Besides the four speakers, at least twenty-five additional researchers are expected to participate in the workshop.<br/><br/>The CATS 2010 Workshop highlights four of the major research themes in combinatorics: Coxeter groups, topological combinatorics, polytopes and manifolds, and quasisymmetric functions in representation theory.  Topics of discussion will include understanding affine Grassmannians (connections with Hilbert schemes, determining a Schur function analogue for its (co)homology), total positivity from a topological perspective (for regular cell complexes, Bruhat order), face vector questions for polytopes and manifolds (the Charney-Davis conjecture, the g-conjecture for spheres and manifolds, lower bound theorem for spheres, manifolds and pseudomanifolds), and combinatorial properties of quasisymmetric Schur and skew-quasisymmetric Schur functions.  A number of the workshop participants are engaged in research spanning more than one of the four areas, so their presence will help foster the interdisciplinary goals of the workshop.  The workshop schedule includes ample time for workshop participants to establish new research contacts, discuss open problems and determine possible new avenues of research.<br/><br/>The award provides full funding for the invited speakers and partial funding for the workshop participants.

Using the newly constructed combinatorial models for Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals by the PI and her collaborators, it is proposed to tackle the X=M conjecture of Hatayama et al. which gives explicit fermionic formulas for configuration sums of certain statistical mechanical models.  Affine crystal structures have recently also been found to be important in combinatorial expressions for Littlewood-Richardson and fusion coefficients, as well as charge formulas for Macdonald polynomials.  In particular, Fomin and Greene's theory of noncommutative symmetric functions in the realm of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals, the affine nilCoxeter algebra, and the affine local plactic algebra will be used to find such formulas.  In addition, the PI proposes to study the combinatorial representation theory of bi-Hecke monoids and algebras, and the quantum R-matrix to explore generalizations of affine crystals.  Combinatorial methods are often amenable to computational investigations.  The robust implementation of algorithms derived from the project will lead to the development of new packages for the open-source computer algebra system SAGE.<br/><br/>The PI's research is in the area of algebraic combinatorics. This is the study of discrete objects and maps between them (combinatorics) together with algebraic properties that govern the structures of these objects.  The combinatorial problems which arise are related to representation theory (study of symmetries), physics (energy levels of particles and their structure coefficients), and geometry (intersections of curves in space).  One of the main tools used in this research are crystal graphs, which describe these structures in the ""zero temperature limit"" and yet encapture all of the important properties. Due to its concreteness, combinatorics is very amenable to computational investigations. The algorithms derived from this project will be implemented in the open-source computer algebra system SAGE."

The research is largely motivated by concrete questions of a combinatorial nature, but it also addresses questions of interest in category theory and general algebra, which in turn should find applications elsewhere. The PI has recently completed an 800 page monograph  (coauthored with Swapneel Mahajan from IIT Mumbai), on which a solid conceptual framework for the study of a large class of Hopf algebras that arise in combinatorics was laid out. This project took about 7 years of dedicated work. This long journey has opened the door to a wealth of new questions and exciting avenues to explore. A very important  finding of this work is the existence of a general construction of Hopf algebras which includes at the same time the combinatorial Hopf algebras alluded to above, and the deformations of the enveloping algebras of simple Lie algebras (quantum groups). This connection has not been explored in depth yet, but it certainly deserves to be. Thus, an important goal of this project will be to bridge between the world of combinatorial Hopf algebras and that of abstract Hopf algebras. There have been recent important advances in the latter (by Andruskiewitsch, Schneider, and others) which should be mutually beneficial to this endeavor.  Central to this work is Joyal's notion of species. It provides the right framework for the application of categorical ideas to algebraic combinatorics. The theory of Fock functors, whose first stages are developed in the PI's work with Mahajan, links the setting of Hopf monoids in species with that of graded Hopf algebras. Extensions of the theory will be explored. Concrete applications to algebraic combinatorics will be a theme of major focus for this project.<br/><br/>The use of algebraic techniques in order to study concrete combinatorial problems, pioneered by Rota, Stanley, and many others, has gained solid ground over the past two decades. This project builds in this direction by exploiting notions and ideas from category theory. Categorical ideas, properly employed, can be very powerful and clarifying. Conversely, the concrete questions studied in this project will serve as motivation and guide for new developments in algebra and category theory. The PI will introduce graduate students to this area of research and make international contacts and collaborations in Europe, Latin America, and India."

This is explored by studying the Euclidean analogs of two problems which were recently investigated in the context of vector spaces over finite fields. The first problem is a natural generalization of the Falconer distance problem to the study of point configurations.  The second problem is drawn from a large class of problems known as the sum-product problems.  The continuous nature of the first problem and the discrete nature of the second allows the researcher to incorporate a variety of methods from various fields in order to better illustrate the general principles involved.  These include methods drawn from arithmetic and geometric combinatorics, number theory, and classical harmonic analysis.  The juxtaposition of the methods from the Euclidean cases with the methods in the context of the finite field geometry could provide a more complete picture of the set expansion phenomenon.<br/><br/>This project involves studying the interaction between several areas of mathematics using a problem-solving approach, in which two problems are considered whose analogs have known solutions in one subfield of mathematics known as finite field geometry.  The problems are examined in two additional related subfields known as discrete and continuous Euclidean geometry.  The goal of the project is to not only find solutions to the two problems in these alternate contexts, but to explore the interplay between a variety of known methods and techniques in order to obtain a more complete understanding of the scope of the general principles involved.  The major areas of mathematics these problems are taken from include additive and geometric combinatorics, number theory, and classical harmonic analysis.  These areas have a variety of applications in encryption, data mining, signal processing, and bioinformatics."

A pattern in a permutation written in one-line notation is a subsequence whose entries have a prescribed relative order. This definition can be re-phrased in various different contexts, e.g. geometrical, where a permutation is identified with its plot, and model-theoretic, where a permutation is taken to be a set with two linear orders defined on it.  Of particular interest are the sets of permutations which are closed under involvement.  These are precisely the sets of permutations which can be defined by avoiding (i.e. not involving) prescribed sets of permutations (""forbidden patterns""). The conference topics include enumeration questions, algorithmic problems, and applications and generalizations of permutation patterns.<br/><br/>Historically, the study of pattern containment in permutations arose from two independent streams in 1960s and 1970s. One was combinatorial in nature, and concentrated on the enumeration problems for permutations with a small set (size 1 or 2, typically) of short (length up to 4) forbidden patterns. The other was coming from Theoretical Computer Science, and was concerned with sets arising from common sorting mechanisms and their combinations. In the past 10 years or so these two strands have come much closer together, and this interaction has created a new, fast developing area of combinatorics, with significant interactions with Theoretical Computer Science, the Theory of Computability and Complexity, Algebra, and Computational Biology, to name only a few.  Apart from the continued interest in sorting mechanisms and enumeration problems, major new strands of research have emerged including the structural theory of classes, the asymptotic behavior of classes, generalized pattern avoidance, packing densities, algorithmic and decidability problems, and geometrical methods."

The second project is an exploration of critical groups of graphs, also known as sandpile groups, which were independently introduced by researchers in diverse fields such as graph theory, dynamical systems, electrical networks, and arithmetic geometry.  The third project considers various objects from algebraic geometry, including linear systems and Jacobians, and examines their analogues for metric graphs, also known in the literature as quantum graphs or abstract tropical curves.  In addition to a number of intrinsic questions arising in each of these fields, the topics of these three projects exhibit intriguing connections to other areas in both pure and applied mathematics.  Some of these subjects are Teichmuller theory, number theory, and geometric combinatorics, as well as mathematical physics, combinatorial optimization, and mathematical biology. <br/><br/>At its heart, algebraic combinatorics involves counting, but this enumeration typically is done while keeping track of certain data.  This is similar to the census, where it is more useful to obtain a detailed breakdown including demographic information rather than simply a single number stating the number of Americans.  A common theme throughout the PI's research is the use of such enumeration techniques to provide new approaches for solving problems in other areas of mathematics.  For example, in the theory of cluster algebras, certain geometric formulas arise through a process called seed mutation.  However, these same expressions can be computed instead by counting, as long as one knows what features for which to look.  The PI will study more phenomena like this, where complicated expressions can be reduced to more concrete calculations.  The above topics naturally lend themselves to computational projects and undergraduate research.  For instance, the PI plans to use the open source math software Sage with students to get more of them interested in these topics, while creating computational packages for other researchers.

A goal is to extend classical theorems in the area and to discover new phenomena using modern approaches, which include the semirandom or nibble method and hypergraph regularity. The PI and his collaborators have recently used these tools to improve and extend several  results in combinatorics that have been around for decades. The plan is to continue these projects. Several questions that were unapproachable for many years have suddenly come within reach due to some ground-breaking recent developments and the PI plans to continue exploiting these new techniques to shed light on old problems.  The specific questions to be attacked concern the chromatic  number of locally sparse hypergraphs,  the structure of typical hypergraphs that contains no copy of some fixed configuration, and the enumeration  of copies of one hypergraph in another.<br/><br/>The  extremal theory of hypergraphs impacts several areas of Mathematics and also has consequences in  other fields like information theory, coding theory, and theoretical computer science. The study of random structures and randomized algorithms has gained importance in recent years due to the proliferation of large networks like the internet and various other social networks.  Developing new techniques to study these complex systems will be a major task for future researchers. Part of this project seeks to develop randomized algorithms that break a large complicated system into smaller, well understood pieces."

In this proposal the PI will focus on graph partitions and their applications. The PI will continue his research in the area of developing and applying a method in extremal graph theory based on the Regularity Lemma and the Blow-up Lemma. Roughly speaking here the Regularity Lemma finds the graph partition and then the Blow-up Lemma tells us how to use this partition. A recent development on the method is the new ""de-regularization"" technique that helps to eliminate the use of the Regularity Lemma from these proofs, while maintaining other key elements, and thus the results are much more applicable (since the Regularity Lemma applies only for very large graphs).<br/><br/>This research is in the area of extremal discrete mathematics. The fundamental question of this field has the following form: determine the maximum (or minimum) size of a discrete mathematical object that satisfies a certain condition. It turns out that this general problem has connections to very diverse fields (geometry, design theory, number theory, algebra, topology, etc.) and to areas with important concrete applications in everyday life (computer science, coding theory, cryptography, optimization and scheduling problems, communication and networking problems, etc.). Therefore achieving results on these research problems will have serious implications in these applications as well."

""Quasirandomness"" is a broad term referring to situations where combinatorial objects -- e.g., graphs, hypergraphs, lattice walks, permutations, subsets of groups -- resemble random objects of their class with respect to some set of statistics.  Central goals of the project are to prove tight bounds on the discrepancy of several proposed quasirandom constructions, explore new quasirandom analogues of well-known probabilistic processes, and develop theory to describe implicative hierarchies of quasirandom properties.  The investigator will further analogize and extend the very useful relationships between quasirandomness and uniformity/regularity already well understood for graphs, hypergraphs, permutations, and abelian groups.  He will also study applications of quasirandomness to graph algorithms (e.g., network routing), coding theory (e.g., liar games), and numerical integration (e.g., walk-on-spheres Monte Carlo simulation).<br/><br/>Probabilistic intuition has been a powerful and influential tool in the past half-century of mathematics, computer science, and physics.  Surprisingly often, the best known solution to a problem arises from constructions that involve some amount of randomness.  Probability theory has lent a decisive perspective on many theoretical questions, particularly in discrete mathematics, the realm of finite objects, relationships, and computations.  Despite the extraordinary success of probabilistic methods, however, such approaches face a few serious shortcomings when implemented in real-world applications.  First, they do not offer explicit solutions, but only ensure the desired properties with some positive probability.  Second, ""true"" randomness is costly and time-consuming to obtain, as the physical universe behaves with consummate predictability on all but the tiniest scales.  Lastly, sometimes, the fluctuations which inevitably accompany randomness prevent solutions from being completely optimal.  One remedy to such deficiencies is to imitate -- or even improve upon -- useful aspects of randomness by carefully designed deterministic processes.  Constructions which resemble random ones according to particular measurements are known as ""quasirandom"".  Research on quasirandomness can provide guaranteed explicit constructions, obviate the need for randomness, and sometimes yield solutions that have even better properties than random constructions.  The PI will continue his work on this subject, as well as continuing to mentor graduate and undergraduate students and organize meetings at the local, regional, and national levels to share ideas between researchers of related areas."

Questions of fairness and social choice are of interest to political scientists, economists, and game theorists, and motivate interesting mathematical questions.  The space of preferences and the preference sets of each person are often naturally geometric sets (e.g., convex, connected, polyhedral), and the desired solution is often at the intersection of such sets.  This project aims to prove mathematical theorems (e.g., about set intersections and triangulations of polyhedra) that have direct bearing on important problems in the social sciences involving voting and fairness."

Cluster algebras are commutative algebras with a special combinatorial structure. The theory of cluster algebras is a fast developing field which is related to many areas of mathematics. The PI will continue his study of the special type of cluster algebras associated to Riemann surfaces; he will introduce generalized cluster variables and use them to construct canonical bases for these cluster algebras, and he will develop combinatorial models for explicit computations inside the cluster algebra. The PI will also investigate cluster-tilted algebras, which are certain finite dimensional algebras, whose modules correspond to elements of the cluster algebra. Cluster-tilted algebras provide a new point of view on tilting theory over hereditary algebras, and their module categories carry interesting information about the cluster algebra.<br/><br/>When cluster algebras were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002, their original motivation came from representation theory, which is a branch of modern algebra that is concerned with the study of symmetries of scientific models. Studying the symmetries of a model is often more fruitful than studying the model directly, and representation theory has found many applications in physics and chemistry as well as in other mathematical fields. The cluster algebras provide a mathematical framework for fundamental patterns which occur throughout representation theory. Surprisingly, these patterns are also observed in various other branches of science which, a priori, are not related to representation theory. This motivates a further development of the theory of cluster algebras to which this project will contribute."

One research direction is centered around the problem of geometric incidences between points and curves and their connections with problems involving distances, areas, and other measures. The project also deals with geometric questions in Ramsey theory, applications of Van der Waerden's theorem on arithmetic progressions and new results of this type, and others that fit in the broader category of monotone paths in line arrangements. Of particular interest are techniques that permit reformulations of geometric problems in a purely combinatorial setting, such as the technique of allowable sequences introduced by Goodman and Pollack. The last category comprises problems of estimating the size of sets that appear in the theory of set addition and multiplication. Ramsey type problems and Erdos-type extremal discrete geometry problems have attracted continued attention in the combinatorics and computational geometry communities, due to their relevance for computational problems (in range counting, pattern matching, motion planning, and others) and the rich techniques developed for improving extremal bounds (such as the epsilon-net theory, the Crossing Lemma, quasi-planar graphs, etc.), which proved to be instrumental in many areas of computational geometry.<br/><br/>A key objective of this project is to explore and identify new techniques for dealing with incidence and distance problems, and other problems in Ramsey theory and number theory that seem to require attacks from several directions. An important feature of the proposed research is advancing the integration of techniques from different areas---geometric graph theory, number theory, topology, linear programming, computer experiments, theory of algorithms---in finding solutions for problems in combinatorial geometry and Ramsey theory. Progress on some of the combinatorial questions presented here are likely to have applications in the design and analysis of geometric algorithms, approximation algorithms, etc, and consequently have impact in the real word over time."

Because the targeted nanostructures are often graphs (e.g. polyhedra), this application is a rich and natural source of appealing graph theoretical problems. Specifically, we will provide optimal design strategies in the form of algorithms and constructive proofs for new graph invariants corresponding to the minimum number of molecular components necessary to build a target graph under various laboratory settings. Furthermore we will determine the combinatorial structures of these building blocks, and how they may be assembled into the desired nanostructure. One method of producing self-assembling DNA nanostructures involves designing linear single strands of DNA that form double helixes along the edges of the desired graphical structure. Currently, these may be specially designed double strands, or a single long scaffolding strand held in place by many short staple strands, but either way, optimal paths for the strands through the target graph must be determined. A second construction method for self-assembly of DNA nanostructures uses k-armed branched junction molecules, called tiles, whose arms are double strands of DNA with one strand extending beyond the other. These arms attach to one another when the extended segments consist of complementary bases, thus forming the edges of a graphical structure. Combinatorially, tiles may be represented by vertices with labeled half-edges. Here the minimum number of tiles required and their combinatorial structures must be determined.<br/><br/>Two new graph invariants together with generalized transition polynomials, the topological Tutte polynomial, cycle double coverings, and genus results from topological graph theory apply to minimizing the molecular building blocks used in self-assembling nanostructures. For linear single strand methods, we will develop optimal strategies for locating the strands, characterize graphs that may be good candidates for these construction methods, and use graph polynomials to capture the topological properties of these constructs. For branched junction molecule methods we will provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of tile sets achieving the minimum number of tile and bond-edge types, and efficient algorithms for generating these sets. This is done under a range of different laboratory settings: whether flexible or rigid armed tiles are used, whether or not the incidental creation of same-size or smaller graphical complexes is acceptable, and whether the target graph is of fixed size (e.g. a polyhedron) or arbitrarily large (e.g. a lattice)."

This method is known as the differential equations method for greedy algorithms and random graph processes.  The investigator recently extended this technique to analyze the triangle-free process, a `controlled' random graph process that produces an interesting distribution on the space of triangle-free graphs.  The investigator showed that a graph drawn from this distribution is likely to have independence number within a constant multiplicative factor of the smallest possible.  In other words, the triangle-free process produces a Ramsey R(3,t) graph.

One of its fundamental problems is to determine for each surface S the set F of minimal graphs that have a cross no matter how they are drawn on S. It follows from the celebrated result of Robertson and Seymour on Wagner?s conjecture that F is finite for every surface S. However, nothing is known about the elements of F, except when S is the sphere or the projective plane. Over the past twenty years, many attempts were made by many researchers yet no new F is completely determined. The PI proposes a different approach to this problem. Results generated from this proposal could lead to a characterization of core members of each F, which would essentially determine F since other members of F are sporadic unimportant graphs.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the behavior of topological graph parameters such as genus and crossing number when the graph is well connected and is big. To achieve this goal, it will be necessary to study the interactions between connectivity, genus, and the size of the graph. A good understanding of such interactions would bring significant insights to the entire topological graph theory. Since surface graphs are so fundamental, these results could have very strong theoretical (on graph structures) and practical (on graph algorithms) impact in many areas of graph theory."

The source of this unexpected connection is based on the following idea. Given a map from a totally ordered set to itself, consider the finite sequences (orbits) that are obtained by iterating the map, starting from dierent initial points. The relative order of the points in the orbit determines a permutation. It turns out that, in the case of piecewise monotone maps on one-dimensional intervals, there are some permutations that do not occur in any orbit. These are called forbidden patterns. If a pattern is forbidden for a given map, then any longer permutation that contains it as a consecutive pattern is forbidden as well. This property relates the study of forbidden patterns of maps to the study of permutations avoiding consecutive patterns, a subject that has received attention in the combinatorics literature, including several papers by the PI. <br/><br/>One of the goals of this new approach to study dynamical systems from a combinatorial perspective is to better understand the set of forbidden patterns of a map, including how its properties are related to the properties of the map, how many patterns there are of each given length, how to algorithmically find these patterns, and which sets of patterns can be forbidden patterns of a map. The PI has already made some progress towards this goal by answering some of the above questions for shift systems and logistic maps."

The states of North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee have recently seen an influx of research strength in combinatorics and adjacent areas.  In particular, a remarkably large number of tenure-track combinatorialists (including several from underrepresented groups) currently work at various colleges and universities within about 5-6 hours drive of the Research Triangle area of North Carolina.  The proposal supports one-day conferences, on combinatorial themes, to be held in the Triangle once a semester, with the aim of fostering regular contact between researchers in the geographic region.  Each conference will bring four outstanding mathematicians from around the country to give talks about some of the most significant cutting-edge developments in combinatorics.<br/><br/>The focus of combinatorics is the structure of discrete (as opposed to continuous) sets of objects.  Combinatorics is critical to many areas of mathematics, and plays a key role in computational, scientific, and engineering applications.  The proposed conferences will: enhance the national infrastructure for research and education by creating and strengthening a regional network of interacting researchers; facilitate the dissemination of cutting-edge research ideas, methods and results among researchers in a large portion of the Southeastern U.S.; promote the teaching and training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars by exposing them to the perspectives of leading researchers; support the development of young faculty at various schools and help them build local support and research networks; and broaden participation of underrepresented groups, particularly women."

Kostochka<br/><br/>Packings and contractions of  graphs and hypergraphs<br/><br/><br/>The notions of packings and minors are basic in graph theory. An important instance of combinatorial packing problems is that of graph packing.  Graphs of order n pack, if there exists an edge disjoint placement of all these graphs into the complete graph with n vertices. In terms of graph packing, one can generalize or make more natural some  graph theory problems or concepts. Important examples of packing problems are problems on existence of a given subgraph, coloring problems, Turan-type problems, and Ramsey-type problems. Another basic notion is that of a minor. A graph H is a  minor of a graph G if H can be obtained from G by a sequence of contractions of edges and deletions of edges and vertices. A number of problems and results in graph theory relate impossibility to pack some graphs with the existence of some minors in these graphs. Maybe, the most famous example is Hadwiger's Conjecture that every non-k-colorable graph has the complete graph with k+1 vertices as a minor. The examples above (and many more) show that it is helpful and potentially fruitful to study in terms of graph packings and contractions a number of rather general problems that are rich enough models for many important applications.  Areas of application include scheduling, database access, assignment of computer registers, data clustering, computer-aided design of printed circuits, positional games, DNA sequencing, etc.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to explore a series of extremal problems on packings and minors of graphs and hypergraphs, with restrictions on degrees of their vertices.  It is expected that the results will make an essential step in understanding of these problems. Some proofs can lead to efficient packing and contraction algorithms; negative results will impose limits on what can be accomplished.  The particular packing problem of equitable coloring has many applications in scheduling, partitioning, and load balancing problems. A fair amount of the work will be done jointly with graduate students and recent graduates of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."

The k-Schur functions are symmetric functions discovered in a study of Macdonald polynomials. Pursuant work with k-Schur functions has led to a theory that branches into many fields along the lines of modern Schubert calculus. Classical Schubert calculus addressed enumerative problems in projective geometry and used intersection theory to convert them into problems of computation in the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian.  The explicit realization of such computations using combinatorial Schur theory played a major role in transforming Schubert calculus into a contemporary theory that provides elegant solutions to a diverse body of problems.  In a similar manner, the introduction of k-Schur functions has generated a pool of open problems in geometry, representation theory, algebra, and physics.  <br/><br/><br/>Combinatorics is a vast area of mathematics loosely described as the study of counting collections of objects that satisfy specified criteria.

This is bound to be very inspiring for all the participants, especially for those who otherwise do not do not have a chance to come into close contact with some of today's the leading mathematicians. The main speaker at the conference is Gregory Margulis of Yale University, who has done much brilliant work in combinatorics, differential geometry, ergodic theory, dynamical systems and discrete subgroups of Lie groups. For his great contributions to mathematics he was awarded a Fields Medal in 1978, and a Wolf Prize in 2005. There will be several other excellent mathematicians and speakers at the meeting; they have been chosen because they are not only powerful research mathematicians, but also wonderful expositors and very approachable people. Among other speakers, we shall have Alexander Barvinok of University of Michigan, who has proved outstanding results about distance geometry, convexity and algorithms related to them; Ralph Faudree, one of the most frequent collaborators of the late Paul Erdos, who has done much work on Ramsey theory and extremal graph theory; Oliver Riordan of the University of Oxford, one of the most brilliant combinatorialists in the world, who has contributed to many areas, most recently to the theory of convergent sequences of sparse graphs; Laszlo Szekely of the University of South Carolina, who is well known for his very elegant contributions to discrete geometry; Slava Krushkal of the Unversity of Virginia, who has done outstanding work on polynomials of surfaces related to the Tutte polynomial; Tsz Ho Chan of the University of Memphis, the young analytic number theorist, who has worked on pair correlation of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function, diophantine approximation and the distribution of primes, Andras Gyarfas of the Computer and Automation Institute in Budapest, the prolific combinatorialist, who has done much work on applications of Szemeredi's Lemma, and Jean-Paul Thouvenot, a Director at CNRS in Paris, one of the foremost people working on ergodic theory and dynamical systems. <br/><br/>Two of the lectures will be aimed at a general audience, including good high school students. In the first lecture, Ralph Faudree will not only introduce the audience to the immense contributions Paul Erdos made to mathematics, but will also paint a personal picture of Erdos, one of the most colourful mathematicians of the 20th century. In the second lecture Gregory Margulis will attempt to bring difficult mathematical ideas concerning geometry within reach of the audience. Unlike the East Coast or the Bay Area on the West Coast, the Mid-South cannot boast of many high-level mathematical conferences; the Contemporary Combinatorics 2010 meeting in Memphis goes some way towards redressing the balance. The formula whereby personal contacts between the lecturers and the other participants is greatly encouraged has been found very successful so far, so this is what we are planning for this year as well.

The topics involved are: integral Caratheodory property of normal polytopes and rational cones, homological and K-theoretical  properties of affine monoid rings, and cofibrations in the category of convex polytopes. The first research direction proposes a new dynamical approach to normal polytopes, as opposed to the traditional study of the static picture of a single polytope. This is done via encoding the interactions of normal polytopes in a certain global poset. The associated topology has a potential of shedding much light to some central open questions on Hilbert bases. The second research topic is an algorithmic attempt at disproving the conjecture that the affine cones over smooth projective toric varieties are Koszul. This includes algorithmic analysis of several closely related properties of independent interest: normality, quadratic generation, resolutions of toric singularities etc. The third research topic is higher K-theory of affine monoid rings. An explicit description of higher K-theory of a singular ring is a rare phenomenon. Here a finer multigraded structure of the involved K-groups is conjectured, as opposed to the weaker graded structures known so far. The fourth research topic concerns the category of convex polytopes and their affine maps. Concrete suggestions are made on how to apply universal categorial concepts to such hypothetical objects as quotient polytopes.<br/><br/>Combinatorics is the science of organizing, arranging and analyzing discrete data. An illustrative example is the set of integer points in a convex polygon in the plane or in a convex polytope in the space. Algebraic combinatorics of lattice polytopes studies such point configurations to encode important constructions in algebra, geometry, and topology, while combinatorial methods are well suited for related computations. The interaction of combinatorics and abstract mathematical techniques, which is the leitmotif of this research, over the last two decades has resulted in a number of fundamental theorems in a variety of disciplines. Applications range from algebraic geometry (the science of solution sets to systems of multidimensional polynomial equations) to integer programming, computer science, probability theory, physics, cryptography etc. The progress would have been unimaginable without computer assisted investigation and experimentation, the increasing importance of which is related to the demand for explicit or algorithmic understanding of discrete structures. The latter aspect makes the project especially well suited for engaging beginning graduate students in the research."

The first problem is a variant of Hadwiger's conjecture, due to Abu-Khzam and Langston, that says that for every non-negative integer t, every graph with chromatic number at least t immerses the complete graph of size t. The second problem is the well-known Erdos-Lovasz Tihany Conjecture. It states that for every graph G whose chromatic number, k, is strictly bigger than its chromatic number, and for every two integers s,t, both strictly bigger than 2, and adding up to k+1, there is a partition (S,T) of the vertex set of G, such the chromatic number of the subgraph of G induced by S is at least s, and the chromatic number of the subgraph of G induced by T is at least t. The PI plans to work on this conjecture for the class of claw-free graphs using a recent structure theorem. The last problem is a conjecture of Erdos and Sos that states that every graph with average degree bigger than k-1 contains every tree on k+1 vertices as a subgraph. Here  the PI is  especially interested in the variant of the conjecture where subgraph containment is replaced by minor containment.<br/><br/>Graph coloring is one of the basic questions addressed in graph theory. The questions is: what is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of a given graph, in such a way that no two adjacent vertices get the same color. There have been quite a few attempts to explain (from the point of view of the structure of the graph) why many colors are needed for some graphs, while only a few are necessary for others. One of the most famous conjectures in this direction is a well known conjecture of Hadwiger, that states that if a graph requires many colors, then it contains a certain substructure, called a ""clique minor"". This grant proposal is concerned with three conjectures in graph theory that connect coloring properties of graphs with certain structural properties. Two of the conjectures are quite well known, while the third one is a less well known variation of Hadwiger's conjecture. All three problems have been open for a while, and the PI proposes to work on a number of new cases and variations, where there is a better chance of success.  As in every fundamental study, there is room for collaboration across all academic levels:  there are special cases that can be investigated by graduate students or superior undergraduates. Those special cases can prove useful in suggesting novel proof strategies or leading to counterexamples."

The principal mathematical topics featured in FPSAC 2010 will be: algebraic, geometric, and enumerative combinatorics, and their relations to other areas such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory, geometric group theory, and symplectic geometry. There will be nine plenary lectures, and approximately 30 contributed talks and 40 poster presentations selected through a strict refereeing procedure. After a second round of refereeing, a special issue devoted to the conference proceedings will be published.<br/><br/>A distinguishing characteristic of FPSAC conferences is the concerted effort to recognize and encourage outstanding young scientists. At least one plenary speaker is an ""emerging star,"" and talented young researchers are well represented among the speakers selected for contributed talks. Another special feature of the FPSAC conferences is a continued tradition of inclusiveness. The conference seeks to draw substantial participation from underrepresented groups. Furthermore, English, French, and Spanish have been designated as offcial languages for FPSAC 2010 to promote a diverse pool of participants. About 200 participants from all over the world are expected. Attendance at this conference will be exceptionally valuable for graduate students and junior researchers. The Bay Area has a long history of research in discrete mathematics, and San Francisco State University has a strong, internationally recognized combinatorics group. FPSAC 2010 promises to be an excellent opportunity for young researchers to make both domestic and international contacts that are likely to be of great value in developing their careers."

The first project involves a study of cluster algebras, defined by Fomin and Zelevinsky, with an eye towards proving the positivity conjecture that has been open since the founding of this field in 2001.  The second project is an exploration of critical groups of graphs, also known as sandpile groups, which were independently introduced by researchers in diverse fields such as graph theory, dynamical systems, electrical networks, and arithmetic geometry.  The third project considers various objects from algebraic geometry, including linear systems and Jacobians, and examines their analogues for metric graphs, also known in the literature as quantum graphs or abstract tropical curves.  In addition to a number of intrinsic questions arising in each of these fields, the topics of these three projects exhibit intriguing connections to other areas in both pure and applied mathematics.  Some of these subjects are Teichmuller theory, number theory, and geometric combinatorics, as well as mathematical physics, combinatorial optimization, and mathematical biology. <br/><br/>At its heart, algebraic combinatorics involves counting, but this enumeration typically is done while keeping track of certain data.  This is similar to the census, where it is more useful to obtain a detailed breakdown including demographic information rather than simply a single number stating the number of Americans.  A common theme throughout the PI's research is the use of such enumeration techniques to provide new approaches for solving problems in other areas of mathematics.  For example, in the theory of cluster algebras, certain geometric formulas arise through a process called seed mutation.  However, these same expressions can be computed instead by counting, as long as one knows what features for which to look.  The PI will study more phenomena like this, where complicated expressions can be reduced to more concrete calculations.  The above topics naturally lend themselves to computational projects and undergraduate research.  For instance, the PI plans to use the open source math software Sage with students to get more of them interested in these topics, while creating computational packages for other researchers.  This work may also lead to the discovery of new combinatorial patterns motivating further research."

On the combinatorial side we will also focus on algebraic combinatorics and its applications. All these areas have seen fascinating progress in the last decade.<br/><br/>The project will be conducted with active involvement of graduate and undergraduate students and post-docs.  These areas of mathematics are closely related to many recent developments in mathematical physics (the mathematical side of theoretical physics), mostly to quantum field theory, string theory, and statistical mechanics.  Combinatorial problems which will be addressed also have direct applications in biology, for instance in the study of phylogenetic trees.  This grant (in combination with other grants) will be used to fund a number of training workshops and master-classes on hot research topics aimed at post-doctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate students."

The PI and his collaborators have worked on the problem of finding the densest packings in 8 and 24 dimensions, using the technique of linear programming bounds. They have studied the sphere packing and associated coding problems in context of potential energy minimization. This has led to various new questions and techniques, such as the concept of universal optimality, gradient descent in the space of packings, and inverse problems which may have applications to molecular self-assembly. This project will explore some of the questions that arose in previous investigations, as well as other fundamental questions such as improvement of asymptotic bounds on the density of sphere packings. Another component of the project is arithmetic geometry, especially the study of K3 surfaces and their automorphisms, such as Shioda-Inose structures. The PI also proposes to study arithmetic applications such as the description of modular curves and surfaces, Galois representations and the computation of modular forms and elliptic curves of high rank. The project also encompasses related questions in computational number theory. Lattices are a unifying theme of the topics of the proposal, and one of the broad goals of the project is to understand explicitly families of interesting lattices in high dimensions.<br/><br/>The ""greengrocer's problem"" of packing equal sized non-overlapping spheres efficiently in space is a classical problem in geometry. Nevertheless, it turns out to have surprising and beautiful connections with various parts of mathematics, physics, and computer science. Its theoretical and practical ramifications extend to Lie algebras, exceptional finite groups, quadratic forms, coding theory, cryptography and energy minimization in physics. This project will seek to further our understanding of sphere packings in high dimensions as well as explore and exploit these connections. Arithmetic geometry seeks to understand the properties of the natural numbers using the powerful tools of algebraic geometry. One of the most spectacular successes of twentieth century algebraic geometry is Faltings' Theorem (erstwhile Mordell's Conjecture), which provides the final link in a trichotomy which links the number of rational points on an algebraic curve to its topological genus, and roughly establishes how many solutions we can expect to an equation linking two variables. The analogous question of how many solutions we can expect to an equation linking three or more variables is still quite a mystery. Some of the questions the PI intends to investigate involve the arithmetic of surfaces, especially K3 surfaces, which are important in mathematics and physics. The project also hopes to make progress on the still murkier computational aspects, such as how to find these solutions. The PI will also develop courses and seminars in topics related to the proposal, and aim to involve graduate and undergraduate students actively in this research. Other aims of the project will be to develop algorithms and open-source code, as well as a catalog of interesting codes in different spaces."

One focus of the research will be enumeration questions, where the goal is to derive exact formulas for the number of combinatorial objects satisfying certain properties. Another emphasis will be on a probabilistic analysis of random combinatorial objects, and in particular their limit shapes, which are geometric shapes that arise in the asymptotic limit when the size of the model becomes large. More generally, the study of combinatorial models in a probabilistic setting raises many fascinating questions, for example questions about limiting fluctuations and about connections to random matrix theory. The technical toolbox of techniques that the investigator hopes to employ to attack such problems is very varied and involves both algebraic methods (e.g. generating functions, linear algebra), analytic methods (for example the calculus of variations) and general probabilistic techniques.<br/><br/>The scientific and educational value of the project is manifold. The combinatorial objects of interest have delighted pure mathematicians for many years for their inherent beauty and elegant structure. But also, amazingly, such seemingly ""useless"" mathematics has turned out to have deep connections to branches of physics and to some very applied mathematical disciplines like probability theory and random matrix theory. Thus, for example, alternating-sign matrices are related to ""square ice"", a simplified model for an ice crystal studied by statistical physicists, while at the same time appearing in the study of an algorithm for computing matrix determinants, which are a ubiquituous concept used in practically all the sciences and engineering disciplines. And Young tableaux, which originated with the mathematical study of symmetry, have been found to be related to random matrix theory, an important mathematical theory which has its origins in attempts by nuclear physicists to model the complex interactions in the nuclei of heavy elements. The combination of theoretical elegance and applied utility makes these research topics highly attractive from a scientific standpoint, and also very suitable as the focus for educational activities planned by the investigator, which would have as their goals to attract promising students to mathematics and the sciences and to promote public appreciation of the value of scientific research.<br/>"
