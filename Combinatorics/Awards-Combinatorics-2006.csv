Cluster algebras, discovered by the investigator in<br/>collaboration with A.Zelevinsky, are a class of commutative rings which<br/>have found applications in several mathematical disciplines, including<br/>representation theory, Teichmueller theory, discrete dynamical systems,<br/>total positivity, Lie theory, tropical geometry, and enumerative and<br/>geometric combinatorics. The investigator develops general structural<br/>theory of cluster algebras and related combinatorial constructions, and<br/>applies it to the study of concrete classes of cluster algebras arising<br/>in various applications.<br/><br/>The original motivation for this project comes from several classical<br/>areas of mathematics listed above. The main tools come from combinatorics,<br/>including combinatorial topology, algebraic and geometric combinatorics, <br/>and the theory of root systems. Combinatorics deals with discrete objects <br/>such as finite sets, graphs, permutations, partial orders, etc. Many <br/>continuous phenomena allow for a discrete representation, lending <br/>themselves amenable to combinatorial methods of study. It is often the <br/>case that identical or similar combinatorial structures underlie <br/>seamingly unrelated mathematical entities, revealing hidden connections <br/>between them and allowing to transport insights and techniques from one <br/>discipline to another. One case in point is the theory of cluster <br/>algebras, which are the main focus of this project.<br/>"

The basic algebraic structure underlying these questions is the algebra of quasisymmetric functions, which generalizes the classical algebra of symmetric functions.  Early results have shown that a generalization of a fundamental enumerative invariant for counting faces in convex polytopes - the cd-index - also provides a convenient way of representing the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of a Bruhat interval in terms of classical polynomials arising in the enumeration of lattice paths.  A focus of the project is to study the behavior of this generalized cd-index over the class of Bruhat intervals.  An unrelated area of interest is the geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees.  A goal here is to determine an efficient scheme to compute distances between trees in this space. <br/><br/>The study of the basic properties of polyhedra has been with us since the Greeks.  One fundamental question, studied for hundreds of years, has to do with the relationship between the numbers of sides, edges and corners in such an object.  Similar questions exist for high-dimensional analogs of polyhedra, which occur naturally in the analysis of methods to solve optimization problems arising in diverse areas such as resource allocation, industrial production and the design of communication networks.  This project is focusing on techniques to analyze these counting problems.  Recently it has been shown that these techniques are also useful in the study of fundamental properties of objects arising in the study of symmetry, for example, in theoretical physics.  An unrelated direction is the study of phylogenetic trees, which are of basic interest in evolutionary biology.  Here the aim is to develop methods to compute the distance between two such trees, a basic step in recently developed techniques to apply statistical methods to the profusion of tree data now being derived from the study of the structure of DNA in various species.  Research on this project will also continue the investigator's training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates, all of whom have gone on to positions as college or university faculty or as research staff in industrial or government laboratories.<br/><br/>"

The first topic concerns a new formula for the values of irreducible characters of the symmetric group. This formula is connected with another formula of Kerov which is not well understood, though it has applications to free probability theory and other areas. The second topic deals with a generalization of the classical theory of lattice paths on the plane, where now the paths lie on a Riemann surface. The third topic concerns the subject of sign-balance, i.e., the difference between the number of even and number of odd permutations in certain sets of permutations. The primary focus is on a conjecture of Eremenko and Gabrielov that may be connected with recent work on ribbon Schur functions. The fourth topic concerns the saturation conjecture for Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, recently proved by Knutson-Tao and others. There are many new avenues of investigation opened up by recent work in this area. The fifth topic is the theory of k-triangulations, a generalization of ordinary triangulations of a polygon. A recent breakthrough of Jakob Jonsson suggests several new open problems and conjectures. Finally the proposer plans to continue his research on increasing and decreasing subsequences, another subject for which recent work has suggested a host of new directions of research.<br/><br/>The proposal deals with a number of topics in algebraic combinatorics, a field which connects arrangements and patterns (such as jigsaw puzzles, computer chip design, and airplane boarding systems) with sophisticated abstract techniques. This combination of both simple, concrete objects with powerful, abstract reasoning has led to many important breakthroughs and applications. The proposer plans to work in six specific areas in which recent work points to the possibility of much further progress. These areas involve such ideas as using symmetry to simplify complicated objects, extending the notion of paths on a plane surface, decomposing a geometric figure into simpler pieces, and finding patterns in a list of objects. Progress on these very natural questions should have many applications, both within mathematics and to practical problems of scheduling, ranking, optimization, etc.<br/>"
