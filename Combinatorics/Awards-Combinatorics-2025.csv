This study goes back to ancient Greeks and has remained vibrant up to the present day. Recent works indicate a mysterious divide between ?structured? tiling problems, in which the tilings are well behaved, to ?wild? tiling problems, where almost anything can happen. One goal of this project is to develop tools to reveal the tiling mystery and, in turn, apply these tools to study related problems. Along with advancing the project?s research goals, the principal investigator also initiates events to the benefit of the community and contribute to synergistic activities related to the topics of this project, such as mentoring young researchers and organizing seminars, summer schools, conferences and workshops.<br/><br/>This project investigates central structural problems and conjectures in the areas of discrete analysis, additive combinatorics and symbolic dynamics via exploring interrelationships among them and using tools from various mathematical fields. More specifically, the principal investigator continues to develop tools to advance the study of the structure of translational tilings. This includes the study of continuous and discrete translational tilings as well as multi-tilings in low dimensions. She then adapts these tools to study related problems, such as Nivat?s conjecture on the structure of low complexity configurations, colorings of a grid that have a sufficiently low number of different local patterns. In addition, building on her recent work in conjunction with Illiopoulou and Peluse, the principal investigator studies the structure of integer and rational distance sets in Euclidean space. This study is closely related to the celebrated Erdos?Ulam problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes work in additive combinatorics concerning generalizations of Szemerédi's theorem on arithmetic progressions (sequences of numbers that are all equally spaced, like 4, 6, 8, and 10), which, informally, says that any sufficiently large collection of whole numbers contains a long arithmetic progression. It is a central problem in additive combinatorics to determine how large ""sufficiently large"" is. The investigator will study versions of this question involving more complicated patterns than arithmetic progressions, and then use the results and techniques developed to make progress on a related problem in ergodic theory. The investigator will also study the size and structure of integer distance sets, which are sets of points whose pairwise distances are all whole numbers. This award will support undergraduate summer research on representation theory and additive combinatorics, and also support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigator will build on her previous work on quantitative bounds for subsets of the integers lacking polynomial progressions of distinct degrees and for subsets of vector spaces over finite fields lacking a certain four-point configuration to tackle more general polynomial, multidimensional, and multidimensional polynomial configurations. The results for multidimensional polynomial configurations of distinct degree will then be used to make progress on the Furstenberg--Bergelson--Leibman conjecture in ergodic theory, which concerns the pointwise almost everywhere convergence of certain nonconventional ergodic averages. She will also investigate the size and structure of integer distance sets, in both the Euclidean plane and in higher dimensions, by encoding them as subsets of rational points on certain families of varieties and then studying these varieties. With her undergraduate students, the investigator will study the distribution of entries in the character tables of symmetric groups and some algorithmic problems in higher-order Fourier analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Edge coloring and edge packing can be considered partitions of the edges of a graph under certain restrictions. For example, a proper edge coloring partitions the edges into sets such that no two edges in the same set share a common endpoint, while an edge cover packing partitions the edges into sets such that the edges in each set cover all the vertices. Optimal or near-optimal solutions to these problems are important for the above mentioned applications. The PI plans to explore both the theory of edge coloring and packing, as well as to develop corresponding efficient algorithms. Graduate students will be involved in this project.<br/><br/>Several open problems in this field are related to the graph parameter called density. Density measures the 'densest' part of a graph, which is often the main concern when solving edge coloring and packing problems. With density-related techniques such as the generalized Tashkinov tree, developed from solving the Goldberg-Seymour conjecture, and the generalized Kempe change method, developed from solving the Core conjecture of Hilton and Zhao, the PI proposes to work on (1) the Berge-Fulkerson conjecture, (2) Gupta?s co-density conjecture, (3) Goldberg?s generalization of the total coloring conjecture for multigraphs, (4) the Overfull conjecture, and (5) finding efficient algorithms to color graphs with the optimal number of colors as stated in the aforementioned conjectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using various techniques developed in recent years, the PI aims to deepen the interaction between combinatorics and algebraic geometry, both in matroid theory and in contexts beyond matroids such as Coxeter combinatorics and algebraic statistics. The PI plans to involve undergraduate and graduate students in the project.<br/><br/>The PI will work on several projects in matroid theory are proposed using the new framework of ""tautological classes of matroids.""  Many of these projects concern new properties for numerical invariants of matroids that have implications to some long-standing conjectures in matroid theory.  These projects also inspire projects in Coxeter combinatorics and algebraic statistics.  Completion of these projects will reveal new structural properties of combinatorial objects such as polymatroids and delta-matroids, and will inform the complexity of maximum-likelihood problems in algebraic statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
