Graphs are useful models for electrical grids, chemical structures, the internet, transportation maps, and many other objects -- anything that can be viewed as a network is, abstractly, a graph. Real world problems involving such networks benefit from the theorems, algorithms, and insights of graph theory. The PI is most interested in graph problems involving so-called colourings and flows, and this project focuses on three sub-problems within these topics. Graduate students will be mentored as part of this project.<br/><br/>The three sub-projects prioritized in this proposal are titled: flows with boundary conditions in graphs; clique subgraphs and strong colouring, and; total colouring and overfullness in graphs with large maximum degree. The first of these is about developing concepts for use as inductive tools towards Tutte's Flow Conjectures. The second is an attack on the Strong Colouring Conjecture, using a clique reduction technique. The third and final sub-project seeks to prove a special case of the Overfull Conjecture (involving large graphs with large maximum degree) and to use this work towards the Total Colouring Conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the heart of this field are objects with strong regularity, which are central to the branch of mathematics known as combinatorics. The current project studies difference sets and partial difference sets, both of which can be neatly described as subsets exhibiting remarkable regularity. These are the underlying objects behind many elegant configurations in a wide range of areas including, on the theory side: finite geometry, coding theory, combinatorial design theory, number theory, graph theory, and on the application side: sequence design, signal processing, information security. Despite their wide-reaching significance, finding explicit constructions of these sets has remained a long-standing challenge. This project embraces an ongoing paradigm shift in the approach to constructing such objects, with the goal of uncovering novel constructions that will substantially advance the constructive landscape of difference sets and partial difference sets. The PI plans to involve graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>This project investigates the central challenge in the study of difference sets and partial difference sets: their explicit constructions. Inspired by the recent breakthrough of Applebaum et al., which determined exactly which of the 56,092 non-isomorphic groups of order 256 contain a difference set, the project will pursue three key directions: (1) constructing difference sets in abelian groups with high exponents, (2) generalizing the classical Denniston partial difference sets to a wider range of parameters and groups, (3) advancing construction techniques beyond abelian settings to the comparatively unexplored territory of nonabelian groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the PI suggests a plan for advancing a computational framework for an abstract field known as the representation theory of combinatorial categories. As part of the project the PI will also provide several concrete applications of this framework to explicitly computing quantities relevant to researchers in combinatorics, algebra, and topology. Graduate students will be trained as part of this project.<br/><br/>More specifically, in seminal work Sam and Snowden developed what is known as the theory of Groebner categories. Roughly speaking, these are categories whose representation theory is well behaved enough to permit something akin to a Groebner basis theory.

The decomposition of the edges of a graph into non-conflicting groups, such as matchings, is deeply rooted in combinatorial theory and holds practical significance across various fields, including computer science, operations research, and telecommunications. Additionally, the Hamilton cycle problem, a fundamental NP-complete problem, has been extensively studied, with recent advancements highlighting the importance of concepts like expansion and quasi-randomness. The project includes several research problems well-suited for graduate student involvement. In addition, the PI has planned outreach activities centered around graph theory concepts to stimulate interest in STEM fields, particularly among middle school students.<br/><br/>The PI's proposal delves into these two pivotal problems and extends her ongoing investigation into four longstanding conjectures: the Overfull Conjecture (Chetwynd and Hilton, 1986), the Multigraph Overfull Conjecture (Stiebitz, Scheide, Toft, and Favrholdt,  2012), the Total Coloring Conjecture (Behzad and, independently, Vizing, 1960s), and the Toughness Conjecture (Chvatal, 1973).

In combinatorial representation theory, one aims to make algebraic structures more accessible by translating them into concrete combinatorial objects such as graphs, tableaux, and partitions. These combinatorial models not only provide intuitive insight but also lead to more efficient computations. A central focus of this project is to study how representations can be combined, especially through operations like the tensor product and composition of group representations. Our goal is to build algorithms that use combinatorial tools to break down the combined representations into basic building blocks, called irreducible representations. This decomposition problem has broad significance across fields like algebraic combinatorics, complexity theory, and statistics, and it finds practical applications in computer vision, quantum physics, chemistry, and even fast matrix multiplication. At its core, it addresses the fundamental challenge of disentangling individual signals from a composite one. In parallel, the PI will continue collaborative work with students on the chromatic symmetric function, a rich yet accessible topic that provides an ideal entry point for introducing students to mathematical research.<br/><br/>Three of the most important open problems in combinatorial representation theory are the Kronecker, plethysm, and restriction problems. Each focuses on understanding how representations decompose into irreducibles, and all three are closely connected. The PI and her collaborators have identified the plethysm problem as the key to solving the others. In joint work with Saliola, Schilling, and Zabrocki, the PI developed a new approach to plethysm using the representation theory of diagram algebras. These efforts led to a new algorithm for computing plethysm based on the uniform block permutation algebra.  Together with Zabrocki, she also introduced new bases of symmetric functions that have led to progress on the restriction and Kronecker problems.  Building on this foundation, the proposed projects will further develop the combinatorial and algebraic frameworks aimed at deeper understanding of the plethysm and related decomposition problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At a time when new abilities as well as new limitations of LLMs are continually coming to light, a clear understanding of what they can and cannot do (that is, their expressivity) is becoming increasingly important. Furthermore, differentiating between the tasks that LLMs can solve at all scales, and those that LLMs can solve at small scales but are guaranteed to fail on at larger scales can be central to the success of some applications of LLMs, particularly where safety guarantees are needed. These questions can be answered with certainty only by mathematical verification. This project is contributing to the study of connections between LLM expressivity and mathematical logic. It is using those connections to reap both theoretical and practical benefits, in the form of new guarantees for LLMs, new extensions of LLMs, new methods for explaining how LLMs work, as well as new developments in mathematical logic.<br/><br/>Just as the Curry-Howard isomorphism established a deep connection between logic and programming languages that enabled many results to be exchanged between the two fields, we are developing a ""Curry-Howard isomorphism for neural networks"": not merely a connection between one kind of neural network and one logic, but a correspondence between the elements of neural networks and the elements of logic that leads to a rich exchange of ideas between the two fields. This connection is establishing new theoretical results about neural networks and driving the development of new neural networks. In the other direction, the proposed research program is pursuing new and exciting developments in logic and model theory, particularly at the intersection of finite model theory and continuous logic, which has not been previously studied.

They include simple examples like two-dimensional polygons with corners on a rectangular grid and extend to high-dimensional examples beyond our ability to visualize. Lattice polytopes are ubiquitous throughout mathematics and the sciences, including combinatorics, optimization, commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, transportation problems, and many other fields. A graph, also called a network, is a collection of objects that are connected pairwise. Two common examples are cities connected by interstates, or people connected when they are friends. Graphs and networks are a source of important lattice polytopes that allow us to study the structure of the pairwise connections among objects. In this proposal, the principal investigator will study three types of lattice polytopes and their structure. First, flow polytopes will be analyzed, which model the flow of material through transportation networks. Second, graphical Hermite normal form simplices will be studied, which are a new class of lattice polytopes whose structure is determined by a graph. Third, faces of symmetric edge polytopes will be investigated, which are lattice polytopes with connections to solving equations related to the behavior of coupled systems of oscillators. For these three classes of lattice polytopes, this project will study geometric and algebraic properties such as volume, faces, and integer point counting. These properties of lattice polytopes play a fundamental role in both pure and applied mathematics. In addition to contributing directly to the expansion of our understanding of lattice polytopes, the principal investigator will continue his ongoing work in advising doctoral students. Further, by contributing mathematical expertise to research teams in mathematics education and history of mathematics, the project will have an impact on the culture and teaching of mathematics. Finally, the PI will continue to lead workshops and seminars dedicated to teaching and learning in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>More technically, the goal of this project for flow polytopes is to understand how combinatorial properties of directed acyclic graphs influence volume and refined volume information obtained via Ehrhart theory. By studying the relation between invariants such as degree sequences of networks and volumes of their flow polytopes, the principal investigator expects to increase our collective understanding of how the edge structure of networks influences flow polytope volumes. The goal of this proposal for graphical Hermite normal form simplices is to classify the simplices having the Gorenstein and integer decomposition properties, and to obtain bounds on the values of vectors arising in Ehrhart theory for these objects. Further, by focusing on the recently-initiated study of Ehrhart h-star distributions of these polytopes, the principal investigator will contribute to our understanding of limits of these distributions. For symmetric edge polytopes, the goal of this project is to study the relationship between clustering metrics on graphs and facet numbers of the polytopes, in pursuit of a proof for a conjecture regarding facet maximizing and facet minimizing graphs. The methods used in these projects will involve a mix of computational experimentation and mathematical proof.

These objects have a beautiful complex structure and are defined through certain specific patterns. Moreover, the same defining patterns appear in many other, seemingly unrelated, areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, enabling one to translate problems into different settings and apply new techniques to study them.  In this way, cluster algebras have been instrumental in establishing numerous significant results in mathematics that reach across different fields.  This project is aimed at answering fundamental questions about certain objects closely related to cluster algebras and appearing at the intersection of combinatorics and algebra, as well as investigating new connections to other areas of mathematics. The project will also contribute to the advancement of education and research in the mathematical community by working with graduate students and fostering international collaborations.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study two classes of objects that lie at the intersection of algebra and combinatorics and are closely related to the theory of cluster algebras. The first one is SL_k friezes, certain arrays of numbers that are defined combinatorially and related to Grassmannian cluster algebras. The project aims to develop a thorough understanding of SL_k friezes and tilings, beyond the well-studied case k = 2. The second one is Cohen-Macauley subcategories of Jacobian algebras, which provide additive categorification of cluster algebras. The main objective is to classify algebras of finite Cohen-Macauley type and to derive a new combinatorial model for their Cohen-Macauley categories coming from dimer models. The main tools to answer these questions rely on utilizing existing connections between cluster algebras, representation theory, and combinatorics, as well as establishing new ones to strengthen the relations between the different topics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, geometry has entered the scene and has provided new perspectives for tackling long-standing problems in matroid theory. Behind the resolution of each of these conjectures is an algebraic invariant that exists for any matroid, but whose properties are predicted by geometry. The broad aim of this project is to study these algebraic invariants with a focus on uncovering their impact and applications throughout combinatorics.  This project includes mentoring graduate students, creating a learning community at NC State for graduate students interested in combinatorics, and initiating a middle-school outreach activity in Raleigh, NC.<br/><br/>The first project aims to give a simpler and more general definition of the intersection cohomology module of a matroid, a module that played a key role in the proof of Dowling?Wilson's top heavy conjecture from 1975.  This new definition will work over positive characteristic fields and thus will lead to positive characteristic analogues of Kazhdan?Lusztig polynomials of matroids.  The project will also introduce a matroidal analogue of Stanley's local h-polynomials with the aim of shedding light on classical problems in graph colorability and matroid realizability. The second project aims to understand to what extent there might be a ""Chow theory"" for arbitrary partially ordered sets.  In the settings of matroids, polytopes, and Coxeter groups, the Chow polynomials of posets have interpretations in terms of well-studied notions in the three respective areas.  The guiding theme is to prove results for arbitrary graded bounded posets by discovering commonalities among these three settings; and, on the other hand, to interpret results that hold for arbitrary posets in these three specific settings. The third project aims to understand log-concavity phenomena in algebraic combinatorics and commutative algebra.  On the one hand, new techniques from commutative algebra will be introduced into the study of log-concavity of polynomials with the goal of investigating log-concavity conjectures for Schur-like polynomials; and, on the other hand, the theory of Lorentzian polynomials will be used to investigate log-concavity questions for natural polynomials arising in commutative algebra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here, the notion of ?distance? is varied and hence highly expressive: It can include familiar settings such as the 3-dimensional world in which we live and the geometry of curved surfaces, and it covers important notions of proximity within, for examples, social networks, collections of proteins or images, the Internet, and many more; such geometries typically reside in high dimensions and seem nonintuitive or strange in comparison to our Euclidean surroundings. A paradigm that has proven to be ubiquitously powerful and useful to a rich variety of pure and applied investigations is embedding a geometric space of interest into a ?nicer? space in which one knows how to perform important tasks (e.g., discovering clusters, efficient storage, compression and optimization, and many more). Typically, this goal cannot be achieved without distorting distances, so the pertinent issue is determining the rate of growth of the smallest possible distortion. This is the overarching theme of the project, which is devoted to resolving central issues and longstanding mysteries of the field. For example, it is not even known how much distances must be distorted, in terms of the total number of objects, when one wishes to represent them in the 3-dimesnional space in which we reside. As another example, while famous and very important work in the 1980s and 1990s determined the largest possible rate of growth of the distortion required to embed a finite metric into Euclidean space (without restricting the target dimension as done above), it remains a longstanding conundrum whether this worst-case scenario can occur when the collection that we wish to embed is a subset of a classical space of vectors (e.g. when distances are measured in terms of the sum of powers of the differences of coordinates, or collections of matrices with natural notions of distance such as the so-called nuclear norm, which occurs in settings ranging from pure mathematics to machine learning and signal processing). When the distortion is shown to grow slowly, as it often does (this entails devising a meaningful geometric embedding), the project harnesses it to devise efficient algorithms for a range of scientific tasks. On the flip side, demonstrating that there is no embedding with small distortion entails obtaining insights and devising tools that are useful and interesting in their own right (e.g., meaningful ways to decompose geometries). The project is devoted to addressing specific open questions in the above directions, as well as deriving unforeseen applications and developing overarching methodologies. The project will include a major effort to train and mentor graduate students and early career researchers through the PI?s advising role and his leadership roles in the mathematics research community. <br/><br/>It is common in analysis and geometry that solutions to natural questions about representing objects using other simpler objects cannot be done without incurring large errors. For example, Bourgain?s famous embedding theorem states that any finite metric space can be embedded into a Hilbert space with bi-Lipschitz distortion of order the logarithm of the number of points, and subsequent work showed that this cannot be improved. However, if the given metric space is a subset of a classical space such as a Lebesgue space, a Schatten-von Neumann trace class, or a subset of a discrete group such as the Heisenberg group or the lamplighter group, can one say anything about its embeddability properties other than merely that it is a metric space? It also remains a longstanding open question to determine the growth rate of the largest possible distortion that is required to embed a finite metric space of a given size in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. As a final example, suppose that we are given a 1-Lipschitz mapping from a subset of a finite dimensional normed space to a Banach and we wish to extend it to a Lipschitz function that is defined on the entire ambient space and whose Lipschitz constant is as small as possible: How must this Lipschitz constant grow with the dimension? This is open even for Euclidean space. The project studies the above questions, and many more along those lines. When low distortion is possible, it yields structural insights that are impactful elsewhere, including algorithm design; such applications are pursued in this project after embedding theorems are proved. The project also studies impossibility results showing that large distortion must be incurred; this involves developing new geometric structural insights and tools in harmonic analysis, probability, isoperimetry, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first topic, ""balancing problems for partially ordered sets,"" is motivated by questions about sorting, among the most basic of algorithmic tasks; the second, ""thresholds,"" has been central to the study of discrete random systems since its beginnings around 1960.  Though much of the PI's work has ties to other disciplines---and some of it has had unanticipated applied consequences---the emphasis is usually on what seems most interesting from a mathematical standpoint.  The PI has long been interested in working across mathematical boundaries.  He has had success both in applying ideas from areas beyond combinatorics (e.g., algebra, geometry, topology, probability, Fourier analysis, information theory) to settle combinatorial problems, and in bringing combinatorial ideas to bear on problems from other areas (e.g., geometry, computer science, probability, statistical mechanics).  As in the current work, he has usually focused on simple, basic questions with histories of resisting solution, motivated in part by the idea that success with such questions almost always forces one to go beyond existing methods. The project will involve graduate students.<br/><br/>The project treats two combinatorial topics that are among the PI's main current interests.  The first deals with a set of notorious old, algorithmically motivated ""balancing"" questions for partially ordered sets; here the PI and his student M. Aires have recently made striking progress, eclipsing all that was previously known in the way of general results, and introducing new methods together with an extensive list of previously unconsidered, though seemingly basic, questions. Part of the appeal of this area is the interplay of extra-combinatorial ideas (from geometry, probability, and information theory) that underlie some of the results. The second topic is ""thresholds,"" roughly meaning the intensities at which various behaviors of interest appear in a (large) random system; these have been central to probabilistic combinatorics and related parts of statistical physics since at least Erdos and Renyi in 1960.  Recent breakthroughs by the PI and others on the ``Kahn-Kalai Conjecture'' of 2008 have refocused research in this area, rendering previously formidable results easy, and offering hope for (and already a few resolutions of) problems previously considered completely out of reach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turn, these spaces are amenable to concrete study using techniques from combinatorics, which concerns discrete objects such as graphs and lists. The project will use the lens of total positivity to reveal the underlying combinatorial structure of spaces of polynomials and hyperplanes.

Since the formulation of the Shapiro-Shapiro conjecture in the 1990's it has been known that total positivity can be employed to construct Schubert intersection problems whose solutions over the complex numbers are all real. This project will broaden this phenomenon with applications to real algebraic geometry.

The ancient Greeks studied polytopes such as the Platonic solids as they are ideal to model nature. In modern days, scientists have found many applications of polytopes in diverse fields such as optimization and computer science. This research project focuses on the combinatorial ?invariants? of polytopes. For example, count the number V of vertices, E of edges, and F of facets of an arbitrary 3-dimensional polytope. Then no matter which polytope we choose, we always end up with getting the identity ?V-E+F=2?. The goal of this research project is to develop new methods to study various invariants of polytopes and spheres that arise from face numbers or other combinatorial data. These tools may further extend our understanding of the interplay between combinatorics, algebra, and geometry. <br/><br/>One of the central conjectures in geometric combinatorics was the g-conjecture; that is, to characterize the face numbers of simplicial polytopes and spheres of all dimensions. This conjecture was only proved very recently, and its resolution requires deep results from other fields such as commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. This project is dedicated to new methods to study polytopes and manifolds with particular geometry or topology. One goal is to investigate various combinatorial models such as the Stanley-Reisner ring and the stress spaces, and how the algebra translates into combinatorial relations among the face number. Another goal is to investigate how preset geometry and topology (for example, central symmetry) affects the combinatorics of polytopes or polyhedral complexes, and vice versa. The project has applications to computer sciences and the PI also plans to develop lecture notes and work with students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This includes work in additive combinatorics concerning generalizations of Szemerédi's theorem on arithmetic progressions (sequences of numbers that are all equally spaced, like 4, 6, 8, and 10), which, informally, says that any sufficiently large collection of whole numbers contains a long arithmetic progression. It is a central problem in additive combinatorics to determine how large ""sufficiently large"" is. The investigator will study versions of this question involving more complicated patterns than arithmetic progressions, and then use the results and techniques developed to make progress on a related problem in ergodic theory. The investigator will also study the size and structure of integer distance sets, which are sets of points whose pairwise distances are all whole numbers. This award will support undergraduate summer research on representation theory and additive combinatorics, and also support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigator will build on her previous work on quantitative bounds for subsets of the integers lacking polynomial progressions of distinct degrees and for subsets of vector spaces over finite fields lacking a certain four-point configuration to tackle more general polynomial, multidimensional, and multidimensional polynomial configurations. The results for multidimensional polynomial configurations of distinct degree will then be used to make progress on the Furstenberg--Bergelson--Leibman conjecture in ergodic theory, which concerns the pointwise almost everywhere convergence of certain nonconventional ergodic averages. She will also investigate the size and structure of integer distance sets, in both the Euclidean plane and in higher dimensions, by encoding them as subsets of rational points on certain families of varieties and then studying these varieties. With her undergraduate students, the investigator will study the distribution of entries in the character tables of symmetric groups and some algorithmic problems in higher-order Fourier analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Edge coloring and edge packing can be considered partitions of the edges of a graph under certain restrictions. For example, a proper edge coloring partitions the edges into sets such that no two edges in the same set share a common endpoint, while an edge cover packing partitions the edges into sets such that the edges in each set cover all the vertices. Optimal or near-optimal solutions to these problems are important for the above mentioned applications. The PI plans to explore both the theory of edge coloring and packing, as well as to develop corresponding efficient algorithms. Graduate students will be involved in this project.<br/><br/>Several open problems in this field are related to the graph parameter called density. Density measures the 'densest' part of a graph, which is often the main concern when solving edge coloring and packing problems. With density-related techniques such as the generalized Tashkinov tree, developed from solving the Goldberg-Seymour conjecture, and the generalized Kempe change method, developed from solving the Core conjecture of Hilton and Zhao, the PI proposes to work on (1) the Berge-Fulkerson conjecture, (2) Gupta?s co-density conjecture, (3) Goldberg?s generalization of the total coloring conjecture for multigraphs, (4) the Overfull conjecture, and (5) finding efficient algorithms to color graphs with the optimal number of colors as stated in the aforementioned conjectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, the interdisciplinary potential of combinatorics is utilized in two ways. First, to study the complexity of a model from machine learning using a recent geometric rephrasing. Second, to develop an algorithm used to help identify novel complex genetic structures driving health and longevity outcomes in humans.
