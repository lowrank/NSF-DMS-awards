In structural graph theory, the goal is to understand the large-scale behavior of graphs whose local behavior is somehow restricted. This project focuses on developing structural techniques for dense graphs, that is, graphs with many connections. The PI will focus on two ways of restricting the local behavior: by forbidding a vertex-minor, and by asking for a dependent first-order theory. These restrictions have applications to other domains such as quantum computing, algorithms and complexity, discrete geometry, and extremal combinatorics. Graduate students will be trained as part of the project.<br/><br/>This project will develop structural techniques for dense classes of graphs, focusing on classes with a forbidden vertex-minor or a dependent first-order theory. For classes with a forbidden vertex-minor, the goal is to obtain a complete understanding of the structure relative to a tour graph. This will be a key step towards proving a conjecture of Geelen, which would give a very precise structural description of graphs with a forbidden vertex-minor. For classes with a dependent first-order theory, the focus is on a well-known dichotomy conjecture. This conjecture roughly states that for classes that are closed under vertex deletion, having a dependent first-order theory is equivalent to admitting an efficient algorithm for checking the first-order properties of graphs in the class.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, geometry has entered the scene and has provided new perspectives for tackling long-standing problems in matroid theory. Behind the resolution of each of these conjectures is an algebraic invariant that exists for any matroid, but whose properties are predicted by geometry. The broad aim of this project is to study these algebraic invariants with a focus on uncovering their impact and applications throughout combinatorics.  This project includes mentoring graduate students, creating a learning community at NC State for graduate students interested in combinatorics, and initiating a middle-school outreach activity in Raleigh, NC.<br/><br/>The first project aims to give a simpler and more general definition of the intersection cohomology module of a matroid, a module that played a key role in the proof of Dowling?Wilson's top heavy conjecture from 1975.  This new definition will work over positive characteristic fields and thus will lead to positive characteristic analogues of Kazhdan?Lusztig polynomials of matroids.  The project will also introduce a matroidal analogue of Stanley's local h-polynomials with the aim of shedding light on classical problems in graph colorability and matroid realizability. The second project aims to understand to what extent there might be a ""Chow theory"" for arbitrary partially ordered sets.  In the settings of matroids, polytopes, and Coxeter groups, the Chow polynomials of posets have interpretations in terms of well-studied notions in the three respective areas.  The guiding theme is to prove results for arbitrary graded bounded posets by discovering commonalities among these three settings; and, on the other hand, to interpret results that hold for arbitrary posets in these three specific settings. The third project aims to understand log-concavity phenomena in algebraic combinatorics and commutative algebra.  On the one hand, new techniques from commutative algebra will be introduced into the study of log-concavity of polynomials with the goal of investigating log-concavity conjectures for Schur-like polynomials; and, on the other hand, the theory of Lorentzian polynomials will be used to investigate log-concavity questions for natural polynomials arising in commutative algebra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here, the notion of ?distance? is varied and hence highly expressive: It can include familiar settings such as the 3-dimensional world in which we live and the geometry of curved surfaces, and it covers important notions of proximity within, for examples, social networks, collections of proteins or images, the Internet, and many more; such geometries typically reside in high dimensions and seem nonintuitive or strange in comparison to our Euclidean surroundings. A paradigm that has proven to be ubiquitously powerful and useful to a rich variety of pure and applied investigations is embedding a geometric space of interest into a ?nicer? space in which one knows how to perform important tasks (e.g., discovering clusters, efficient storage, compression and optimization, and many more). Typically, this goal cannot be achieved without distorting distances, so the pertinent issue is determining the rate of growth of the smallest possible distortion. This is the overarching theme of the project, which is devoted to resolving central issues and longstanding mysteries of the field. For example, it is not even known how much distances must be distorted, in terms of the total number of objects, when one wishes to represent them in the 3-dimesnional space in which we reside. As another example, while famous and very important work in the 1980s and 1990s determined the largest possible rate of growth of the distortion required to embed a finite metric into Euclidean space (without restricting the target dimension as done above), it remains a longstanding conundrum whether this worst-case scenario can occur when the collection that we wish to embed is a subset of a classical space of vectors (e.g. when distances are measured in terms of the sum of powers of the differences of coordinates, or collections of matrices with natural notions of distance such as the so-called nuclear norm, which occurs in settings ranging from pure mathematics to machine learning and signal processing). When the distortion is shown to grow slowly, as it often does (this entails devising a meaningful geometric embedding), the project harnesses it to devise efficient algorithms for a range of scientific tasks. On the flip side, demonstrating that there is no embedding with small distortion entails obtaining insights and devising tools that are useful and interesting in their own right (e.g., meaningful ways to decompose geometries). The project is devoted to addressing specific open questions in the above directions, as well as deriving unforeseen applications and developing overarching methodologies. The project will include a major effort to train and mentor graduate students and early career researchers through the PI?s advising role and his leadership roles in the mathematics research community. <br/><br/>It is common in analysis and geometry that solutions to natural questions about representing objects using other simpler objects cannot be done without incurring large errors. For example, Bourgain?s famous embedding theorem states that any finite metric space can be embedded into a Hilbert space with bi-Lipschitz distortion of order the logarithm of the number of points, and subsequent work showed that this cannot be improved. However, if the given metric space is a subset of a classical space such as a Lebesgue space, a Schatten-von Neumann trace class, or a subset of a discrete group such as the Heisenberg group or the lamplighter group, can one say anything about its embeddability properties other than merely that it is a metric space? It also remains a longstanding open question to determine the growth rate of the largest possible distortion that is required to embed a finite metric space of a given size in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. As a final example, suppose that we are given a 1-Lipschitz mapping from a subset of a finite dimensional normed space to a Banach and we wish to extend it to a Lipschitz function that is defined on the entire ambient space and whose Lipschitz constant is as small as possible: How must this Lipschitz constant grow with the dimension? This is open even for Euclidean space. The project studies the above questions, and many more along those lines. When low distortion is possible, it yields structural insights that are impactful elsewhere, including algorithm design; such applications are pursued in this project after embedding theorems are proved. The project also studies impossibility results showing that large distortion must be incurred; this involves developing new geometric structural insights and tools in harmonic analysis, probability, isoperimetry, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study goes back to ancient Greeks and has remained vibrant up to the present day. Recent works indicate a mysterious divide between ?structured? tiling problems, in which the tilings are well behaved, to ?wild? tiling problems, where almost anything can happen. One goal of this project is to develop tools to reveal the tiling mystery and, in turn, apply these tools to study related problems.

She then adapts these tools to study related problems, such as Nivat?s conjecture on the structure of low complexity configurations, colorings of a grid that have a sufficiently low number of different local patterns. In addition, building on her recent work in conjunction with Illiopoulou and Peluse, the principal investigator studies the structure of integer and rational distance sets in Euclidean space.

The first topic, ""balancing problems for partially ordered sets,"" is motivated by questions about sorting, among the most basic of algorithmic tasks; the second, ""thresholds,"" has been central to the study of discrete random systems since its beginnings around 1960.  Though much of the PI's work has ties to other disciplines---and some of it has had unanticipated applied consequences---the emphasis is usually on what seems most interesting from a mathematical standpoint.  The PI has long been interested in working across mathematical boundaries.  He has had success both in applying ideas from areas beyond combinatorics (e.g., algebra, geometry, topology, probability, Fourier analysis, information theory) to settle combinatorial problems, and in bringing combinatorial ideas to bear on problems from other areas (e.g., geometry, computer science, probability, statistical mechanics).  As in the current work, he has usually focused on simple, basic questions with histories of resisting solution, motivated in part by the idea that success with such questions almost always forces one to go beyond existing methods. The project will involve graduate students.<br/><br/>The project treats two combinatorial topics that are among the PI's main current interests.  The first deals with a set of notorious old, algorithmically motivated ""balancing"" questions for partially ordered sets; here the PI and his student M. Aires have recently made striking progress, eclipsing all that was previously known in the way of general results, and introducing new methods together with an extensive list of previously unconsidered, though seemingly basic, questions. Part of the appeal of this area is the interplay of extra-combinatorial ideas (from geometry, probability, and information theory) that underlie some of the results. The second topic is ""thresholds,"" roughly meaning the intensities at which various behaviors of interest appear in a (large) random system; these have been central to probabilistic combinatorics and related parts of statistical physics since at least Erdos and Renyi in 1960.  Recent breakthroughs by the PI and others on the ``Kahn-Kalai Conjecture'' of 2008 have refocused research in this area, rendering previously formidable results easy, and offering hope for (and already a few resolutions of) problems previously considered completely out of reach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turn, these spaces are amenable to concrete study using techniques from combinatorics, which concerns discrete objects such as graphs and lists.

The ancient Greeks studied polytopes such as the Platonic solids as they are ideal to model nature. In modern days, scientists have found many applications of polytopes in diverse fields such as optimization and computer science. This research project focuses on the combinatorial ?invariants? of polytopes. For example, count the number V of vertices, E of edges, and F of facets of an arbitrary 3-dimensional polytope. Then no matter which polytope we choose, we always end up with getting the identity ?V-E+F=2?. The goal of this research project is to develop new methods to study various invariants of polytopes and spheres that arise from face numbers or other combinatorial data. These tools may further extend our understanding of the interplay between combinatorics, algebra, and geometry. <br/><br/>One of the central conjectures in geometric combinatorics was the g-conjecture; that is, to characterize the face numbers of simplicial polytopes and spheres of all dimensions. This conjecture was only proved very recently, and its resolution requires deep results from other fields such as commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. This project is dedicated to new methods to study polytopes and manifolds with particular geometry or topology. One goal is to investigate various combinatorial models such as the Stanley-Reisner ring and the stress spaces, and how the algebra translates into combinatorial relations among the face number. Another goal is to investigate how preset geometry and topology (for example, central symmetry) affects the combinatorics of polytopes or polyhedral complexes, and vice versa. The project has applications to computer sciences and the PI also plans to develop lecture notes and work with students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Permutation patterns is the area of research in mathematics and computer science that studies how small patterns can occur as parts of larger patterns, particularly in rearrangements of objects in a line.  There are applications in biology, particularly in the study of DNA rearrangements and amino acid sequences. This conference is part of a series that has been held annually since 2003 (with virtual substitutes during the COVID pandemic), rotating mostly between different institutions in North America and Europe. Each year, the conference features two plenary talks and approximately thirty-five contributed talks, providing researchers with the opportunity to present and discuss their results, while also offering newcomers to the study of permutation patterns a broad perspective on the subject as a whole.  This year, there will also be an introductory workshop aimed at graduate students.  The conference offers a platform for collaboration between junior and senior researchers. There will be time set aside for open problems to be discussed by the entire community. The conference attracts broad participation, including significant numbers of faculty from primarily undergraduate institutions. <br/><br/>The conferences will feature research on permutation patterns and their applications. Permutation patterns is an interdisciplinary area with roots in both theoretical computer science and combinatorics. Major themes include the structural properties of permutation classes, asymptotic behavior from both enumerative and probabilistic points of view, extremal questions, algorithmic and decidability questions, and automated theorem proving and discovery.

This includes work in additive combinatorics concerning generalizations of Szemerédi's theorem on arithmetic progressions (sequences of numbers that are all equally spaced, like 4, 6, 8, and 10), which, informally, says that any sufficiently large collection of whole numbers contains a long arithmetic progression. It is a central problem in additive combinatorics to determine how large ""sufficiently large"" is. The investigator will study versions of this question involving more complicated patterns than arithmetic progressions, and then use the results and techniques developed to make progress on a related problem in ergodic theory. The investigator will also study the size and structure of integer distance sets, which are sets of points whose pairwise distances are all whole numbers. This award will support undergraduate summer research on representation theory and additive combinatorics, and also support the training of graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigator will build on her previous work on quantitative bounds for subsets of the integers lacking polynomial progressions of distinct degrees and for subsets of vector spaces over finite fields lacking a certain four-point configuration to tackle more general polynomial, multidimensional, and multidimensional polynomial configurations. The results for multidimensional polynomial configurations of distinct degree will then be used to make progress on the Furstenberg--Bergelson--Leibman conjecture in ergodic theory, which concerns the pointwise almost everywhere convergence of certain nonconventional ergodic averages. She will also investigate the size and structure of integer distance sets, in both the Euclidean plane and in higher dimensions, by encoding them as subsets of rational points on certain families of varieties and then studying these varieties. With her undergraduate students, the investigator will study the distribution of entries in the character tables of symmetric groups and some algorithmic problems in higher-order Fourier analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Edge coloring and edge packing can be considered partitions of the edges of a graph under certain restrictions. For example, a proper edge coloring partitions the edges into sets such that no two edges in the same set share a common endpoint, while an edge cover packing partitions the edges into sets such that the edges in each set cover all the vertices. Optimal or near-optimal solutions to these problems are important for the above mentioned applications. The PI plans to explore both the theory of edge coloring and packing, as well as to develop corresponding efficient algorithms. Graduate students will be involved in this project.<br/><br/>Several open problems in this field are related to the graph parameter called density. Density measures the 'densest' part of a graph, which is often the main concern when solving edge coloring and packing problems. With density-related techniques such as the generalized Tashkinov tree, developed from solving the Goldberg-Seymour conjecture, and the generalized Kempe change method, developed from solving the Core conjecture of Hilton and Zhao, the PI proposes to work on (1) the Berge-Fulkerson conjecture, (2) Gupta?s co-density conjecture, (3) Goldberg?s generalization of the total coloring conjecture for multigraphs, (4) the Overfull conjecture, and (5) finding efficient algorithms to color graphs with the optimal number of colors as stated in the aforementioned conjectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
