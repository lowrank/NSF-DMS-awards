Here, the notion of ?distance? is varied and hence highly expressive: It can include familiar settings such as the 3-dimensional world in which we live and the geometry of curved surfaces, and it covers important notions of proximity within, for examples, social networks, collections of proteins or images, the Internet, and many more; such geometries typically reside in high dimensions and seem nonintuitive or strange in comparison to our Euclidean surroundings. A paradigm that has proven to be ubiquitously powerful and useful to a rich variety of pure and applied investigations is embedding a geometric space of interest into a ?nicer? space in which one knows how to perform important tasks (e.g., discovering clusters, efficient storage, compression and optimization, and many more). Typically, this goal cannot be achieved without distorting distances, so the pertinent issue is determining the rate of growth of the smallest possible distortion. This is the overarching theme of the project, which is devoted to resolving central issues and longstanding mysteries of the field. For example, it is not even known how much distances must be distorted, in terms of the total number of objects, when one wishes to represent them in the 3-dimesnional space in which we reside. As another example, while famous and very important work in the 1980s and 1990s determined the largest possible rate of growth of the distortion required to embed a finite metric into Euclidean space (without restricting the target dimension as done above), it remains a longstanding conundrum whether this worst-case scenario can occur when the collection that we wish to embed is a subset of a classical space of vectors (e.g. when distances are measured in terms of the sum of powers of the differences of coordinates, or collections of matrices with natural notions of distance such as the so-called nuclear norm, which occurs in settings ranging from pure mathematics to machine learning and signal processing). When the distortion is shown to grow slowly, as it often does (this entails devising a meaningful geometric embedding), the project harnesses it to devise efficient algorithms for a range of scientific tasks. On the flip side, demonstrating that there is no embedding with small distortion entails obtaining insights and devising tools that are useful and interesting in their own right (e.g., meaningful ways to decompose geometries). The project is devoted to addressing specific open questions in the above directions, as well as deriving unforeseen applications and developing overarching methodologies. The project will include a major effort to train and mentor graduate students and early career researchers through the PI?s advising role and his leadership roles in the mathematics research community. <br/><br/>It is common in analysis and geometry that solutions to natural questions about representing objects using other simpler objects cannot be done without incurring large errors. For example, Bourgain?s famous embedding theorem states that any finite metric space can be embedded into a Hilbert space with bi-Lipschitz distortion of order the logarithm of the number of points, and subsequent work showed that this cannot be improved. However, if the given metric space is a subset of a classical space such as a Lebesgue space, a Schatten-von Neumann trace class, or a subset of a discrete group such as the Heisenberg group or the lamplighter group, can one say anything about its embeddability properties other than merely that it is a metric space? It also remains a longstanding open question to determine the growth rate of the largest possible distortion that is required to embed a finite metric space of a given size in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. As a final example, suppose that we are given a 1-Lipschitz mapping from a subset of a finite dimensional normed space to a Banach and we wish to extend it to a Lipschitz function that is defined on the entire ambient space and whose Lipschitz constant is as small as possible: How must this Lipschitz constant grow with the dimension? This is open even for Euclidean space. The project studies the above questions, and many more along those lines. When low distortion is possible, it yields structural insights that are impactful elsewhere, including algorithm design; such applications are pursued in this project after embedding theorems are proved. The project also studies impossibility results showing that large distortion must be incurred; this involves developing new geometric structural insights and tools in harmonic analysis, probability, isoperimetry, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This study goes back to ancient Greeks and has remained vibrant up to the present day. Recent works indicate a mysterious divide between ?structured? tiling problems, in which the tilings are well behaved, to ?wild? tiling problems, where almost anything can happen. One goal of this project is to develop tools to reveal the tiling mystery and, in turn, apply these tools to study related problems. Along with advancing the project?s research goals, the principal investigator also initiates events to the benefit of the community and contribute to synergistic activities related to the topics of this project, such as mentoring young researchers and organizing seminars, summer schools, conferences and workshops.<br/><br/>This project investigates central structural problems and conjectures in the areas of discrete analysis, additive combinatorics and symbolic dynamics via exploring interrelationships among them and using tools from various mathematical fields. More specifically, the principal investigator continues to develop tools to advance the study of the structure of translational tilings. This includes the study of continuous and discrete translational tilings as well as multi-tilings in low dimensions. She then adapts these tools to study related problems, such as Nivat?s conjecture on the structure of low complexity configurations, colorings of a grid that have a sufficiently low number of different local patterns. In addition, building on her recent work in conjunction with Illiopoulou and Peluse, the principal investigator studies the structure of integer and rational distance sets in Euclidean space. This study is closely related to the celebrated Erdos?Ulam problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A significant focus is on gaining deeper insights into random discrete structures, particularly analyzing the locations of phase transitions (e.g., the molecular changes when water freezes into ice). These are important phenomena in various areas such as statistical physics, theoretical computer science, and network science, as they define the boundary between two phases with distinct properties. Recent advancements in this field have been groundbreaking, and the PI has been committed to advancing the innovative tools developed in recent years. The project will involve both graduate and undergraduate students in research.<br/><br/>This project addresses two areas of research. The first focuses on the threshold phenomena of random discrete structures. The primary objectives of the project in this topic are to prove the ``Second"" Kahn-Kalai Conjecture, which was the original motivation for the Kahn-Kalai Conjecture, and to prove a conjecture of Talagrand that concerns the suprema of certain classes of stochastic processes. To tackle these challenges, the PI aims to test the strengths and limitations of the methods developed in recent breakthrough results in this field, including some that the PI has contributed to. The second area investigates asymptotic enumeration problems on expander graphs.

The first topic, ""balancing problems for partially ordered sets,"" is motivated by questions about sorting, among the most basic of algorithmic tasks; the second, ""thresholds,"" has been central to the study of discrete random systems since its beginnings around 1960.  Though much of the PI's work has ties to other disciplines---and some of it has had unanticipated applied consequences---the emphasis is usually on what seems most interesting from a mathematical standpoint.  The PI has long been interested in working across mathematical boundaries.  He has had success both in applying ideas from areas beyond combinatorics (e.g., algebra, geometry, topology, probability, Fourier analysis, information theory) to settle combinatorial problems, and in bringing combinatorial ideas to bear on problems from other areas (e.g., geometry, computer science, probability, statistical mechanics).  As in the current work, he has usually focused on simple, basic questions with histories of resisting solution, motivated in part by the idea that success with such questions almost always forces one to go beyond existing methods. The project will involve graduate students.<br/><br/>The project treats two combinatorial topics that are among the PI's main current interests.  The first deals with a set of notorious old, algorithmically motivated ""balancing"" questions for partially ordered sets; here the PI and his student M. Aires have recently made striking progress, eclipsing all that was previously known in the way of general results, and introducing new methods together with an extensive list of previously unconsidered, though seemingly basic, questions. Part of the appeal of this area is the interplay of extra-combinatorial ideas (from geometry, probability, and information theory) that underlie some of the results. The second topic is ""thresholds,"" roughly meaning the intensities at which various behaviors of interest appear in a (large) random system; these have been central to probabilistic combinatorics and related parts of statistical physics since at least Erdos and Renyi in 1960.  Recent breakthroughs by the PI and others on the ``Kahn-Kalai Conjecture'' of 2008 have refocused research in this area, rendering previously formidable results easy, and offering hope for (and already a few resolutions of) problems previously considered completely out of reach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the positive part of a sphere is a triangle bounded by three great circles. More general spaces such as pyramids and polyhedra also arise as the positive parts of more complicated objects, and they turn out to have interesting boundary structures: vertices connected by edges, which are in turn contained in faces, etc. The boundaries of various totally positive spaces model diverse phenomena such as outcomes of a scattering experiment in particle physics or different ways to sort a list of numbers. In turn, these spaces are amenable to concrete study using techniques from combinatorics, which concerns discrete objects such as graphs and lists. The project will use the lens of total positivity to reveal the underlying combinatorial structure of spaces of polynomials and hyperplanes. It will also support K-12 outreach activities.<br/><br/>Lorentzian polynomials were recently introduced to resolve several outstanding log-concavity conjectures. They also serve as geometric realization spaces of matroids, which are combinatorial abstractions of linear spaces. The project will determine the topology of various spaces of Lorentzian polynomials. A second direction concerns Schubert calculus, which studies intersection problems involving linear subspaces. Since the formulation of the Shapiro-Shapiro conjecture in the 1990's it has been known that total positivity can be employed to construct Schubert intersection problems whose solutions over the complex numbers are all real. This project will broaden this phenomenon with applications to real algebraic geometry. A third direction is to study the totally positive parts of Springer fibers, certain subvarieties of flag varieties which play a significant role in representation theory and algebraic combinatorics. The project will develop a new approach to studying the geometry of components of Springer fibers by relating them to Richardson varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI plans to involve undergraduate and graduate students in the project.<br/><br/>The PI will work on several projects in matroid theory are proposed using the new framework of ""tautological classes of matroids.""  Many of these projects concern new properties for numerical invariants of matroids that have implications to some long-standing conjectures in matroid theory.  These projects also inspire projects in Coxeter combinatorics and algebraic statistics.  Completion of these projects will reveal new structural properties of combinatorial objects such as polymatroids and delta-matroids, and will inform the complexity of maximum-likelihood problems in algebraic statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
