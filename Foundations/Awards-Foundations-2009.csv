A main theme of this proposal is the investigation of certain ``coordinate systems'' for Banach spaces, e.g. bases, frames, and dictionaries. One of the problems considered is an old one from harmonic analysis, which asks whether the space of square integrable functions has a basis formed by translates of the same element. It is intended to attack this problem with tools from the theory of Banach spaces.  Another prominent question deals with the structure of the (complemented) subspaces of the space of p-integrable functions. The PI intends to bring to bear here the method of infinite asymptotic games, which he has developed in collaboration with E. Odell.  Several parts of this proposal deal with other issues originating from signal processing and data compression. Here one looks for bases, frames, or, more generally dictionaries of spaces, in which (certain) vectors can be approximated by vectors with few nonzero coordinates, using easily implementable algorithms, so that the representation satisfies certain stability conditions, and/or can be ``quantized''.<br/><br/>Banach spaces, their geometric and topological structure provide a natural framework for studying dynamical systems, differential equations, multi-resolution analysis, in particular if one wants to model complex and high-dimensional structures. A main goal of this proposal is to study several types of coordinate systems on these spaces. The techniques to be employed will involve a combination of analysis, infinite combinatorics, and logic. The proposed work could also spur further development in these areas.<br/>"

The traditional view of this program has been that of an increment program with progress measured by a  progression up the hierarchy of large cardinals. <br/>It is now known that this view is not correct. A critical transition occurs at the level of exactly one supercompact cardinal, and in solving the Inner Model Program for this specific large cardinal axiom, one solves the Inner Model Program for essentially all known large cardinal axioms. The solution must necessarily yield an ultimate enlargement of Goedel's inner model L. This ultimate-L must closely approximate the parent universe within which it is constructed. The ramifications for Set Theory will be profound, ranging from new inconsistency results in ZF to combinatorial theorems of ZFC proved by exploiting the closeness of ultimate-L to V. Ultimate-L will also provide a key setting for resolving the hierarchy of large cardinals beyond the level of omega-huge cardinals which constitute essentially the strongest large cardinals axioms which are not known to be inconsistent. The point is that ultimate-L inherits large cardinals from V exactly as L inherits large cardinals from V if 0-sharp does not exist. Therefore the analysis of what is possible in ultimate-L is in effect the analysis of what is possible in V.<br/><br/>The mathematical study of Infinity in its modern incarnation dates from the<br/>work of Cantor in the late 19th century, this area of mathematics<br/>is Set Theory. With the results of Goedel and then<br/>Cohen from the middle of the 20th century it was established that many of the<br/>fundamental problems could not be solved on the basis of the current ZFC axioms for  Set Theory. The most famous example is the problem of Cantor's Continuum<br/>Hypothesis which was placed first by Hilbert on his list of 20 questions<br/>in 1900. The solution to this question and the numerous other questions now known to be unsolvable requires the discovery of new axioms beyond the current axioms. Over the last few years a new approach to this problem has emerged based on generalizations of Goedel's axiom of constructibility. There is now convincing evidence that this approach will lead to new axioms which settle all the problems of Set Theory currently known to be unsolvable, are compatible with all known strong axioms of infinity, and which themselves are immune to kind of unsolvable problems that are ubiquitous in Set Theory. These examples will be the first examples of such axioms ever discovered and therefore show great promise for at long last finding the correct axioms for Set Theory and thereby solving in particular the problem of the Continuum Hypothesis."

The principal investigator has shown that a limited amount of errors in the operation of a random number generator can lead to a loss of randomness that cannot be compensated for using algorithms. A main goal is to determine if at any point true randomness can be reconstructed as the amount of such errors becomes small. The results already obtained were proved using probabilistic potential theory and random closed sets. This approach in conjunction with work by other researchers has lead to a richer picture of the possible notions of randomness for fractional effective Hausdorff dimension, and opened up questions about a link with a statistical-mechanical interpretation of algorithmic information theory. A secondary but also integral part of the project is the computability-theoretic analysis of probability. An example here is the determination of the Kolmogorov complexity of finite strings describing random walks that approximate Brownian motion.<br/><br/>The project aims to further the understanding of random objects in computability-theoretic terms, and help clarify the theoretical limitations of random number generation, a field of wide application in science and engineering. In particular, the aim is to understand to what extent one can repair damaged randomness sources, or prove that such a repair is impossible. The goal is not necessarily to reconstruct the original undamaged random data but to obtain some random data. The notion of particular data being random can be made precise using the theory of Turing computability. The idea is that a sequence of 0s and 1s is random for all practical purposes if no computer algorithm can detect any pattern in it. Thanks to the work of Alan Turing and others, this idea can be studied abstractly without worrying about particular physical computers and implementations. Conversely, the theoretical study of algorithms played a large role in the development of modern computers. Turing computability has been used in many areas of mathematics to show that certain tasks cannot be carried out by any algorithm. For example, Matiyasevich showed this for the task of finding an integer root of a polynomial equation. Applying this computability theory to probability and randomness is especially fruitful. The theory of probability predicts what properties the outcome of an experiment will have, without necessarily giving any specific example of a reasonable ?random? outcome. For instance, the experiment of throwing a dart at a dart board can result in any region of the board being hit, but will never result in a perfect bulls-eye or any other predefined point on the board. In theory there will always be a small error, perhaps invisible to the naked eye; this can be expressed by saying that the result of the experiment is an algorithmically random point on the dart board. One can also study how algorithmically random a sequence of observations must be for the scientific method to yield information about the phenomenon underlying the observations via the methods of statistics. The mathematical delineation of the intuitive notion of an individual random object as one having no computable or definable unlikely properties may contribute to a better appreciation of probability and randomness by scientists as well as the general public.<br/>"

Harizanov works on a broad range of topics including effective categoricity of structures, Turing and strong degree spectra of relations, computable structures of high Scott rank, and degrees of the isomorphism types of geometric structures.

It is of importance in theoretical mathematics and computer science and in the philosophy of mathematics. It combines ideas and techniques of computability theory with methods of other areas of mathematics to solve important complexity and classification problems. Many mathematical problems have algorithmic solutions. For those problems that are fundamentally non-algorithmic, we use sophisticated and often unique computability theoretic methods to further investigate their computational content. Such methods include Turing and other degree theoretic analysis of relative computational complexity of sets and problems they encode. <br/>"

Firstly, he intends to further elaborate on the structure theory of large Polish group and, in particular, automorphism groups of countable first order structures. The PI's main <br/>interest in this domain is the existence of generic representations of countable discrete groups in such automorphism groups and its uses in investigating the dynamics and algebraic structure of the automorphism group. <br/>Secondly, the PI will be working on the classical problem of J.P.R.

Again, this problem is tightly connected with the geometry and dynamical properties of Polish groups and very likely to leads to new techniques and concepts of value outside of the study of automatic continuity. <br/>Finally, Rosendal will be continuing his collaboration with V. Ferenczi on the <br/>rough classification of separable Banach spaces, a programme initiated by W. T. Gowers in the course of the solution to the homogeneous space problem. This programme heavily relies on Ramsey theoretical and game theoretical methods from descriptive set theory and thus enriches both descriptive set theory by developing new techniques and functional analysis by contributing to one of the most central problems of Banach space theory. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In recent years, there has been a growing collaboration and sharing of ideas between researchers working in dynamical systems and descriptive set theory. Initially, this was largely fostered by work on Borel equivalence relations but has lately also come to include topological dynamics. The principal objectives of descriptive set theory consists in studying the definable subsets of the real line, showing that these are much better behaved than arbitrary subsets. This has developed into a large structure theory of such sets which gives a solid framework within which most of mathematical analysis takes place, and as such, the use of descriptive set theoretical techniques in parts of functional analysis is continuously expanding.<br/><br/>"

If S is a discrete semigroup, then its Stone-Cech compactification is, in a natural way, a compact Hausdorff right topological semigroup. As is true of any compact Hausdorff right topological semigroup, this Stone-Cech compactification has a smallest two sided ideal, and this ideal usually has elaborate algebraic structure. This project involves the study of the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification and its smallest ideal and investigation of the combinatorial applications of that structure, primarily to Ramsey Theory.<br/><br/>Ramsey Theory is that part of combinatorics that deals with the question of what sort of homogeneous structures one can expect to find in some one cell of a finite partition (or ""coloring"") of specified sets. For example, the simplest nontrivial instance of the infinite version of Ramsey's Theorem says that whenever the two element subsets of the set N of positive integers are finitely colored, there must be some infinite subset of N all of whose two element subsets are the same color. The principal investigator gained some fame many years ago when he proved that whenever N is finitely colored, there must exist in one color an infinite sequence together with all of its finite sums of distinct terms without repetition. The original proof was elementary, but very complicated. But in 1975, Fred Galvin and Steven Glazer showed that this ""Finite Sums Theorem"" is a completely trivial consequence of the fact that the Stone-Cech compactification of N can be given an algebraic structure extending ordinary addition which is a compact right topological semigroup, and therefore has idempotents, that is elements such that p + p = p. Since then, numerous other applications of the algebraic structure of Stone-Cech compactifications to Ramsey Theory have been found.<br/><br/>"

The properties are at the heart of Shelah's fundamental work on classification of first-order theories, as well as the results on excellent classes. Preliminary results allow to conjecture that failure of generalized amalgamation is witnessed by certain category-theoretic objects. Study of such objects is the central topic of this research. <br/><br/>Kolesnikov's approach allows to treat generalized amalgamation properties in first-order theories and non-elementary classes as particular cases of a common phenomenon. The starting point of this research is the development of a theory of generalized amalgamation for algebraically closed sets in stable first-order theories, extending the work of Hrushovski. Such a theory appears to be rich even for totally categorical theories and could be of independent interest.<br/><br/>A novel feature of this research is the idea to phrase generalized amalgamation in terms of functorial embeddings of simplicial complexes into models (of a first-order theory or those of an atomic class). <br/>The projected characterization of generalized amalgamation in terms of homological algebra would lead to influx of new ideas into model theory of both first-order theories and non-elementary classes.<br/><br/>Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic that aims to analyze classes of mathematical structures that are axiomatized in some way (the terms ""first-order theory"" and ""non-elementary class"" refer to certain kinds of axioms that are used). One of the subfields of model theory, called classification theory, attempts to identify conditions on a class of structures that provide substantial information about the overall behavior of the elements of the class. The finer analysis of geometric model theory attempts to connect the combinatorial geometry of structures, defined in model-theoretic terms, with geometries coming from classically known structures. Generalized amalgamation properties originated in classification theory. The expectation is that Kolesnikov's research will connect the failure of properties to the existence of certain objects studied in a different area of mathematics. This research will contribute to the broader efforts on solving a long-standing (classification-theoretic) conjecture of Shelah and, potentially, will help in developing geometric methods in model theory of non-elementary classes. <br/>"

Broadly speaking, the goal is to describe their dynamics and identify types of dynamics that cannot occur in them. In recent work the principal investigator and others have applied methods from recursion theory and topological dynamics to describe the complexity of some classical dynamical invariants associated to SFTs and CA, such as their entropy and directional dynamics (subdynamics). This project represents a continuation of that investigation. The principal investigator hopes to extend the classification of subdynamics to co-rank 1 actions (currently only co-rank 2 and higher are known) and begin a systematic study of the full dynamics, which are related to more quantitative measures of complexity drawn from computer science rather than the qualitative ones of recursion theory. He will also study the relation between SFTs, CA, and other dynamical systems, specifically addressing which actions on the Cantor set can be approximated by certain types of SFTs.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the class of dynamical systems arising from infinite collections of discrete elements in which only ""nearby"" elements interact. Such models are widely used as theoretical models and in simulation in many areas of science and engineering, such as thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, the theory of quasi-crystals, information theory, and computer science, to name just a few. In that context, it is a fundamental problem to determine which dynamics such systems can represent and what their theoretical limitations are and to identify subclasses that are more amenable to study and use. Precise results in this field have come to light recently, and this project aims to continue research in this direction."

Faculty and students who are not experts are immersed in the subject for one or two intensive days and get the tools they need to continue on their own. The location and topic is announced several months in advance. Each workshop is led by one or two experts in the topic. This could mean doing all the lecturing themselves, or delegating parts to others. Typically, there are three hours of lectures in the morning (with short breaks), two hours for lunch, and three hours of lectures in the afternoon (with short breaks).  Those wishing to attend a workshop may apply to have some of their travel expenses reimbursed. We hire one or two student participants to prepare typed notes based on the lectures with help from the workshop leader or leaders. These lecture notes are disseminated online. At least one publisher has expressed interest in publishing a collection of these lecture notes as part of a mathematics book series.

The first measures the information content of finite binary strings, while the second captures the intuition that a random infinite binary sequence has no ""distinguishing features"". Both notions are rooted in computability theory, so it is not surprising that the study of randomness draws methods and ideas from computability theory, as well as core mathematical subjects like measure theory and information theory.<br/>However, the theory of effective randomness has proved to be a rich field of study in its own right. Miller proposes to study the strength of non-monotonic betting strategies, the computable power of sequences with positive effective Hausdorff dimension, degrees of randomness, and K-triviality.<br/><br/>A sequence of zeros and ones is considered random if the shortest<br/>(binary) computer program that generates the sequence has essentially the same length as the sequence itself. Intuitively, a random sequence has no patterns that can be exploited to give a compressed description. For example, the sequence consisting of a million zeros can be generated easily by a short program, so it is not random. On the other hand, there is a high probability that a sequence generated by flipping a coin a million times (tails is zero, heads is one) will be random. The length of the shortest program for a sequence is called the Kolmogorov complexity of the sequence; this notion was introduced in the 1960s. An infinite sequence is considered random if all of its finite initial segments are sufficiently random. This is equivalent to saying that no (semi-)computable betting strategy can win money trying to predict the digits of the sequence. The proposed research will address fundamental questions about randomness, including: (1) How powerful are computable betting strategies that are allowed to bet on the digits of a sequence in any order; (2) Is it possible to distill information out of a semi-random source to produce a random sequence or, at least, a sequence that has higher information density; (3) What does it mean to say that one infinite sequence is more random that another (4) How computationally weak are the infinite?<br/><br/>"

Important background notions include the ideas of Kolmogorov complexity and Martin-Lof randomness, which have separately and jointly received large amounts of attention, and which come together in many of the examples and problems described in this proposal.  Issues to be studied during the project include relationships between Martin-Lof random sets and Hausdorff dimension or other measures of dimension, methods for extracting randomness from a semi-random source of data, dimensions and other properties of complexity classes of strings, distinctive properties of sets with low Kolmogorov complexity, and relationships between algorithmic randomness and reverse mathematics, which seeks to understand the axiomatic strength required by particular theories.<br/><br/>The forms of randomness studied by this group of researchers are based on some appealing ideas regarding infinite strings, such as the record of an infinitely repeated series of coin tosses.  Intuitively, the Kolmogorov complexity of a binary string like the record of heads and tails from coin tosses is the length of the shortest definitive description of the string.  Digitization methods for voice and picture transmission take advantage of the regularity and repetition in typical voice signals or digitized images, using much less space or time to record the sound or image data than might seem necessary.<br/>From the point of view of Kolmogorov complexity, a genuinely random binary string is probably its own shortest description, or nearly so.<br/>Some of the problems studied by this research group seek to establish properties of subsets of strings that have the same complexity, such as their dimension.

This target has resisted 40 years of effort by set theorists, despite major advances in the late 60's, in 1974-1980, and in 1985-1994.  That earlier work gave us a good understanding of canonical inner models satisfying ``There is a Woodin cardinal"", and even slightly stronger hypotheses, but it fell well short of superstrong cardinals. Since 1994, progress in this interval has been slow and incremental, but Steel believes it has opened up a promising line of attack. This line builds on concepts and methods derived from the evolving merger of inner model theory and pure descriptive set theory. It centers on the Core Model Induction technique, and the Mouse Set Conjecture.  Steel proposes to work in this direction.<br/><br/><br/>    Work on the set-theoretic foundations of mathematics has revealed a remarkable phenomenon. It appears that all natural mathematical theories fall into a single hierarchy, calibrated by the degree to which a commitment to the existence of large infinite sets is implicit in the theory. Moreover, this degree of commitment corresponds exactly to the power of the theory to decide questions about concrete objects, like natural numbers, real numbers, or sets of real numbers. Set theorists have developed two complementary methods for locating theories in this hierarchy of logical strength, namely Forcing and Inner Model Theory. <br/>While the basics of Forcing are understood in full generality, the basics of Inner Model Theory are not, and consequently many problems concerning the logical strengths of particular foundational theories remain open. <br/>Steel will work to further develop the basics of Inner Model Theory.<br/><br/>"

Finite-state automata are Turing machines with fixed finite bounds on resource use.  Continuing a tradition of studying that part of mathematics which can be performed effectively, the field of automatic structures explores mathematical objects which can be represented by automata.  Questions about automatic structures may be grouped into two themes: developing structural characterizations and studying algorithmic consequences of such characterizations. Dr. Minnes has worked in both of these areas, including proving both positive and negative results about the existence of such characterizations. Through this NSF grant, she will work towards answering these guiding questions in the context of less understood classes of structures.  For example, the fundamental groups associated with certain manifolds have intimate connections with automata and some sequences arising in symbolic dynamics and combinatorics may be seen as generated by automata.  The tools developed by the automatic structures community may lead to a better structural understanding of these objects.  In parallel,  Dr. Minnes seeks to develop the area of automatic model theory.   Much work has been done in understanding how the standard results of model theory change when restricted to the framework of computable or polynomial-time objects.  Preliminary work shows interesting analogies in the automatic structures world and suggests the promise of fruitful results.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>With the increasing reliance of the modern world on computerized and networked systems, the theoretical underpinnings of computational feasibility have gained more immediate relevance.

This NSF project focusses on a different model for the computer, the finite automaton, which more closely captures online computation and resource bounds.  Dr. Minnes will study questions which relate finite automata both to traditional topics of mathematical logic  and to new interactions with other fields of mathematics and computer science."

One of main projects is to answer Efimov's question of whether it is consistent that one or the other must be true in each compact space. Another is to complete our project of determining if there is a small upper bound to the natural notion called the sequential order of a compact (sequential) space. The structure of the remainder of the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers, known as N*, and continuing an important line of investigation following Shelah's breakthrough result on self-homeomorphisms, the behavior of continuous maps with that as the domain, will be investigated. Given the current state of knowledge, it is quite interesting that most of these questions remain unresolved in models of the celebrated Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA) and forcing extensions of models in which this axiom holds. This project will be adding to the toolbox of techniques and results in this central area of study.
