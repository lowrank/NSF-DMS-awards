Deepening the understanding of<br/>the mathematical processes that underlie fast computation and<br/>computer simulation is the principal goal of the meeting.  The<br/>mathematical content covers fields of research at the interface<br/>of engineering, computer science, and pure mathematics, but<br/>focused on computation.  The program includes 18 3-day workshops<br/>and 18 plenary speakers.  The plenary talks and workshops span<br/>subjects of vital interest to the nation's infrastructure,<br/>economy, and defense.  The project supports participation by<br/>postdocs, graduate students, junior participants, women and<br/>minorities as well as plenary and semi-plenary speakers and<br/>workshop organizers.<br/>     Large-scale computation and the implementation of<br/>mathematical models for complex physical and societal phenomena<br/>are of fundamental importance to the nation's economy.<br/>Computation is also the backbone of the sciences supporting the<br/>nation's defense.  Large-scale computation is the engine of<br/>numerical models for complex physical phenomena occurring at many<br/>scales.  Fast computation and processing of the ever-increasing<br/>data sets obtained from various sensors is critical to the new<br/>military.  The purpose of this major meeting, held only every<br/>three years, is to further the understanding of the deep<br/>relationships between mathematical theory: analysis, topology,<br/>geometry and algebra, and computational processes as they are<br/>evolving in tandem with the modern computer.  The topics to be<br/>addressed include large scale computation and high performance<br/>computing as occurs in atmospheric and groundwater modeling,<br/>computer aided design and animation, data, image and signal<br/>processing, modeling network traffic, quantum computing, learning<br/>theory, optimization and control.  Sustaining the nation's<br/>advantage in these vital areas relies on understanding the<br/>foundations of computational science.  The meeting involves<br/>350-500 researchers in 18 workshops over a 10-day period, with<br/>special plenary sessions attended by everyone.  A large contingent<br/>of graduate students and other young scientists are<br/>participating, and the program is designed to promote intensive<br/>interaction among the participants.  Several panels are devoted to<br/>identifying the most promising directions for future research.<br/>Published proceedings, web-based materials, and the conference<br/>sessions themselves serve as launching pads for focus and special<br/>interest groups for future interactions in a range of subjects at<br/>the interface of mathematics and computation.<br/><br/>"

The work of Buium and Hrushovski has shown that these<br/>ideas have important consequences in Diophantine geometry.  In<br/>particular, the principal investigator will study the model<br/>theoretic behavior of solution sets of families of algebraic<br/>differential equations.

The<br/>methods and results of model theory are cast in terms of<br/>definable sets and functions, where a construction is definable<br/>exactly when it can be expressed by first-order logical formulas<br/>in the language of the structure. Model theoretic methods for the<br/>field of real numbers with exponentiation have been remarkably<br/>successful in proving new results on the geometry of exponential<br/>varieties and sets defined from them. This work has already found<br/>applications in asymptotic analysis, control theory, microlocal<br/>analysis, and neural networks.

The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its<br/>diameter, therefore, is a manifestation of the actual, as opposed to<br/>just the potential, infinite. While the existence of the actual<br/>infinite has had a profound influence on mathematics, its acceptance<br/>was not immediate and the history of the subject is fraught with<br/>controversy.  Two major branches of mathematics which devote much of<br/>their resources to the study of the infinite are analysis and set<br/>theory. Much of analysis is concerned with understanding limiting<br/>behaviour in various contexts. A simple prototype of this is found in<br/>considering the number Pi as the limit of increasingly longer finite<br/>decimal approximations to Pi. Many of the spaces which analysts study<br/>consist of limits of simpler objects. Set theory, on the other hand,<br/>studies the infinite in a more abstract setting, concentrating on the<br/>combinatorial and structural implications of the infinite. While the<br/>connections between set theory and analysis have always been<br/>acknowledged, too much of the work in these two areas has gone on<br/>largely unheeded by researchers in the other area.

The axiom of determinacy is the statement that<br/>every two-player integer game is determined, that is, one of the<br/>players has a winning strategy.  Although this axiom contradicts<br/>the axiom of choice, an accepted part of mathematics, it was<br/>proposed in the 1960s to be a reasonable assumption for the<br/>smallest inner model of set theory containing the real numbers.<br/>This model contains the sets of reals occurring in ordinary<br/>mathematical practice (e.g., the projective sets and beyond).<br/>The study of this model, in turn, gives direct information about<br/>the mathematical universe.  The notion of a scale is a central<br/>structural concept in descriptive set theory, and the axiom of<br/>determinacy was used to develop the scale theory of the<br/>projective sets, which was later extended throughout the entire<br/>model.  The scale theory by itself, however, is not sufficient to<br/>answer many questions.  A more detailed inductive analysis was<br/>begun in the mid 1980s which was successful at the lower levels<br/>of the model, including the projective sets.  This theory does<br/>not currently extend through the entire model, and finding such<br/>an extension remains a central goal.  Recently, several new lines<br/>of investigation have opened up, relating in some way to the<br/>theory of this model.  One such direction concerns investigating<br/>the connections between the existing theory of this model and the<br/>theory of ultrafilters (Shelah's p.c.f. theory).  Preliminary<br/>results, which use centrally Woodin's theory of the nonstationary<br/>ideal, suggest strong collapsing principles apply as one moves<br/>from the inner model to the real universe.  Exactly what is<br/>forced to collapse, and what principles govern this phenomenon,<br/>is a topic of investigation.  Finding and establishing principles<br/>independent of the complete inductive analysis might also provide<br/>a framework for propagating a basic ""skeleton"" of the analysis<br/>through the entire model.<br/><br/>This project attempts to advance the understanding of the<br/>mathematical universe of sets.  All of mathematics takes place<br/>within this universe, and progress here is important not only<br/>foundationally, but because of the direct influence on the<br/>various branches of mathematics.  It has been known for some time<br/>that strong assumptions are needed to answer many basic<br/>mathematical questions.  Identifying these assumptions and<br/>exploring their consequences is a major theme in set theory.  The<br/>axiom of determinacy is an important example of such an axiom.<br/>This was formulated in the 1960s but the full extent of its<br/>consequences is not known.  Recent evidence suggests that it may<br/>shed light on some basic mathematical questions, such as the<br/>continuum hypothesis (the question of how many real numbers there<br/>are).<br/>"

Uniformity has to be understood here in the following sense. Suppose an  algebraic-geometric object, such as  a variety or a coherent sheaf,  is presented to us by means of some polynomials over an algebraically closed field. From this object other objects or invariants can be derived by applying some algebraic-geometric process. The question posed is now when can this  construction be carried out by using only polynomials of degree bounded by the degree of the initial polynomials? In particular, when is an invariant associated to this object uniformly bounded by the initial degrees only? Provided such uniform bounds exist, the following transfer principle can be applied. Encode, allowing negations and quantification, the construction or some of its properties in the field by means of the coefficients of the polynomials involved--the existence of uniform bounds is certainly a necessary, but often even a sufficient condition for this to hold. Then use the Lefschetz Principle to carry over results from positive characteristic to zero characteristic, or, conversely, from zero characteristic  to almost all positive characteristics. The investigator has already successfully applied this method to the following non-trivial facts: the Bass Conjecture, the Zariski-Lipman Conjecture and the New Intersection Theorem. In this proposal, he is especially interested in applications to tight closure in characteristic zero. Moreover, he proposes to infer from the existence of uniform bounds, the constructible nature of certain algebraic-geometric constructions. For instance, he seeks to continue the following program originally initiated by Nagata and Grothendieck: for a given geometric property of a point on a variety,  when is the set of all points on the variety for which this property  holds, constructible?<br/><br/>This program provides an alternative approach to some open problems in the field, as well as a simplified treatment of previous results. The author takes a special interest in the following old problem, simple to state but yet so far resisting all known proof methods: is every curve in three dimensional space obtained by intersecting two surfaces? On a deeper level, the current proposal can be seen as an attempt to analyze and better understand the constructive nature of Algebraic Geometry, by looking at it from a logicians point of view. In this way, the Principal Investigator intends to present the domain in a more coherent and unified way and obtain an improved link between Geometry and Algebra.<br/>"

She is currently<br/>working with Csima, Hirschfeldt, and Soare on prime models and<br/>lowness properties.  She plans to work with Lempp, McCoy, and<br/>Solomon on Boolean algebras.  The funds are mainly for student<br/>travel and books.  The remainder is for partial support of the<br/>Notre Dame Logic Seminar.  Currently, Knight has two students.<br/>Andrew Arana, who may finish this summer, has a number of results<br/>on complexity in arithmetic, using some new independent sentences<br/>(variants of the Godel-Rosser sentence).  Arana is now<br/>concentrating on problems of a more foundational nature.  Wesley<br/>Calvert, a second year student, is working on complexity of the<br/>isomorphism problem for various familiar classes of computable<br/>structures.  He already has results for several classes of<br/>fields.  Knight may acquire new students during the period of the<br/>grant.<br/><br/>The goal of Knight's research, and that of students working with<br/>her, is to determine which aspects of mathematical structures are<br/>computable, and for those which are not computable, whether there<br/>is some nice, computable approximation.  The grant will<br/>facilitate new work of this kind.  There is a larger<br/>goal---enabling students to become first-rate research<br/>scientists.  The grant will be used mainly for student travel and<br/>books.  Without money for books, Knight's students would hardly<br/>own any.  She has found that, given money to buy the most<br/>important references, her students read much more than they would<br/>otherwise.  They see how the problems they are working on arose,<br/>and what their work means for the field as a whole.  Knight's<br/>past students, and other logic students at Notre Dame, have<br/>benefited tremendously from opportunities to travel to meetings.<br/>They meet researchers from other universities and hear about new<br/>developments.  As soon as they have results of their own, they<br/>give talks, and they get valuable suggestions.  In short, they<br/>have the opportunity, as students, to join the community of<br/>research mathematicians.<br/>"

The first of these directions relates to the treeable<br/>equivalence relations.  Following work of Adams and Kechris, we<br/>know that there is a mass of countable Borel equivalence<br/>relations which are mutually incomparable.  No such result is<br/>known for the treeable Borel equivalence relations. We do not<br/>know whether there are infinitely many distinct examples, and we<br/>basically have only one established example which is not<br/>hyperfinite. More generally we do not know whether the implicit<br/>involvement of measure theoretic examples involving free actions<br/>of the free group is the sole obstruction to hyperfiniteness. The<br/>second direction of Hjorth's project concerns issues in the fine<br/>study of Borel complexities of countable isomorphism types in the<br/>topology of quantifier free logic, and may be connected with a<br/>translation of some basic concepts from first order logic into a<br/>quantifier free context. The third direction of the proposal is<br/>to investigate some combinatorial questions, such as having a<br/>model with a certain partition property for definable partitions,<br/>for infinitary sentences, especially those arising as the Scott<br/>sentence of some countable structure; this may be related to a<br/>still open problem posed by Shelah in the 1970's on the Hanf<br/>number up to the continuum for countably infinitary logic.<br/><br/>In very general terms, this project can be located inside the<br/>branch of mathematics known as ""descriptive set theory"". This<br/>area arose around the end of 19th century as part of an effort to<br/>better understand the basic objects -- such as the real number<br/>line, real valued functions, subsets of the reals, subsets or<br/>regions of two dimensional and three dimensional space, the area<br/>or volume of such subsets -- which appear in calculus, and which<br/>are needed for applications in engineering, physics, and<br/>differential equations. Descriptive set theory does not itself<br/>actually address any of these eventual applications, but is<br/>rather preoccupied with purely foundational issues. Following<br/>Silver's theorem in the 1970's, many descriptive set theorists<br/>have become interested in equivalence relations on spaces such as<br/>the real number line, or two dimensional space, or similar<br/>classes of ""topological spaces"". The study of such equivalence<br/>relations leads to quotient objects which arise by considering<br/>the collection of all equivalence classes.  For instance if we<br/>set two real numbers to be equivalent when the result of<br/>subtracting one from the other is an integer (i.e. a ""whole<br/>number""), then the collection of equivalence classes may be<br/>naturally identified with the result of basically wrapping the<br/>real number line around itself, to obtain circle of circumference<br/>one. In this simple example the quotient object is easily<br/>understood, and has a geometrical representation.  Most of the<br/>work in Hjorth's area deals with the so called ""non-smooth""<br/>equivalence relations whose quotient objects do not admit such a<br/>representation, and the study of these quotient spaces is known<br/>to have connections with a variety of mathematical disciplines,<br/>such as ""dynamics"", and ""ergodic theory"", and some of the more<br/>abstract branches of ""analysis"", such as ""infinite dimensional<br/>group representations"".<br/>"

His test project is an analysis of the<br/>geometries induced by bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space<br/>and more complex structures like von Neumann algebras. With his<br/>student Berenstein Buechler has shown that many self-adjoint<br/>operators induce dependence relations satisfying all of the<br/>conditions of the dividing dependence relation. Buechler hopes<br/>that the dividing dependence relation will give insight into the<br/>structure of von Neumann algebras. In another project Buechler<br/>will investigate ""dividing relative to a closure operator"". While<br/>this study is analogous to the study of p-simple types in a<br/>superstable theory it presents dramatically different results<br/>when the original theory is not simple and the closure operator<br/>is chosen creatively. Applications to metric spaces and Vaught's<br/>conjecture are expected. Buechler will also study a class of<br/>scale-free networks with model-theoretic methods. Scale-free<br/>networks are ubiquitous in nature and technology.  Random graph<br/>theorists have discovered some of their properties, such as the<br/>degree functions.  However, techniques for building models are<br/>limited.  Model theorists have developed techniques for building<br/>graphs that are random relative to some constraints.  These<br/>methods may lend themselves to building scale-free graphs with<br/>specified parameters.<br/><br/>Frequently a significant advancement in science occurs when a<br/>problem arising in one area is viewed from the perspective of<br/>another discipline.  For example, problems in genetics have<br/>yielded to techniques from graph theory. In mathematics algebra<br/>has lead to great insight into geometry and knot theory.<br/>Buechler's specialty is model theory, a subfield of mathematical<br/>logic. Recently, Hrushovski applied model theory to solve<br/>problems in number theory. Buechler is adapting these same<br/>model-theoretic methods with an eye to problems in analysis and<br/>network theory. In analysis Buechler is looking at the<br/>model-theoretic content of operator theory, which has connections<br/>to mathematical physics.  The networks Buechler will study are at<br/>the heart of such disparate systems as the metabolic pathways in<br/>a cell and the World Wide Web. Buechler will attempt to adapt<br/>model-theoretic techniques for constructing graphs of interest in<br/>pure mathematics to building models of these networks arising in<br/>nature and technology.  Graduate students will be involved in all<br/>of these projects. The cross-disciplinary nature of the work will<br/>require the students to learn science that their normal<br/>curriculum would not expose them to, and to learn the value of<br/>viewing research in a broader context.<br/>"

In<br/>representation theory, the mathematician considers a group G as<br/>an abstract object and attempts to classify all the objects of<br/>which G is the symmetry group.  Traditionally, research has<br/>focused on the case where the objects are finite-dimensional<br/>vector spaces.
