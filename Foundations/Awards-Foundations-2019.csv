The main purpose of this conference is to bring together many leading researchers in the field of model theory from around the world.  The conference is expected to consist of approximately seventeen talks over the span of three days.  Although the talks will generally be aimed for logicians, some of these talks will be accessible to researchers outside of mathematical logic.  Furthermore, a poster session is planned at the conference where students and early career researchers can present their work.  <br/><br/>The conference aims to focus on areas of model theory which have not been the emphasis of any major conference in North America for the last several years.  The main topics that may be covered in the conference include: stability theory, simplicity theory, and neo-stability theory; model theory and computability theory; model theory and combinatorics; model theory in non-first order contexts; and model theory and set theory.

Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the lens of transfinite ordinal numbers.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project involves attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected to have a number of other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals. The second part of the research project concerns further developing techniques in pure set theory: <br/>methods for studying the combinatorics of the second uncountable cardinal via forcing axioms; the role that Jensen's diamond principle plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at most aleph1.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ramsey's Theorem states that given any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into finitely many colors, there is an infinite subset in which all pairs have the same color.  Since its inception, Ramsey theory has developed in multiple directions, often appearing as the core content in solutions to deep problems from a wide range of mathematical disciplines.  This project utilizes techniques in mathematical logic to more fully develop Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures.  A major motivation is to find dividing lines between those infinite structures which act like the natural numbers in the sense of possessing analogues of Ramsey's theorem, and those which do not.  Of particular interest is the advancement of Ramsey theory for structures with forbidden configurations.  Progress on infinite structures works in tandem with progress in mathematical logic and topology, creating new pathways between several areas of mathematics.  This project includes some important questions which are suitable for graduate students and early career researchers, thus providing opportunities to broaden participation of well-trained mathematicians via the PI's mentoring.<br/><br/>This research program will develop the Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures, especially those with forbidden configurations, an area which had been largely impervious to investigations prior to the PI's recent solution for the universal homogeneous triangle-free graph.  This will involve constructing new types of trees which code homogeneous relational structures and using the technique of forcing to produce (in ZFC) Ramsey theorems for these classes of trees.  These new techniques will be used obtain better bounds for finite structural Ramsey theory.  Computability theoretic strengths of varying Ramsey statements, and connections with classification schemes in model theory will be investigated.  Infinitary Ramsey theory will continue to be developed with a broad spectrum of implications for and applications to other areas of mathematics.  The techniques developed, involving simultaneous uses of logic, combinatorics and topology, will create new pathways between these areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since most mathematical objects can be represented as a structure, its subject matter is very broad and it interacts with several areas of mathematics. However, whereas other fields of mathematics are interested in specific structures, or classes of structures (for instance arithmetic studies the structure of the integers with addition and multiplication), model theory takes a step back and studies structures in general, looking for dividing lines and common properties. It singles out large classes of structures defined by combinatorial tameness conditions (which imply that the structure is in some sense not too complicated) and then attempts to understand the structures in those classes. One such class is that of NIP structures, which can be thought of as structures that have a geometric flavor. This class has received a lot of attention in the past decade. Another class is that of homogeneous structures, which are structures that have a lot of symmetries. Those are objects that belong to combinatorics and have been largely studied outside, or at the border of model theory. The main goal of this project is the investigation of new model-theoretic tools to understand homogeneous structures and in particular those that are NIP. There are few general theorems on homogeneous structures and at the same time no evidence that there cannot be any: we do not know how complicated homogeneous structures can be and this project hopes to shed light on this.<br/><br/>The starting point of this project is the classification of the primitive rank 1 NIP homogeneous structures obtained by the PI. One goal is naturally to generalize this result to all finite rank NIP homogeneous structures. A more long-term goal is the classification of all NIP homogeneous structures. This would require understanding omega-categorical linear orders, which is an interesting project in its own right. A more general goal of the project is the development of model-theoretic tools to study homogeneous structures. This will build on the work mentioned above as well as on a previous work with Itay Kaplan on finitely generated dense subgroups of automorphism groups. Projects include finding model-theoretic consequences of the Ramsey property and clarifying its link with distality, finding necessary and sufficient conditions for admitting homogeneous expansions with nice properties (including having a stationary or canonical independence relation, being linearly ordered, Ramsey etc.). Finally, a more speculative project is the understanding of random-like behaviors in homogeneous structures and finding ways to measure the complexity of homogeneous structures, in particular those that lie outside the usual model-theoretic tame classes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For many years, the PI has concentrated on mechanisms by which a theory can either admit or forbid certain combinatorial configurations in its models, and the proposed research is to continue these investigations in several  disparate contexts.  In some cases, this investigation melds well with computational learning theory.  As one example, if a theory forbids the independence property, then all of the concepts i.e., definable sets, arising in the models of the theory are PAC learnable.<br/><br/>In more detail, potential canonical Scott sentences have proved to be a useful tool in determining the Borel complexity of invariant classes of countable structures and we intend  to streamline these methods by exploring thickness and groundedness of classes of models.  It is hoped that the Borel complexity of every mutually algebraic theory can be computed.  Theories with non-maximal uncountable spectrum are classifiable.  Recent technical results about the existence of prime models make it tractable to settle Vaught's conjecture for classifiable theories and possibly for superstable theories as well.  In first order logic, aleph1-categoricity of a theory is an absolute notion, as can be seen by the Baldwin-Lachlan characterization of aleph1-categoricity.  The PI proposes to determine whether a similar characterization can be found for aleph1-categoricity of sentences of L(omega1, omega), or equivalently for classes of atomic models.  Specifically, the proposed research is to determine whether  aleph1-categoricity is absolute  for classes of atomic models. The PI also proposes to use previous results about mutually algebraic structures to study  expansions of weakly minimal structures that preserve stability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tools for testing whether a mathematical structures is suitable for classification are various hypotheses called ""dividing lines"", which forbid some fixed pattern in the behavior of a structure. A main focus of this project is one such dividing line called VC-dimension, which originated in machine learning, and uses ideas from graph theory to measure randomness in mathematical objects. In model theory, this notion emerged in the study of so-called ""NIP theories"". Conant will apply this model theoretic framework to questions in group theory, from both the discrete and topological perspectives, and also in the newer field of arithmetic combinatorics, which is a fusion of algebra, analysis, and discrete math. <br/><br/>A large part of past research in model theory has focused on structures which exhibit tameness at the global level, in the sense that every definable relation in the structure omits a combinatorial configuration of some fixed type. This research focuses on the local level, in which one analyzes a single tame relation inside an otherwise complicated structure. A major aim is to develop an algebraic theory of NIP formulas in arbitrary groups, which continues prior research of Conant and Pillay in the case of pseudofinite groups. A second aim is to extend this work on pseudofinite groups outside of the NIP environment. This setting is suitable for applications to arithmetic combinatorics in finite groups, for example previous research of Conant, Pillay, and Terry on tame arithmetic regularity. In the proposed research, Conant will use Lie theory and representation theory to develop arithmetic regularity in the pseudofinite setting without extra tameness assumptions. The goal is to give a model theoretic account of arithmetic regularity results of Green and Tao, and extend these results to non-commutative groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A familiar example of a graph is the internet: a huge network of computers, connected by cables.  Over time, it is easy to imagine this network growing so large that referring to individual computers becomes next to impossible.  Instead, one can probe large collections and ask questions like ""how many labels do I need so that no two connected computers receive the same label?""  This parameter, called the chromatic number of the graph, can change depending upon the complexity of the algorithms allowed to produce the labeling.  Such parameters have (often surprising) connections with other areas of mathematics -- including combinatorial and geometric group theory, probability theory, and operator algebras -- and a secondary aim of this project is to strengthen these connections in addition to forging new ones.<br/><br/>More precise proposed areas of study within this general setting include: (a) existence of measurable vertex colorings, edge colorings, and matchings, and subforests, (b) applications to structurability of measured equivalence relations, in particular those arising as orbit equivalence relations of probability-measure-preserving actions of locally compact Polish groups, (c) applications to finding measurable tilings of group actions, and (d) applications towards characterizing paradoxical decompositions.

This theory provides a general framework for understanding the nature of classification of mathematical objects up to some notion of equivalence, and, due to its broad scope, it has natural interactions with many areas of mathematics. A central place in this theory is occupied by countable Borel equivalence relations (CBERs), which arise via actions of countable groups as well as via locally countable graphs. These connections between equivalence relations, group actions, and graphs create an extremely fruitful interplay between descriptive set theory, ergodic theory, measured group theory, and descriptive graph combinatorics. The overarching goal of the reseach is to deepen the understanding of these connections and further the theory of CBERs having major open questions as guiding targets.<br/><br/>The projects can be grouped into four topics. The first concerns closure properties of the class of treeable CBERs, namely, whether abstract quasi-isometries and finite index extensions preserve treeability in the Borel or measurable contexts. Next is the investigation of the quasi-invariant setting aiming to develop a theory of quasi-invariant cost. The third topic is the existence of desirable subgraphs of graphings of a CBER, e.g., the existence of cost-approximating subgraphings or subtreeings, as well as that of maximal hyperfinite free factors.

It attracts participants nationally and internationally.  The STDC regularly attracts over 150 participants, and often over 200.  There are 7 plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks in most areas of topology and its applications by established researchers.  Talks bridging two or more research areas are encouraged.  In a highly technological society like the USA, a high level science research, and in particular mathematics research, is crucial for further progress. Conferences are an essential part for developing successful and competitive research programs in mathematics and for the education of young researchers. The STDC has played an essential part in the success and education of many of its participants. The conference will include contributed talks by PhD students, post-doctoral students, as well as junior mathematicians, and will encourage diversity among speakers.  There are six special sessions in subareas of topology including a new session in Topology and Graph Theory. More information and an invitation to participate may be found at the conference website:  http://www.uab.edu/cas/mathematics/mathnews/stdc<br/> <br/>The 53rd Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will run six special sessions: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Topology, Geometric Group Theory, Set<br/>Theoretic Topology, and Topology and Graph Theory that will include most topics of contemporary research in topology as well as highlighting connections between topology and other mathematical subjects. The session on Topology and Graph Theory is being included for the first time this year.

A crucial idea in this area, first developed in the 1970s by Shelah, is the notion of a dividing line. A dividing line can be thought of as a structural dichotomy within a certain class of mathematical objects.  Many of the most important dividing lines correspond to local combinatorial properties which have significant implications for global structure.  In the infinite setting, model theorists have had great success using dividing lines to classify examples and generalize their behavior. However, extensions into the finite setting have been limited, largely due to the failure there of crucial infinitary tools.  On the other hand, extremal and arithmetic combinatorics are fields which focus on the finite setting, but which study many of the same themes as model theory, such as local versus global structure and the interplay of structure and randomness.  These fields have developed finitary questions and tools which are new to model theory, but which have have deep connections to model theoretic ideas.  The goal of this project is to extend the study of model theoretic dividing lines in the finite setting by solving finitary problems from extremal and additive combinatorics which address these shared themes.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project will focus on finding local model theoretic conditions which have robust implications for bounds and growth rates in theorems from additive and extremal combinatorics.  This will be accomplished in two main directions.  The first will focus on questions from additive combinatorics.  Here a main goal will be to identify structural dichotomies for subsets of high-dimensional vector spaces over prime fields. For instance, what kinds of sets are most ""tame'', as measured through improved bounds in structural decomposition theorems?  Can the ""tame'' sets be characterized by local combinatorial configurations?  The second direction will address questions in extremal combinatorics.  Specifically, the PI will continue work on enumeration and extremal problems for hereditary properties in finite relational languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical theories which cannot be decided by ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs) are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. This is the Godel's program in Set Theory. If an LCA is ""correct"", then the theories it decides are also correct. How can one test for correctness of an LCA? The Inner Model Program, a major program in modern Set Theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of Arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a correct theory). The proposed project contributes to the Inner Model Program by advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various extensions of ZFC. <br/><br/><br/>The project focuses on studying the connections between inner models, sets of reals, hybrid structures (such as hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of determinacy models), forcing, and strong combinatorial principles (such as the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA)). The PI proposes to work on advancing the basic theory of hybrid structures, focusing on strategy mice and hod mice as well as developing methods for the core model induction beyond its current state. In particular, the project aims to make advancements in answering the following fundamental questions in descriptive inner model theory: (1) Is HOD of a determinacy model fine-structural (e.g. do the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), various square principles hold in HOD)?
