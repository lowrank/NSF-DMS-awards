There are many different types of dynamical systems, and one important mathematical question is to classify the statistical or qualitative behavior of these systems. This project uses descriptive set theory to show what kinds of classification are possible and to establish the mathematical limitations of general classifications. The project involves graduate students.<br/><br/>Classification of dynamical systems can be approached by classifying the statistical and qualitative behavior of diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds and establishing criteria for deciding when time forwards is isomorphic to time backwards (in the appropriate category).  These questions are closely related to which abstract measure-preserving transformations are isomorphic to volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds.  This project studies when classifications are possible with inherently countable methods and explores methods for realizing abstract transformations as diffeomorphisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The tools for testing whether a mathematical structures is suitable for classification are various hypotheses called ""dividing lines"", which forbid some fixed pattern in the behavior of a structure. A main focus of this project is one such dividing line called VC-dimension, which originated in machine learning, and uses ideas from graph theory to measure randomness in mathematical objects. In model theory, this notion emerged in the study of so-called ""NIP theories"". Conant will apply this model theoretic framework to questions in group theory, from both the discrete and topological perspectives, and also in the newer field of arithmetic combinatorics, which is a fusion of algebra, analysis, and discrete math. <br/><br/>A large part of past research in model theory has focused on structures which exhibit tameness at the global level, in the sense that every definable relation in the structure omits a combinatorial configuration of some fixed type. This research focuses on the local level, in which one analyzes a single tame relation inside an otherwise complicated structure. A major aim is to develop an algebraic theory of NIP formulas in arbitrary groups, which continues prior research of Conant and Pillay in the case of pseudofinite groups. A second aim is to extend this work on pseudofinite groups outside of the NIP environment. This setting is suitable for applications to arithmetic combinatorics in finite groups, for example previous research of Conant, Pillay, and Terry on tame arithmetic regularity. In the proposed research, Conant will use Lie theory and representation theory to develop arithmetic regularity in the pseudofinite setting without extra tameness assumptions. The goal is to give a model theoretic account of arithmetic regularity results of Green and Tao, and extend these results to non-commutative groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Model theory is a part of mathematical logic, and studies the manner in which mathematical objects or classes of objects are defined linguistically. Consequently, model theory has developed various ways of measuring the simplicity and complexity of classes of functions or sets.  Among the  other areas of  mathematics that the PI will study using model-theoretic methods,  is combinatorics, in particular graphs, also informally called networks.  Important results in combinatorics are ""regularity"" results, showing how networks can be decomposed into a small number of pieces, each such piece behaving ""almost randomly"". The PI will use model theoretic methods to extend and improve such regularity theorems, sometimes under a simplicity assumption. <br/><br/>The core part of the proposal has three aspects: The first is to use methods from topological dynamics to obtain new invariants for first order theories and definable groups. The second concerns applications of model theory and nonstandard methods to arithmetic regularity theorems as well as the formulation of new regularity statements in a ""tame"" environment such as stability theory in continuous logic. The third involves the formulation of the notion of an approximate subgroup in a general model-theoretic context and giving a classification in the absence of invariant measures.

Surprisingly, for such a general context, we can say meaningful things, discovering new general laws on the one hand and giving new methods for concrete mathematical theories on the other. Model-theoretic classification theory gives an approach to discovering the general laws: informally, it aims to isolate so-called dividing lines where a significant structural change in the class of theories may be detected, and in parallel to develop the internal theory to understand what is producing the phenomena observed. One such dividing line has to do with whether theories have nontrivial randomness.  Current methods have been successful in many ways on the non-random side. This project concerns independent theories, those on the random side. The randomness complicates to varying degrees the ability of current methods to gauge the full structure. This research works towards a more fundamental understanding of such theories, using a range of classical and newly developed tools able to detect average behavior and changes in the complexity of model-theoretic randomness. Along with the research developments, the project will support the training of students at various levels.<br/><br/>More precisely, the project aims to study independent theories, those with the independence property. The following interrelated test problems guide the work in this project. The first concerns characterizing saturated models of simple theories in a way analogous to the known characterization for stable theories, as a test problem for understanding of the building blocks of simple unstable theories. An approach to this question, of independent interest, involves developing a recently introduced generalization of forking. A second problem involves characterizing and developing a structure theory for a certain interesting class of simple theories 'near' the random graph. A third is to investigate the structure of quotients of Keisler's order. A fourth is to find true dividing lines within the class of independent theories and in parallel to develop the internal theory justifying these as dividing lines. These questions themselves connect to the classical problem of understanding the so called Keisler order, whose structure on dependent theories is known but whose structure on the independent theories remains in some senses mysterious.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project is focused on cases where this happens because the argument is indirect, proving a fact about finite numbers using a detour through various notions of infinity. In these cases, it is often possible to provide a translation in which we reinterpret statements about infinite numbers as more complicated statements about explicit computations. The goal of this project is to develop ""meta-theorems"" for cases where this happens - results allowing us to systematically translate infinitary proofs into finite, explicit proofs - and to test these methods by applying them to examples in model theory. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students through their involvement with the research topics.<br/><br/>This project considers an assortment of situations where abstract logical ideas, particularly saturation, compactness, forcing, and uncountable cardinals, are used to prove concrete theorems.

The project focuses on results in model theory, including the combinatorial part of stability theory and its links to graph and hypergraph quasirandomness, and saturated embedding tests for quantifier elimination.

They often appear as the set of symmetries of a geometric object, for example, of 3-dimensional space, a molecule or a crystal. Oftentimes, the set of symmetries themselves, i.e., the group, has a natural topological structure. That is, one can speak of one symmetry being close to another, as in the case of two rotations of 3-dimensional space being close if they differ by a small angle. These latter groups are called topological transformation groups and are trivially related to geometry via the geometric object of which they are the set of symmetries. However, other topological groups are not so easily viewed as coming from geometry. This is, for example, the case for the systems of solutions to many differential equations which form a group under addition called a Banach space. However, one of the principal ideas of the present project is that all topological groups have natural intrinsic geometric structure which is defined jointly by their topological and algebraic structure. Moreover, this geometric structure can in many cases provide significant insight into the structure of the group by blotting out finer details that obscure the global or large scale properties of the group.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to investigate the coarse geometry of topological and, in particular, Polish groups. In earlier research, the PI has established and investigated a natural coarse structure that every topological group is equipped with and which coincides with that traditionally studied on finitely generated or locally compact groups, Banach spaces or even homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds. Particularly interesting subclasses to be studied are the Polish groups of bounded geometry for which the geometric structure theory is well-advanced. Several interesting questions on the extent of this class of groups remain open, for example, whether every Polish group of bounded geometry is coarsely equivalent to a locally compact group. The research program is by nature interdisciplinary. While its origins lie in descriptive set theory, the main examples of groups to be studied arise in various disciplines of mathematics, including functional analysis, logic, and geometric and differential topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Von Neumann algebras were introduced by John von Neumann in his mathematical account of quantum mechanics and consist of infinite-sized matrices closed under various natural operations.  Quantum complexity theory considers the difficulty of solving or verifying solutions to decision problems using the quantum model of computation, that is to say, computers that run according to the laws of quantum physics as opposed to classical physics.  Recently, a landmark result in quantum complexity theory showed that classically unsolvable decision problems could be reliably verified by a quantum computer.  This quantum complexity result established a negative solution to a famous problem in operator algebras, the so-called Connes Embedding Problem, posed in 1976, which asks whether or not every von Neumann algebra can be approximated by a simple von Neumann algebra known as the hyperfinite II_1 factor.  Using techniques from model theory, a branch of mathematical logic that studies classes of structures by examining what is expressible about them using first-order logic, the PI and a collaborator greatly simplified and elucidated the connection between the quantum complexity result and the solution to the Connes Embedding Problem.  This project plans to deepen the connection between these three areas by isolating the exact model-theoretic content behind the quantum complexity result and deducing further von Neumann algebraic consequences. <br/><br/>More specifically, the PI plans on extending the model-theoretic analysis of the quantum complexity result to understand the complexity of the full first-order theory of the hyperfinite II_1 factor; the PI's work with Hart established this connection for the one-quantifier theory.  In addition, the PI plans to pursue proofs of the failure of the Connes Embedding Problem which avoid the use of the quantum complexity result by using the model-theoretic notions of existentially closed models and Robinson forcing; due to the difficulty in proving the quantum complexity result, a new proof along these lines would serve as a great simplification of the resolution of the Connes Embedding Problem.  The project will also study other uses of model theory in von Neumann algebra theory, including furthering progress on Popa's embedding problem, which asks about the existence of certain kinds of ergodic embeddings of II_1 factors into ultrapowers.  The PI also plans on making progress on the C*-algebra version of the Connes Embedding Problem known as the Kirchberg Embedding Problem, which asks if every C*-algebra is approximated by the Cuntz algebra, an algebra of extreme importance in the classification program for nuclear C*-algebras.  Finally, while the majority of the model-theoretic study of von Neumann algebras has focused on so-called finite algebras, the PI plans on studying the model-theoretic properties of arbitrary von Neumann algebras through the lens of W*-probability spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broadly speaking, mathematical logic is the formal study of mathematical language and its meaning.  For example, the assertion ""between every two numbers, there is a third"" changes meaning depending on which ambient universe of ""numbers"" (integers, fractions, etc.) one is referring to.  Categorical logic provides tools for constructing a ""universal abstract universe"" in which the interpretation of mathematical statements captures their meanings in all possible ""real"" universes at once.  Descriptive set theory provides tools for classifying all such possible ""real"" universes, or in certain cases, proving that no such classification exists.  Recent work has pointed toward a deep connection between these two historically disparate subfields of logic, and this project aims to further develop this connection.<br/><br/>In this project the PI studies categorical logic and descriptive set theory as dual ""syntactic"" and ""semantic"" representations of infinitary propositional and first-order logic.  In the propositional setting, a long line of work points to locale theory (""point-free topology"") as an uncountable generalization of classical descriptive set theory in Polish and standard Borel spaces, and this project aims to extend this analogy by developing localic counterparts of more advanced classical techniques, such as projective sets, effective descriptive set theory, and forcing.  In the first-order setting, recent work by the PI has shown that the Joyal-Tierney representation theorem for toposes yields a duality between theories in infinitary first-order logic and their standard Borel groupoids of countable models.  This project aims to extend this duality to continuous logic for metric structures, which will involve first developing the foundations for a metric analog of topos theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By considering different mathematical structures, ideas from dynamics interact with several other areas of mathematics, in particular logic, group theory, and combinatorics. In turn, ideas from these fields give rise to new phenomena in dynamics. This project will focus on ideas coming from ""countable combinatorics,"" broadly construed. Combinatorics is the study of discrete structures, as opposed to continuous ones, while the emphasis on ""countable"" combinatorics means that these discrete structures will be infinite, but still small enough that we can write down a list, or enumeration, of their elements. Much research in the past two decades has elucidated how pigeon-hole principles on countable structures can yield examples of groups with simple dynamics; here, the group of symmetries will be large, i.e. uncountable. On the other hand, attention has shifted recently to considering combinatorial arguments on countable groups themselves; these can be used to show that countable groups always have wild dynamics.<br/><br/>The PI has two primary goals for this project. The first is to continue to develop the dictionary back and forth between combinatorial principles and dynamical properties of countable groups and more general Polish groups. In the case of countable groups, the existence of certain patterns on the group can lead to the construction of subshifts with interesting behavior, such as doubly minimal shifts or shifts disjoint from another given dynamical system. For more general Polish groups, Ramsey-like principles can be used to produce interesting spaces of ultrafilter-like objects on which the group can act. These dynamical systems will then have important universal properties, such as being universal for minimal flows, or being a universal ""completion flow,"" a dynamical object previously defined and investigated by the PI. The second is to develop techniques to prove new theorems in countable combinatorics. Of particular interest are theorems asserting that various countable first-order structures have finite big Ramsey degrees. While the properties of interest are about countable objects, the techniques used can deal with extremely large objects, such as spaces of ultrafilters or forcing posets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A crucial idea in this area, first developed in the 1970s by Shelah, is the notion of a dividing line. A dividing line can be thought of as a structural dichotomy within a certain class of mathematical objects.  Many of the most important dividing lines correspond to local combinatorial properties which have significant implications for global structure.  In the infinite setting, model theorists have had great success using dividing lines to classify examples and generalize their behavior. However, extensions into the finite setting have been limited, largely due to the failure there of crucial infinitary tools.  On the other hand, extremal and arithmetic combinatorics are fields which focus on the finite setting, but which study many of the same themes as model theory, such as local versus global structure and the interplay of structure and randomness.  These fields have developed finitary questions and tools which are new to model theory, but which have have deep connections to model theoretic ideas.  The goal of this project is to extend the study of model theoretic dividing lines in the finite setting by solving finitary problems from extremal and additive combinatorics which address these shared themes.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project will focus on finding local model theoretic conditions which have robust implications for bounds and growth rates in theorems from additive and extremal combinatorics.

Furthermore, group theory has a long history of interaction with logic. In the early developments of logic, group theory was an important testing ground for ideas in logic. On the other hand, it became gradually clear that many ideas from logic were also useful in the study of groups.

The main tool is the theory developed by Sela, and independently by Kharlampovich and Myasnikov, which they used to solve the 70-year-old Tarski's problem. The second part aims to understand the complexity of describing the elements and multiplication of groups. This includes analyzing the word problem and representative systems of groups using the framework of formal language theory. The third part builds on previous work of the investigator and aims to understand the descriptive complexity of groups, and how they connect to various important classes of finitely-generated groups. More broadly, this part aims to understand the complexity of classes of groups and the relations on them, especially isomorphism, within the context of computability theory. Overall, the project is conducive for student research as it contains many concrete and experimental examples, and will provide training and research experience for the diverse students at California State University, Northridge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broadly speaking, mathematical logic is the formal study of mathematical language and its meaning.  For example, the assertion ""between every two numbers, there is a third"" changes meaning depending on which ambient universe of ""numbers"" (integers, fractions, etc.) one is referring to.  Categorical logic provides tools for constructing a ""universal abstract universe"" in which the interpretation of mathematical statements captures their meanings in all possible ""real"" universes at once.  Descriptive set theory provides tools for classifying all such possible ""real"" universes, or in certain cases, proving that no such classification exists.  Recent work has pointed toward a deep connection between these two historically disparate subfields of logic, and this project aims to further develop this connection.<br/><br/>In this project the PI studies categorical logic and descriptive set theory as dual ""syntactic"" and ""semantic"" representations of infinitary propositional and first-order logic.  In the propositional setting, a long line of work points to locale theory (""point-free topology"") as an uncountable generalization of classical descriptive set theory in Polish and standard Borel spaces, and this project aims to extend this analogy by developing localic counterparts of more advanced classical techniques, such as projective sets, effective descriptive set theory, and forcing.  In the first-order setting, recent work by the PI has shown that the Joyal-Tierney representation theorem for toposes yields a duality between theories in infinitary first-order logic and their standard Borel groupoids of countable models.  This project aims to extend this duality to continuous logic for metric structures, which will involve first developing the foundations for a metric analog of topos theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The origins of the fields trace back to David Hilbert's program from the 1900's and to the work by Gödel, Church, and Turing that proved several aspects of this program impossible: there are problems in elementary number theory that do not have computable solutions. Since then, incomputable problems have been identified in many different subfields of mathematics. Most famously, the solution sets to some Diophantine equations and the word problem for some finitely presented groups are incomputable. Computability theory proposes frameworks to study the relative algorithmic complexity of such problems. This project proposes an in-depth investigation of two related frameworks in computability theory, and the complex structures that they give rise to. The project presents a diverse array of research avenues, suitable for all levels of experience. Soskova and Miller intend to continue their collaboration with undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students and facilitate the quick immersion of young researchers into this area through two textbooks: a beginner level Computability Theory textbook and a more specialized advanced textbook on the precise topic studied within this project. They also maintain a visual online database that allows the quick identification of open problems. The project will support women's engagement in the field through a mentorship program organized by Soskova within the CiE Women in Computability focus group. Soskova and Miller will continue to support the Logic Community by organizing scientific meetings and through their editorial work.<br/><br/>In computability theory, the Turing degrees are used to measure the effective content of sets of natural numbers. This measure can be extended to capture the effective content of other objects in mathematics, such as the real numbers. In other cases, Turing reducibility is not sufficient. For example, Miller proved that it is not possible to assign a Turing degree to every continuous function on the unit interval. In that and many other cases, an extension of Turing reducibility, enumeration reducibility, turns out to provide a better framework for effective mathematics. In 1967, Rogers posed a list of problems that strongly influenced the development of computability theory. One of these problems asks whether the partial orders of the Turing degrees and the enumeration degrees are rigid structures, i.e., have no nontrivial automorphisms. Slaman and Woodin proved that the rigidity of the Turing degrees is equivalent to a complete characterization of its definable relations and to its biinterpretability with second order arithmetic. Building on this, Soskova proved that the same equivalence holds for the enumeration degrees. Miller and Soskova (with collaborators) answered another problem from the list: there is a first order definable copy of the Turing degrees inside the enumeration degrees. This established a link between the rigidity problems for the two structures; if the Turing degrees are rigid then so are the enumeration degrees. The rigidity of the enumeration degrees, while still open, could turn out to be more approachable. Definability within the enumeration degrees has already proved more approachable. The goal of this project is to expand our understanding of the structure of the enumeration degrees and its nontrivial connections to effective mathematics, with a focus on computable topology. We would like to accumulate new methods investigate combinatorial properties of the structure, and isolate special classes of degrees that determine the logical character of the structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, mathematicians in these fields have come to realize that problems concerning algebraic, dynamical, and descriptive structural complexity of countable group and equivalence relations can be fruitfully studied via descriptive combinatorial and graph theoretic means. The principal investigator and collaborators have employed this combinatorial perspective to create new tools used to answer several open problems in these fields.  This research project aims to generate more new general tools and to promote fruitful interactions among these fields. <br/><br/><br/>The PI proposes to study problems around descriptive set theory and its specific interactions with orbit equivalence relations, cocycle superrigidity, treeability, inner amenability, weak equivalence and weak containment, and rigidity/anti-rigidity. The PI's research in these areas has already prompted a wealth of interesting and fundamental questions which intersect a variety of fields including descriptive set theory, measured group theory, graph theory, ergodic theory, probability theory, and operator algebras.
