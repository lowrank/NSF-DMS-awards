It is often the case that by starting with a large enough structure, a substructure with desired properties emerges.  Ramsey's Theorem states that given any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into finitely many colors, there is an infinite subset in which all pairs have the same color.  Since its inception, Ramsey theory has developed in multiple directions, often appearing as the core content in solutions to deep problems from a wide range of mathematical disciplines. This project utilizes techniques in mathematical logic to more fully develop Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures.  A major motivation is to find dividing lines between those infinite structures which act like the natural numbers in the sense of possessing analogues of Ramsey's theorem, and those which do not.  Progress on infinite structures works in tandem with progress in mathematical logic and topology, creating new pathways between several areas of mathematics. This project includes important questions suitable for graduate students and early career researchers, thus providing opportunities to broaden participation of well-trained mathematicians via the PI's mentoring.<br/><br/>This research program investigates infinite relational structures supporting Ramsey theory.  A major focus of this project is to develop the Ramsey theory of homogeneous structures.  This involves constructing new types of trees which code homogeneous relational structures and using the technique of forcing to produce (in ZFC) Ramsey theorems for these classes of trees, as well as developing purely combinatorial proofs.  Computability theoretic strengths of structural Ramsey statements will be investigated, as will model-theoretic dividing lines.  The second main focus is the continued development of topological Ramsey space theory and its implications for forcing, ultrafilters, and Banach spaces.  Development of Ramsey spaces for homogeneous structures ties this together with the first focus.  The third line of research will develop Ramsey theory on uncountable structures.  The techniques developed, involving simultaneous uses of logic, combinatorics and topology, will create new pathways between these areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the increasing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life and, more recently, in mathematical research, the time is ripe to start a regular annual meeting on this subject. Just like development of the World Wide Web started in the scientific community, the mathematical approach to machine learning can stimulate development of better AI algorithms and architecture whose future applications can extend far beyond 'pure' sciences. At the same time, advanced tools in machine learning start playing a major role in mathematical research, sometimes assisting expert mathematicians in making progress with some of the most difficult mathematical challenges. Although the interaction between the two communities seems natural, the opportunities are extremely limited and one of the main goals of the conference ""Mathematics and Machine Learning 2023"" is to fill this void.<br/><br/>The interactions between mathematics and machine learning (ML) can be roughly organized into three broad areas: the use of ML for very challenging cutting-edge problems in mathematics, the mathematical theory of ML, and the use of ML in automated proof assistants. All of these areas will be represented at the conference ""Mathematics and Machine Learning 2023.""

Variations on this theme are called ""Ramsey theorems"" after the groundbreaking work of Frank Ramsey in the early 20th century.  Ramsey theorems have been used most recently in computer science to design efficient algorithms on certain types of data sets.  This project concerns structural Ramsey theory, which uses tools from model theory to describe the objects under study.  Model theory is an area of foundations of mathematics that studies properties holding generally on large sets of mathematical objects, across different areas of mathematics.  This research project will extend the contribution of model theory to structural Ramsey theory.  Methods from saturated model theory, pseudofinite model theory, category theory, and topological dynamics will be applied to create new knowledge pathways across these different areas of mathematics.  This project will also provide increased training opportunities for students at California State University, San Bernardino.<br/><br/>This research project studies how certain maps between two infinite structures in possibly different first-order languages can transfer information about the automorphism groups of these structures and, ultimately, the Ramsey properties of the finitely-generated structures embeddable in these infinite structures.  In particular, this project studies a pair of maps between two infinite structures called a ""semi-retraction"" that induces a retraction of the type space of one structure onto the type space of the other.  This project also studies which Ramsey theorems transfer from a class of finite structures to ultraproducts of these finite structures.  This project will identify notions of tame partitions and investigate the classes of structures which have a Ramsey theorem for these tame partitions, but perhaps not in general.  Many test cases are available as a result of a confluence of recent results in the calculation of finite big Ramsey degrees. This work is anticipated to have applications in classification theory in model theory, as well as in topological dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most famous example is the Continuum Hypothesis, which states that any infinite subset of the real numbers is either countable or in a one-to-one correspondence with the whole set of real numbers. The technique known as forcing can be used to show that the Continuum Hypothesis is logically independent of the standard set of axioms for mathematics, known as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).  A major theme in modern set theory is development of relative consistency results and ZFC-strengthenings. ZFC-strengthenings are given by large cardinal hypotheses, which assert the existence of certain highly compact mathematical objects, called large cardinals, with strong reflection properties, that is, if a property holds at the large cardinal, it must hold at many cardinals below it. Assuming large cardinals exist, the method of forcing can be used to create various mathematical models.  This project analyzes these constructions, motivated by two complementary notions: what is mathematically necessary? what is mathematically sufficient? The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The main objectives of the project are analyzing what is possible from large cardinals and forcing, versus what constraints are imposed by ZFC. Forcing in the presence of large cardinals is the main tool to create models of ZFC and prove consistency results. In contrast to having large cardinals, Gödel's constructible universe L is the minimal class model of set theory. Two central questions are how much the universe resembles L, and how much compactness can be achieved by forcing. Compactness is the phenomenon where if a certain property holds for every smaller substructure of a given object, then it holds for the object itself. It follows from large cardinals, and often fails in L. Compactness is captured by some key combinatorial principles such as the tree property and its strengthenings. On the other hand, square properties are the canonical instance of incompactness and serve as a yardstick how close a model is to L. The project will focus on the interplay between these principles and forcing extensions constructed from large cardinals. The PI will also investigate how they interact with cardinal arithmetic and especially with singular combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many natural mathematical questions are independent of the usual mathematical axioms. The most famous example is the continuum hypothesis (CH), which is the statement that any infinite set of real numbers is either countable or has the same size as all the reals. This became Hilbert's First Problem. The first breakthrough was in 1940 by Kurt Godel, who showed that CH cannot be refuted by the standard mathematical axioms, known as ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice). Then in 1964 Paul Cohen invented the method of forcing and used it to show that the continuum hypothesis is actually independent of ZFC. In other words, neither CH, not its negation is a logical consequence of the ZFC axioms. Since Cohen's work, modern set theory investigates ZFC constraints (i.e. ""what is necessary"") versus relative consistency results obtained by forcing (i.e. ""what is possible""). Both questions are addressed by infinitary combinatorics, the study of infinite objects in mathematics. This study generates many projects and research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI will focus on using forcing and large cardinals to investigate properties of infinite objects. The main motivation is analyzing ZFC-constraints against consistency results. The project will center on analyzing combinatorial principles, such as the tree property, stationary reflection and square principles, and their relation to cardinal arithmetic, especially singular cardinal arithmetic. The tree property and stationary reflection are compactness type properties that follow from large cardinals. Compactness is the phenomenon where if a certain property holds for every smaller substructure of a given object, then it holds for the object itself. On the other hand, square properties are canonical instances of incompacntess that hold in Godel's constructible universe L and are at odds with large cardinals.

It provides methods of converting asymptotic questions about finite structures into qualitative questions about the shape, volume or dimension of certain limiting infinite objects. This method of study originated in questions on foundations of mathematics, but in recent years it has found important applications in the study of some central objects of classical mathematics and computer science. The project investigates further these connections, with the major motivation of extending the existing techniques from binary structures (graphs) to structures of higher arity (hypergraphs), which represent a mathematical way of describing more complex networks in which interactions happen not just between two nodes at a time, but between multiple nodes simultaneously. This study will both deepen and extend the scope for applications of the infinitary model-theoretic machinery to questions in combinatorics of geometrically or algebraically arising hypergraphs, and conversely for applications of combinatorics to open questions in model theory. The project will involve training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Shelah's classification program isolates combinatorial dividing lines (stability, distality, NIP, etc.) separating mathematical structures exhibiting various degrees of Gödelian behavior, from the tame ones in which one develops a ?geometric? theory akin to algebraic geometry for definable sets in such structures. These tameness notions in Shelah?s classification theory are typically given by restrictions on the combinatorial complexity of definable binary relations. Many of the central results in graph combinatorics can be then improved dramatically if one restricts to graphs on the tame side of this classification, in particular to graphs arising from various algebraic or geometric configurations. The PI will investigate a higher generalization of Shelah's classification theory, where the restriction is only put on higher arity relations, focusing on n-dependence (with the case n=1 corresponding to the well studied class of NIP structures), n-stability, n-distality, and n-amalgamation, as opposed to the traditional binary case n=1. This will be applied to questions in extremal combinatorics of hypergraphs definable in various tame structures (via Keisler measures), as well as to generalizations of the polynomial expansion phenomena (Elekes-Szabó type theorems), and to the study of algebraic structures such as groups and fields definable in n-tame theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our knowledge of mathematics comes through deduction from axioms. This knowledge is inherently incomplete, in the sense that there is a wide range of questions that can never be answered, either positively or negatively, from the standard axioms. Set theorists study these questions, to see how they relate to each other, and how they relate to a backbone of additional axioms, called large cardinal axioms, that assert strong reflection properties for very large sets. This project explores some of these questions through three interrelated aspects. The first involves a property of cardinal numbers that can be viewed as a remnant of a large cardinal axiom. This property has been studied since the 1970s, and work on it has been driving substantial developments in the area of consistency proofs. The second involves the interactions between combinatorial properties of the line of real numbers, and the size of the set of real numbers. In both these aspects, proofs that the relevant principles can hold use large cardinal axioms. The third aspect is to study the large cardinal axioms themselves, to develop specific models for these axioms, and to further strengthen the known connection between some of these axioms and properties of the line of real numbers. The overall purpose in all cases is to further our understanding of what is, and what is not, possible in the universe of mathematics. This project will support the development and training of graduate students in mathematical logic at UCLA.   In addition this project builds on previous work of the PI at the undergraduate level. The PI plans to help talented UCLA undergraduates acquire graduate level knowledge in mathematical logic, and continue to graduate studies.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>This project deals with three interrelated areas in set theory: (i) the tree property; (ii) consistency proofs with large continuum; and (iii) large cardinals and inner models, in the region of Woodin cardinals and of supercompact cardinals. In connection with (i), the project is particularly concerned with forcing the tree property at regular cardinals, above the first uncountable cardinal, in increasingly large intervals. The ultimate goal is to see whether the tree property on some of these cardinals can prevent the property from holding on other cardinals, or whether it is consistent that the tree property holds at all these cardinals. We are very far from an answer to this question, but there has been some impressive progress in recent years and this project seeks to build on this progress in order to push the boundaries further. In connection with (ii), the project is particularly concerned with some of the central structural consequences of the proper forcing axiom (PFA), for example Todorcevic's open coloring axiom and p-ideal dichotomy. This project seeks to determine whether these principles are consistent with large continuum, meaning larger than its size under PFA. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust framework of consistency results with large continuum, or determine actual mathematical obstacles for such frameworks. In connection with (iii), the project is particularly concerned with descriptive set theoretic applications of inner models theory at the level of Woodin cardinals, and with pushing the theory of inner models to the level of supercompact cardinals. The former should lead to solutions for some of the more intractable, still open, questions in descriptive set theory under determinacy. The latter should help with our understanding of a key level of the large cardinal hierarchy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topological groups and, in particular, the Polish groups that are the central object of attention of the proposal, appear throughout mathematics and very often in the form that groups were initially conceived by Galois 200 years ago, namely, as collections of symmetries of various mathematical objects. Whereas the groups themselves have no explicit concept of distance and therefore also no explicit geometry, the project is devoted to unveiling the implicit geometry that can be defined from their algebraic and topological structure. The mathematical problems proposed bring together ideas stemming from mathematical logic, analysis, and metric geometry, while at the same time their solution will develop a tool set applicable to other areas such as geometric topology. The project will also contribute to US workforce development, through the training of students and post-doctoral scholars, and to community building in the mathematical sciences through targeted conference and workshop organisation.<br/><br/>Apart from their topological and algebraic structure, topological groups carry well-defined large scale and small scale geometries in the form of canonical coarse and uniform structures that may or may not be instances of underlying large or small scale Lipschitz geometries on the group. Although this Lipschitziation problem is satisfyingly solved for large scale geometry, it remains largely open for small scale geometry. One facet of the proposal is exactly to make progress on this problem by constructing an appropriate Banach?Lie algebra for groups admitting small scale Lipschitz geometry and perhaps ultimately characterise them as closed subgroups of Banach?Lie groups. Other problems in the proposal concern liftings of bounded sets in Polish groups, non-commutative analogs of coarsely proper actions on locally compact spaces and new constructions of groups admitting coarsely proper and cocompact on said spaces. The project also aims to provide a better grasp of the large scale geometric implications of amenability by substituting proximity in L1-norm by proximity in Wasserstein distance and thereby connecting amenability with issues in optimal transport theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Homotopy type theory is a new field of Mathematics that draws on multiple disciplines, including logic, homotopy theory, category theory, and computer science. It is closely tied to the development of new computerized proof assistants that permit mathematical proofs to be constructed interactively and verified to be correct.  Student participants will learn about both the theory and practice of such computational tools, which are becoming increasingly important in the exact sciences.<br/><br/>Homotopy type theory is based on recently discovered connections between constructive type theory, homotopy theory, and higher category theory.  Martin-Löf?s dependent type theory is a formal system that underlies computerized proof assistants such as Lean, Coq, and Agda.  This system was recently shown to interpret into certain higher-categories originally developed for homotopy theory.  As a result, it can also be used for reasoning in higher mathematics.  Importantly, the proof assistants based on it can then be used to formally verify difficult results in these areas not previously attainable by such tools.  Extensions to the system suggested by the new applications also greatly extend the range of mathematics that can be developed and formalized using proof assistants.

A successful classification of these objects would be a simple list of properties, which are easy to observe, so that two objects which have the same properties will in fact be equivalent. A central aim of this project is to further develop the theory of ""Borel equivalence relations"". This is a field of study which provides a rigorous framework to analyze the complexity of various classification problems in mathematics and to determine when a successful classification is possible or not. This project will expand the theory, develop new methods, and apply these to study various classification problems in mathematics. The PI will work with undergraduate and graduate students, through teaching, directed reading, advising, and mentoring. The PI will also be involved in organizing conferences and seminars.<br/><br/>This project will develop and expand general techniques to determine when certain classifying invariants are possible for a given classification problem. The analysis of classifying invariants will be facilitated by various techniques coming from axiomatic set theory, including symmetric models of set theory and cardinal characteristics of the continuum. Specifically, the PI will further develop the relationship between symmetric models of set theory, in which the axiom of choice fails, and Borel equivalence relations which are ""classifiable by countable structures"". This relationship will be applied to settle several problems about such equivalence relations and to further analyze their structure up to Borel reductions and Borel homomorphisms. Furthermore, generalized frameworks of classifying invariants, beyond ""classification by countable structures"", will be studied. These allow for a meaningful investigation of the possible classifying invariants for classification problems which were previously considered unclassifiable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, mathematicians in these fields have come to realize that problems concerning algebraic, dynamical, and descriptive structural complexity of countable groups and equivalence relations can be fruitfully studied via descriptive combinatorial and graph theoretic means. The principal investigator and collaborators have employed this combinatorial perspective to create new tools used to answer several open problems in these fields. This research project aims to generate more new general tools and to promote fruitful interactions among these fields. This project involves training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The PI proposes to study problems around orbit equivalence relations, measure equivalence and quasi-isometry, amenability and inner amenability, cocycle superrigidity, treeability, weak equivalence, and rigidity and anti-rigidity for group actions by applying the perspective and insights of descriptive set theory and logic. The problems in the proposal are of interest to many fields, including descriptive set theory, measured group theory, geometric group theory, measurable combinatorics, ergodic theory, probability theory, and operator algebras. The PI and collaborators<br/>have already seized the first foothold toward a resolution to many of the proposed problems, and this project is likely to advance knowledge in these fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Model theorists aim to isolate certain combinatorial features enjoyed by definable sets in tame structures and to develop a general theory of structures satisfying these properties. This unifies and explains the tameness of a structure or family of structures, but also provides an engine for proving deep structure theorems by exploiting the combinatorial similarity of a structure under analysis to well-understood mathematical objects.  The model-theoretic notion of simplicity was a distillation of the tameness of sets definable in random graphs, pseudo-finite fields, and algebraically closed difference fields and has served as a key ingredient in applications of model theory to combinatorics and algebraic dynamics.  Simplicity was the first of the model-theoretic tree properties to be isolated and studied, but since then there have been a number of model-theoretic properties that have received intensive study, generalizing and deepening the achievements of simplicity theory.  The PI will continue to develop the theory of model-theoretic tree properties and pursue applications in algebra and combinatorics. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The simple theories were defined by Shelah as the class of theories without the tree property, a combinatorial property of a formula that he isolated in the study of independence in stable theories.  The first applications were set-theoretic, but the core tools of simplicity theory also led to a consolidation of the techniques at play in the analysis of concrete structures coming from algebra and combinatorics, most notably in the case of pseudo-finite fields and smoothly approximable structures built out of classical geometries over finite fields.  The development of the theory, then, sparked a two-way exchange between the theory and the examples, leading to refined understanding of core notions in model theory. The template established by simple theories, of a theory for class of theories defined by a combinatorial condition on trees of definable sets built on a theory of independence, was successfully replicated for a variety of dividing lines.  Moreover, this extension has revealed striking connections and applications to combinatorics, allowed for the analysis of core new algebraic examples, and led to the resolution of difficult open problems in model theory.  This project takes a systematic approach to model-theoretic tree properties, consolidating the core techniques to address both internal questions within model theory and applications to a diverse array of structures coming from algebra, geometry, and combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Distributed computing is the area of computer science that studies distributed systems, i.e., decentralized networks of computers that communicate with each other by passing messages. Distributed computing is especially relevant in the modern era of large networks, such as the Internet, where millions of machines are interconnected. On the other hand, descriptive set theory investigates the structure of subsets of the real line and other well-behaved spaces. It is used to understand the complexity of various sets defined by mathematical formulas and to classify them according to their complexity. Surprisingly, it turns out that these two areas are closely related, and that ideas and results from one can often be applied in the other. As this relationship has only recently been discovered, it is still poorly understood. This project will explore it in depth with the ultimate aim of developing a unified theory that integrates the two subjects. The educational component of this project is focused on creating opportunities for junior researchers to enter this rapidly developing field. Specifically, it will support training of graduate students and designing a suite of materials (textbooks and lecture notes, instructional videos, workshops, and courses) aimed at students and scholars with background in combinatorics or computer science but no prior exposure to descriptive set theory.<br/><br/>Known interactions between descriptive combinatorics and distributed computing take place in the framework of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, where the objective is to assign labels to the vertices of a given graph subject to some ""local"" constraints. Part of the project is to investigate the following general question: Given an LCL problem that can be solved with some degree of regularity (e.g., Borel, measurable, etc.) on Borel graphs, when can we find an efficient algorithm for this problem in some model of distributed computation? Currently, the answer is only known in a few special cases, and this project aims to extend it to a much wider context. Another goal of this project is to develop an effective classification of the complexity of LCL problems from the perspective of descriptive set theory and distributed computing, or to prove that such classification is impossible. Thirdly, this project will study specific problems of particular interest, such as graph coloring and perfect matchings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
