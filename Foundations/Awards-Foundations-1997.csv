In a past work, the investigator proved the strongest known theorem about true embedding partition relations. For every finite graph H and for every cardinal t there is a graph G ""arrowing"" H with t colors.  Recent results give some hope of extending this result to countable target graphs and developing a ""Nesetril-Rodl"" type Ramsey theory for partition relations with infinitely many classes.  The second direction is the investigation of polarized partition relations using a far reaching new method called ""double ramification"" developed jointly with Professor James Baumgartner of Dartmouth College.  The third direction is a continuation of a successful collaboration with Professor Peter Komjath of the Eotvos Lorand University of Budapest, Hungary.  Extensions of partition relations will be investigated- for the case in which noncomplete graphs are partitioned, a theory of simultaneous chromatic number of graphs and set systems will be developed.  Theqe will involve forcing methods and new proof techniques.  The fourth direction is a continuation of a long standing collaboration with Professor Istvan Juhasz of the Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.  Specific targets will be investigations of partitions destroying the topology of a space, and study of invariants of CCC structures.  Combinatorial problems and methods have proved to be a powerful tool in inspiring new developments in set theory, and new metamathematical methods have led to spectacular advances in set theory and its applications to set theoretical topology. The project plans to enhance this fruitful cooperation."

The first three problems are connected with extending and generalizing Shelah's dichotomy theorem.  Specifically, the PI proposes to study the possible types of branching that can occur in decomposition trees of models of classifiable theories, inherent limitations on extending Shelah's theorem to uncountable languages, and those theories whose models are characterized by systems of invariants involving finite subsets of the model.  The first of these problems emanated from the completion of the classification of the uncountable spectra of countable theories.  The last two problems deal with new methods of constructing models that are reminiscent of forcing constructions.  In work with Shelah, the PI defined  two new methods of constructing models of small, stable theories with a type of infinite multiplicity, one based on choosing realizations of the type with positive measure and the other based on choosing non-meager realizations.  Whereas the notions of measure and category typically go hand in hand throughout mathematics, there is an essential asymmetry between the notions in this context.  The final problem is to investigate the feasibility of obtaining an o-minimal expansion of the reals containing a function whose growth rate exceeds any exponential polynomial.  It seems possible that by using new results of Wilkie and Macintyre, such an expansion could be constructed in the manner of Cohen forcing.    As the term is used here, ""model theory"" is essentially the systematic study of algebraic structures.  A theory is simply a set of sentences and its class of models consists of the possible universes in which each of the sentences of the theory is true. It turns out that if one asks rather general questions about the class of models of a theory (such as the number of models of a certain size) the answer depends only on a small set of combinations of elements.  Tha t is, the number of models of a certain size is determined by which of these combinations are permitted by the theory and which are prohibited.  Much of the focus of this proposal is to better understand what these sets of combinations look like in various contexts.  The study of some of these sets of combinations has recently found applications in PAC learning theory and in the study of the expressive power of neural network architectures."

Some of the problems concerning o-minimality relate to expansions of archetypal o-minimal structures and structures whose domain has as its order type that of the real numbers. Others have as their focus groups definable in o-minimal structures or the development of o-minimal analogues of more sophisticated topological methods and tools. Problems having to do with extensions of o-minimality deal in particular with the notions of weak o-minimality and local o-minimality. A range of natural examples of weakly o-minimal structures is now known and there already is a significant body of results in the subject. It is hoped that local o-minimality may provide a suitable framework for developing some model theory for subanalytic sets. The research described above falls under the heading of model theory, one of the principal subfields of mathematical logic. Model theorists study  properties of familiar mathematical structures which can be described by a formal mathematical language such as predicate logic. The distinctive point of view of model theory can provide insights and understanding into such structures that otherwise might not be easily achieved. This project focuses on structures that include and behave in important respects like the ordered field of real numbers, that is, the real numbers together with the polynomial and algebraic functions that are studied in first-year calculus and describe many phenomena. This decade has witnessed significant advances in which model theory has played a crucial role.  The results obtained have deepened our understanding of familiar mathematical systems of interest in such diverse areas of the mathematical sciences as the analysis and geometry of real functions, neural nets, and relational database theory."

This has been a rapidly-developing area for the last several years, with many contributions from---and cooperation between---model theorists and analytic geometers. Miller hopes to build further interdisciplinary links by investigating possible connections and applications of o-minimality to control theory and variational calculus.   Many results of so-called classical mathematical analysis and geometry are very general; they apply to a wide variety of 'input', so one must expect to have to deal with a correspondingly wide variety of 'output'.  However, one could hope that if the input is, in some respect, particularly well behaved, then the output would be similarly well behaved.  This turns out to be true in many important cases, but to see this usually requires new, more constructive, proofs of classical results, as well as a deeper understanding of the 'good' properties of the input.  Before such projects can be begun, though, it is necessary to have some way of deciding which mathematical objects (inputs) should be considered as well behaved, and those which should be considered as troublesome. (This can be a difficult matter.) The theory of o-minimal structures on the real field, a sub-discipline of mathematical logic, has been developed in large part to deal with this issue. Recent years have seen rapid growth of the subject.  Applications and connections have been found in neural-net learning theory and theoretical economics, as well as several areas of pure mathematics."

This work is motivated by basic foundational questions, like understanding the nature of complete classification of mathematical objects up to some notion of equivalence by invariants, and creating a mathematical framework for measuring the complexity of such classification problems. This theory is developed within the context of descriptive set theory, which provides the basic underlying concepts and methods. On the other hand, in view of the broad scope of this theory, there are natural interactions with other areas of mathematics, such as the theory of topological and transformation groups, topological dynamics and ergodic theory, model theory, and recursion theory. One of the fundamental questions that arises in many fields of mathematics is that of classifying a given collection of objects that has been studied in this field. This amounts to providing a ""catalog"" or ""listing"" of these objects, in principle not unlike that of cataloging species in biology or stars and galaxies in astronomy. If such a classification is possible, one has a ""complete"" understanding of the mathematical structures involved.  Otherwise a more or less ""chaotic"" behavior is expected. It is thus very important to understand under what circumstances a classification is possible. This difficult foundational question is further complicated by the fact that what constitutes an acceptable classification is very much dependent on the particular field of mathematics studied, so the criteria for a ""good"" classification in one area might not be appropriate in another.  At its basic level, this project aims to develop a general quantitative theory, which in many situations can precisely measure the complexity of a classification problem and thus provide objective means by which one can decide,  in any given field, whether a satisfactory classification of the objects in question is possible. This is achieved by associating with each collection of objects to be studied an appropriate concept of ""magnitude"" or ""size"", which in a precise sense measures the difficulty of its classification problem. This new theory of ""size"" is investigated in this project."

Gabrielov proposes to continue research in two closely related areas: the theory of subanalytic sets, with applications to quantifier elimination and simplification problems, and the theory of Pfaffian functions (analytic functions satisfying systems of Pfaffian differential equations with polynomial coefficients), with applications to o-minimality and computational complexity.  The goal of this research is to find an effective estimate of complexity of the ``quantifier simplification'' for expressions with Pfaffian functions, i.e., replacing an expression with existential and universal quantifiers by an equivalent expression without universal quantifiers.  This includes estimates of the complexity of different operations with semi- and sub-Pfaffian sets, such as the frontier, closure, stratification, and resolution of singularities.    Modern computer algebra qystems allow one to perform on a computer many operations with algebraic equations and inequalities previously considered the domain of abstract algebraic geometry.  The results can be applied to such practical problems as visualisation, robotics, and coding theory.  The complexity of computer codes performing these operations becomes a practically important problem. This complexity usually grows quickly with the degree of polynomials.  A new approach to reduce computational complexity lies in the Pfaffian theory studying a class of non-algebraic functions with global finiteness properties similar to the properties of algebraic functions.  The complexity of a polynomial considered as a Pfaffian function depends only on the number of its non-zero monomials (or, more generally, on the complexity of a formula representing this polynomial) independent of its degree.  Exponential and trigonometric functions, and many special functions, are Pfaffian, too. Thus Pfaffian methods, when applicable, allow one to produce fast computer codes for computations with simple algebraic, exponential and trigonometric formulas, possibly of a high degree."

Classical affinoid rigid analytic geometry is based on rings of strictly convergent power series-power series convergent on products of ""closed"" discs.  The proposers have introduced new rings of power series convergent on products of ""closed"" and ""open"" discs.  These rings of separated power series share many of the desirable algebraic properties of the smaller rings of strictly convergent power series.  Lipshitz and Robinson propose to develop local and global rigid geometry over these rings, in analogy to the classical case.  This will represent an extension of the classical theory to the case of relative rigid geometry over ""open"" polydiscs.  On the model theory side, Lipshitz and Robinson propose to complete their development of the theory of rigid subanalytic sets based on the rings of separated power series by proving a Uniformization and a Singular Locus Theorem.  They also propose to continue their development of the theory of rigid subanalytic sets based on the rings of strictly convergent power series. The methods employed come from model theory, commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  The sets of points in real space defined by systems of equations and inequalities among analytic functions are called analytic sets.  The projection (i.e., the shadow) of such a set on a lower dimensional subspace is called subanalytic.  Real subanalytic sets arise in several branches of mathematics such as differential equations and geometry.  Similar classes of sets arise naturally, for example in number theory, over fields different from the real numbers, where the notion of distance has rather different properties.  These sets, however, share many of the nice properties of their real cousins.   Lipshitz, Robinson and their students will continue their investigation of the properties of these sets, using methods from mathematical logic, commutative algebra and algebraic geometry."

Marat Arslanov (Kazan State University) and Sergei Goncharov (Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk Branch) as well as Steffen Lempp (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Robert Soare (University of Chicago).  The proposed workshop (to be held jointly and at the same location as a workshop in complexity theory, organized by Profs. Razborov and Ablayev) is the first meeting of its kind, designed to allow close contact between approximately thirty Russian and thirty scientists from the U. S. and other Western countries.   Computability theory, the study of unsolvable problems in mathematics, is a well-established branch of mathematical logic, and is particularly strongly represented in the United States and Russia.  For obvious political reasons, interaction between the two countries in this area has been quite limited in the past.  Research interests have also developed in somewhat different directions within the field;  e. g., the emphasis in Russia is on applications of computability theory to algebra, whereas in the United States, classical computability theory is more dominant.  On the other hand, close connections between the various directions obviously exist, as is evidenced by the small amount of cooperative research already taking place.  While the political barriers have by now mostly disappeared, severe financial difficulties have proven to be almost as great an obstacle to mutual cooperation in the field.  It thus appears that the only way to organize a meeting including a large number of Russians is to organize one within Russia, cutting travel expenses for Russian participants and counting on the non-Russian participants to be able to raise travel funds more easily."

The ""pure"" mathematics topics include investigations into set theopy, topology, and measure theory.  The properties of the standard (Lebesgue) measure on the real numbers are well understood, but various generalizations of Lebesgue measure lead to interesting open questions.  The proposer plans further work on measure extension axioms, which involve extending Lebesgue measure to measure additional (non-measurable) sets of real numbers.  He also plans to consider measures on other topological spaces.  The ""pure"" AR topics include improving the technology for linked resolution and automatic lemma generation.  In addition, a number of topics involve integrating AR and mathematics by using AR to derive mathematical theorems.  In particular, it is proposed to continue work on algebraic systems such as quasigroups and loops; one specific project here is to find a structure theory for G-loops.  It is also proposed to work on single axioms for groups.  Besides these specific questions in algebra, it is planned to look at the general problem of transcribing machine-generated proofs into meaningful form.  Work is also proposed on verification systems, which are designed to use a computer to check the correctness of existing mathematics.   There are three distinct, but related, threads to this research.  The first thread involves the expansion of our knowledge of traditional pure mathematics, without any specific practical application in mind.  The other two involve automated peasoning (AR) tools.   AR allows the computer to derive logical conclusions from given knowledge.  This subject has been in existence since the 1960s, but it is only in recent years that the tools have become powerful enough to discover conclusions which could not have been discovered without human assistance.  The second thread involves a continuation of the proposer's work in impr oving the AR tools and using these tools to create new results in mathematics.  This is of interest not only for the mathematics itself, but because it demonstrates the power of the tools, which can then be applied to reasoning tasks in other areas of science and engineering, as well as to autonomous decision making by robotic agents.  The third thread involves verification systems; these systems do not discover new mathematics, but rather are used as an automated database to collect and verify existing mathematics.  One potential application to advanced mathematics is the use of the computer as a referee to validate new mathematical results.  On the more elementary level, these tools can provide an accessible intelligent database of mathematical knowledge, which can be accessed by users of mathematics.  The difference between this and traditional database methods in cataloging mathematics is that the computer has ""understood"" and verified the knowledge it has, so that the the knowledge may be accessed by idea or concept, rather than by keywords."

Recent work of the PI discusses versions that assert that in every collection of finite functions satisfying a certain coherence condition, some element has a very strong combinatorial property related to Ramsey theory.  He proposes to relate these examples to the fast growing numerical functions associated with the relevant large cardinal axioms.  In addition, he has discovered a family of transfer principles which establish a  new kind of formal relationship between finite set theory and transfinite set theory. In particular, he has shown that certain large cardinal axioms are equivalent to transfer principles asserting that any statement of a simple kind that is true about the functions on the natural numbers is true about the functions on the ordinals. The PI proposes to extend this work to stronger large cardinal axioms, and also to formulate and investigate related transfer principles from the hereditarily finite sets to arbitrary sets.  An independent statement is a mathematical assertion which cannot be proved true or false within the usual axioms for mathematics. The previously known independent statements have certain unsatisfactory features which make them very  atypical of normal everyday mathematical assertions. Friedman has discovered some examples which are much closer to normal mathematics in terms of both concreteness and naturality and proposes to continue the search for more concrete and natural examples. His examples also have the positive feature that the assertions can be proved using certain well studied new axioms for mathematics (so called large cardinal axioms), but not otherwise. The PI also has established an entirely new way in which these new axioms arise - they can be thought of as the natural extension of known facts in the context of the inte gers. He proposes to extend this new way of looking at these new axioms for mathematics to yet stronger new axioms for mathematics."

The notation systems lay bare a fundamental part of the structures for the corresponding set theories.   The proposed research is motivated by questions which arise naturally from Godel's incompleteness theorems. These theorems imply that no reasonable mathematical system is strong enough to provide solutions to all concrete mathematical problems, e.g., determining the existence of solutions in the natural numbers to polynomial equations or verifying the correctness of computer programs. There will always be questions whose solution will hinge on the discovery of new axioms- new axioms whose acceptance will be determined by intuition. The possible new axioms which have emerged all fall into the class of ""axioms of infinity"" which assert the existence of larger and larger nonconcrete mathematical objects. That axioms of this sort are the only new axioms amenable to our intuition seems possible, even probable. The ultimate goal of the proposed research would be to provide convincing answers to the following questions: 1. Can the notion of axiom of infinity be given a precise definition? 2. Can all meaningful concrete mathematical problems be resolved by axioms of infinity? 3. Which axioms of infinity are necessary for the solution of  meaningful concrete mathematical questions? While answers to these questions seem unlikely in the near future, especially for the first two, the successful completion of the program proposed here would be a significant step forward."

Results about the models help to find fragments of the language whose truth in the real number system (as defined by  Bishop) can be decided, and this fact is provable constructively, or in an  intuitionistic metatheory. Using the decidability results, the next step is to look for first order axioms for the decidable fragments of the constructive and/or intuitionistic theory of real closed ordered fields and to analyze the structure of elements and sets definable in  these  fragments. The work then would turn to the direction initiated by Scowcroft: towards the model-theoretic study of the relative strength of axiomatizations of a constructive first order theory of the reals.  Connections to recent developments about the decision procedure of S2S and to related game-theoretic approach to concurrent programming are to be  investigated, as well as the relationship between the theory of a Heyting algebra and the properties of the corresponding model for intuitionistic analysis.     In most cases computations involve real numbers. The proposal's aim is to look at the structure of reals - for instance, (maybe infinite) decimal fractions with addition and multiplication - from a constructive point of view. This means, for example, that it is not enough to show that a real number, or a function from reals to reals with particular properties exists, a method is required to find arbitrary approximations of the number or of the values of the function in question. The first step in this practical approach is to find constructive proofs that questions like ""is there a number/funct ion with such and such properties?"" can be answered. Then from the proof itself, if the answer is yes, one may obtain the method mentioned above. One way to approach this problem is by looking at various models of the constructive/intuitionistic theory of the reals, and this is the starting point of the present proposal. The results then help to find the method when there is such, and also to find the problems where in general there is no such method."

In recent years, methods developed in the context of stability theory have been used to analyze structures such as pseudo-finite fields, pseudo-algebraically closed fields, difference fields, and quadratic forms over finite fields. This research has yielded applications to arithmetic number theory (due largely to Hrushovski). Model-theorists now have a good understanding of how these dependence relations fit in a general framework. Buechler proposes to generalize techniques from the geometrical stability theory of superstable theories to this broader class. This research is likely to give insight into the model-theoretic properties of bilinear forms and groups definable in structures such as those mentioned above. Buechler also intends to set a more general framework for arguments based on ranks and dependence relations. Much of mathematics involves the classification of an abstract collection of objects in terms of concrete, well-understood objects. The classification of finite simple groups is one instance of this principle. Model theorists study classification results in an abstract setting, addressing questions such as: When can we prove that a classification theorem exists, even when the particular theorem is unknown? How can we tell when a particular classification theorem is the best possible result for a given collection of objects? When are two classification theorems special cases of a more general result? In the past twenty years model theorists have gone a long way towards answering these questions for collections of objects axiomatized in a relatively simple manner. While this research is carried out in abstract setting, it has spawned concrete results in differential algebra and arithmetic number theory. Buechler proposes to expand the mathematical context in which these results apply. He will also find a more abstract notion of classification theorem which encompasses several existing examples. This may lead to a greater understanding of results related to Fermat's Last Theorem."
