The focus of his project is the fine structure of determinacy and its metamathematical consequences concerning the Continuum Hypothesis.<br/><br/>     Is every infinite set of points in the line either countable, i.e., equinumerous with the integers, or else equinumerous with the set of all points in the line?  This is Cantor's continuum problem.  Modern set theory began 35 years ago with P.J.

In particular, the theory of the projective sets (the ``true'' axioms for second order number theory) is now arguably settled.  The nature of Cohen's proof is such that this success cannot be directly repeated for Cantor's continuum problem. Nevertheless, recent results indicate progress can be achieved, for these results suggest a key asymmetry concerning potential solutions to the continuum problem.

Is the class of finite algebras<br/>possessing a finite equational basis recursively enumerable?  Is the<br/>class of finite algebras generating a residually large variety<br/>recursively enumerable?  Additionally, he will work toward a complete<br/>determination of all finitely generated varieties that possess<br/>definable principal congruences.  Farley is working productively on a<br/>large variety of problems in duality theory and combinatorics of<br/>ordered sets.  Most significant is the conjecture that all perfect<br/>sequences of a chain-complete ordered set converge to the same<br/>``core,'' up to isomorphism, and, closely related, the conjecture that<br/>the fixed-point property is preserved under direct products of<br/>(unrestricted) ordered sets.

Universal algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with<br/>the unknown.  The old adage, that if it looks like an orange, smells<br/>like an orange, and tastes like an orange, then it IS an orange, does<br/>not apply.  One can have a collection of objects about which all we<br/>know is that one can add and multiply them like numbers, and that the<br/>``usual'' rules apply --- for instance, x+y always equals y+x --- but<br/>still not be dealing with numbers.

McKenzie will examine<br/>what one can say about this variety of systems if one just knows about<br/>A.  II.  The theory of ordered sets is a branch of mathematics that<br/>deals with, well, order: If one has a collection of objects, and it<br/>makes sense to ask, ``Is object P bigger than object Q?'' then one has<br/>an ordered set.  For instance, the collection N of natural numbers<br/>(1,2,3,4,...) is an ordered set.  Ordered sets can be added and<br/>multiplied like numbers --- N*N is the collection of pairs of points<br/>(a,b) where a and b are natural numbers.  A natural question to ask<br/>is: If P and Q are ordered sets with a particular property, does P*Q<br/>have this property?  Farley will address this question when the<br/>property is the ""fixed point property""; this is a difficult<br/>long-standing problem.  Farley and McKenzie will also attempt to solve<br/>a problem dealing with the exponentiation of ordered sets, a problem<br/>over 50 years old.<br/>***<br/>"

This project will attempt to address<br/>some of the combinatorial difficulties inherent in extending the<br/>current techniques for automorphisms to finite back-and-forth<br/>arguments.  This might help convert the invariant/automorphism<br/>technology into a definable/non-definable technology, thus producing<br/>possibly interesting definable sets.<br/>     A recursively enumerable set is a set whose members gain entry<br/>because a corresponding computation comes to a halt; thus the<br/>recursively enumerable sets are examples of a phenomenon described<br/>over time (at any given time one knows only the finite set of members<br/>whose computation has already halted) but whose actual nature is<br/>timeless (a potential member is either in or out---the computation<br/>either eventually halts or it never halts).

Finally, a small portion of the funds (about 10%)<br/>will enable the students to have permanent access to certain important<br/>reference books. Knight and her students are working on various aspects of<br/>computable structure theory. One student, Charles McCoy, has several results<br/>connecting definability with complexity. He is now trying to characterize<br/>in a mathematical way the linear orderings and Boolean algebras with the<br/>feature that between computable copies, there is always some isomorphism<br/>at level two in the arithmetic hierarchy. Another student, Andrew Arana,<br/>is beginning work on models of arithmetic and enumerations. Knight herself<br/>will concentrate on problems involving existence of computable copies of<br/>structures. In particular, she hopes to extend the partial results of<br/>Khisamiev on reduced Abelian p-groups with computable copies. She is<br/>interested in a question of Shore, on what statement could serve as a<br/>computable non-structure theorem. Knight has a side interest in systems<br/>theory. <br/> The area of computable structure, a new and arguably more suggestive<br/>term for what has long been known as recursion theory, has its roots in the<br/>discovery more than half a century ago of sets of integers for which no<br/>algorithm exists to decide if a particular integer is a member. Moreover,<br/>another old result (from the 1950's) established that there are incomparable<br/>sets of this type, i.e., two sets such that neither permits one to construct<br/>the other from it in a mechanical way. As a practical matter, one cares<br/>about the speed and efficiency of algorithms and not their mere existence.<br/>Nevertheless, understanding the inherent limits of algorithmic possibility<br/>is an important philosophical accomplishment and triumph of the human<br/>intellect, in a way the ultimate in self-knowledge.<br/>***"

These assertions involve<br/>sequential constructions of finite graphs and trees, where at each<br/>stage a feature of the construction is minimized. This is in some<br/>analogy with the so called ``greedy'' constructions in computer<br/>science. The assertions tell us that such constructions can be<br/>performed in such a way that the resulting object has strong and<br/>natural combinatorial properties related to Ramsey theory (a branch of<br/>combinatorics). These combinatorial statements are provable from<br/>certain large cardinal assumptions, but not from the usual axioms of<br/>mathematics. Results in this connection from prior NSF support were<br/>used as an integral part of an undergraduate course in the computer<br/>science department at UCSD. In addition, under prior NSF support,<br/>Friedman has discovered a new kind of elementary constraint on<br/>sequences from a finite alphabet. For each finite alphabet, there is a<br/>bound on the length of any sequence satisfying this constraint. In one<br/>letter, this longest length is 3. In two letters, this longest length<br/>is 11. In three or more letters, this longest length is demonstrably<br/>incomprehensibly enormous, and is closely connected to various topics<br/>in mathematical logic and combinatorics. These topics include fast<br/>growing functions, provably recursive functions, fragments of Peano<br/>arithmetic, and proof theoretic ordinals. This topic was explored by<br/>gifted high school students this past summer at the University of<br/>Chicago, where students came up with 11 for two letters. Friedman will<br/>continue his investigation of this and other related problems<br/>involving such simple constraints.

The general format will be to build<br/>each of the three-day conferences around four one-hour lectures by<br/>distinguished set theorists and to round out the program with shorter talks<br/>contributed by those attracted to the featured speakers. This strategy has<br/>been successful in the past---the series of conferences began in 1992---and<br/>participants are widely representative of set theoretic research across<br/>the U.S. and Canada, with increasing participation from countries<br/>overseas. Participation by younger mathematicians, by women, and by<br/>underrepresented minorities has been encouraged.
