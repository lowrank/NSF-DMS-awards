This applies especially in cases where these relations are Borel sets. Part of the planned research concerns the question ""Which cardinal characteristics are associated with Borel relations?""  For many characteristics the answer is known to be positive; for others it appears to be negative, but it isn't yet known to be negative for any particular characteristic.  The investigator hopes to close this gap by proving that certain specific characteristics are not associated with Borel relations.  A second aspect of the planned research concerns the sequential composition of relations, which occurs in many theorems and proofs about cardinal characteristics.  A priori, sequential compositions cannot be Borel relations, but the investigator intends to extend the theory of Borel relations, using tools from topos theory, so as to cover sequential composition.  The research also includes questions relating computability theory to cardinal characteristics.  Finally, the investigator also plans to study the use of the groupwise density number (a characteristic introduced some years ago by Laflamme and the investigator) in partition theorems.<br/><br/>Cardinal characteristics of the continuum constitute a significant area of contemporary research in set theory. Not only are they of interest for their own sake, but for the last two decades they have played a role in applications of set-theoretic methods to general topology.  More recently, there have been applications (including some due to the investigator) to other parts of mathematics, particularly algebra.  The investigator and graduate students will extend this theory in several directions.  One direction concerns connections with classical descriptive set theory, dealing with relatively easily definable relations involving real numbers.  A second direction connects this theory with recursion theory, the study of what is (and what is not) computable in principle.  A third direction establishes connections with combinatorial information about infinite sets and structures.<br/>"

A basic question in Foundations of Mathematics is: Which set-existence axioms are needed to prove specific theorems of core mathematics?  Here ``core mathematics'' comprises standard topics in analysis, algebra, topology/geometry, etc.  The investigator and his colleagues study this question in terms of Subsystems of Second Order Arithmetic, as exposited in the investigator's recently published research monograph of that title.  An extensive series of case studies reveals that (i) many core mathematical theorems are logically equivalent to the set-existence axioms needed to prove them, (ii) only a handful of set-existence axioms arise in this way, (iii) the corresponding subsystems are linearly ordered by logical implication.  This gives a far-reaching classification of hundreds of core mathematical theorems into a small number of classes, the classes being defined in terms of logical equivalence over a weak base system.  This ongoing classification project is known as Reverse Mathematics.  It has many implications for philosophically motivated foundational programs such as constructivism (Bishop), computable mathematics (Pour-El/Richards), finitistic reductionism (Hilbert), predicativism (Weyl/Feferman), and predicative reductionism.  The Reverse Mathematics classification project is also a rich source of challenging technical problems.  The investigator and his colleagues are pursuing several of these, with emphasis on analysis, geometry, and countable combinatorics.  A direction for the future is to weaken the base system, in order to greatly broaden the scope of the classification project, providing significant points of contact with other parts of mathematics such as number theory and computational complexity.<br/><br/>Foundations of Mathematics is the study of the most basic concepts and logical structure of mathematics, with an eye to the unity of human knowledge.  This line of research deals fruitfully with fundamental questions such as: What is the nature of mathematical proof?  What is the logical structure of mathematics?  What are the appropriate axioms for mathematics?  Foundations of Mathematics is a rich subject with a long history, going back to Aristotle and Euclid and continuing in the hands of outstanding modern figures such Frege, Russell, Hilbert, Turing, and G del.  The investigator and his colleagues continue in this foundational tradition by pursuing a far-reaching classification project known as Reverse Mathematics.  Specific mathematical theorems are classified according to the axioms needed to prove them.  This reveals a remarkably simple logical structure within mathematics.  The existence of such a structure has many profound implications.  The ongoing research contributes to clarification of the role of the infinite in mathematics, the nature of mathematical constructions, the role of impredicative definitions in mathematics, and related issues. <br/>"

Certain categories of such quotients exhibit a strong permanence property: a structure reducible to another  one is either very simple, or it inherits characteristic properties of the more complex structure. Via a theory of liftings previously developed by the investigator, this phenomenon is now well understood for some  classes of groups and Boolean algebras, in the contexts of both decriptive and combinatorial set theory. (The former corresponding to the situation in which we study only the simply definable sets of real numbers and the latter corresponding to the situation in which we accept the Axiom of Choice and study arbitrary sets of reals in an appropriate ambient theory.) The investigator plans to further this research into the realm of Borel equivalence relations induced by Polish group actions.  An example of an important problem that may yield to such a technique is an isolation of a simple basis for turbulent orbit equivalence relations. <br/><br/>Quotient of a mathematical structure is formed by identifying its elements that differ ""in an inessential way.""  Different applications require different understanding of what is ""inessential,"" and therefore single structure gives rise to a multitude of quotients with rather  diverse properties. Some of them are reducible to the original structure, but the resulting quotient is frequently, yet somewhat paradoxically, much more complex than the underlying space.   One of the goals of this project is in finding a simple basis for a  class of quotients corresponding to the new notion of  ""magnitude"" introduced in order to study difficulties of classification problems in mathematics and extensively studied during the last decade.  Basis is a set, typically small, of objects from a given class that  are ""critical"" in the sense that every object reduces one from the basis. Canonical objects consisting the basis are easier to understand than the arbitrary ""generic"" objects, yet the intrinsic properties of the latter are reflected in the former. Therefore the basic objects provide a paradigm for studying the whole class.   <br/>"

First, in collaboration with Hart and Hrushovski, the investigator is seeking to  determine the `fine structure' of models of classifiable theories. This amounts to determining the amount of flexibility one has in choosing a decomposition tree for a model of such a theory. Recently, Laskowski has discovered that any shallow, strictly stable theory that does not have the dimensional order property interprets an infinite group.  In collaboration with Shelah, Laskowski is seeking to understand the extent to which this group determines the dependence relation of dividing. Finally, in collaboration with Dolich, Laskowski is seeking to identify a class of theories that contains the simple theories, yet also a satisfactory notion of independence.   <br/><br/><br/>Model theory is concerned with the interplay between theories (i.e., sets of sentences in a very formal language) and the classes of algebraic structures (models) that satisfy these sentences.  Most of Laskowski's research to date concerns broad classes of theories, as opposed to concentrating on a specific theory or structure. Because of the breadth of the context, applications have been found in other areas of mathematics and in computer science, specifically in the analysis of structured data bases. These classes of theories are described in terms of the embeddability  or non-embeddability of certain configurations of elements  into models of the theory.  Laskowski is continuing to analyze three classes of theories.  In all three cases, the combinatorial assumptions on the class of theories imply that the models of such theories contain  some algebraic content.  The investigator is studying the extent to which this algebraic component determines the behavior of a model of the theory.    <br/>"

Some of the problems having to do with o-minimality relate to expansions of archetypal o-minimal structures and structures whose domain has as its order type that of the real numbers. Other have as their focus abelian groups definable in o-minimal structures or the development of o-minimal analogues of differential and algebraic topological methods and tools. Problems concerning extensions of o-minimality have to do in particular with weak o-minimality, local o-minimality, and, in analogy with Morley rank, the development of a model theory for ordered structures of finite rank. The third main topic of the project involves classes of finite structures with dimension and measure. This work has as its aim the development of a model theory for classes of finite structures that is in analogy with mainstream model theory for infinite structures. The results obtained to date and the examples that have been found suggest that there is much to be done.<br/><br/>The research outlined above concerns model theory, one of the principal subfields of mathematical logic. Model theorists study properties of familiar mathematical structures that can be expressed in a formal mathematical language such as predicate logic. This distinctive point of view can provide insights and understanding into such structures that otherwise might prove elusive. One aspect of this project focuses on structures that include and behave in important ways like the ordered field of real numbers, that is, the real numbers together with the polynomial and algebraic functions that are studied in first-year calculus and describe many phenomena. Model theory has played a key role in many of the significant advances that have been made in the last ten years. These have deepened our understanding of familiar mathematical systems in such diverse areas of the mathematical sciences as the analysis and geometry of real functions, neural nets, and relational database theory. Applications also have been made in economics. A second principal aspect of the project deals with classes of finite structures. Finite structures in general are central to computer science: any database can be construed as a finite structure in the sense in which they are studied in here, and a particular class of finite structures called finite fields are especially important in cryptology.<br/>"

All results stated below use large cardinal assumptions, and some such assumptions are necessary. One line of research for the funded project is the investigation of classes of objects with the same properties, so-called terminal classes. A typical result states that the Ramsey ultrafilters are a terminal class: roughly, they share all properties invariant under the Rudin-Keisler equivalence of filters. Open questions under investigation involve finding further such terminal classes, and more importantly, the quantification of theproliferation of such classes throughout mathematics. Another line of research pursued is the construction of models in which the behavior of cardinal invariants of the continuum is optimal. A typical result is that the Miller model is the optimal way of increasing the dominating number d: roughly, all projectively defined invariants which are consistently less than d, are less than d in this model. The dual result states that there is an optimal Pmax model in which the bounding number is small. Open problems involve finding further cardinal invariants which have canonical models associated with them.  More challenging is the investigation of the notion of duality mentioned above, and the investigation of the limits of the method of forcing with simply definable partial orders.<br/><br/>Set theorists have for a long time studied certain additional axioms for mathematics, called large cardinal axioms. While they are largely irrelevant for solving specific problems in most traditional fields of mathematics, they do have a strong influence on the methodology used. Typically the large cardinal axioms allow the mathematician to select an optimal approach to answering a question only by considering the syntactical form of the question. Frequently this information can serve to discover the core of a seemingly complex problem.  Three examples are in order.  As the first example, it has been known for twenty years that sets of reals with simple definitions are well behaved from the point of view of mathematical analysis. Second, the PI has identified several classes of objects in mathematical practice that are ""terminal"": all objects in such a class have the same properties. Such classes have great methodological significance, and the PI plans to isolate more of them. In still another development, the PI found that for certain mathematically important classes of theories, there is an optimal approach to answering the question of whether the theories contain no contradictions. Again, the PI continues to isolate further such classes. Generally, the funded project serves to show that such seemingly esoteric hypotheses as large cardinal axioms have direct impact on mathematical practice, thus promoting the interaction between logic, set theory and other branches of mathematics.<br/>"

The problem remains unsolved to this date, and while its solution may not have immediate applications to areas of science other than mathematics, the mathematical methods developed thus far in the attempt to understand the problem have already proved useful in the study of dynamical systems (which in turn is a major tool used in physics and engineering).

The long term goal of the project is to gain insight into  Diophantine (un)decidability of  Q and rings of algebraic integers of number fields.  The immediate goal is to study  Diophantine definability over some subrings of number fields and function fields.  In particular, if one thinks of the field as a ring where all the primes are allowed to occur in the ""denominators"" of the elements, then integers and rings of integral functions and numbers, where we understand the problem relatively well, can be considered as rings where no primes or only finitely many primes are allowed in the denominator.  Thus a natural intermediate step for the project is to understand what happens in the rings where infinitely many primes are allowed to appear in the denominator of the divisors of the elements.  These rings constitute the main focus of study by the Principal Investigator.  A related issue is the problem of defining of integrality at sets of primes using polynomial equations.  This problem has been solved for many fields for the case when the prime sets are finite.  However, even for the finite sets the question is open for the primes whose residue fields are algebraically closed.  The investigator also plans to study this problem with the goal of identifying situations where this kind of integrality is not definable in Diophantine terms.<br/><br/>In 1900, during an International Congress of  Mathematicians, a great German Mathematician David Hilbert presented a list of problems which had great influence on the development of Mathematics in the XX century and whose influnce is likely to extend to the XXI century.  The tenth problem on the list asked a question which, if rephrased in modern terms, can be stated as follows.  Is there a computer program which can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables has solutions in integers (whole numbers) ?  The answer turned out to be ""no"".  It took many years to obtain and it finally emerged in the late sixties in the work of Yurii Matyasevich building on results of Julia Robinson, Martin Davis and David Putnam.  There has been speculation that Hilbert did not expect this answer.  He hoped for an algorithm to ""solve"" all polynomial equations.  Such an algorithm would also solve all polynomial equations where the answers are allowed to be fractions.  The absence of the computer program for integer solutions left the question wide open for the case when we allow rational numbers (fractions) as solutions.  The answer to the question of what happens when we allow solutions to polynomial equations to be fractions is the long term goal of the project.  However, this problem currently seems too hard to approach directly.  As in many other situations in Mathematics, a gradual assault is probably necessary.  As a first step in our program we plan to move from integers to fractions in stages. If one thinks of rational numbers as a collection of numbers where any non-zero number is allowed in the denominator, and integers as a collection of numbers where no number is allowed in the denominator, one can visualize an intermediate step as a the study of collections of numbers where some but not all numbers are allowed in the denominator.  The investigator's immediate goal is to study such sets of numbers.  <br/><br/>Finally we should note that polynomial equations over rational numbers are present in virtually every part of Mathematics and its applications.  Thus understanding their logic properties is likely to shed light on many other problems.<br/><br/><br/>"

There are many interesting theorems about Shnirel'man density or lower density in additive number theory and a few interesting theorems about upper density or upper Banach density in combinatorial number theory. However, dealing with upper density or upper Banach density in additive number theory is still an uncharted area. One of the major untouched problems in this area is finding the growth and structure of sums of sets of positive upper density or positive upper Banach density. The principal investigator has been investigating the problem using nonstandard analysis and has obtained many interesting new results. The first part of the proposal describes a topological approach to the problem. Using U-topologies on a hyperfinite Loeb space, the principal investigator proves a powerful theorem in nonstandard analysis, which implies several new theorems in some standard mathematical fields including additive number theory. These theorems reveal a general phenomenon, which says that if two sets A and B are large in terms of ``measure'', then A plus B is not small in terms of ``order-topology''. The second part of the proposal describes a measure-theoretical approach. This approach allows one to derive a parallel theorem about upper Banach density to an existing theorem about Shnirel'man density or lower density in a very efficient way.<br/><br/>Additive number theory is classical and studies the properties of addition of natural numbers like 1,2,3,4... which people use every day. Nonstandard analysis is relatively new and more abstract. It adds infinitely large numbers into our number system. A non-expert may be surprised that the study of the elusive infinitely large numbers has an interesting impact on the study of ordinary numbers. The principal investigator has already achieved some success in this direction. By furthering his efforts, the principal investigator will contribute more innovative ideas and results to additive number theory.<br/>"

In many theories of enriched fields, for example differential, difference and valued D-fields, the definable sets are known to enjoy strong regularity properties, but in most cases the determination of the full induced structure on even one-dimensional sets has proved elusive. Scanlon seeks to determine this structure on minimal sets in differentially closed and difference closed fields and to resolve foundational issues for the theory of valued D-fields in preparation to study the fine structure of their definable sets. The main trichotomy theorem on Zariski geometries, or more exactly the locally modular versus non-orthogonal to an infinite field dichotomy for Zariski groups, implies finiteness and uniformity theorems for certain subgroups and subvarieties of algebraic groups. Scanlon exploits this connection, especially by studying extensions of the Drinfeld module analogue of the Manin-Mumford conjecture to higher dimensional T-modules and of the Tate-Voloch conjecture in the case of p-adically transcendental moduli. Scanlon searches for mathematically meaningful interpretations of the triviality of  certain definable sets in differential or difference fields by  concentrating on certain subsets of moduli spaces of Shimura  varieties definable in some difference closed fields. Scanlon  studies inverse problems in model theoretic algebra. Specifically, Scanlon addresses the questions of which fields are stable and  which fields are supersimple.  <br/><br/>Scanlon undertakes this project to exhibit how the  deep, though apparently abstract, theorems of stability theory  manifest themselves in concrete mathematical practice.  Some such phenomena have already been discovered.  Given the strength of these abstract theorems, a systematic search  to interpret them can only lead to strong uniformity results on the number and properties of solutions to algebraic,  differential, and difference equations not readily perceived from an elementary perspective.<br/>"
