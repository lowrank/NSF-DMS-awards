If<br/>there exists a proper class of Woodin cardinals then<br/>whether or not a given sentence is Omega-valid is itself<br/>generically invariant. There is a natural candidate<br/>of the notion of proof for Omega-logic and the Omega-Conjecture<br/>is simply the conjecture that if there is a proper class<br/>of Woodin cardinals then for any sentence, the sentence<br/>is Omega-provable if and only if it is Omega-valid.<br/>The significance of the Omega-Conjecture is<br/>that if it is true then one has a complete analysis of<br/>what can be achieved by forcing and moreover the set<br/>of Omega-valid sentences is definable in third order<br/>number theory. This places a limit on the possibilities<br/>for generic absoluteness.<br/><br/><br/>The Omega-Conjecture is also generically invariant and<br/>so it is unlikely to be independent is the same fashion<br/>that CH is. Therefore any refutation of the Omega-Conjecture <br/>must come from large cardinal axioms. The Omega-Conjecture <br/>holds in the current generation of inner models (extender models). <br/>The focus of the proposal is to investigate the possibility<br/>that some large cardinal hypothesis refutes the<br/>Omega-Conjecture by examining extender models for <br/>large cardinals beyond superstrong.<br/>These extender models differ from the current family<br/>in that long extenders are allowed on the sequence.<br/>Preliminary results have established several key points.<br/>First, for the standard generalization of extender models<br/>to the case of long extenders, comparison fails as soon as<br/>one reaches sequences of extenders for which the moving<br/>spaces problem arises (this problem was first identified by Steel).<br/>Nevertheless there is family of extender models <br/>which effectively exhaust all known large cardinal axioms and for these<br/>extender sequences the moving spaces problem does not arise <br/>(the sequences are suitably short). If comparison<br/>can be established for these models then Omega-Conjecture<br/>holds in these inner models. As a corollary one would obtain<br/>that no known large cardinal hypothesis can refute<br/>the Omega-Conjecture. Finally if a suitable iteration<br/>hypothesis holds in these inner models then assuming<br/>appropriate large cardinals in V (extendible cardinals)<br/>the Omega-Conjecture must hold in V. Finally if, as one<br/>might naturally expect, there are definable versions of these extender<br/>models then there are a number of truly profound corollaries.<br/>These include the following: if there is an extendible cardinal <br/>then HOD correctly computes the successor for a proper class <br/>of singular cardinals.<br/><br/>Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis is arguably the most famous<br/>unsolvable problem in Mathematics, it was the first problem<br/>on Hilbert's list of 23 problems from 1900. The Continuum Hypothesis<br/>simply asserts that any infinite collection of real numbers<br/>is either equinumerous with the integers or equinumerous<br/>with the collection of all real numbers.<br/><br/>Around 40 years ago this problem was shown to be formally<br/>unsolvable from the axioms of Set Theory. This seminal work<br/>of Cohen introduced a new technique to Set Theory, the <br/>method of forcing. However the fact that the Continuum Hypothesis<br/>is formally unsolvable does not necessarily imply that<br/>it cannot be solved. Indeed the experience in Set Theory<br/>over the last 40 years has demonstrated that some questions<br/>which are formally unsolvable can be answered. But the<br/>precise methodology used in these cases cannot work<br/>for the problem of the Continuum Hypothesis.<br/><br/>The Omega-Conjecture (proposed around 10 years ago) arises<br/>naturally from an abstract analysis of the method of forcing<br/>but in the context of so called large cardinal axioms. If<br/>the Omega-Conjecture is true then there is an argument, or at<br/>least strong evidence, that the Continuum Hypothesis is false. <br/>But independent of this, whether or not the Omega-Conjecture <br/>is true has profound consequences for the foundations of Set Theory. <br/><br/>Cohen's method of forcing cannot be used to establish that<br/>the Omega-Conjecture is unsolvable so it is reasonable to<br/>expect that whether or not the Omega-Conjecture is true<br/>can be resolved. Any refutation of the Omega-Conjecture<br/>must come from large cardinal axioms. This research project<br/>concerns trying to prove the Omega-Conjecture by a detailed<br/>analysis of the hierarchy of large cardinal axioms. Preliminary<br/>results have been obtained which offer strong evidence for<br/>plausibility of this approach.<br/><br/>"

Solomon proposes to study several questions concerning the members of<br/>these and other classes of algebraic structures.   Do the members of a <br/>given class display the most general forms of ineffectiveness found in <br/>computable algebra?  Are instances of ineffectiveness caused by the <br/>coding methods (and hence can be removed by a reasonable coding) or by <br/>some inherent property of the underlying algebra (and are therefore <br/>unavoidable)?  How does adding structure (such as an ordering) to the <br/>members of a class effect the computational properties?  These <br/>questions aim toward a deeper understanding of the connection between <br/>computation and algebraic behavior in mathematics.   <br/> <br/><br/>Many theorems in mathematics state that given certain conditions, a <br/>particular mathematical object must exist.  There are numerous ways to <br/>study the effectiveness of such a theorem.  One method, called <br/>computable or recursive mathematics, uses an idealized model of a <br/>computer in which computations are allowed to run for arbitrarily long <br/>(but finite) amounts of time and to use arbitrarily large (but finite) <br/>amounts of memory.  The fundamental question is whether such an <br/>idealized computer can construct the desired mathematical object from <br/>the theorem.  If the answer to this question is no, then the theorem <br/>uses a method of construction that cannot be performed on an actual <br/>computer no matter how much technology increases computer speed and <br/>memory size.  Because this question requires that mathematical objects <br/>be coded into the binary language of computers, the answer sometimes  <br/>depends on the type of coding used.  Solomon proposes to study a number <br/>of algebraic constructions from this point of view and in particular to <br/>study when ineffectiveness is caused by a poor choice of coding (and <br/>hence can be fixed by a better choice of coding) and when it is caused <br/>by inherent conflicts between mathematical structure and computation <br/>(and hence cannot be removed by clever coding).  Solomon also proposes <br/>to use a second method, called reverse mathematics, to study the <br/>effectiveness of numerous mathematical theorems.  In this approach, one <br/>isolates the mathematical axioms required to prove the theorem.  <br/>Reverse mathematics and computable mathematics are closely related.  If <br/>only simple axioms are required to prove a theorem, then it is likely <br/>that a computer can carry out the construction, while if complicated <br/>axioms are required, then a computer probably cannot perform the <br/>construction.<br/>"

For<br/>example, it is not known if it is consistent that a space which is<br/>Frechet-Urysohn for finite sets must be first-countable.  Settling this<br/>question is likely to lead to a solution of Malychin's well-known problem<br/>whether it is consistent that separable Frechet-Urysohn topological groups<br/>must be metrizable.  Two other themes of this proposal involve function<br/>spaces with the compact-open topology.  Settling one of them would solve a<br/>40 year old problem of J.

Finally,<br/>there have been a number of recent advances on the D-space property, a<br/>property with interesting but not well-understood relationships with<br/>covering properties, which indicate that the time may be ripe for settling<br/>the D-space questions of van Douwen that have stumped researchers for more<br/>than 20 years. <br/><br/>Set theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines,<br/>with common historical roots, and they serve as essential tools in many<br/>areas of mathematics.  General topology provides a framework for the study<br/>of shapes, from ordinary shapes in real three-dimensional space to much<br/>more abstract shapes and structures.

A possible solution to<br/>this problem will certainly involve descriptive set theory of<br/>Polish groups. However, it is also likely to rely heavily, on the<br/>one hand, on set theoretic assumptions (like the Continuum<br/>Hypothesis) and, on the other hand, on algebraic properties of the<br/>underlying group (amenability, freeness).

In<br/>another part of the project, Solecki will apply methods developed<br/>first in set theory (in the study of Borel equivalence relations)<br/>to problems in topology and model theory. First, he will use<br/>descriptive set theoretic techniques augmented by tools coming<br/>from model theory to investigate the structure of an important<br/>topological space---the pseudo-arc.

The analytic geometry of closed balls over an algebraically<br/>closed valued field, termed affinoid rigid analytic geometry, was developed<br/>in the 1960s and 70s by Tate, Remmert and others. Lipshitz and Robinson have<br/>previously extended affinoid geometry to the setting, which they term<br/>quasi-affinoid, of relative affinoid geometry over an open ball. They<br/>applied that theory to prove rigid analytic quantifier elimination and<br/>quantifier simplification theorems that yield precise information about the<br/>structure of sets definable by rigid analytic functions and their images.<br/>They propose to continue this investigation. In particular, a central<br/>remaining question is whether there is a quantifier elimination theorem in<br/>the affinoid rigid analytic category. They also propose to continue their<br/>recently-begun collaboration with Raf Cluckers into uniform cell<br/>decomposition theorems for (equicharacteristic zero) valued fields with<br/>analytic  structure, extending the uniform algebraic cell decomposition of<br/>Pas to the case of (equicharacteristic zero) valued fields with analytic<br/>structure. In the discretely valued cases, the analytic  structure is<br/>provided by affinoid power series and in the non-discretely valued case by<br/>quasi-affinoid power series.  Key is a generalization of the classical<br/>Mittag-Leffler decomposition to 'analytic' functions on a generalized<br/>annulus with coefficients in a valued field with analytic structure that is<br/>not necessarily complete or algebraically closed. Pas's algebraic cell<br/>decomposition theorem gives results uniform in the prime p about the<br/>rationality of p-adic zeta-functions. This investigation will extend that<br/>theory to the analytic category and will also have applications to motivic<br/>integration. The methods to be used in the investigation come from model<br/>theory, rigid analytic function theory, commutative algebra and algebraic<br/>geometry.<br/><br/><br/>The Archimedean property of the real numbers is the fact that any two<br/>nonzero real numbers are commensurate; that is, there is an integer multiple<br/>of the first the magnitude of which exceeds the magnitude of the other.  In<br/>various branches of mathematics, e.g., number theory and algebraic geometry,<br/>non-Archimedean fields arise. These are fields with a notion of magnitude<br/>that does not satisfy the Archimedean property: the magnitude of a sum of<br/>elements is no larger than the largest term of the sum. A natural example of<br/>such a field is the field of Laurent series (power series in one variable<br/>with at most finitely many negative exponents) with coefficients in a field<br/>K. The nonzero elements of the coefficient field all have unit magnitude,<br/>and the magnitude of the variable is considered to be small (1/2, say.)<br/>Power series satisfy the implicit function theorem, a central property<br/>linking the magnitude and the algebraic structure. Other non-Archimedean<br/>fields satisfy Hensel's Lemma, a generalization of the implicit function<br/>theorem. A great deal of the algebraic structure of such fields is coded in<br/>the structures of the residue field (the ring of elements of unit magnitude<br/>modulo the ideal of smaller elements; in the example, K) and the value group<br/>(the set of magnitudes that occur; in the example, all integer powers of 2.)<br/>Definable subsets over such fields can often be decomposed into finitely<br/>many particularly simple pieces, called cells. This decomposition is very<br/>useful in the evaluation of various integrals that arise in number-theoretic<br/>and geometric contexts. Lipshitz and Robinson propose to extend<br/>non-Archimedean cell decomposition results and applications, which are known<br/>in the algebraic category, to the analytic category; i.e. to non-Archimedean<br/>fields satisfying Hensel's Lemma on which, in addition to the polynomial<br/>functions, a natural class of analytic functions is defined.<br/>"

Moore<br/><br/>The proposed research concerns applying new techniques in set<br/>theory and infinite combinatorics to basis problems in topology,<br/>graph theory, and order theory.  In each case, the goal is to<br/>prove a classification theorem for the uncountable objects in a<br/>certain category.  Three such categories are topological spaces,<br/>bipartite graphs, and linear orders.  The goal is to use forcing<br/>axioms to prove that the category has a finite basis of classical<br/>examples. The techniques employed in analyzing such problems are<br/>often Ramsey theoretic and frequently draw upon results and<br/>motivation which arise in analyzing Cantor's continuum problem<br/>and Suslin's classification problem for the real line.  The<br/>proposed research seeks to expand our understanding of forcing<br/>axioms and their impact upon basis problems and the continuum<br/>problem.  The PI has already proved that the Proper Forcing Axiom<br/>implies that the uncountable linear orders have a five element<br/>basis, answering one of the central problems of the proposal.<br/>The proof involved new techniques in infinite combinatorics which<br/>are likely relevant to completing the rest of the proposal.  At<br/>the crux is the PI's notion of set mapping reflection which was<br/>formulated in relation to his results on the Proper Forcing Axiom<br/>and the size of the continuum.  Conspicuous in the solution is<br/>the need for a strong axiom of infinity to obtain the consistency<br/>of a five element basis.  This was quite unexpected and may serve<br/>both to explain past difficulties and fuel future research on the<br/>relationship between very large sets and combinatorics associated<br/>with the smallest uncountable cardinal.<br/><br/>The proposed research represents an analysis of fundamental<br/>mathematical objects - graphs, orders, and topologies - using a<br/>generalized version of the probabilistic method which Paul Erdos<br/>pioneered in his study of networks, packings, prime numbers, and<br/>circuit complexity.  The apothegm of the probabilistic method is:<br/>""If an object occurs with positive probability, it exists.""  For<br/>finite probability spaces, this is a fact.  For infinite spaces<br/>and their generalizations - known as forcing notions - it<br/>requires additional axiomatic assumptions - known as forcing<br/>axioms.  The PI has recently shown, for instance, under such<br/>assumptions that any linear order which cannot be represented as<br/>a collection of rational numbers must contain one of five<br/>critical orders.  While at the present this would seem to<br/>represent a theoretical accomplishment with little practical<br/>significance, the style of argument may inspire real world<br/>applications in the future.  A recent example of such a success<br/>in set theory is Laver's algorithm for comparing braids.  An<br/>important question which arises in a number of areas of<br/>mathematics and science - from particle physics to genetics - is<br/>when two braids can be made to look the same without cutting or<br/>breaking the strands.  Laver used ideas from the theory of large<br/>infinite sets to devise a fast algorithm for comparing braids.<br/>The previous algorithm was exponentially slow.  Current<br/>algorithms based on Laver's idea run in quadratic time (fast).<br/>Hence the study of infinite sets can provide practical<br/>applications to much more down to earth objects.  The proposed<br/>research may some day have applications in the traditional<br/>finitary probabilistic method or less foreseeable impact as with<br/>with Laver's work.<br/>"

Meeks, University of Massachusetts (Amherst)<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Proposed Research Project Abstract<br/><br/>In this proposal the researcher will study the geometry, asymptotic<br/>behavior, conformal structure and topology of properly embedded<br/>minimal surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space.  One of the main<br/>goals of the proposal is to classify all of the properly embedded minimal <br/>surfaces which can be parametrized by domains in the Euclidean plane and<br/>to describe the asymptotic geometry of all finite genus examples.<br/>Related theoretical techniques concerning compactness, regularity and<br/>convergence of minimal surfaces of locally bounded genus will be<br/>investigated as well.  One hoped for application of this research is<br/>to classify all smooth finite group actions on the three-dimensional<br/>sphere.  As an outgrowth of his recent joint manuscript with Charles<br/>Frohman on the topological classification for minimal surfaces, the<br/>researcher proposes to prove that Bryant surfaces in hyperbolic <br/>three-space are unknotted.<br/><br/>Classical minimal surface theory has its roots in 18-th and 19-th<br/>century mathematics. Minimal surfaces are the first<br/>important examples of what is called the calculus of variations, first<br/>described by Euler around 1735.  Physically minimal surfaces can be<br/>modeled locally as soap films on wires or by surfaces of least-area <br/>relative to their local boundaries.  Minimal surfaces play an important<br/>role as a tool in the study of three-dimensional topology and<br/>Riemannian geometry. The subject of minimal surfaces has a broad impact in mathematics and<br/>physical sciences.  Minimal surfaces are stationary fluid interfaces,so<br/>their shapes arise in many physical problems.  The work in this<br/>proposal would classify the possible physical shapes which could occur<br/>as infinite interfaces.  Many of the known examples of minimal surfaces<br/>are observed physically, so it is of interest to have a rigorous<br/>theorem which predicts the shapes which can occur.<br/>The research proposed here strongly impacts the area of classical<br/>differential geometry of surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean<br/>space.  As is well known to geometers, minimal surface theory has been<br/>and continues to be one of the principal tools for proving theorems in<br/>general relativity and three-dimensional topology.  One well-known<br/>such application is Schoen and Yau's proof of the Positive Mass<br/>Conjecture.  Recent work of Gabai on the Generalized Smale Conjecture<br/>shows the continued importance of minimal surfaces in<br/>three-dimensional topology. Most of the research proposed here is related to and<br/>motivated by the hope that it will lead to a positive solution of the<br/>Pitts-Rubenstein Conjecture and to the classification of<br/>three-manifolds with finite fundamental group.  This hoped for<br/>topological application to one of the outstanding classification<br/>problems in mathematics has its roots in previous joint research by<br/>the researcher, Peter Scott, Charles Frohman and S. T. Yau.  In part<br/>because of the important connections with other areas of mathematics<br/>and the ease in which it is possible to make computer graphics<br/>pictures of beautiful classical examples, minimal surfaces continue to<br/>be one of the principal topics for popular science articles and public<br/>science exhibits.  Thus, indirectly, the exciting research problems<br/>outlined in this proposal help bring many young scientists and<br/>mathematicians to the frontiers of research. <br/><br/>"

Many important problems in complex and algebraic<br/>geometry concern the construction of holomorphic objects such as<br/>holomorphic sections of line bundles or maps between spaces.  It often<br/>happens that the construction problem simplifies as the degree of the<br/>line bundles or maps increases.  A classical example is the Kodaira<br/>embedding theorem, which says that there are enough sections of a high<br/>power of a positive line bundle to embed a Kahler manifold into<br/>projective space. Asymptotic results in general concern the properties<br/>of maps or sections of very high degree, where constructions often<br/>simplify. Effective results ask for the smallest power or degree where <br/>a desired effect takes place, e.g. the smallest power of a line bundle <br/>so that sections embed.  Many such results will be surveyed in our<br/>conference, with techniques ranging from partial differential equations<br/>to geometric and algebraic methods.<br/><br/>Our conference consists of seven days of lectures, with six to eight<br/>lectures a day. There will be lectures surveying past results and others which present new results.  The topics include complexity of<br/>zero-finding algorithms, moduli spaces, holomorphic maps, ground states<br/>of superconductors, and the vacuum selection problem in string theory.<br/>The lectures will expose the field to graduate students, postdoctoral<br/>researchers and junior faculty members, as well as to senior<br/>mathematicians.  Two graduate students and at least five postdocs are<br/>giving lectures.  A significant portion of our funding will go towards<br/>paying travel expenses of graduate students, young mathematicians and<br/>members of under-represented groups.<br/><br/>"

More specifically, we concentrate on issues of existential/Diophantine definability that have evolved from the solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem.  The main open problems in the area concern the existential decidability of rational numbers and rings of algebraic integers of number fields.  New methods involving elliptic curves have shown promise in making these problems more approachable.  We also investigate existential definability over function fields.  In the case of function fields of characteristic 0 we also look at first-order definability problems since the corresponding existential definability problems seem out of reach at the moment.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>The interest in the questions of Diophantine definability and decidability dates back to the time of the solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem (HTP).  At the beginning of the XX century Hilbert asked the following question (among others): is there an algorithm that can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables and with integer coefficients has integer solutions? In the early 1970's, Yurii Matijasevich, building on the work by Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson showed that Diophantine sets and computably enumerable sets of integers were the same and thus showed that an algorithm sought by Hilbert did not exist. Matijasevich's result immediately raised another question which proved to be even more vexing: is there an algorithm as described above but for the solutions in rational numbers?  This problem is unsolved to this day. As is often the case with difficult problems in Mathematics, HTP for rational numbers as well as its sister problem, HTP for the rings of integers of number fields, generated many new questions, quite interesting on their own, which the author of this proposal plans to investigate.  Some of these questions turned out to be questions of Number Theory or Algebraic Geometry, but they in turn generated quite interesting consequences in Logic.  The expectations are that questions originating in HTP will generate many new areas of interaction between Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry and Logic.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>"

One very well known and central problem in this area is<br/>whether the Proper Forcing Axiom is equiconsistent with the existence of a<br/>supercompact cardinal. A solution to this problem is probably still far<br/>off, but Steel has recently made some progress using the powerful and<br/>flexible ``core model induction"" method. He intends to pursue and develop<br/>this method further, as it applies to the Proper Forcing Axiom, and in<br/>several other contexts as well. This program leads naturally to a number<br/>of questions concerning the relationship between canonical inner models<br/>with Woodin cardinals and the derived models of the Axiom of Determinacy<br/>which are associated to them. Steel has some results on this connection,<br/>and plans to investigate the area further.<br/><br/><br/>    Much of set theory is motivated by the simple question<br/>``What are the proper axioms for mathematics?"".<br/>Mathematicians<br/>prove things for a living; what should they take as their<br/>common assumptions in these proofs? In the period 1905-1927, Russell,<br/>Zermelo, Fraenkel, and Skolem<br/>isolated an elegant list of basic statements about sets, expressed<br/>in the language of set theory, and showed that from these axioms<br/>one could derive all of the mathematics of the time. This system of<br/>axioms is now known as Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with Choice,<br/>or ZFC. While there is still no hint of a mathematical statement which<br/>cannot be expressed in the language of set theory, we have<br/>discovered that  ZFC is incomplete in important ways. A<br/>surprising number of quite basic questions about sets in general<br/>are not decided by the axioms of ZFC; moreover, many of the<br/>more abstract questions of analysis, algebra, and topology are<br/>similarly left undecided. This leads to Godel's Program, first formulated<br/>by Kurt Godel in the late 1940's:<br/>Decide<br/>mathematically interesting questions<br/>which are independent of ZFC in well-justified extensions of<br/>ZFC. There have been great successes in this direction obtained<br/>by adding ``large cardinal hypotheses"" to ZFC.<br/>Such hypotheses<br/>assert the existence of sets whose  cardinality, or size, is<br/>inaccessible from below in ever stronger senses. Possibly our deepest<br/>understanding of large cardinal hypotheses<br/>comes from the inner model program. This program attempts to<br/>associate to each large cardinal hypothesis H a canonical minimal<br/>universe of sets (or ``inner model"") in which H is true. The stronger<br/>H is, the largere this universe must be.<br/>The inner models<br/>we have so far constructed have internal structures which<br/>admit a systematic, detailed analysis, a  ``fine structure theory""<br/>which  gives us a very good idea as to what these universes<br/>look like. Inner models are  crucial in several<br/>basic uses of large cardinal hypotheses to settle questions<br/>left undecided by ZFC. Steel will focus his efforts on furthering<br/>the inner model program.<br/><br/><br/>"

In developing model<br/>theory of o-minimal structures the principal investigator is planning to use<br/>differential-geometric techniques. In turn the principal investigator hopes<br/>to apply model-theoretic techniques to questions in complex and real<br/>analytic geometries. Model theory of compact complex manifolds has had<br/>remarkable success in the recent years and the proposer plans, among the<br/>other things, to extend these advances, using methods developed by him and<br/>his collaborators. <br/><br/>The proposal is in in a branch of mathematical logic called model theory.<br/>Model theory studies mathematical structures by considering the first-order<br/>sentences true in those structures, and the family of alternate structures<br/>that also satisfy all of those first-order sentences. (Sentences in logic<br/>are built out of a small repertoire of elements and constructions.<br/>""First-order"" refers to the number of quantifiers in a sentence, a measure<br/>of complexity.) In many cases these alternative structures illuminate some<br/>properties of the original mathematical objects. <br/>A good example is the non-standard analysis. A part of this proposal is an<br/>extension on ideas of non-standard analysis to complex-analytic functions. <br/>"

Many of these<br/>issues complement a new theory of the infinite developed by W. <br/>Hugh Woodin called Omega-logic. By now it is a well established<br/>theme in set theory that large cardinals impose certain forms of<br/>canonicity and absoluteness on the universe of sets. In<br/>particular, the existence of certain large cardinals implies that<br/>the theories of certain definable inner models of the universe are<br/>invariant under forcing. Furthermore, these large cardinals also<br/>tend to give rise to a detailed structure theory for these inner<br/>models.   The prototypical results of this type are results of<br/>Woodin, building on work of Foreman, Magidor, Shelah, Martin and<br/>Steel, showing that a proper class of Woodin cardinals implies<br/>that the theory of the least inner model of set theory containing<br/>the reals and the ordinals (L(R)) cannot be changed by set<br/>forcing, and that this fixed theory includes the Axiom of<br/>Determinacy. One natural program in the wake of these results is<br/>to identify and study larger models for which similar results<br/>hold. Another direction, noting that the Axiom of Determinacy<br/>contradicts the Axiom of Choice, is to find similar forms of<br/>absoluteness compatible with AC. One way of doing this is to<br/>consider statements to the effect that the universe of sets is<br/>closed under certain forcing operations. Such statements are<br/>typically called forcing axioms. Another approach is to consider<br/>forcing extensions of these inner models of determinacy. One major<br/>advance in this direction is Woodin's forcing Pmax. Heuristically,<br/>every natural question about the subsets of the first uncountable<br/>cardinal should have an answer in the Pmax extension of L(R).<br/>Nonetheless, there are several important questions about the Pmax<br/>extension which remain open. Some of these questions concern the<br/>properties of the nonstationary ideal on the first uncountable<br/>cardinal. One goal in pursuing these questions is to develop a<br/>finer analysis of the Pmax extension. In the other direction there<br/>is the issue of whether results obtained by Pmax can be obtained<br/>by other methods. Furthermore, the Pmax method has a number of<br/>variations, some of which have found application in topology.<br/><br/>Cohen's method of forcing is a way of taking models of the<br/>mathematical universe and producing larger, often very different<br/>models. We intend to study properties of the first two uncountable<br/>cardinals as realized by the forcing method in the context of the<br/>regularity imposed by assuming the existence of large infinite<br/>objects (large cardinals) and certain regularity properties for<br/>set of real numbers (determinacy), and the applications of these<br/>models to other areas, especially topology.
