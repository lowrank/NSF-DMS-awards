In addition to applying set-theoretic ideas to this branch of algebra, he is looking for new set-theoretic concepts and results motivated by algebraic problems.  He is exploring the connection between universal algebra (in Lawvere's category-theoretic formulation), the theory of classifying topoi, and the theory of unification (which plays a prominent role in some areas of computer science).  The connection is already understood in the case of absolutely free algebras, but further exploration is needed in the more general case of algebras subject to nontrivial identities.  Unification in the presence of identities is in general a troublesome topic, and it is hoped that the connection with other, better understood areas can clarify it.  The proposer is also studying a topos-theoretic approach to extending the notion of Borel functions to higher types.  Such an extension is useful for the theory of cardinal characteristics of the continuum.<br/>Borel functions at the base type (real numbers) already play a major role in this theory, but so does an operation of sequential composition that necessarily leads to higher types.  The proposer is also studying several questions at the border between constructive logic, category theory, and game semantics.  This research includes an attempt to amplify the connection between games and free (or co-free) bicomplete categories, axiomatization of game-semantical validity, and a game-theoretic principle that may be fruitfully added to intuitionistic logic.  Finally, the proposer is studying several questions in set theory, most of which are connected with ultrafilters and in particular with the equivalence relation of near coherence on ultrafilters.  There are also some questions in infinite combinatorics growing out of considerations in abelian group theory.<br/>  The project builds on the proposer's past experience in several areas of mathematics --- set theory, category theory (especially topos theory), abelian group theory, game semantics, constructive mathematics, and computer science --- in order to address problems bridging these areas.  Almost all of the topics in the proposal connect two or more of these areas.  In each case, it is reasonable to expect that ideas and styles of reasoning from one area can benefit other areas.  Among the potential outcomes of this research are: (1) a better understanding of unification, which is an essential ingredient of logic programming, (2) a clearer view of constructive mathematical reasoning as based on strategies in certain sorts of debates, and (3) applications of a context that resembles traditional set theory in many ways yet avoids the phenomena sometimes regarded as pathological.<br/>"

Many dynamical systems, while completely determinate, appear to have elements of random behavior. This phenomenon can be described explicitly when there is a time-invariant probability measure on the system.  Such a description could state that the system is measure theoretically isomorphic to a particular known process, such as a Bernoulli process. From this point of view it is natural to try to attempt to classify dynamical systems measure-theoretically. The hope would be to have a ""library"" of possible measure preserving systems and be able to describe an arbitrary system measure theoretically as one in the library.<br/>This project, while very successful in its early stages, runs into insuperable obstacles for deep logical reasons. Foreman's previous work with his co-authors showed that the isomorphism problem for ergodic measure preserving systems is inherently too complex from a logical point of view to admit a classification. Foreman's proposed work involves extending these anti-classification results to differentiable systems on compact manifolds and to identify those  systems for which the isomorphism problem is tractable.<br/><br/>Many natural systems evolve over time according to definite rules. Much of science involves discovering these rules and describing them, perhaps by a system of equations. These rules discuss how individual points in a system behave, and are often completely deterministic. However, what can be actually observed (for example due to round-off error) in these systems are sets  of points. At this level the qualitative behavior of a dynamical system can be apparently random. This led to the project of classifying<br/>the possible behavior statistically so that the   qualitative behavior of<br/>natural systems could be catalogued. There were many successes in the program in its early stages. Recently however, it turns out that there are reasons related to mathematical logic that the program cannot, in principle, work. Foreman's proposed research explores extending the impossibility results to concrete settings and finding large collections of systems for which there are good classifications of their statistical behavior.<br/><br/><br/>"

She aims to better understand how algorithmic properties interact with algebraic and topological ones. Harizanov focuses on the complexity of countable models, their submodels and relations, and transformations of structures. She studies model-theoretic complexity of computable structures measured by their Scott rank. Harizanov investigates intrinsic complexity of relations on structures, captured both syntactically and by their Turing or strong degree spectra. She relates degree spectra of structures to the degree spectra of relations via spectrally universal structures, which are often obtained as Fraisse limits. Harizanov investigates the spaces of left orders and bi-orders on magmas, semigroups, and groups of importance in low-dimensional topology and algebra. She connects their topological properties with computability-theoretic ones. Harizanov also studies algorithmic complexity of isomorphisms. This includes effective categoricity of specific and general computable structures. It also includes the study of partial and total automorphisms. One direction is to develop the theory of automorphism degree spectra of computable structures. The other direction is to investigate various semigroups of partial automorphisms and how the structures can be recovered from these semigroups.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Invented in the 1930's, computability theory paved the way for the creation of the modern programmable computer. The main thrust of the field is to understand the limitations on algorithmic computation, without regard for the physical implementation. Interaction of computability theory with model theory and universal algebra, as well as other areas of mathematics, has resulted in computable model theory and, more generally, in computable mathematics, a very active research area in the last few decades. Harizanov's proposed research includes a broad range of topics in computable mathematics. She investigates when some mathematical constructions are algorithmic, or can be replaced by algorithmic ones yielding the same results, and when they are fundamentally nonalgorithmic. Undecidable sets, as well as problems these sets encode, can be more precisely classified by considering algorithms with oracles, which require external knowledge. Turing and other computability-theoretic degrees, which play a significant role in Harizanov's project, provide an important measure of the level of such knowledge needed. Harizanov combines degree-theoretic and other unique methods from computability theory with algebraic, combinatorial and topological methods to study and explain phenomena of importance in other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>"

In a different direction Marker will continue his work on connections between model theory and descriptive set theory. In particular, he will try to understand more about theories where the isomorphism relation on countable models is Borel.<br/><br/>In model theory one studies mathematical structures by looking at solution sets to systems of equations and more complicated sets you can build from these basic sets. In some situations, like the real or complex numbers with algebraic operations, the sets constructed are geometrically simple-for example there are only finitely many connected pieces.  In the real numbers if you add the exponential function, the definable sets are still geometrically simple, but in the complex numbers you can construct infinite discrete sets like the integers.  In this case it is unknown if the sets constructed can be arbitrarily complicated.  Possibly, all the sets arise from simple pieces.

Core model theory addresses some of the fundamental unresolved questions in set theory in direct and sophisticated ways.  <br/>Beyond its foundational concerns, core model theory is connected to other areas, for example, cardinal arithmetic (the arithmetic of infinite<br/>numbers) and infinitary combinatorics (the combinatorics of infinite structures such as graphs and trees).  The research problems addressed in this project lead to new core model theoretic techniques and applications.<br/>"

The interest in the questions of polynomial definability and decidability dates back to the time of the solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem (HTP). At the beginning of the XX century a famous German mathematician David Hilbert asked the following question (among others): is there an algorithm that can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables and with integer coefficients has integer solutions? In the early 1970's, Yurii Matiyasevich, building on the work by Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson showed that the sets of integers which can be defined using polynomial equations and the sets of integers that can be listed by a computer program were the same, and thus showed that an algorithm sought by Hilbert did not exist. Matiyasevich's result immediately raised another question which proved to be even more vexing:<br/>is there an algorithm as described above but for the solutions in rational numbers? This problem is unsolved to this day.<br/>As is often the case with difficult problems in Mathematics, HTP for rational numbers as well as its sister problem, HTP for the rings of integers of number fields, generated many new questions such as Mazur's conjectures and various conjectures for elliptic curves. Many of these questions turned out to be questions of Number Theory or Algebraic Geometry, but they in turn generated quite interesting consequences in Logic. The author of this proposal believes that this line of research will continue to reveal new areas of interaction between Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry and Logic, enriching all the fields involved.<br/><br/><br/>The language of rings or the language of polynomial equations is widely used in almost all branches of Mathematics, sciences and social sciences, and therefore understanding what can be expressed by this language and whether we can determine algorithmically which sentences in this language are true is of importance to many areas of Mathematics and beyond. <br/><br/>"
