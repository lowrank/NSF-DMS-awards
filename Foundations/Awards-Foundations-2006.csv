Frames represent a theoretical underpinning of Signal processing. In the context of A/D conversion it is crucial to quantize signals, or, abstractly speaking, the coefficients in a frame-expansion. Using infinite dimensional Banach space theory the author intends to formulate and prove results which provide the theoretical background for such quantizations. He will build on results already proven for basis-expansions. The author intends also to continue his research on the following fundamental questions of Geometrical Functional Analysis: Does there exist a bounded linear operator on any infinite dimensional Banach space which is not a compact perturbation of  a multiple of the identity? The principal investigator proposes to explore several interesting variations on this theme, each with a distinctly structure-theoretical flavor. Secondly, the author proposes to work on several structure theoretical questions in Banach spaces, which concern their co-ordinate systems. These problems can be summarized under the following general question: Given a separable Banach space, how close can we find an other space containing the first one which has a finite dimensional decomposition (or even a basis)?<br/><br/>"

The first measures the information content of finite binary strings, while the second captures the intuition that a random infinite binary sequence has no ""distinguishing features"". Both notions are rooted in computability theory, so it is not surprising that the study of randomness draws methods and ideas from computability theory, as well as core mathematical subjects like measure theory and information theory.<br/>However, the theory of effective randomness has proved to be a rich field of study in its own right. Miller proposes to study the strength of non-monotonic betting strategies, the computable power of sequences with positive effective Hausdorff dimension, degrees of randomness, and K-triviality.<br/><br/>A sequence of zeros and ones is considered random if the shortest<br/>(binary) computer program that generates the sequence has essentially the same length as the sequence itself. Intuitively, a random sequence has no patterns that can be exploited to give a compressed description. For example, the sequence consisting of a million zeros can be generated easily by a short program, so it is not random. On the other hand, there is a high probability that a sequence generated by flipping a coin a million times (tails is zero, heads is one) will be random. The length of the shortest program for a sequence is called the Kolmogorov complexity of the sequence; this notion was introduced in the 1960s. An infinite sequence is considered random if all of its finite initial segments are sufficiently random. This is equivalent to saying that no (semi-)computable betting strategy can win money trying to predict the digits of the sequence. The proposed research will address fundamental questions about randomness, including: (1) How powerful are computable betting strategies that are allowed to bet on the digits of a sequence in any order; (2) Is it possible to distill information out of a semi-random source to produce a random sequence or, at least, a sequence that has higher information density; (3) What does it mean to say that one infinite sequence is more random that another (4) How computationally weak are the infinite?<br/><br/>"

In the project Rosendal will investigate both algebraic and topological properties of these groups, such as the small index property, the Bergman property, phenomena of automatic continuity of homomorphisms and extreme amenability. The main problems investigated are to a great extent motivated by the model theoretical problem of reconstructing a countable structure from its group of automorphisms. One of the principal tools used in this connection is the automatic continuity of isomorphisms of automorphism groups, which motivated the study of the broader phenomenon of automatic continuity of arbitrary homomorphisms between classes of Polish groups. Rosendal also plans to apply these ideas to study the topological dynamics of uncountable discrete groups most notably in connection with the fixed point on metric compacta property. The study of Polish groups using the very diverse methods of several fields seems likely to promote the further integration of separate knowledge and deeper understanding of the objects considered.<br/>In a separate project, Rosendal intends to continue his work with V. Ferenczi on a question of G. Godefroy concerning the number of non-isomorphic subspaces of a non-Hilbertian Banach space. The methods that have proven useful at this moment have been highly set theoretical in nature and have reduced the problem to the case of minimal spaces. Probably more analytical tools will be of greater utility for the next steps. In connection with this, Rosendal plans to revisit Gowers' determinacy theorem and by using set theoretical tools extend its applications beyond its nominal reach of analytic sets. This should provide tools in Banach space theory not obtainable by classical geometric considerations.  <br/>Also Rosendal will pursue another ongoing project with B.D. Miller of classifying Borel transformations up to a descriptive notion of Kakutani equivalence. This is a completely parallel project to the theory of Kakutani equivalence in ergodic theory, but due to the nature of the objects, the methods used are completely descriptive set theoretical and go back to works of Glimm and Effros in operator algebra. <br/>By stressing the interconnections of mathematical logic with other domains of mathematics, Rosendal hopes to enrich both logic itself and provide new insight into objects outside of mathematical logic. The main applications of his research will be in functional analysis (Banach space theory), topological groups, and ergodic theory."

This is the least level in the large cardinal hierarchy which cannot be captured by games of countable length.<br/>The present project aims to extend and study this connection between levels of the large cardinal hierarchy and games of uncountable length. 2 -- Using inner models for large cardinals it is possible to identify ultrafilters on specific sets of countable sequences in the smallest model of set theory containing all the reals.

The PI is investigating the constructions of ultrafilters from large cardinals with the aim of generalizing them to the case of uncountable sequences, and studying the resulting forcing extensions. 3 --- The PI is studying the expressive power of the monadic second order language in the structure of the ordinals, both under the axiom of choice (for ordinals above the second uncountable cardinal) and under the axiom of determinacy.<br/><br/><br/>Large cardinal axioms state the existence of functions which act on the entire universe of sets, and preserve the structure of set membership. It is one of the most amazing discoveries of modern set theory that these functions, which at face value should only affect extremely large sets (large enough to not be definable from smaller sets using the structure of set membership), concretely affect the properties of real numbers. The intermediary connecting large cardinals to real numbers is the axiom of determinacy, stating the existence of winning strategies in infinite games of perfect information. The present project is part of the study of the ties between large cardinals and determinacy. It addresses games of uncountable infinite length, two-valued measures on sequences of uncountable length under the axiom of determinacy, and the expressive power of statements involving sets, but not functions, over wellordered structures.<br/>"

Some of the<br/>questions remain unresolved even in the presence of the Proper Forcing<br/>Axiom. The sequential order of a space is a natural ordinal invariant<br/>that measures the complexity of a sequential space; the question of<br/>whether there can be a finite or countable bound on this invariant for<br/>compact spaces has only been resolved under CH. We will also study<br/>continuous maps on the remainder of the Stone-Cech compactification of<br/>the integers which are finite-to-one. We will try to determine if such<br/>maps have to be ""somewhere trivial"" and whether the range space will be<br/>homeomorphic to the domain. This question has been fully resolved under<br/>PFA but not, for example, under MA. Two other questions about the<br/>remainder of N under PFA: can it be covered by nowhere dense P-sets and<br/>can there be non-trivial copies of the remainder?<br/><br/><br/>When one formalizes the limiting process of an infinite sequence of<br/>steps one is naturally lead to the notion of topological space. Points<br/>in physical space can be analyzed using the notion of a converging<br/>sequence, but just as mathematics has a need for a much broader<br/>understanding of points (e.g. functions or processes themselves lying in<br/>a space of like processes), so too has the need for a broader<br/>understanding of limit and topological space been developed to handle<br/>convergence in the more general settings. The investigation into the<br/>nature of generalized convergence, connections between conditions that<br/>may imply the existence of (the much easier to understand and apply)<br/>classical convergent sequences,  and the behavior of the convergence<br/>structure under deformations  is on-going and productive. These notions<br/>are very sensitive to the foundational axioms of mathematics and the<br/>questions serve as both a testbed for foundational study and a generator<br/>of new development. One of the most famously indeterminate questions of<br/>mathematics, the continuum hypothesis (the ""size"" of the real number<br/>line) is intimately connected to these questions of convergence. <br/>"

Particular emphasis will be placed on issues of definability and automorphisms. Also included in this area is the analysis of the relations between the difficulty of computing functions and other issues such as rates of growth, complexity of their definitions in arithmetic and the strength of axiom systems needed to prove their existence (reverse mathematics). The emphasis in reverse mathematics will be on analyzing basic combinatorial principles that seem to lie outside the scope of the standard theories studied. Applications of the methods of pure computability theory will be made in the areas of model theory and notions used in differential geometry. The emphasis in computable model theory will be on the ways in which choosing different representations of a given structure affect the computational complexity of various relations or procedures on the elements of the structure. Issues in automata theory and especially automatic structures that deal with computable complexity will also be addressed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The proposed project includes research into a broad range of topics in computability theory (recursion theory) and logic both theoretical and applied to other areas of mathematics and computer science. At the foundational level, this work illuminates the nature of relative complexity of computation, the strength of axioms needed to prove standard mathematical theorems and the relations between these areas. In practical terms, results in this area (computable mathematics and model theory as well as reverse mathematics)  at times indicate that there are no algorithms for certain important tasks or that more information than might have been expected is needed to write programs calculating the desired results. The work related to automata theory and automatic structures is based on a very limited model of computation that is often relevant to practical computing problems. The theoretical and foundational analysis of structures whose basic relations and functions are computable by such automata should also eventually be of practical significance.<br/><br/><br/>"
