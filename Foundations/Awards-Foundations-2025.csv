Measuring stronger theories requires new techniques for describing computer programs which are guaranteed to eventually stop, but where this can only be proven in very strong theories. The goal of this project is to complete a recent breakthrough in this area which introduced the use of self-modifying computer programs. This made it possible to analyze the theory known as full second order arithmetic in this way. This project will use this new characterization of this very abstract theory to develop new ways to translate this abstract strength into concrete, computational information. This project involves graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The starting point of this project will be writing down a complete ordinal notation for the theory of second order arithmetic and then using this to examine the strength of this theory from several perspectives. The project will develop combinatorial results, in the style of Goodstein sequences or hydra games, whose termination is so hard to prove that it cannot be shown in second order arithmetic. The project will also develop new forms of inductive definitions which exhaust the strength of second order arithmetic. This project will also develop this new approach to cut-elimination as a general method applicable to other logics besides variants of second order arithmetic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combining ideas from different areas of mathematical logic, from computability theory, descriptive set theory, and infinitary model theory, the Scott analysis is a way of measuring and understanding the complexity of mathematical objects. The Scott analysis is robust in the sense that it captures several different kinds of complexity that all coincide: the complexity of describing an object, the complexity of identifying two copies of an object, and the complexity of an object's internal structure. Though there remain many questions, the Scott analysis has now been well-developed for the case of discrete structures such as many structures appearing in algebra. More recently there has been increasing interest in studying continuous structures such as those appearing in analysis, a setting in which we do not have a robust Scott analysis, as there are further complication which do not arise in the discrete setting. This project will develop a robust Scott analysis in this continuous setting, including applications, while also further applying developing the Scott analysis in the more classical discrete setting. The long-term goals are to give a more rigorous and formal understanding of why certain mathematical questions are difficult or even impossible to solve, and what the barriers are to solving them. This project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Consider a discrete structure such as a graph, group, or Boolean algebra. The Scott analysis assigns to this structure an ordinal-valued Scott rank or more finely a Scott complexity. This is robust in the sense that it measures, simultaneously, the complexity of defining the automorphism orbits of the structure, the complexity of characterizing the structure up to isomorphism in infinitary logic, the Borel complexity of the set of copies of that structure in the topological space of all structures, and the computational complexity of building isomorphisms between copies of that structure. This project will develop such a theory in the continuous setting where the structures are metric or topological structures such as Banach spaces or manifolds. The main goal is to develop a bridge between syntactic characterizations in infinitary continuous logic and semantic characterizations in terms of computation or topology and descriptive set theory. Applications of this include studying how the Scott complexity of n-manifolds changes as n increases, or of studying the Scott complexity of Banach spaces and, for example, the impact of whether or not they have a Schauder basis. The project will also include further developments in the discrete setting, both in developing the theory at a finer level and in further applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

LCAs are designed to settle all natural theories that are independent of ZFC. This is Gödel's program in set theory. How can one test for ?correctness? of an LCA? The inner model program, a major program in modern set theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of arithmetic (PA). The canonicity of the models justifies the correctness of the LCAs much like the canonicity of the natural numbers justifies the correctness of PA. This research project contributes to the inner model program by advancing the state of the current knowledge regarding canonical models for LCAs and their relationship with other foundational frameworks of set theory. The project provides research opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>This project builds on and expands the PI?s previous work on computing consistency lower bounds for the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), on studying canonical models of AD^+ up to the minimal model of the Largest Suslin Axiom (LSA), and on the Sealing phenomenon concerning universally Baire sets. These are important theories in our set-theoretic landscape. The PI plans to explore further various aspects of Sealing (particularly a weak form of Tower Sealing and its implications) and develop further techniques of the core model induction with the eye towards determining the consistency strength of various fragments of Martin?s Maximum. The PI plans to study the theory of short-tree strategy mice for the least-branch hierarchy; this not only completes the general structure theory for least-branch hod mice but also will have potential applications, particularly in core model induction contexts. The PI also plans to continue the ongoing joint work with W. Chan and S. Jackson on the general analysis of combinatorial structures of determinacy; this allows the PI and his co-authors to understand deeper how sets are related to one another in this context. This, in particular, leads to the discovery and resolution of the ABCD Conjecture, solutions to several classical descriptive set theoretic conjectures, and the study of general cardinalities and cofinalities of sets in choiceless contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics.  Through subsequent work of Godel and Cohen, it has been realized that many aspects of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete description using axioms.  Moreover, these complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, geometry, and topology--all of which are core areas of mathematics. The aim of this grant is to further develop both understanding of set-theoretic methods and their role in topology, particularly in relation to the basic notations of compactness and convergence.  It also more broadly supports graduate student research into applications of set theory to other fields of mathematics and logic.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project aims to classify the simplest nonmetrizable compact topological spaces in the presence of PFA, an additional axiomatic assumption.  It will leverage a new approach to building nonmetrizable compacta as limits of spaces which are finite in nature (for instance finite sets of points or their convex hulls).  The second part of the research project aims to classify the cofinal types of uniform ultrafilters on the first uncountable cardinal.  The third component of the research project is to support thesis research of graduate students working under the PI's supervision.  The topics include the analysis of generic extensions of Solovay's model via ultrafilters on topological Ramsey spaces, set-theoretic aspects of homological algebra, and the interplay between proof theory and the determinacy of infinite games.

Here, model theory refers to a branch of mathematical logic: roughly speaking, model theorists study mathematical structures by studying the expressive power of abstract languages that describe them. Over the last few decades, the abstract perspective of model theory has led to the discovery of certain surprising patterns across different areas of mathematics. A key such pattern is Zilber's trichotomy: this is a general observed phenomenon in which sufficiently well-behaved mathematical structures (in the sense of model theory) tend to have one of just three basic forms. This is an imprecise phenomenon -- but recent work has increased our understanding of when and how it can be formally studied. This project aims to expand on such recent work, using the latest techniques to find more precise and true instances of the trichotomy. The PI then plans to use new cases of the trichotomy to expand applications of model theory in other areas of mathematics, with a particular focus on certain aspects of geometry and combinatorics. The project will provide research opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>More specifically, the project has four main goals. First, building on recent work, the PI will seek to prove new instances of the Zilber trichotomy for relics of structures of geometric interest. The main questions of this form concern relics of o-minimal structures and relics of algebraically closed valued fields; in each of these cases, the status of the trichotomy has seen substantial recent progress but remains open. Second, the PI will use new instances of the trichotomy to study reconstruction problems in geometry -- focusing particularly on reconstructing algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields from partial data. This will generalize the work of Zilber on recovering a curve from its Jacobian variety: the goal is to prove stronger and more general statements of the same type, using the latest trichotomy results as a tool. Third, the PI will investigate broader interpretations of the trichotomy, weakening the usual assumption of strong minimality to similar notions of tameness, such as geometric structures?the hope being that a wider array of trichotomy-style theorems will allow for a broader array of geometric applications. Finally, the PI will investigate pseudo-finite variants of the trichotomy in the hope of finding new applications to incidence problems in combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Model theory usually studies infinite structures, though, within model theory, there are techniques for taking a collection of finite structures--graphs, orders, groups, etc.--and producing an infinite limit structure that encodes useful information about the finite structures.  For example, there are Fraïssé limits, like the Rado graph or the rational order, which allow for the study of all finite graphs and orders via their rich collection of symmetries, and ultraproducts, which are logical limits that reflect the asymptotic features of a sequence of structures detected by first order logic. Some of the most striking developments in model theory concern the 'smoothly approximable' structures, a special class of structures that can be seen simultaneously as both kinds of limit, which are built out of classical geometries over finite fields and have deep connections to combinatorics and group theory. The geometries that form their basic building blocks also can be considered over infinite fields and are important objects of study in several areas of mathematics. As with the infinite limits of finite structures, model-theoretic techniques allow for the construction of infinite-dimensional limits of these (infinite but) finite-dimensional geometries and new tools are needed to understand them.  This project is focused on the development of those tools. The educational component involves organization of a summer school at University of Notre Dame and  working with graduate students. In addition, the PI plans to work with students in several countries where access to high level math education is more limited. <br/><br/>The PI's research agenda will develop a structure theory for NSOP_1 theories, pushing beyond the reaches of simplicity theory and enabling the treatment of smoothly approximable structures over infinite fields. The name NSOP_1 is an unfortunate label for a very natural class of theories, serving as a kind of 'compactification' of the simple theories and encompassing many important examples. The PI has proposed a two-part program. The first part would develop the 'geometric' aspects of the theory, by analogy with geometric stability theory, with a focus on definable groups and higher amalgamation.  The second part proposes a far-reaching program to expand the reach of the existing structure theory for smoothly approximable structures developed, in its ultimate form, by Cherlin and Hrushovski. In that work, group theory, via work of Kantor, Liebeck, and Macpherson, provided a catalogue of the basic building blocks and classification theory, via the then-nascent theory of simple theories, explained how a smoothly approximable structure is assembled out of these basic pieces. For the analogue over infinite fields, there are significant questions both on the group-theoretic side, concerning the basic geometries, and the classification-theoretic side, concerning a 'geometric' theory of NSOP_1 theories. The PI aims to develop the analysis of geometries in two distinct regimes: the algebraic and the pseudo-finite. This will enable meaningful applications to algebra, representation theory, and combinatorics, particularly to groups of finite Morley rank and to the asymptotic behavior of finite permutation groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project centers around three main projects involving model theory. The first involves solutions of differential and difference equations. These types of equations specify how an object or variable moves with respect to another in a continuous or discrete manner, respectively. Over the last decade, model theory has played a pivotal role in the resolution of several long-standing open problems for algebraic differential equations. This project aims to continue that progress as well as adapt the new methods to solutions of difference equations. The second project aims to develop connections between model theory and machine learning on both a theoretical and practical level. The third main area of this project involves applying the lessons learned from machine learning and difference equations in more general model theoretic settings. These adaptations are expected to lead to fundamental new advances in model theory. This project involves graduate student training.<br/><br/>Model theory has a long history of applications to transcendence results for differential equations. In the last decade, this circle of results has rapidly expanded as model theoretic methods have become more refined. This project seeks to adapt these results to the setting of difference fields, which is expected to have applications in algebraic dynamics via characterizing the invariant subvarieties of algebraic maps of varieties. In model theory, one usually does not study arbitrary first order theories due to well-known wildness phenomena such as undecidability. Because of this, different settings have developed specific techniques in the presence of various tameness principles. Surprisingly, these principles proved to be the key to efficient learnability in several different models of machine learning. This project seeks to continue to develop this growing area of connection while applying cutting edge results from graph theory and combinatorics.

Universal algebra generally studies algebraic structures, the mathematical framework for computations, solving equations, etc. This project investigates various notions of nilpotence, specific finiteness conditions on algebras, and how they can be used to develop efficient algorithms. It is motivated by questions that arise in computer science when manipulating relations, in the structure theory of classical algebras, and in the classification of non-standard general algebras. The goal is to combine and extend recent independent advances in these areas to develop a general algebraic toolkit for specifying and analyzing nilpotent algebras, and to apply it to solving key open problems in all these areas.<br/><br/>Developed from the classical notion in group theory, commutator theory in universal algebra is one of the main tools for investigating the structure of algebras via properties of their congruences.

The first goal is a more precise classification of central extensions in congruence modular varieties using the new concept of clonoids. The investigator will then use this to study to what extent known results in the supernilpotent setting generalize to the nilpotent. Specific projects include the Finite Basis Problem, which concerns nilpotent algebras having finitely axiomatizable equational theories, and the development of efficient algorithms for computing in direct powers of algebras with cube terms, which reduces to central extensions based on the investigator's previous work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Areas of mathematics with physical applications tend to appear in the low levels of the corresponding complexity hierarchy. Passing to higher levels of complexity enables mathematicians to make connections between different areas of mathematics, and to develop productive general theories. There is a corresponding division of the universe of mathematics into an absolute part, where natural questions tend to be resolved by the standard axioms, and a more abstract part where extensions of the standard axiom system are needed to resolve many fundamental questions. The main focus of PI's research is the relationship between these parts. The technical machinery involved in this project includes Cohen's forcing technique, axioms asserting the existence of winning strategies in infinite games, and axioms asserting the existence of infinite objects whose existence cannot be proved from the standard axioms for mathematics. These techniques originate in set theory, which serves as the most commonly accepted foundations for mathematics.  <br/><br/><br/>The PI plans to work on a related collection of projects involving the complexity of sets of real numbers. Two of these projects aim to extend the work published in two of his recent books. The first of these is another book exposing part of W. Hugh Woodin's work on his axiom AD^+. The first part of this book is to be on methods for producing maximal models of AD^+ via strengthenings of Woodin's derived model methods. The second half of the book concerns reversals, methods for showing that a given model of AD^+ arises as a derived model. This approach resolves many basic questions about models of AD^+.  The second project involves applications of the methods of Geometric Set Theory, which is the topic of the PI's book with Jindrich Zapletal. There are many open questions about the relationships between fragments of the Axiom of Choice which appear to be amenable to the techniques developed in this book. The PI plans to use this approach to study discontinuous homomorphisms of the additive group of the real line, probability measures on the integers, and Blackwell determinacy. Another project involves the universally measurable sets of real numbers, those which are measured by every Borel measure on the real line. Despite their fundamental nature, many basic questions about these sets remain open, among them the question of whether it is consistent for every universally measurable set to have the property of Baire. Another project involves using techniques from inner model theory to study canonical inner models derived from strengthenings of first-order logic, such as logics allowing quantifiers for cofinality or stationarity. These models are typically analyzed by understanding which mice they contain, and which mice construct then. Finally, the PI plans to work with Saharon Shelah on an approach to 0-1 laws. Results in this area show that for many natural properties of finite structures, the probability that a finite structure has the property in question approaches either 0 or 1 as the size of the structure approaches infinity. Results in this project show that under natural assumptions 0-1 laws are preserved while adding additional random predicates to the structures in question.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Distributed computing is the area of computer science that studies distributed systems, i.e., decentralized networks of computers that communicate with each other by passing messages. Distributed computing is especially relevant in the modern era of large networks, such as the Internet, where millions of machines are interconnected. On the other hand, descriptive set theory investigates the structure of subsets of the real line and other well-behaved spaces. It is used to understand the complexity of various sets defined by mathematical formulas and to classify them according to their complexity. Surprisingly, it turns out that these two areas are closely related, and that ideas and results from one can often be applied in the other. As this relationship has only recently been discovered, it is still poorly understood. This project will explore it in depth with the ultimate aim of developing a unified theory that integrates the two subjects. The educational component of this project is focused on creating opportunities for junior researchers to enter this rapidly developing field. Specifically, it will support training of graduate students and designing a suite of materials (textbooks and lecture notes, instructional videos, workshops, and courses) aimed at students and scholars with background in combinatorics or computer science but no prior exposure to descriptive set theory.<br/><br/>Known interactions between descriptive combinatorics and distributed computing take place in the framework of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, where the objective is to assign labels to the vertices of a given graph subject to some ""local"" constraints. Part of the project is to investigate the following general question: Given an LCL problem that can be solved with some degree of regularity (e.g., Borel, measurable, etc.) on Borel graphs, when can we find an efficient algorithm for this problem in some model of distributed computation? Currently, the answer is only known in a few special cases, and this project aims to extend it to a much wider context. Another goal of this project is to develop an effective classification of the complexity of LCL problems from the perspective of descriptive set theory and distributed computing, or to prove that such classification is impossible. Thirdly, this project will study specific problems of particular interest, such as graph coloring and perfect matchings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ubiquity of this concept is central to its connection with dynamics, the study of systems that evolve in time and space. These processes can be either deterministic, as in the movement of planets, or stochastic, as in the throwing of dice. The main purpose of this proposal is to study the interplay between dynamics and groups (group actions and dynamics) using the methods of logic, with a particular emphasis on the tools of descriptive set theory. Descriptive set theory precisely studies how complicated it is to define certain subsets, equivalences, and related objects. In particular, it can show whether certain simple classifications of objects exist or are impossible.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will focus on understanding the complexity of random walks and their Poisson Boundaries, the possible symmetries and joinings of dynamical systems, and the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Poisson Boundaries capture the notion of asymptotic indistinguishability for random walks. They also classify the space of an important set of functions on groups (the bounded harmonic functions). When the boundary is trivial, this implies that in the long term all random walks look similar. One goal of this project is to make progress in understanding when this triviality occurs. Joinings represent a broad notion of symmetry, more general than morphisms or factor maps, that topological dynamical systems can have. Understanding the joinings of a topological dynamical system to itself provides a rich perspective on the various symmetries that the system can possess. Borel equivalence relations are a formal way to precisely describe whether classification problems are easy or difficult. This project aims to further impact their study, as well as to initiate the exploration of linear algebraic analogues of Borel equivalence relations. Graduate students will be involved in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology is an area of mathematics that emerged from analysis and geometry as its own discipline in the late 19th century. It has since become a foundational discipline of mathematics, underlying many other areas of mathematics as well as the application of mathematics to the sciences, including logic, computer science, data science, life sciences, game theory, and category theory. As the thirty-ninth event in its series, SUMTOPO 2025 will be an important international event, held in the EPSCoR state of Alabama, that reflects the ever-expanding world of topology and its applications, with sessions dedicated to low-dimensional topology, dynamics and continuum theory, topological graph theory, set-theoretic topology, and interactions with computing. Participants will comprise a diverse group of established researchers, junior researchers, and graduate students, with special emphasis on recruiting speakers and participants from populations underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>SUMPTOPO 2025's session on Low-Dimensional Topology will feature talks related to knot theory and low-dimensional topology, which have seen recent invigoration through the interaction of different techniques from algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory, where breakthroughs have often resulted from exchanging tools between fields to resolve outstanding problems. A session on Topological Dynamics and Continuum Theory will feature the study of continua (a topological space that is connected, compact and Hausdorff, and often metric as well) and the continuous mappings between them, as well as dynamical systems, including the study of iterates of a continuous map from a topological space to itself. In recent years there has been increasing interaction between mathematicians working in continuum theory and dynamical systems; in particular, continua arise naturally in the study of the topology and dynamics of one-dimensional and planar systems. In Topological Graph Theory, participants will explore how graphs can be embedded in the 3-dimensional space and on surfaces. This area features several important topics, including the Hadwiger Conjecture, the Colin de Verdière mu invariant, outerplanarity, planarity, and linkless embeddability. The Set-Theoretic Topology session will focus on the study of techniques from set theory that are used to investigate topics in general topology. Such topics include topological games, homogeneity, hyperspaces, topological algebra, compactifications, and much more. Problems about topological topics or properties often require extra axioms of set theory to answer; advances in set theory, conversely, have applications in general topology. Finally, a special session on Topology and Computing will be featured at SUMTOPO 2025 to showcase and disseminate the growing applications of computing for topology, as well as applications of topology on computing, broadly construed. Any research related to both topology and computing will be welcome, including but not limited to, topological data analysis, formalization of topology, applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning on topology, and more.
