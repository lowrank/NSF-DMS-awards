The organizers plan to hold a series of workshops at Vanderbilt University under the common theme annually. The primary objectives of these events will be to foster collaboration among researchers in these fields, identify compelling research problems, and provide educational opportunities for graduate students and early-career researchers.<br/> <br/>The inaugural edition of the workshops will bring together up to 50 researchers for a five-day event at Vanderbilt University in May 2025. The main focus of this first workshop is to prioritize topics at the interface of group theory and logic. The following distinguished mathematicians, including two International Congress of Mathematicians speakers, will give teach mini-courses: Isaac Goldbring, Thomas Koberda, Andrew Marks, Katrin Tent, and Simon Thomas; these mini-courses will cover the necessary background and review recent developments in areas of current interest. In addition, the workshop will feature invited research talks, problem sessions, and small group discussions.

The ubiquity of this concept is central to its connection with dynamics, the study of systems that evolve in time and space. These processes can be either deterministic, as in the movement of planets, or stochastic, as in the throwing of dice. The main purpose of this proposal is to study the interplay between dynamics and groups (group actions and dynamics) using the methods of logic, with a particular emphasis on the tools of descriptive set theory. Descriptive set theory precisely studies how complicated it is to define certain subsets, equivalences, and related objects. In particular, it can show whether certain simple classifications of objects exist or are impossible.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will focus on understanding the complexity of random walks and their Poisson Boundaries, the possible symmetries and joinings of dynamical systems, and the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Poisson Boundaries capture the notion of asymptotic indistinguishability for random walks. They also classify the space of an important set of functions on groups (the bounded harmonic functions). When the boundary is trivial, this implies that in the long term all random walks look similar. One goal of this project is to make progress in understanding when this triviality occurs. Joinings represent a broad notion of symmetry, more general than morphisms or factor maps, that topological dynamical systems can have. Understanding the joinings of a topological dynamical system to itself provides a rich perspective on the various symmetries that the system can possess. Borel equivalence relations are a formal way to precisely describe whether classification problems are easy or difficult. This project aims to further impact their study, as well as to initiate the exploration of linear algebraic analogues of Borel equivalence relations. Graduate students will be involved in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is the twenty-second in a series of biennial logic meetings at UCLA which, starting in the mid 1970s, has been one of the most important forums for mathematical logic on the West Coast. The meeting is a key opportunity for logicians to learn about and discuss important advances in research, to exchange ideas, and to collaborate on scientific projects. About half the grant funds are dedicated to travel awards for graduate students and early career researchers, to allow them to come to the meeting. Most of the participants will be research mathematicians and university teachers. What they learn at the meeting will have a positive impact on their research and teaching. <br/><br/>The meeting is scheduled to have eleven talks, on a wide range of topics within mathematical logic, including set theory, descriptive set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and philosophical logic, with speakers at all career stages who have obtained outstanding results in these fields. There is particular emphasis on descriptive set theory, in honor of Alekos Kechris, on the occasion of his formal retirement from Caltech. One of the talks is a named lecture in honor of Greg Hjorth. The 2025 Hjorth speaker is Grigor Sargsyan.

The conference encourages participation  from a wide range of mathematicians at all career stages and from a variety of backgrounds. In support of this goal of inclusivity, the conference is be available to both in-person and virtual participation. As a result, the 58th STDC will assemble a diverse group of mathematicians to disseminate results and build connections that will lead to future collaboration. Conference funds will be used to support graduate students, early career mathematicians, and those without sufficient institutional support.<br/><br/>The 58th STDC will be the latest in a conference series that began in 1967, and it will continue the conference's tradition of bringing together researchers from various active research areas within topology. This year's conference will include sessions in continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric topology, geometric group theory, set-theoretic topology, and applied topology. The inclusion of applied topology is a new addition for this year's conference and is intended both to appeal to regular STDC participants while also attracting new mathematicians to the conference.

Topology is an area of mathematics that emerged from analysis and geometry as its own discipline in the late 19th century. It has since become a foundational discipline of mathematics, underlying many other areas of mathematics as well as the application of mathematics to the sciences, including logic, computer science, data science, life sciences, game theory, and category theory. As the thirty-ninth event in its series, SUMTOPO 2025 will be an important international event, held in the EPSCoR state of Alabama, that reflects the ever-expanding world of topology and its applications, with sessions dedicated to low-dimensional topology, dynamics and continuum theory, topological graph theory, set-theoretic topology, and interactions with computing. Participants will comprise a diverse group of established researchers, junior researchers, and graduate students, with special emphasis on recruiting speakers and participants from populations underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>SUMPTOPO 2025's session on Low-Dimensional Topology will feature talks related to knot theory and low-dimensional topology, which have seen recent invigoration through the interaction of different techniques from algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory, where breakthroughs have often resulted from exchanging tools between fields to resolve outstanding problems. A session on Topological Dynamics and Continuum Theory will feature the study of continua (a topological space that is connected, compact and Hausdorff, and often metric as well) and the continuous mappings between them, as well as dynamical systems, including the study of iterates of a continuous map from a topological space to itself. In recent years there has been increasing interaction between mathematicians working in continuum theory and dynamical systems; in particular, continua arise naturally in the study of the topology and dynamics of one-dimensional and planar systems. In Topological Graph Theory, participants will explore how graphs can be embedded in the 3-dimensional space and on surfaces. This area features several important topics, including the Hadwiger Conjecture, the Colin de Verdière mu invariant, outerplanarity, planarity, and linkless embeddability. The Set-Theoretic Topology session will focus on the study of techniques from set theory that are used to investigate topics in general topology. Such topics include topological games, homogeneity, hyperspaces, topological algebra, compactifications, and much more. Problems about topological topics or properties often require extra axioms of set theory to answer; advances in set theory, conversely, have applications in general topology. Finally, a special session on Topology and Computing will be featured at SUMTOPO 2025 to showcase and disseminate the growing applications of computing for topology, as well as applications of topology on computing, broadly construed. Any research related to both topology and computing will be welcome, including but not limited to, topological data analysis, formalization of topology, applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning on topology, and more.
