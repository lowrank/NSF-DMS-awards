"2442011","CAREER:  Model theory, independence, and approximation","DMS","FOUNDATIONS","07/01/2025","04/11/2025","Samuel Ramsey","IN","University of Notre Dame","Continuing Grant","Tomek Bartoszynski","06/30/2030","$99,427.00","","sramsey5@nd.edu","940 GRACE HALL","NOTRE DAME","IN","465565708","5746317432","MPS","126800","1045","$0.00","This is a project in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic that studies the features of mathematical structures that can be expressed by formal languages. Model theory usually studies infinite structures, though, within model theory, there are techniques for taking a collection of finite structures--graphs, orders, groups, etc.--and producing an infinite limit structure that encodes useful information about the finite structures.  For example, there are Fraïssé limits, like the Rado graph or the rational order, which allow for the study of all finite graphs and orders via their rich collection of symmetries, and ultraproducts, which are logical limits that reflect the asymptotic features of a sequence of structures detected by first order logic. Some of the most striking developments in model theory concern the 'smoothly approximable' structures, a special class of structures that can be seen simultaneously as both kinds of limit, which are built out of classical geometries over finite fields and have deep connections to combinatorics and group theory. The geometries that form their basic building blocks also can be considered over infinite fields and are important objects of study in several areas of mathematics. As with the infinite limits of finite structures, model-theoretic techniques allow for the construction of infinite-dimensional limits of these (infinite but) finite-dimensional geometries and new tools are needed to understand them.  This project is focused on the development of those tools. The educational component involves organization of a summer school at University of Notre Dame and  working with graduate students. In addition, the PI plans to work with students in several countries where access to high level math education is more limited. <br/><br/>The PI's research agenda will develop a structure theory for NSOP_1 theories, pushing beyond the reaches of simplicity theory and enabling the treatment of smoothly approximable structures over infinite fields. The name NSOP_1 is an unfortunate label for a very natural class of theories, serving as a kind of 'compactification' of the simple theories and encompassing many important examples. The PI has proposed a two-part program. The first part would develop the 'geometric' aspects of the theory, by analogy with geometric stability theory, with a focus on definable groups and higher amalgamation.  The second part proposes a far-reaching program to expand the reach of the existing structure theory for smoothly approximable structures developed, in its ultimate form, by Cherlin and Hrushovski. In that work, group theory, via work of Kantor, Liebeck, and Macpherson, provided a catalogue of the basic building blocks and classification theory, via the then-nascent theory of simple theories, explained how a smoothly approximable structure is assembled out of these basic pieces. For the analogue over infinite fields, there are significant questions both on the group-theoretic side, concerning the basic geometries, and the classification-theoretic side, concerning a 'geometric' theory of NSOP_1 theories. The PI aims to develop the analysis of geometries in two distinct regimes: the algebraic and the pseudo-finite. This will enable meaningful applications to algebra, representation theory, and combinatorics, particularly to groups of finite Morley rank and to the asymptotic behavior of finite permutation groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Distributed computing is the area of computer science that studies distributed systems, i.e., decentralized networks of computers that communicate with each other by passing messages. Distributed computing is especially relevant in the modern era of large networks, such as the Internet, where millions of machines are interconnected. On the other hand, descriptive set theory investigates the structure of subsets of the real line and other well-behaved spaces. It is used to understand the complexity of various sets defined by mathematical formulas and to classify them according to their complexity. Surprisingly, it turns out that these two areas are closely related, and that ideas and results from one can often be applied in the other. As this relationship has only recently been discovered, it is still poorly understood. This project will explore it in depth with the ultimate aim of developing a unified theory that integrates the two subjects. The educational component of this project is focused on creating opportunities for junior researchers to enter this rapidly developing field. Specifically, it will support training of graduate students and designing a suite of materials (textbooks and lecture notes, instructional videos, workshops, and courses) aimed at students and scholars with background in combinatorics or computer science but no prior exposure to descriptive set theory.<br/><br/>Known interactions between descriptive combinatorics and distributed computing take place in the framework of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, where the objective is to assign labels to the vertices of a given graph subject to some ""local"" constraints. Part of the project is to investigate the following general question: Given an LCL problem that can be solved with some degree of regularity (e.g., Borel, measurable, etc.) on Borel graphs, when can we find an efficient algorithm for this problem in some model of distributed computation? Currently, the answer is only known in a few special cases, and this project aims to extend it to a much wider context. Another goal of this project is to develop an effective classification of the complexity of LCL problems from the perspective of descriptive set theory and distributed computing, or to prove that such classification is impossible. Thirdly, this project will study specific problems of particular interest, such as graph coloring and perfect matchings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ubiquity of this concept is central to its connection with dynamics, the study of systems that evolve in time and space. These processes can be either deterministic, as in the movement of planets, or stochastic, as in the throwing of dice. The main purpose of this proposal is to study the interplay between dynamics and groups (group actions and dynamics) using the methods of logic, with a particular emphasis on the tools of descriptive set theory. Descriptive set theory precisely studies how complicated it is to define certain subsets, equivalences, and related objects. In particular, it can show whether certain simple classifications of objects exist or are impossible.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will focus on understanding the complexity of random walks and their Poisson Boundaries, the possible symmetries and joinings of dynamical systems, and the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Poisson Boundaries capture the notion of asymptotic indistinguishability for random walks. They also classify the space of an important set of functions on groups (the bounded harmonic functions). When the boundary is trivial, this implies that in the long term all random walks look similar. One goal of this project is to make progress in understanding when this triviality occurs. Joinings represent a broad notion of symmetry, more general than morphisms or factor maps, that topological dynamical systems can have. Understanding the joinings of a topological dynamical system to itself provides a rich perspective on the various symmetries that the system can possess. Borel equivalence relations are a formal way to precisely describe whether classification problems are easy or difficult. This project aims to further impact their study, as well as to initiate the exploration of linear algebraic analogues of Borel equivalence relations. Graduate students will be involved in this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology is an area of mathematics that emerged from analysis and geometry as its own discipline in the late 19th century. It has since become a foundational discipline of mathematics, underlying many other areas of mathematics as well as the application of mathematics to the sciences, including logic, computer science, data science, life sciences, game theory, and category theory. As the thirty-ninth event in its series, SUMTOPO 2025 will be an important international event, held in the EPSCoR state of Alabama, that reflects the ever-expanding world of topology and its applications, with sessions dedicated to low-dimensional topology, dynamics and continuum theory, topological graph theory, set-theoretic topology, and interactions with computing. Participants will comprise a diverse group of established researchers, junior researchers, and graduate students, with special emphasis on recruiting speakers and participants from populations underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>SUMPTOPO 2025's session on Low-Dimensional Topology will feature talks related to knot theory and low-dimensional topology, which have seen recent invigoration through the interaction of different techniques from algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory, where breakthroughs have often resulted from exchanging tools between fields to resolve outstanding problems. A session on Topological Dynamics and Continuum Theory will feature the study of continua (a topological space that is connected, compact and Hausdorff, and often metric as well) and the continuous mappings between them, as well as dynamical systems, including the study of iterates of a continuous map from a topological space to itself. In recent years there has been increasing interaction between mathematicians working in continuum theory and dynamical systems; in particular, continua arise naturally in the study of the topology and dynamics of one-dimensional and planar systems. In Topological Graph Theory, participants will explore how graphs can be embedded in the 3-dimensional space and on surfaces. This area features several important topics, including the Hadwiger Conjecture, the Colin de Verdière mu invariant, outerplanarity, planarity, and linkless embeddability. The Set-Theoretic Topology session will focus on the study of techniques from set theory that are used to investigate topics in general topology. Such topics include topological games, homogeneity, hyperspaces, topological algebra, compactifications, and much more. Problems about topological topics or properties often require extra axioms of set theory to answer; advances in set theory, conversely, have applications in general topology. Finally, a special session on Topology and Computing will be featured at SUMTOPO 2025 to showcase and disseminate the growing applications of computing for topology, as well as applications of topology on computing, broadly construed. Any research related to both topology and computing will be welcome, including but not limited to, topological data analysis, formalization of topology, applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning on topology, and more.
