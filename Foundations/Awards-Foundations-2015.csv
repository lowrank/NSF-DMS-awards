Descriptive set theory gives a general framework for studying such classification problems and comparing their relative difficulties. The field has had remarkable success, proving the existence of barriers to having simple types of classifications, calibrating the difficulty of classification problems in a variety of fields of mathematics, and in understanding the structure of the space of all classification problems. This study has had particularly close connections with ergodic theory, probability, and operator algebras.<br/><br/>This project studies the difficulty of classifying countable Borel equivalence relations using new techniques based on Borel determinacy and recursion theory. These tools have already resolved several important questions in the field, and are promising candidates for attacking problems in the subject which are known to require new methods, such as the increasing unions problem for hyperfinite equivalence relations, and the question of whether Turing equivalence is universal. This work is also closely connected to the study of descriptive graph combinatorics. Recent breakthroughs in this area have yielded new combinatorial methods for studying problems in the field of countable Borel equivalence relations, and these connections have also inspired new combinatorial investigations."

One of the fundamental results of ergodic theory is the Mean Ergodic Theorem of von Neumann (1932), which amounts to an abstract statement about the limiting average state of a conservative system. In this project we seek to apply concepts and techniques of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, to establish results on ergodic averages and ergodic recurrence by reinterpreting and extending research results discovered in the decades following von Neumann. The model-theoretic viewpoint should help illuminate and potentially unveil connections between ergodic theory and other branches of mathematics.<br/><br/>One of the project's goals is casting recent results on convergence of multiple ergodic averages into a suitable model-theoretic framework that allows combining analytic arguments with the theory of types, forking calculus, and ordinal ranks. An important concept in the proposed research is a ranking of the complexity of ""polynomial actions"" of a group G on some measure space X, or rather of the induced (polynomial) actions of G on various topological spaces (say, of functions on X). This requires developing an abstract algebraic framework that extends Leibman's theory of polynomial mappings between groups. Ancillary anticipated products of the model-theoretic approach include results on metastable convergence (akin to a weak form of uniformity in situations in which uniform convergence is absent), on convergence of averages on ultraproducts of polynomial-ergodic systems, and on polynomial-ergodic actions of ordinal (transfinite) rank (generalized Leibman degree).Connections and applications to combinatorics, Ramsey theory, and number theory will also be studied."

Ramsey theory is that part of combinatorics that deals with the question of what sort of homogeneous structures one can expect to find in some one cell of a finite partition of specified sets (or sometimes in any suitably ""large"" subset). For example, the simplest nontrivial instance of the infinite version of Ramsey's theorem says that whenever the two-element subsets of the natural numbers N are finitely colored, there must be some infinite subset of N all of whose two-element subsets are the same color. Ramsey theory has applications in a wide variety of areas of mathematics as well as in theoretical computer science, communications, and information theory. The principal investigator will continue to mentor graduate students in projects on finite Ramsey Theory; this award consists solely of support for graduate students, facilitating the training through research involvement of the next generation of mathematicians.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will continue his research in Ramsey theory, including the interactions between this part of combinatorics and the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification of a discrete semigroup. The principal investigator proved many years ago that whenever N is finitely colored, there must exist in one color an infinite sequence together with all of its finite sums of distinct terms without repetition. The original proof was elementary, but very complicated. Subsequently, other proofs were found that were less complicated. But in 1975, F. Galvin and S. Glazer showed that this ""Finite Sums Theorem"" is a completely trivial consequence of the fact that the Stone-Cech compactification of N can be given an algebraic structure extending ordinary addition which is a compact right topological semigroup, and therefore has idempotents. Sets with the property that they contain all the finite sums from a sequence are called IP sets. By virtue of the connection discovered above, a set is an IP set if and only if it has an idempotent in its closure. Those that have special idempotents which are called minimal in their closure are central sets. These sets have much stronger properties, many of which are consequences of the Central Sets Theorem. But central sets have a very complicated elementary description. Sets that satisfy the conclusion of the Central Sets Theorem are called C sets, and are much easier to describe in an elementary fashion. Investigation of these various algebraically characterized large subsets of N should continue to yield new Ramsey theoretic results."

The LFCS series represents the body of work in those areas of fundamental logic related to computer science. The conference is intended to encourage the interchange and interuse of ideas emanating from a wide variety of fields and applications. LFCS conferences appear to be of significant and growing importance for the logic and foundations community in the United States since computer and information sciences provide a cluster of areas in which the core logical methods are applicable in the most immediate and powerful way. Such a conference is pivotal for building a cadre of future logical foundations of computer science.<br/><br/>Since its origin in 1989, each LFCS meeting has resulted in a Springer volume of proceedings published prior to the conference and, as has been the norm, a post-conference volume of Annals of Pure and Applied Logic - a flagship journal in mathematical logic.  The US community in logic and foundations benefits greatly from such a conference. LFCS conferences attract a good number of graduate students for whom this conference is a milestone event. Logic and foundations life in Florida area needs support. Another major beneficiary of LFCS 2016 is the logic community in the City University of New York, one of the leading institutions with a high number of underrepresented groups.

For example, the Continuum Hypothesis (that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers) is independent of the standard axioms, as shown in 1963 by Paul Cohen through the breakthrough method of forcing.  Since then, a longstanding project in set theory has been to use forcing for relative consistency results and to study strengthening of the ZFC axioms. This constitutes the broad motivation of the project: What is possible in strengthening of ZFC, versus what constraints are imposed by ZFC itself? The educational component of the project features organizing two workshops and support for undergraduate and graduate student research.<br/><br/>The main candidates for ZFC strengthenings are large cardinal axioms and strong forcing axioms.  Forcing over a model with large cardinals is also the most powerful tool for showing consistency results. Combinatorial principles, especially at singular cardinals are used to understand both the nature of these extensions, and how much we can do with forcing and large cardinals. Jensen's square, Shelah's approachability property are ""anti-compactness"" type principles that hold in models that sufficiently resemble L. In contrast, the tree property is a reflection property that resembles large cardinal properties, but can hold at successor cardinals. The project will focus on the interplay between these principles and forcing extensions constructed from large cardinals. The PI will also investigate how they interact with the singular cardinal hypothesis and Shelah's PCF theory. The latter is mostly decided in ZFC, and provides certain ""canonical invariants,"" against which one can test new axioms."

While topological transformation groups are quite trivially connected to geometry by the objects of which they are symmetries, this is not so for more general groups, that is, sets equipped with a notion of multiplication or addition. For example, solutions to differential equations can often be seen as points or vectors in infinite-dimensional spaces, namely so called Banach spaces, and such points can be added together to form new points in the space. So the solution spaces to differential equations are themselves groups. As it turns out, groups have an intrinsically defined large scale geometric structure. That is, as groups are seen from farther and farther away, the microscopical structure becomes blurred and one is left with a macroscopical perspective, which may be accessible to computation and provide structural information about the groups themselves. The PI will investigate groups from this large scale perspective, in particular expanding the existing theory to various infinite-dimensional groups originating in logic, topology and analysis.<br/><br/>The PI intends to conduct research on the large scale geometry of Polish groups. While large scale geometry of discrete or locally compact groups has been a very active area for quite some time, the realisation that Polish groups may have a well-defined large scale geometry is very recent. Several aspects to be investigated concern the large scale geometry of various concrete classes of groups such as homeomorphism and diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds and automorphism groups of countable first-order structures. In the latter case, one particular issue is to calibrate geometric properties of the automorphism group with the model theoretical properties of the structure. The nature of the proposal is very much interdisciplinary. On the one hand, it will involve descriptive set theory, via the study of Polish groups, model theory, via the study of automorphism groups, while at the same time incorporating the multifaceted instruments of geometric group theory. On the other hand, the theory allows for a geometric study of a number of topological transformation groups that were not hitherto amenable to such an approach, which again should open up for connections with areas such as geometric and differential topology."

This amounts to providing a ""catalog"" or ""listing"" of these objects, in principle not unlike that of cataloging species in biology or stars and galaxies in astronomy. If such a classification is possible, one has a ""complete"" understanding of the mathematical structures involved.  Otherwise a more or less ""chaotic"" behavior is expected. It is thus very important to understand under what circumstances a classification is possible. This difficult foundational question is further complicated by the fact that what constitutes an acceptable classification is very much dependent on the particular field of mathematics studied, so the criteria for a ""good"" classification in one area might not be appropriate in another.  At its basic level, this project aims to develop a general quantitative theory, which in many situations can precisely measure the complexity of a classification problem and thus provide objective means by which one can decide, in any given field, whether a satisfactory classification of the objects in question is possible. Developments arising in this program often lead to the study of the symmetries of various mathematical structures and their dynamics as well as connections to areas of discrete mathematics or probability and this is another important aspect of this project.<br/> <br/>The general aim of this project is the development of the theory of definable actions of Polish groups, the structure and classification of their orbit spaces, and the closely related study of definable equivalence relations and graphs. This work is motivated by basic foundational questions, like understanding the nature of complete classification of mathematical objects, up to some notion of equivalence, by invariants, and creating a mathematical framework for measuring the complexity of such classification problems. This theory is developed within the context of descriptive set theory, which provides the basic underlying concepts and methods. On the other hand, in view of its broad scope, it has natural interactions with many other areas of mathematics, such as model theory, group theory, topological dynamics, ergodic theory, probability theory and combinatorics. Within this general program Kechris proposes to study: (i) newly developed connections between the topological dynamics and ergodic theory of automorphism groups of countable structures and finite Ramsey theory; (ii) descriptive aspects of the global theory of ergodic group actions and equivalence relations, including the study of complexity of classification problems arising in ergodic theory; (iii) descriptive graph combinatorics, including its relations to ergodic theory, geometric group theory and probability theory; (iv) structurability for countable Borel equivalence relations."

Despite the simplicity of this concept, familiar to any child who has played a game of connect-the-dots, graphs are sufficiently general to model many phenomena both within mathematics and also in nearby scientific disciplines.  For example, graphs have found applications in computer network design, including modeling the evolution of the internet, as well as in statistical physics, including modeling atomic-scale thermodynamic interactions.  In these applications, the number of vertices is so large that for analytical purposes it is indistinguishable from being infinite.  In this project, the principal investigator will study infinite graphs from the descriptive set-theoretic viewpoint, in essence regarding such graphs abstractly as sets and relating the complexity of their descriptions with their concrete combinatorial properties.  In areas of mathematics such as dynamics and probability, such definable graphs arise as limits of finite graphs, and the descriptive set-theoretic methods shed light on this asymptotic behavior.  Additionally, the analysis finds applications within descriptive set theory as well, finding new ways of stratifying the relative difficulty of various classification problems.<br/><br/>In general, the objective of the project is to understand combinatorial parameters of Borel graphs on standard Borel spaces subject to various measurability constraints.  For example, the chromatic number of a graph (the smallest cardinality of the image of a function assigning different values to adjacent vertices) typically has different values when the coloring function is required to be Borel, measurable with respect to some Borel probability measure, or Baire measurable with respect to some compatible Polish topology.  While interesting in their own right, such parameters have (often surprising) connections with other areas of mathematics -- including combinatorial and geometric group theory, ergodic theory, probability theory, and operator algebras -- and a secondary aim of the proposal is to strengthen these connections in addition to forging new ones.  More precise proposed areas of study within this general setting include: (a) existence of measurable vertex colorings, edge colorings, and matchings, (b) applications to structurability of measured equivalence relations, in particular those arising as orbit equivalence relations of probability-measure-preserving actions of locally compact Polish groups, (c) applications to the global hierarchy of Borel/measure reducibility of definable equivalence relations, especially those just above hyperfinite, (d) connections with the probabilistic aspects of graph limits."

The research contains three projects involving two main areas of mathematics: descriptive set theory and ergodic Ramsey theory. The first two of the research projects lie in the theory of definable equivalence relations, which provides a general framework for understanding the nature of classification of mathematical objects up to some notion of equivalence; due to its broad scope, it has natural interactions with many areas of mathematics. These two projects are devoted to studying an important subclass of definable equivalence relations and whether slight extensions of the members of this subclass still belong to it. The third project features a new method for obtaining statements in arithmetic combinatorics similar in nature to a celebrated theorem of Szemeredi, which roughly states that any non-negligible subset of integers retains much of the additive structure of the entire set of integers.<br/><br/>In the theory of definable equivalence relations on Polish spaces, a central place is occupied by countable Borel equivalence relations, an important subclass of which is that of treeable equivalence relations. The first two projects investigate the question of closure of this subclass under finite index extensions in two different contexts: Borel and measure-theoretic. The former involves Borel combinatorics and possibly Borel games, whereas the latter is tightly connected with ergodic theory and the theory of cost of equivalence relations, and may require nontrivial machinery from geometric group theory. The third project lies in ergodic Ramsey theory and its goal is to obtain multiple recurrence results for amenable groups via a correspondence principle provided by nonstandard analysis. This is done by transferring recurrence statements from a given amenable group to a more convenient setting of probability groups by taking the ultrapower of the original group and equipping it with Loeb measure. The latter, being countably additive, presents the main advantage of the probability group over the original amenable group equipped with only a finitely additive density function, enabling integration over the group and the use of Fubini's theorem."

Among the historically important applications of set theory are independence results, which are theorems which assert that certain statements can neither be proved nor disproved from the axioms of mathematics, or equivalently, that certain statements together with their negations are both consistent with such axioms. As an example, the continuum problem, which was posed by the founder of set theory Georg Cantor, asks how the size of the real number line compares with the infinite cardinalities. This problem was shown to be independent by the work of Gdel and Cohen. In the process, Cohen introduced forcing, which is a powerful technique for creating models of set theory which can be analyzed in terms of the combinatorial properties of partially ordered sets. The goals of the project are to make advances in the theory of forcing, and to prove consistency results in combinatorial set theory.<br/><br/>The main topics of the project are side condition forcing and its application to proving independence results. For several decades, elementary substructures have been an indispensable tool in many combinatorial arguments in set theory. The method of side conditions involves including elementary substructures in the conditions of a forcing poset, in order to ensure cardinal preservation or stronger properties, such as properness and the approximation property. The project will build on previous work of Krueger in the theory of adequate sets, which is a style of side condition forcing which has resulted in a number of advances in the area. For example, adequate sets were used to construct a forcing poset for adding a club subset of the second uncountable cardinal with finite conditions, while preserving CH, solving an open problem of Friedman. We aim to develop general techniques in side condition forcing, and to apply these techniques to solve problems in combinatorial set theory, especially problems related to the square principle, the approachability ideal, forcing axioms, the theory of trees, ideals and filters, and stationary sets."

The issues of the long-term behavior of an infinite sequence of processes or systems (however abstract) is at the core of many mathematical or physical questions. The universal setting for this investigation is known as the study of compact topological spaces. The ""points"" in the ambient space can represent any mathematical object in applications ranging from turbulent dynamical systems to a quantum mechanics setting. It has emerged that many natural questions are sensitive to the very foundational principles of mathematics itself. This research project pursues the resolution of such topological questions armed with the modern methods of uncovering possible dependence on the foundational axioms of mathematics. <br/><br/>The investigator will  study the influence of well-known countability properties on the structure of compact (Hausdorff)  spaces. Some spaces are determined by the behavior of their converging   sequences, while one of the most fundamental  spaces, henceforth  BetaN, the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers N,  are at the opposite extreme in that it has no converging sequences whatsoever. The behavior of BetaN is heavily influenced by extra axioms of set-theory  and  many natural questions about spaces of functions and measures and the like,  are as well. Additionally, the Banach spaces of continuous real-valued functions with domain some compact subset of BetaN  will be investigated. Again set-theoretic hypotheses, mixed with additional topological properties, lead to varying behavior in the important class of compact spaces. Our study is the  analysis of the interplay between the various  countable convergence conditions and the axioms of set-theory that influence them.  We are expecting to have to develop new techniques of constructing topological spaces as well as the refinement of forcing techniques to uncover basic combinatorial structures involved. These specific problems of longstanding will  be of central focus. (1) If an infinite compact space has no converging sequence, does it contain a copy of BetaN? (2) Are the metrizable compact spaces the only ones whose diagonal is uncountably-inaccessible? (3) Is the Banach space of continuous functions on the remainder BetaN - N, like  BetaN - N itself, essentially unique in certain models of set theory? (4) If the topology of a compact space is determined by converging countable sequences, is there a finite or countable bound on how many times one must iterate taking limits to capture all such limits?"

Revived in the beginning of the twentieth century to deal with some foundational issues, mathematical logic turned out to also be useful for obtaining new results in mathematics. The recent applications of the model theory of difference and differential algebra to algebraic number theory are some of the most exciting examples of this. Difference equations, like differential equations, model real-world processes that change over time. Differential equations describe quantities that vary continuously with time, such as the positions of planets in space, while difference equations describe quantities that are only measured at discrete time intervals, such as the annual GDP of a country. Difference algebra is the abstract setting for studying difference equations; it also has applications to the kind of algebraic number theory that underpins modern cryptography and internet security.  Medvedev proposes to study the fine structure of solution sets of difference equations: to find algorithms for computing their dimensions and for identifying the very special cases where it is possible to define some kind of addition and/or multiplication on these sets.<br/><br/>A difference field is a field with a distinguished automorphism. The theory of difference closed fields is supersimple, meaning that Lascar rank is a good notion of dimension for complete types. Furthermore, the complete types of Lascar rank 1 satisfy the Zilber Trichotomy: each is nonorthogonal to a definable field, or nonorthogonal to a definable one-based group, or is disintegrated. While the fieldlike case of the trichotomy is relatively easy to identify in explicit examples, the dividing line between the grouplike and the disintegrated cases is much less clear. Similarly, even in the relatively nice case of groups, it is not always easy to determine the Lascar rank of a particular type. Beginning with her PhD thesis, Medvedev has worked on these sorts of problems, and on applications to algebraic dynamics. She is confident that she can generalize the main theorem of her PhD thesis from curves to higher-dimensional algebraic varieties. She has already accomplished the first part of this in far greater generality; the last part of the original proof should generalize easily; and the middle piece is supplied by an observation in a paper by Chatzidakis and Hrushovski. She expects to also obtain concrete results on the Lascar rank of certain groups G defined by systems of polynomial difference equations. This question can be translated to the language of linear algebra over the quasiendomorphism ring of the underlying algebraic group. For example, when G is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field in characteristic zero, this question reduces to linear algebra over the field of rational numbers. In addition, Medvedev proposes to continue expanding her foundational notes about difference schemes defined by Hrushovski in his work on the model theory of Frobenius automorphisms, filling in many missing detail, adding enlightening examples, and reorganizing the presentation to make it (more) understandable. Medvedev expects to continue involving students in this work, encouraging logicians and algebraic geometers to learn each other's languages when they are still young."

The conference is centered on the topic of arithmetic and algebraic differentiation, with a special emphasis on the role of the Witt vectors. This is a rich and exotic algebraic construction that originated in the early 20th century in algebraic number theory and which, in recent decades, has played a key part in some of the most important advances in arithmetic algebraic geometry. The subject has attracted the attention of mathematical researchers from disparate fields who have traditionally worked in parallel.  A principal goal of this conference is to bring together these researchers from number theory, algebraic topology, and applied model theory to propel the study of the Witt vectors in all of these fields through this intellectual cross-fertilization.<br/> <br/>The conference will concentrate on topics related to  Witt vectors. The Witt vectors have been especially crucial in the arithmetic geometry, notably in p-adic Hodge theory.  Even more recently, in the form of the de Rham--Witt complex, the Witt vectors have had important applications in algebraic topology, especially in the work of Hesselholt-Madsen and their followers on algebraic K-theory. In the meantime, Witt vectors have grown further in number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry, perhaps most importantly in Buium's work. His key insight was that Witt vectors are closely related to certain arithmetic analogues of differential operators, and he was then able to extend large parts of classical differential algebraic geometry to an ""arithmetic differential"" algebraic geometry. Here, we take seriously the analogy that ordinary differentiation is to formal power series as arithmetic differentiation is to the Witt vectors. This program includes, most notably, extending applications in Diophantine questions over function fields to such questions over number fields. This aspect of the theory was then picked up and carried further by applied model theorists especially in the work of Blair-Macintyre-Scanlon in which Ax-Kochen-Ershov-style theorems are proven for the Witt vectors considered as a first-order structure in the language of rings augmented by the Witt-Frobenius operator and then in the work of Scanlon (and the recent extensions by Rideau) putting Buium's p-differential operators into a model theoretic context.  The work of Chatzidakis-Hrushovski on the model theory of difference fields brought out the fine structure of the algebraic part of the theory of arithmetic differential equations.  The subsequent applications of this theory to diophantine geometry by Hrushovski and Scanlon demonstrated its power and the reworking of the theory by Pink-Rssler and then by Rssler alone returned the ideas to algebraic geometry proper. As number theory, algebraic topology, and applied model theory have traditionally been quite separate fields, and it has not been easy for experts on Witt vectors and arithmetic differentiation in one of these fields to keep on top of developments in the others, even though they are working with largely the same mathematical objects. The purpose of the conference, then, is to remedy this. It will bring together researchers in these fields who study Witt vectors and arithmetic differentiation from their own points of view and for their own purposes. This will allow them to learn about the latest developments in other fields. Further, one hopes that bringing together researchers from very different traditions with very different ways of thinking about the same mathematical objects will lead to jolts forward in all of these fields.<br/><br/>Conference web site: https://math.berkeley.edu/~scanlon/aad15.html"
