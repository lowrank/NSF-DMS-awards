This is interpreted  somewhat broadly and is meant to include, for example, the study  of a new class of models.  These models are generated as forcing  extensions of models in which the axiom of determinacy holds.   They are interesting because they provide the first examples of  canonical models in which the Continuum Hypothesis is false.       One consequence of Kurt Godel's results of 60 years ago is  that there will always be mathematical problems which cannot be  solved.  This first became a practical concern 30 years ago when  Paul Cohen showed that Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis cannot be  settled.  Since Cohen's work, numerous problems have been shown  to be unsolvable.  The large cardinal hierarchy provides in many  cases a resolution to the problem of independence.  This is done,  not by resolving the question, but rather by calibrating the  degree to which it is unsolvable.  This hierarchy of axioms, each  of which asserts the existence of a new infinity, emerges as the  fundamental mathematical reality.  The investigator intends to  study this hierarchy in its many manifestations.  ***"

He  expects to obtain more information as to the possible mechanisms  making a type inevitable in the setting of superstable theories  that do not have the Dimensional Order Property (DOP).  Laskowski  expects to complete his classification of those countable  theories for which there are two non-isomorphic models that can  be forced isomorphic by a forcing with the countable chain  condition.  Finally, he will continue his research into an  inherent asymmetry between two new methods of constructing models  of small, superstable theories.       Most of the field of model theory (as a branch of  mathematical logic) is concerned with developing methods for  building algebraic structures with certain properties.  The  problem of whether there is a structure having an element  satisfying an infinite set of properties (i.e., realizing a type)  is well understood: such a structure exists if and only if, for  every finite subset of the type, there is an element satisfying  each of these properties.   However, it is a much more subtle  question to ask whether a given type is inevitable, i.e., whether  EVERY structure contains an element realizing the type.  Without  adding additional restrictions to the class of structures under  consideration, it is known that there can be no satisfactory  criterion for which types are inevitable.  Laskowski will  continue his research on what additional constraints must be  placed on the algebraic structure to yield a natural  characterization of inevitability.  ***"

Some of these questions relate  to expansions of archetypal o-minimal structures and structures  whose domain has as its order type that of the real numbers.   Other problems concerning o-minimality are intended to develop  the structure of groups definable in o-minimal structures as far  as possible in analogy with locally Euclidean groups.  Among the  variants and extensions of o-minimality to be considered are weak  o-minimality and local o-minimality.  It is hoped that the latter  will provide a suitable framework for developing some model  theory for subanalytic sets.  Another goal of the research is to  begin to develop a general model theory for ordered structures,  patterned after stability theory.       The research described above falls under the heading of  model theory within the branch of mathematics called logic.   Model theory attempts to deal with the properties of familiar  mathematical structures which can be described by a formal  mathematical language such as predicate logic.  The focus of this  project is a class that includes and behaves very much like the  polynomial and algebraic functions based on the real numbers that  are studied in freshman calculus and are used to describe many  phenomena.  There has been much exciting progress during the past  five years, in which model theory has played a central role in  deepening our understanding of familiar mathematical systems of  interest in diverse areas of mathematics outside of logic.  ***"

Lipshitz, Z. Robinson and their students will continue  their investigation of rigid subanalytic and semianalytic sets  (i.e. subanalytic and semianalytic sets over an algebraically  closed field which is complete with respect to a non-Archimedean  absolute value).  This investigation will entail further work on  the algebra and geometry of the rings of separated power series.   Among other topics, they will investigate unique factorization,  uniformization, Stein factorization, the singular locus theorem,  and sheaf theory over these rings.  Methods to be used will be  nonstandard models and quantifier elimination from mathematical  logic, together with techniques from commutative algebra and  algebraic geometry.       The sets of points in real space defined by systems of  equations and inequalities among analytic functions are called  analytic sets.  The projection (i.e. the shadow) of such a set on  a lower dimensional subspace is called subanalytic.  Real  subanalytic sets arise in several branches of mathematics, such  as differential equations and geometry.  Similar classes of sets  arise naturally, for example in number theory, over fields  different from the real numbers, where the notion of distance has  rather different properties.  These sets, however, share many of  the nice properties of their real cousins.

The  fundamental aim is to deepen our understanding of computability  and its relation to algebraic structures and to models of various  first order theories.  The approach is to apply algebraic and  model theoretic methods to assemble apparently unrelated and  often chaotic individual results in recursion theory into a  unified theory and to point the way toward future research.  A  recent example is the Slaman-Soare result where a simple  algebraic criterion was discovered which unified many results and  methods on the r.e. degrees over the last 30 years and solved the  long standing problem on extension of embeddings.  In another  area Harrington and Soare have developed a method for generating  automorphisms of the r.e. sets on the one hand and for producing  definable properties on the other, which show that other  automorphisms cannot exist.  In addition, Lachlan and Soare have  applied certain forcing methods to study models of arithmetic and  will develop these further.       The aim is to study computability of sets of integers.  The  first objective is to study computability in terms of the  recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets, namely those which can be  listed by a computable procedure, and to relate their algebraic  structure to the degree of information they encode and to the  speed with which they can be enumerated with respect to some  measure of the complexity of computation.  The second objective  is to study the relationship of computability to other  mathematical objects, for example to certain models, and to  certain algebraic structures.  For algebraic structures, the  general problem is to determine exactly what information can be  coded into a particular type of that structure.  This will give  new information about how information can be coded between sets  and how it can be co ded into an algebraic structure.  ***"

The investigator has  recently introduced a new model-theoretic method of proving  existence theorems, where one can often make an easy computation  to obtain an approximate solution to a problem, and then invoke a  general forcing theorem to get a harder result giving an exact  solution.  The present project will continue development of this  method.       For a variety of problems in both pure and applied  mathematics, it is easy to show that there are approximate  solutions but very difficult to show that there are exact  solutions.  This is typical for stochastic differential  equations, optimization problems, and equilibrium problems.   Keisler's new approach to such problems, which is justified by a  theorem in mathematical logic, can often dramatically simplify  the construction of exact solutions.  This method has already  produced several new results and has the potential of becoming a  valuable and broadly applicable tool.  ***"

Results  showing that some natural problem is algorithmically unsolvable,  as in Godel's proof  1931 , are very fundamental, because they  reveal inherent limitations both to practical and to theoretical  computation.  The unsolvability of Tarski's finite equational  basis problem is solid but unsurprising evidence that finite  algebras can exhibit complexity of a kind that is not found in  the classical algebras, i.e. in finite groups, rings or  semigroups.       The name ""algorithm"" means a general procedure for solving a  problem or performing a calculation.  Godel's proof was  essentially a demonstration that there can be no algorithm to  determine all true arithmetic properties of the natural numbers.   Ideas implicit in his proof were developed by others into the  modern mathematical theory of algorithms (recursive functions,  Turing machines), which led as well, through the work of Alan  Turing and John von Neumann, to the later development of the  stored program computer.  Algebra is a rich source of algorithms,  many of which easily exceed the capabilities of modern computers.   In fact, some of the deepest results of modern mathematics are  centered on algorithmic problems in algebra, and this continues  to be a lively area of research.  It is not illogical to suggest  that important breakthroughs in practical computation may  eventually derive from this theoretical work, although nobody  today can foresee in detail how this would come about.  ***"

This work has already started, on two  fronts.  On the one hand, he formulated a conjecture analogous to  the Lang-Weil estimates, but more general, that would determine  the first order theory of the Frobenius.  On the other hand,  together with several coworkers, he is in the process of carrying  out the fundamental model theoretic analysis of the theory of  difference fields in question, along the lines of Shelah and  Zilber.  Put together, these should throw considerable light on  the issue; there will be applications to finite simple groups and  perhaps to finite groups in general.       The work described in the above paragraph forms part of a  general trend in the area of mathematical logic known as model  theory.  For several decades, this subject developed  autonomously.  The lack of external pressure allowed it to refine  distinct points of view on algebraic structures, and to reach a  degree of technical maturity.  However, this was done as it were  in laboratory conditions, under assumptions (""stability"") that  are too restrictive in practical applications.  The time seems  ripe to test the ideas developed in this period against more  complex structures, in particular, number theoretic and geometric  ones.  This requires identifying structures appropriate for model  theoretic analysis and performing an algebro-geometric analysis  needed to prepare for the model theoretic tools.  It also  requires generalizing the model theoretic ideas beyond the  ""stable"" context in which they were conceived.  Some success has  been had with these methods, including the investigation of  finite structures with a high degree of symmetry, and the proof  of certain conjectures in number theory.  One hopes that this is  only the beginning of the road.  ***"
