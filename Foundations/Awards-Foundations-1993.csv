Set theory contains                   classical mathematics in the sense that every theorem of                        classical mathematics can be formulated as a statement about                    sets, and then formally derived from the standard collection ZFC                of axioms for set theory.  Beginning with the work of Godel                     (1936) and Cohen (1963), set theorists have shown that some                     problems on which mathematicians have worked are independent,                   i.e. neither provable nor disprovable from ZFC.  Some of these                  independent statements are nevertheless known to be provable when               ZFC is augmented by axioms asserting the existence of large                     infinite cardinal numbers.  The instant project has three parts:                first, to continue the study of a class of very large cardinals;                second, to continue the study of the relation of these cardinals                to problems in groups and finite combinatorics; and third, to                   study some unrelated open questions in forcing and infinite                     combinatorics.                                                                        The main subject of this project is connected both to set                 theory and to algebra and topology.  On the algebra/topology                    side, one of the topics to be studied is the classical braid                    groups, which arise in many contexts, including statistical                     mechanics (see for instance Kauffman, New invariants in the                     theory of knots, AMS Monthly, March 1988, 195-241).  The                        connection of this area with the algebras studied in this project               has led to new results about the braid groups.  Moreover, results               on the set theory side of the project have opened the question                  whether some properties of knots and braids will require the                    large cardinal tools of set theory for their solution."

The orthodox view (e.g. Bourbaki)  holds that the ultimate axiomatic foundation for mathematics is  set-theoretical.  However, it is also clear that set theory  itself is concerned mainly with objects (pathological subsets of  the real line, large cardinals, etc.) which are rather far  removed from ordinary mathematics (analysis, algebra,  combinatorics, etc.).  The question which drives this project is:   Which set existence axioms are actually needed to prove specific  theorems of ordinary mathematics?  This question has been  investigated in the context of subsystems of second order  arithmetic, because:  (1) the language of second order arithmetic  is just rich enough to accommodate the bulk of ordinary  mathematical practice; and (2) subsystems of second order  arithmetic embody a detailed classification of set existence  axioms according to ""logical strength"" as measured by proof  theoretic ordinals.  It turns out that, for many specific  theorems of ordinary mathematics, one can precisely determine the  weakest subsystem of second order arithmetic in which the  given theorem is provable.  Furthermore, the subsystems which  arise in this way are few in number and correspond to certain  alternative foundational programs such as recursive analysis  (Myhill-Specker), predicativity (Weyl), predicative reductionism  (Kreisel-Feferman-Friedman), and finitisic reductionism  (Hilbert).  The study of subsystems of second order arithmetic  and their role in the foundations of mathematics has been  vigorously pursued by Stephen G. Simpson, the Principal  Investigator in this project, who is also in the final stages of  writing a book which covers the entire subject.  Some specific  questions which Simpson is currently investigating are: Which set  existence axioms are needed to prove basic theorems in countable  combinatorics (e.g. the dual Ramsey theorem of Carlson and  Simpson, and Laver's th eorem on embeddability of countable linear  orderings) and in Borel combinatorics?  Which set existence  axioms are needed to prove basic theorems of dynamical systems  theory?  Which set existence axioms are needed to prove Lebesgue  measurability of analytic sets?      This project is concerned  with the foundations and logical structure of mathematics.  The  orthodox view, promulgated by the Bourbaki school among others,  is that the ultimate foundation of mathematics is set  theoretical.  This view was basic to the ""New Math"" experiment of  the 1960's.  The research in this project tends to show that, in  certain respects, the orthodox view is incorrect and the  foundational claims of set theory are unwarranted.   Through systematic investigation of the relationships between  axioms and theorems, it emerges that carefully chosen systems of  second order arithmetic provide a logically more appropriate  foundation for mathematics.  ***"

In                   particular, he will focus on definability questions in expansions               with extra analytic structure.  Most of his work over the past                  five years has been concentrated in this area.  He will attempt                 to prove further results of the following character.  (1) Marker,               Macintyre, and van den Dries have shown that the structure of the               real numbers with exponentiation and restricted analytic                        functions is O-minimal and admits elimination of quantifiers.                   O-minimality implies that there is a rich structure theory for                  the definable sets.  (2) Marker and Pillay have shown that any                  non-trivial reduct of an algebraically closed field that contains               addition is strong enough to recover the full field structure.                  (3) Marker has shown that if any non-trivial real structure is                  added to the complex numbers, then the real numbers are                         definable.  These latter two results can be thought of as                       attempts to examine the boundary of algebraic geometry.  The                    first says that weakening algebraic geometry leads to little more               than linear geometry.  The second says that extending algebraic                 geometry leads to the full complications of real algebraic                      geometry.                                                                            While ""definability"" is a logical notion, often it turns out               that the definable sets are ones which arise naturally and are of               great importance.  Model theoretic methods provide a new tool for               their study.  For example, the sets definable in the structure of               the real numbers with exponentiation and restricted analytic                    functions arise naturally in studying analytic geometry,                        dynamical systems, statistics, and control theory."

These structures have significantly  broadened the class of stable structures in recent years.  In  particular, he asks whether structures of this sort can possibly  satisfy the Vaught or Lachlan conjectures, i.e. whether the  theory of such a structure can have finitely many or aleph-one  countable models.  He will also study the relation between  `generic' models for classes of finite structures and recent  advances in the study of `random' models by Spencer.  During the  last twenty years stability theory has developed a technical  apparatus for detailed investigation of a large class of  mathematical structures.  Zil'ber suggested that in fact all  the structures involved were tied very closely to classical  structures.  Hrushovski provided a counterexample to this  conjecture.  Baldwin refined his construction to find a new  non-Desarguesian projective plane.  Baldwin also discovered a  close connection between these structures and the theory of  random graphs.

A common theme of many of the questions to be explored is               the notion of the consistency strength of formal systems.  Among                the questions to be considered are the following:  Did Godel have               a proof of the independence of the axiom of choice from the                     axioms of type-theory prior to Cohen's discovery of forcing?  Is                the non-orthodox system of set-theory proposed by Quine                         consistent?  Can one get significantly more precise estimates on                the ""consistency strength"" of subsystems of second order number                 theory?                                                                              One of the important discoveries of twentieth century logic                is that the kinds of reasoning carried out by mathematicians can                be codified into axiom systems.  The most popular such system, by               far, is the axiom system proposed by Zermelo (and later modified                and corrected by Fraenkel and Skolem), but there are interesting                extensions that have been extensively studied by set theorists as               well as some significantly weaker ones beloved by the                           mathematically cautious.  It has become clear that the study                    of such weak subsystems of set-theory is intimately related to                  large cardinals (a research specialty of Solovay's).  Solovay                   hopes to apply his expertise in large cardinals to achieve a more               precise calibration of the strength of these weak subsystems.                   If successful, this will bring substantial progress to a                        research program of some fifty years duration, which excites                    renewed interest in the present era of computers."

An r.e. set also has an                information content called its Turing-degree; an r.e. set with                  maximum information content is called Turing complete.  The                     collection of r.e. sets form a lattice, and this lattice is the                 most natural setting for studying r.e. sets as sets.  A property of             r.e. sets is invariant if it is respected by all automorphisms of               this lattice.  This project will study invariant sets, and                      automorphisms of this lattice, and their relationship to the                    degrees of r.e. sets.  In particular it will continue the recent                research with Soare studying r.e. sets which are not automorphic to             any complete set (with the hope of finding some general classes of              invariant sets), and studying r.e. sets which are automorphic to a              complete set (with the hope of finding some general constructions               of automorphisms).                                                                   Recursion theory treats an abstract model for computability                that ignores practical limitations of time and space.  In other                 words something is theoretically computable according to this model             if memory and run-time requirements can be shown merely to be                   finite without regard to how large they might actually be.  This                simplification permits a deeper understanding of the nature of                  computability.  Furthermore, it is also clear that in cases where               something can be shown not to be recursively computable, it has                 certainly also been shown not to be computable in any practical                 sense.  Finally, the habits of mind developed by the study of                   recursion theory turn out also to be of practical value, and former             students of this investigator can be found in industry doing                    software development as well as in mathematics departments training             another generation of logicians."

The most important aim of this research will be to extend core                  model theory so that one can prove the existence of a core model                in the presence of a Woodin cardinal.  The probable structure of                this core model is already known; the main problem seems to be to               develop techniques which can be used to prove an extender is a                  member of the core model.

As their name                  suggests, the 'core' of a universe of set theory, if it exists,                 provides a skeleton with a relatively well-defined structure and                thus gives a good deal of information about the form of the full                model.  Since set theory lies at the very foundation of                         mathematics, this enterprise has important consequences for the                 soundness of many accepted mathematical practices, although it is               customary for most working mathematicians to take this on faith."

In recent years several general model-theoretic problems have been systematically approached via the stability-theoretic hierarchy. Even though a problem itself may not involve stability-theoretic notions, considering separately the cases: totally transcendental, superstable, etc., brings into play a mass of technical machinery. Such is the case for Vaught's conjecture, which was proved by Shelah for totally transcendental theories and (over the past 5 years) by Buechler for the superstable theories of finite rank. Buechler intends to continue using the methods of geometrical stability theory to gain insight into Vaught's conjecture for all superstable theories. The geometrical methods bring modules into the picture, allowing for the use of representation theory and other algebra to pin down further the models of these theories. This research lies in the general setting of abstract ""Classification Theory."" In many diverse branches of mathematics researchers attempt to code each element of a class of structures with an element of a ""simpler"" class of structures. The original class is then more easily analyzed, using the more detailed information that one can obtain for this simpler class. Classification Theory is the abstract study of such codings. Researchers have shown that it is possible to determine when such a simplification exists by using only rather basic information about the original class. Buechler intends to study when an abstract class can be simplified down to a very precise class of objects called ""modules,"" which have been studied in great detail by algebraists."
