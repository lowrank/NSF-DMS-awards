Set theory may be                     viewed as containing mathematics, that is, every theorem of                     classical mathematics may be formulated as a statement about                    sets, and then formally derived from the standard collection ZFC                of axioms for set theory.  Beginning with the work of Godel                     (1936) and Cohen (1963), set theorists have shown that problems                 on which mathematicians have worked are independent, i.e. neither               provable nor disprovable from ZFC.  The first and most well-known               example of this is the Godel-Cohen result that Cantor's continuum               hypothesis is independent.  Some statements independent of ZFC                  are nevertheless known to be provable when ZFC is augmented by                  axioms asserting the existence of large infinite cardinal                       numbers.  The project has three parts:  first, to continue                      the study of a class of very large cardinals; second, to continue               the study of the relation of these cardinals to problems in                     finite combinatorics; and third, to study some unrelated topics.                    While the details of proofs in this area are mainly meant                   for experts, it is a remarkably intriguing discovery that some                  very basic mathematical propositions not only have not yet been                 proved or disproved, but can be proved to be unprovable (or                     disprovable)."

Consider the                      natural partial ordering of the degrees of sets computable from                 A.   The investigator will study this in the case where A is                    Cohen generic for n-quantifier arithmetic.  A property is not                   easily seen to be satisfied in this ordering for n-generic A if                 it has more complexity than n.  One needs a priority argument as                well as a forcing argument.  The investigator is developing this                theory.  He has provided a complementation theorem and minimal                  cover theorem.  He plans now to study whether these results hold                for l-generic degrees.  He will also try to solve isomorphism and               automorphism questions which are related to the homogeneity                     conjecture for the whole structure of Turing degrees.  These                    questions have been open for more than twenty years.                                 The degree of computability of a set is measured by its                    Turing degree.  Higher degrees signify the need for more powerful               computational principles.  Although actual machines cannot embody               these higher powers, the mind-set engendered by recursion theory                has been fruitful for those studying machine computability."

There are three                  main areas of effort. The first is the application of                           classification and quantification techniques in knot theory to                  the analysis of enzyme-DNA three-dimensional structure and enzyme               mechanism. Mathematical models, such as the tangle model, will be               developed and perfected, the aim being to produce a mathematical                tool of use to the experimental molecular biologist. The                        mathematics used here is recent work in the theory of                           3-manifolds, and the biological input is experimental results                   obtained from the topological approach to enzymology. The second                area is the study of the topological entanglement of random                     chains in 3-space.  Random chain entanglement statistics are                    related to the conformational entropy of a polymer system in                    dilute solution.  Asymptotic entanglement (as the length goes to                infinity) is reasonably well understood; the fundamental problem                of scientific interest is the description and computation of                    entanglement at finite lengths.  Both rigorous mathematics and                  simulation techniques will be employed.   The third area is the                 topological description of spiral wave patterns in excitable                    media.     The methods of differential topology and obstruction                 theory will be used to provide necessary and sufficient                         conditions for the existence and time evolution of patterns on                  bounded orientable 3-manifolds.                                                      A central problem in molecular biology is to deal with                     long-chain DNA molecules. The way they fold, replicate, and                     recombine is intimately bound up with their functions. The                      behavior of long-chain polymers in solution is a more general                   form of the same questions. Important applications arise in                     genetic engineering, the design of drugs, and the development of                long-chain polymers for industrial and technological uses.  Knot                theory is a part of topology that studies exactly these kinds of                questions: how structures fold and recombine and replicate."

Turing degrees; recursion-theoretic properties of various                       algebraic structures; and computational complexity questions for                polynomially-time-bounded Turing degrees.  Soare recently                       developed with Harrington and Lachlan a very powerful method for                generating new automorphisms of the r.e. sets, and they                         simultaneously found several new definable properties which                     together with the automorphisms answered many fundamental                       questions going back to Post's program (1944) on the relationship               between the algebraic structure of an r.e. set and its Turing                   degree.  These two new methods will be developed further and                    applied to answer other open questions on r.e. sets.  Soare will                continue his study of questions of continuity, definability,                    embeddability, and partial decidability for the structure of the                r.e. Turing degrees. He will complete research on computability                 aspects of various algebraic structures, specially Boolean                      algebras, investigating, for example, which information can be                  coded into their classical isomorphism types.  Finally, he will                 continue research with several collaborators on computational                   complexity questions for the many-one and Turing degrees under                  polynomially-time-bounded Turing computations.                                       The motivation for studying such notions lies in their                     origins.  For example, Turing machines idealize actual computing                devices, and Turing degrees simply order their relative                         computational power.  The elaborate techniques required to prove                theorems in this area sometimes tend to obscure these fundamental               facts, despite an effort to use suggestive terminology, e.g.,                   ""computability"" and ""computational complexity."""

A step towards the objective was taken in the forthcoming                  paper, ""From Discrete to Continuous Time"".  In that paper, a                    concept of forcing was introduced, and it was proved that a wide                class of statements about continuous-time stochastic processes                  are true if and only if forced by a sequence of discrete-time                   stochastic processes.  This forcing theorem can be used to prove                a variety of existence theorems.  For example, the method gives                 proofs of the existence of solutions of many stochastic                         differential equations.  The discrete-time statement is often                   easy to prove, and the forcing theorem does most of the work                    required to get from there to the continuous-time statement.                         The forcing theorem is presently formulated in a way which                 is natural from the point of view of mathematical logic but is                  often more difficult to apply than one would hope.  One reason                  for this is that one must first show that the statement to be                   proved is expressible in terms of ""liftable functions"", which are               defined in a technical way using nonstandard analysis.  The                     investigator is working toward a more general and more convenient               forcing theorem which would use nonstandard notions in its proof                but not in its application.  To complement this effort, the scope               of the method will be tested by developing a wider variety of                   applications to particular problems in probability theory.                           It is surprising that deep methods from mathematical logic                 can be used to obtain alternative and often simpler proofs in the               theory of probability.  However, the investigator has been very                 successful in demonstrating this by example over a period of many               years."

It addresses                  the problem of automatically generating proofs of individual                    lemmas, and also sets forth a general framework for verifying                   large fragments of mathematics through a development of axiomatic               set theory.                                                                          In logic programming, the project considers Prolog-style                   languages.  These derive from logic, but there are serious                      questions about their semantics, and there are several divergent                points of view on what a logic program ""should"" mean.  The goal                 is to clean up the semantics, while still maintaining Prolog's                  efficiency as a programming language.                                                In set theory and topology, three topics of research are                   planned.  (1) Homogeneity properties of compact spaces. (2)                     Real-valued measurable cardinals; recent advances by Gitik and                  Shelah make it reasonable to reconsider some old questions in                   this area. (3) Martin's Axiom (MA) and uncountable cardinals                    below the continuum.  Specifically, the investigator would like                 to find models where MA first fails at a singular cardinal of                   cofinality greater than omega-one and would like to discover                    consistent PFA-style axioms which allow the continuum to be                     greater than omega-two.                                                              This project thus involves several apparently unrelated                    areas, logic programming and proof verification on the one hand                 and set theoretic topology on the other hand.  The former has a                 more obvious relation to practical problems of computer science,                but the underlying connection is through the habits of mind                     cultivated by long study of mathematical logic."

One of the fundamental               ideas of geometric stability theory is a trichotomy between                     geometries of combinatorial, linear, and geometric type.  A                     satisfying structure theory exists in the linear domain, for the                geometries themselves and the structures they coordinatize.  The                regular types of the third type are very poorly understood; until               recently they were believed to consist entirely of algebraic                    geometry objects (in finite rank), but a series of constructions                has shown the class to be much larger.  The research undertaken                 here will attempt to create a map of the nonlinear strongly                     minimal sets.  One goal is Cherlin's conjecture, that aleph-one-                categorical groups are simple algebraic groups over algebraically               closed fields.  In another direction, there are indications that                the geometric trichotomy is valid beyond the existing borders of                stability theory.  The investigator hopes to extend these                       borders, creating a theory of forking, regular types, and the                   parallel of the linear theory, for a class of structures that                   includes all the classical geometries (projective, unitary,                     orthogonal, symplectic) among its (linear) regular types.  This                 would have applications to pseudo-finite structures and possible                interactions with finite group theory.                                               One of the remarkable things about this research area is                   that it shows that a great deal of information about algebraic                  structures can be obtained from intensive study of the                          mathematical language in which one deals with them.  Shelah,                    Hrushovski, and others have pushed this model-theoretic approach                much further in recent years than most people previously thought                possible."

The Connecticut Logic Seminar has met weekly since 1974. Its participants now include the logicians from the University of Connecticut, Wesleyan, Vassar, Southeastern Massachusetts University, and Yale, as well as other faculty from regional schools. Weekly meetings are held on a rotating basis at Connecticut, Wesleyan, Vassar and Yale. The seminar typically ranges over most of current interest in logic, and reflects the interests of the participants and invited speakers. From time to time, an extended period is spent investigating as topic in depth, as was done most recently with Hrushovski's examples of new strongly minimal sets. The seminar is of great value not only to the participating faculty, but to their graduate students."
