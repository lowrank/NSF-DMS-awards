These areas include field theory and commutative and differential algebra; manifolds, both topologically and analytically; uncountable structures and the possibility of presenting and studying them effectively; and Blum-Shub-Smale computability and degree theory for the real numbers.  In field theory, Miller has already made substantial progress, both by asking and answering natural computable-model-theoretic questions about fields, and also by noticing general questions about fields which can be answered using computability theory.  He has taken the lead in introducing computability techniques to researchers outside mathematical logic, and has often been able to interest such people in his questions and his methods.  Fields also intersect with his interest in uncountable structures:  indeed, uncountable fields fit very naturally into the framework of local computability, the approach developed by Miller for considering uncountable structures within the Turing model of computation.  In another approach to uncountable objects, Calvert and Miller have developed a definition of real-computable manifold, using the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation on the real numbers.  They have found that for the study of the fundamental group, the BSS model actually melts away and the Turing model of computation is appropriate.  However, for consideration of distances on manifolds, using geodesics or other ways of defining a metric, they expect that BSS computation or other notions of computation, such as those from computable analysis, will be essential.<br/><br/>Traditional computability theory examines the capabilities of digital computers and the limits on the problems which can be solved using such computers.  Since the pioneering work of Alan Turing, it has been known that many problems cannot be solved by any digital computer running any program whatsoever.  Even these ""noncomputable"" problems can be ranked by difficulty, however: problem A is easier (or at least, no more difficult) than problem B if we can show how a hypothetical program solving B would allow us to solve A as well.  Recently, the PI Russell Miller has made contributions to computable model theory, the branch of this field in which one studies noncomputable problems about specific mathematical structures involving the natural numbers and the rational numbers.  Structures involving all real numbers are much larger and therefore trickier to consider, but Miller and many others have introduced various methods for addressing these structures as well.  Some of these methods use digital computers, while others assume exact-precision arithmetic on the real numbers or other structures.  By examining the limits of these different models of computation, we can understand better how much extra power is provided by exact precision, and which mathematical problems require such precision if they are to be solved."

These questions naturally admit, and benefit from, ideas and methods from graph theory and finite combinatorics. More precisely, Malliaris will work to further develop the theory of characteristic sequences, which are countable sequences of hypergraphs defined on the parameter space of a first-order formula. Malliaris has shown that a deep collection of techniques from graph theory and combinatorics, including Szemeredi regularity, can be brought to bear on model-theoretic structure via the characteristic sequence. Malliaris proposes to further explore these promising connections, which are relevant to many structural questions in unstable theories, including the fine structure of order and independence and the classification of theories with the independence property, as well as to understanding the model-theoretic significance of graph-theoretic phenomena such as edge density and hypergraph regularity in this context.  Moreover, these investigations shed light on the ways in which families of types are realized and omitted in regular ultrapowers, and are therefore relevant to the longstanding open problem of the structure of Keisler's order on unstable theories (a preorder on countable theories which, roughly speaking, measures the difficulty of producing saturated regular ultrapowers).<br/><br/>Model theory is a branch of mathematics which studies the fundamental structure of certain classes of mathematical objects, the models of a given theory. The structural variation which occurs within a given class (or between comparable models of different classes) sheds light on the inherent simplicity, or complexity, of the theory itself.  The work in this proposal arises from new indications that certain theories may have deep and previously undetected structural similarities. These similarities have to do with possible limit behavior, that is, with the complexity of infinite configurations which arise from families of finite combinatorial objects within models of the theory. One broad aim of this work is the development of finer tools to detect this behavior in certain invariants of the theory (e.g. the persistence and distribution of graphs in the characteristic sequence of certain formulas of T).  These ideas would give new leverage in the ongoing program of classifying unstable theories. Model-theoretic classification theory has, over the last forty years, developed a richly informative toolbox for analyzing the complexity of first-order theories and isolated many useful indicators of complexity, but much remains to be done. In particular, a second underlying goal of this work is to give a language in which to precisely ask, and to explore, the largely open questions of distribution and density of these indicators: how and where they cluster and how they interact with other objects in the model, e.g. base sets for types."

He intends to do this by applying techniques from descriptive set theory and geometric measure theory in addition to the model-theoretic and analytic-geometric techniques usually associated with o-minimality. In turn, Miller hopes to apply model-theoretic techniques to obtain results in control theory (specifically, classifying expansions of structures on the real field by trajectories of definable vector fields), descriptive set theory, and geometric measure theory.<br/><br/>Many results of classical mathematics are very general: They apply to a wide range of input, so to speak, and thus tend to produce a wide range of output. But one could hope that if the input is particularly well behaved in some respect, then the output would be similarly well behaved. This turns out to be true in many important cases, but usually requires new, more constructive, proofs of classical results, as well as a deeper understanding of which inputs should be regarded as well behaved. The theory of o-minimal structures on the real field, a sub-discipline of mathematical logic, has been developed in large part to deal with this issue. This has been a rapidly-developing area for the last twenty-five years, with many contributions from, and cooperation between, researchers from several branches of mathematics and logic. Applications have been found in areas as diverse as theoretical economics, neural-net learning theory, and hybrid control systems, as well as in pure mathematics. <br/>However, o-minimality has a drawback: It allows only for the modelling of locally finitely connected behavior, and thus has rather limited use in understanding noisy or oscillatory settings. Miller proposes to develop extensions of o-minimality that can deal with at least some of these non-o-minimal phenomena."

Martin-Lof type theory extends the lambda- calculus by admitting dependent types and terms, and is at least as strong as second-order logic. It is also used as the basis of several high-level programming languages because of its combination of expressive strength and desirable proof-theoretic properties. The system is interpreted into axiomatic homotopy theory using the framework of Quillen model categories and relying on related algebraic methods involving (weak) higher-dimensional groupoids.  This permits logical methods to be combined with algebraic and topological ones, admitting theoretical and computational applications of type theory in homotopy and higher-dimensional algebra.<br/><br/>This research pursues a surprising connection between Geometry, Algebra, and Logic which was discovered by the PI and is now under active investigation by several researchers worldwide. In addition to its importance in foundations of mathematics, it has strong potential for direct applications in computer science.  Logical systems of the kind investigated are used extensively in programming language design and implementation.  The new geometric and algebraic interpretations are of use both in securing the correctness of applied systems and as a theoretical model of the computational paradigms implemented by such systems.  Conversely, computational applications in geometry and algebra are made likely by the well-developed computational implementations of the logical system.  The broader impact of the research is both in applications in science and technology and in graduate education.  A doctoral student in Carnegie Mellon's Pure and Applied Logic program is partially supported under this research project.

This is equivalent to understanding sets of homomorphisms between a pair of discrete groups (the domain representing the equations and the target the group of interest).  The first half of this project is motivated by the theory of S-bundles, where S is a compact orientable surface.  Surface bundles arise throughout pure mathematics.  If B is a manifold (or other reasonable space), then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of isomorphism classes  (oriented) of S-bundles over B and the set of (conjugacy classes of) homomorphisms from the fundamental group of B to the mapping class group of S.  The PI intends to develop a general structure theory for this set when the fundamental group of B is finitely  generated (which will always happen when B is compact, for example).  In the second half of this project (joint work with H, Wilton), we study homomorphisms to free (and more generally torsion-free hyperbolic) groups.  Broadly speaking, this is the class of `negatively-curved' groups.  This study is motivated by the first-order logic of these groups.  It is quite remarkable that the geometry of negative curvature has profound implications for first-order logic.  We intend to study these first-order theories from an algorithmic point of view, and find general decision processes which determine if a logical sentence is true or false.      Groups form a natural language for studying symmetries of mathematical objects.  As such, they arise throughout mathematics, and their study is informed by many branches of mathematics.  There are very few basic properties of a `symmetry', the most important of which is that it doesn't lose any information about the space, so it can be undone.  In this project, we treat the groups as objects of intrinsic interest, although the questions that we ask take their motivation from topology, geometry, logic and computer science as well as from within group theory.  Broadly speaking, we take a collection of equations over a group G, and try to understand the set of all solutions to these equations.  In the first half of the project, the group G is the mapping class group of a surface, which captures much of the symmetry of a surface (a space which looks like the plane in small sets).  Studying equations over the mapping class group is of fundamental interest in geometry and topology, through the study of surface bundles (a space which nearby any point decomposes into a pair of smaller sets, one of which is a surface).  The study of equations over the mapping class group gives a general theory parametrizing surface bundles.  The second half of this project studies equations over groups from the point of view of logic, and looks for general algorithms which decide if logical sentences are true of false.    This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Foundations Program."

It is motivated by basic foundational questions, like understanding the nature of complete classification of mathematical objects, up to some notion of equivalence, by invariants, and creating a mathematical framework for measuring the complexity of such classification problems This theory is developed within the context of descriptive set theory, which provides the basic underlying concepts and methods. On the other hand, in view of its broad scope, it has natural interactions with many other areas of mathematics, such as model theory, computability theory, the theory of topological groups and their representations, topological dynamics, ergodic theory, operator algebras, and combinatorics. Within this general program it is proposed to study: (i) newly developed connections between the topological dynamics of automorphism groups of countable structures and finite Ramsey theory as well as a related semigroup framework for such connections with infinite Ramsey theory; (ii) the concepts of genericity and ample genericity in Polish groups and their relation to other structural properties of groups such as the small index property, uncountable cofinality, the Bergman finite generation property, fixed point properties for actions on trees and automatic continuity; (iii) the global theory of ergodic group actions, including the study of complexity of classification problems arising in ergodic theory; (iv) aspects of measurable combinatorics.<br/><br/>A fundamental question that arises in many fields of mathematics is that of classifying a given collection of objects under study. This amounts to providing a ""catalog"" or ""listing"" of these objects, in principle not unlike that of cataloging species in biology or stars and galaxies in astronomy. If such a classification is possible, one has a ""complete"" understanding of the mathematical structures involved.  Otherwise a more or less ""chaotic"" behavior is expected. It is thus very important to understand under what circumstances a classification is possible. This difficult foundational question is further complicated by the fact that what constitutes an acceptable classification is very much dependent on the particular field of mathematics studied, so the criteria for a ""good"" classification in one area might not be appropriate in another.  At its basic level, this project aims to develop a general quantitative theory, which in many situations can precisely measure the complexity of a classification problem and thus provide objective means by which one can decide, in any given field, whether a satisfactory classification of the objects in question is possible. Developments arising in this program often lead to the study of the symmetries of various mathematical structures and their dynamics and this is another important aspect of this project."

Finite-state automata are Turing machines with fixed finite bounds on resource use.  Continuing a tradition of studying that part of mathematics which can be performed effectively, the field of automatic structures explores mathematical objects which can be represented by automata.  Questions about automatic structures may be grouped into two themes: developing structural characterizations and studying algorithmic consequences of such characterizations. Dr. Minnes has worked in both of these areas, including proving both positive and negative results about the existence of such characterizations. Through this NSF grant, she will work towards answering these guiding questions in the context of less understood classes of structures.  For example, the fundamental groups associated with certain manifolds have intimate connections with automata and some sequences arising in symbolic dynamics and combinatorics may be seen as generated by automata.  The tools developed by the automatic structures community may lead to a better structural understanding of these objects.  In parallel,  Dr. Minnes seeks to develop the area of automatic model theory.   Much work has been done in understanding how the standard results of model theory change when restricted to the framework of computable or polynomial-time objects.  Preliminary work shows interesting analogies in the automatic structures world and suggests the promise of fruitful results.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>With the increasing reliance of the modern world on computerized and networked systems, the theoretical underpinnings of computational feasibility have gained more immediate relevance.  Starting in the 1950s, the Turing machine, an idealized model of a computer with no bounds on memory use or computation time, led to astonishing and foundational insight into what problems can or cannot be solved by any algorithm.  This NSF project focusses on a different model for the computer, the finite automaton, which more closely captures online computation and resource bounds.  Dr. Minnes will study questions which relate finite automata both to traditional topics of mathematical logic  and to new interactions with other fields of mathematics and computer science."

The analysis done so far indicates that the solution to the problem lies on the intersection of descriptive set theory and model theory (branches of logic), Ramsey theory (a branch of combinatorics), and topological dynamics (a branch of topology).<br/>To be more precise, by a work of Irwin and Solecki that uses model theoretic ideas, the dynamical problem can be translated into a purely Ramsey theoretic question concerning finite objects.

Today, we know that they appear naturally in many mathematical contexts, for example, in fluid dynamics, in smooth dynamical systems living in Euclidean spaces, among topological groups, in the study of continuous functions, etc. Solecki intends to gain a better understanding of the pseudo-arc by using methods from diverse subfields of mathematics (combinatorics, logic).<br/>Problems that have arisen in these investigations have already lead to new theorems that are of purely combinatorial and of purely topological interest. Such mutually stimulating interactions between distinct areas of mathematics are expected to continue. In a similar manner, other parts of the project feature interactions of descriptive set theory, model theory, topological dynamics, and combinatorics in the study of extreme amenability and in classification of mathematical objects according to Tukey reductions."

One central question in this investigation is to give necessary and suffcient conditions on an infinite binary sequence X which ensure that there is a continuous measure m such that X is effectively or arithmetically random relative to m.  This is a classic mathematical problem, given an individual data set determine a distribution which would generate it.  By results of Reimann and Slaman, for all but countably many X there is such an m. The argument is highly meta-mathematical. Necessarily so, as Reimann and Slaman have also shown that this co-countability theorem cannot be proven without invoking infinitely many iterations of the power set of the reals. In the emerging picture, there is a close interaction between a sequence's failure to have a random ingredient and it's being structurally definable, which should be studied more deeply.<br/><br/>Slaman's proposal can be viewed in the context of the continuing investigation of computability and mathematical definability. With quantitative mathematical analysis of these phenomena, one can answer questions of the form ``Is there an algorithm to solve all problems of a this type?'', ``Is there a simple example with specific properties'', ``Is there a concrete classification of all structures with these properties?''. One can also address questions of the sort ``Are these techniques adequate to resolve this question?'' or ``How random must a sequence be in order to exhibit a particular typical behavior?''

Similarly, one must develop a detailed theory of definability to show that there is no simple example with certain properties or to show that certain phenomena do not have concrete classifications."

Model theory has already made substantial contributions in all three areas, and the principal investigator plans to further extend these contributions, and come up with new ones.<br/><br/>Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, which studies sets defined by formulas in a formal language from the point of view of their geometry. As a result, it allows one to treat geometrically concrete situations in which geometry is not apparent otherwise.

The proposed project will apply such techniques to problems in algebra, geometry and differential equations."

Many theorems in Ramsey theory can be proven using infinitary methods, in the form of ultraproducts, nonstandard analysis, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory.  Proof mining extracts finite information from these infinite arguments.  The proposed research will apply the methods of proof mining in order to investigate: 1) explicit bounds on numerical quantities which are not made apparent by infinite proofs, 2) approximations of infinitary Ramsey theoretic statements which ""quantify"" (typically, with a countable ordinal) how transfinite a given construction is, and 3) new finitary analogs of infinitary methods.  Where necessary, the proposed research will also expand the repertoire of proof mining tools by investigating how to interpret higher order notions, particularly the topological structure of the ultrafilters, in finitary terms.<br/><br/>Questions in mathematics about concrete, finite properties of the integers often turn out to have answers that make use of abstract, infinite notions.  The goal of the area of proof theory known as ""proof mining"" is to develop tools for explaining this phenomenon.  Often, we discover that there are finite methods which can replace the infinite ones, at the price of making the argument much more difficult to understand.  Some of these arguments are so unwieldy that it is difficult to imagine that they could be discovered directly.  By ""unwinding"" the infinite argument into finite arguments, however, we often discover new information.  For example, infinite proofs often prove that a number with some property exists while providing no information about which number it is; the corresponding finite argument, however, typically gives an upper bound on the size of that number."

Scanlon will study Galois theory, or the theory of symmetries, of general systems of equations involving operators by employing this process of linearization, the logical theory of liaison groups, and a Tannakian formalism.  In addition, he will address specific questions about algebraic relations on special points by using the fine structure theory for definable sets in difference fields as well as the model theory of valued fields and of real geometry via the theory of o-minimality.  <br/>Finally, Scanlon will develop the model theory of the theory of the Witt vectors with analytic structure and the relative Frobenius.  Scanlon will use this theory both as a proving ground for the general theory of metastability and as a logically tame theory in which arithmetic problems may be encoded believing that this theory may ground a new theory of motivic integration in which finite dimensional difference varieties play the role of algebraic varieties. Scanlon will develop a model theory of p-jets independent of the prime p from which uniformities in number theoretic problems may be deduced.<br/><br/><br/>Model theory, in the sense of mathematical logic, gives a unifying perspective for studying questions in disparate branches of mathematics as instances of a general theory. For example, it may ground fanciful, but suggestive, theories in which techniques appropriate to the study of geometry and differential equations are transposed to investigate numbers.  In the opposite direction, its very general methods for understanding symmetries of structures and more importantly symmetries of one part of a structure relative to another part when specialized to concrete mathematical questions about differential and difference equations reveal otherwise unknown theories of symmetries.  With this project, Scanlon will explore the underlying unity of mathematics as seen from mathematical logic from the theories of differential equations, to dynamical systems, to number theory."

The first measures the information content of finite binary strings, while the second captures the intuition that a random infinite binary sequence has no ""distinguishing features"". Both notions are rooted in computability theory, so it is natural that the study of randomness draws methods and ideas from computability theory, as well as classical mathematical subjects like measure theory and information theory. On the other hand, ideas from effective randomness have fed back into computability theory and even reverse mathematics, so there is cross-fertilization between effective randomness and other fields. Moreover, the theory of effective randomness has proved to be a rich field of study in its own right. Miller proposes to study the interaction between effective dimension and computational power, the interaction between degrees of randomness and computational power, triviality and lowness notions, and the strength of non-monotonic betting strategies.<br/><br/>A sequence of zeros and ones is considered random if the shortest<br/>(binary) computer program that generates the sequence has essentially the same length as the sequence itself. Intuitively, a random sequence has no patterns that can be exploited to give a compressed description. For example, the sequence consisting of a million zeros can be generated easily by a short program, so it is not random. On the other hand, there is a high probability that a sequence generated by flipping a coin a million times (tails is zero, heads is one) will be random. The length of the shortest program for a sequence is called the Kolmogorov complexity of the sequence; this notion was introduced in the 1960s. An infinite sequence is considered random if all of its finite initial segments are sufficiently random. This is equivalent to saying that no (semi-)computable betting strategy can win money trying to predict the digits of the sequence. The proposed research will address fundamental questions about randomness. Some are speculative, such as: ""What does it mean to say that one sequence is more random that another?"" This question has lead to difficult technical problems.<br/>It has motivated much of Miller's work on the initial segment complexity of Martin-Löf randoms and has recently led to the formulation of a notion that seems to come closer to providing a satisfactory answer. On the other hand, technical work often reveals higher level patterns. For example, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the assertion: ""More random sequences are less useful as oracles and computationally useless random sequences are automatically more random."" This ties back into the question about what it means to be ""more random"". Other basic questions, such as ""To what extent can we distill information out of a semi-random source?""<br/>have lead to interesting work but have not been exhausted on a technical level. Still others, like ""How powerful are betting strategies that are allowed to bet on the digits of a sequence in any order?"" remain largely open, despite concentrated effort. These are all fundamental questions that have proved to have interesting technical aspects."
