The research considers the feasibility of classifying the transformations that characterize dynamical evolution based on categorizing systems according to their numerical or algebraic properties. Previous work has shown that this is impossible for certain common types of concrete dynamical systems. Such negative results are of interest since they provide additional evidence of the immense diversity and complexity of transformations studied in ergodic theory and the theory of dynamical systems. The current project involves extending these impossibility results to other longstanding classification questions.<br/><br/>The research involves applying techniques in descriptive set theory to questions in ergodic theory and dynamical systems. This investigation expands a long-term project in ergodic theory to explore questions in differentiable dynamical systems linked to classification problems. Specifically, the investigator and a collaborator showed that von Neumann's 1932 proposal to classify diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds up to measure isomorphism was impossible because the equivalence relation is not Borel (therefore impossible using inherently countable methods). This project aims to extend that result to show that the topological equivalence relation is intractable."

Model theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies mathematical structures and their definable sets (i.e., the basic sets that ""live"" in those structures). On the other hand, differential and difference equations are equations that describe how things change with time and are the fundamental tools that modern science and engineering use to model physical reality. The basic idea of the project will be to view the set of solutions of a differential or difference equation as a definable set in an appropriate structure, and use the tools of model theory to understand its properties. The equations that the project focuses on -- the Painlevé differential and difference equations and the Schwarzian differential equations -- appear in many important physical applications such as statistical mechanics and general relativity, as well as in important problems in number theory. <br/><br/>The project builds on recent successes by model theorists to use techniques from geometric stability theory to classify special cases of these differential equations according to the trichotomy theorem in differentially closed fields of characteristic zero. The investigator will extend his work on the generic Painlevé (differential) equations to non-generic ones as well as to the Schwarzian equations. The objective is to both fully describe the structure of the sets of solutions and to use such descriptions to better our understanding of geometrically trivial sets in the theory. This work is expected to have applications to problems in number theory and functional transcendence theory. The project will also transport some of the ideas and techniques used to study classical differential equations to the difference setting. The main challenge will be to develop a notion of irreducibility (in the sense of classical functions) for difference equation and show that the difference Painlevé equations are irreducible. In addition to model theory, the work will also employ techniques from algebra and geometry and from the analytic study of differential/difference equations."

While this method originates in foundational questions, over the years profound applications to the study of many central objects of classical mathematics and computer science were discovered. This project will investigate an emerging connection to the area of graph theory. Graphs are the basic discrete mathematical objects used to model networks and related systems. In combinatorics, one often investigates the asymptotic behavior of various quantitative properties (such as the density of the edges, or the size of a certain regular pattern) for large finite graphs. Model theory provides a method of converting asymptotic quantitative questions about properties of a family of graphs into qualitative questions about the shape, volume or dimension of a certain limiting infinite object (via the so-called ultraproduct construction). Infinitary model-theoretic machinery to study such limit objects will be used to address questions in finite graph combinatorics, and conversely rich body of results in combinatorics will be used to attack open questions in model theory.<br/><br/>As demonstrated in the previous work of the principal investigator and other researchers, recent advances on pseudo-randomness and Ramsey-type phenomena for restricted families of graphs (e.g. semialgebraic regularity lemma by Fox et al., Tao's algebraic regularity lemma over finite fields, regularity lemma for graphs of finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension by Lovasz-Szegedy, etc.) admit a uniform model-theoretic treatment well-aligned with the methods and ideas in Shelah's classification theory. This project initiates a systematic program of investigating these connections, centered around the study of Keisler measures and various model-theoretic notions of dimension (e.g. coming from forking independence or pseudofinite counting) in tame classes of first-order structures (stable, distal, dependent, simple, NTP2, etc.), as well as the finer questions on generalized ""incidence bounds"" and their relation to Zilber's trichotomy phenomena."

Within 40 years the key principles of Set Theory were discovered, these are the ZFC axioms, and the stage was set for the detailed development of transfinite mathematics, or so it seemed. However, in a completely unexpected development, Cohen showed in 1963 that even the most basic problem of Set Theory was not solvable on the basis of these principles alone. That problem was the widely discussed and celebrated problem of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis. The 50 years since Cohen's announcement has seen a vast development of Cohen's method and to the realization that the occurrence of unsolvable problems is ubiquitous in Set Theory. This arguably challenges the very conception of Cantor on which Set Theory is based. However, during this same period, the detailed study of special cases of the Continuum Hypothesis led to a remarkable success. This was the discovery and validation of a key new principle for Second Order Number Theory. Second Order Number Theory is the study of the structure of all sets of counting numbers, and this is just Set Theory in its simplest incarnation. The resulting theory is largely immune to Cohen's method. The prospect that this could somehow be extended to produce an analogous new principle for Set Theory itself (as a single additional axiom to the ZFC axioms) has always seemed completely hopeless. But that belief was itself based on a misconception and recent discoveries suggest there is a resolution. These discoveries were the result of prior NSF supported research. This project continues and expands the research based on these discoveries.<br/><br/>Gödel's consistency proof for the Axiom of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis involves his discovery of the Constructible Universe of Sets. The axiom ""V = L"" is the axiom which asserts that every set is constructible. This axiom settles the Continuum Hypothesis and more importantly,  Cohen's method of forcing  cannot be used in the context of the axiom ""V = L"". However the axiom V = L is  false since it limits the fundamental nature of infinity. In particular the axiom refutes (most) strong axioms of infinity. A key question emerges. Is there an ""ultimate"" version of Gödel's constructible universe L yielding an axiom ""V = Ultimate L"" which retains the power of the axiom ""V = L""  for resolving questions like that of the Continuum Hypothesis, which is also immune against Cohen's method of forcing, and yet which does not refute strong axioms of infinity? This vague question has been recast, through previously supported research,  into a specific and precise conjecture; the Ultimate L Conjecture. The goal of this project is to resolve that conjecture."

In addition to the regular scientific program, the conference will feature a presentation and a discussion on Wikipedia editing in Mathematics, including a practical how-to guide and demonstration.<br/><br/>Interaction with computation permeated the development of geometric group theory, from the work of Max Dehn in the 1910s, through the work of Turing in 1930s, the Novikov-Boone Theorem in the 1950s and the theory of word-hyperbolic and automatic groups in the 1990s, to the present day. Now group theorists are interested not just in decidability of various problems but in specific low-complexity estimates. Various data compression techniques (such as straight-line programs, power circuits, etc.) have found amazing applications to group-theoretic decision problems. In turn, geometric group theory has repaid in kind and produced powerful ideas that have found applications in computer science and computability theory. Thus, the notion of ""generic-case complexity"" as a way of capturing the practical behavior of an algorithm on ""most"" inputs (and distinct from average-case complexity) was born in geometric group theory. This notion has led to the development of the theory of coarse and generic computability in computational complexity, which is now transforming that subject. The ideas of CAT(0) cubical geometry, coming from geometric group theory, are finding useful applications in computational topology, robotics, and computer science. The conference aims to take stock of these developments and map possible future venues of interaction between geometric group theory, computer science and computability theory. <br/><br/>More detailed information can be found at the conference website, http://web.stevens.edu/algebraic/Schupp/"

First, the investigator will generalize his work on the differential algebra of the j-function to understand the differential equations satisfied by analytic covering maps associated with various Shimura varieties. This line of work is expected to have number theoretic consequences related to special-point conjectures as it did in the case of modular curves. The project will also investigate several finiteness results in differential algebra; this line of work is expected to have consequences on effective bounds in number theory and in computational differential algebra. The project aims to develop various aspects of the model theory of supersimple and superstable groups as a generalization of recent work in differential algebraic and difference algebraic groups. The project will investigate the classification of disintegrated strongly minimal sets in differentially closed fields. This work seeks to answer a fundamental question about differential equations: what are the possible structures given by the differential algebraic relations between solutions to a fixed differential equation? Finally, this project aims to adapt and generalize results from algebraic foliations and vector fields for application in differential algebraic geometry."

Algebra is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, whereas model theory is a branch of mathematical logic, a fairly new subject that originated in the late 19th century with philosophical investigations into the foundations of mathematics. However, in recent decades logic has found many applications in other parts of mathematics, in computer science, and even in engineering. For about fifteen years, the PI has been involved in a collaborative effort to develop a model-theoretic treatment of asymptotic analysis. These investigations are naturally related to other fields within mathematics (mainly logic and analysis) but may also lead to novel applications of differential equations in science and engineering. They recently led to some decisive positive results, and many questions which seemed out of reach previously may now be answerable.<br/><br/>More concretely, the goal of this project is to unify three seemingly very different approaches to enrich the real continuum by infinitesimal and infinite quantities: surreal numbers, germs of real-valued functions, and transseries. Surreal numbers have a combinatorial flavor and encompass Cantor's ordinal numbers; they were introduced by J. H. Conway in the 1970s in connection with game theory. Germs of real-valued functions are central objects in analysis; they were first systematically studied by P. du Bois-Reymond in the 1870s. Transseries are formal objects that model the growth rates of such germs at infinity; they arose in both analysis and logic during the 1980s. Their formal nature also makes transseries suitable for machine computations in computer algebra systems. The goal of this proposal is to deepen our understanding of these structures, and to establish links between them. For example, we would like to know: Are there analytic structures (Hardy fields) with the same logical features as transseries? Is there a natural isomorphism between surreals and transseries? Answers to questions such as these may now be within grasp due to fundamental advances in our understanding of the ideas of number, series, and function within the last decade, and would exhibit heretofore unknown relationships between them."

Set theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines, with common historical roots, and they serve as essential tools in many areas of mathematics. Set theoretic applications to topology have invigorated both fields since the proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis fifty years ago, and the synergy between them continues to invigorate the field of set-theoretic topology. Techniques developed to solve central questions in the field were instrumental in the development of the method of forcing, combinatorial set theory, and Ramsey theory. Set-theoretical techniques are also fundamental in recent work on the structure of non-separable Banach spaces and the study of rings of continuous functions and topological vector spaces. Quite naturally, set-theoretic topology also is close to logic and has much in common with finite combinatorics and theoretical computer science in its study of partial orders, Boolean algebra, and continuous lattices.<br/><br/>This conference will feature both three plenary talks and eighteen contributed research talks, as well as a session on open problems.

Model theory develops various ways of measuring the complexity of a class of functions or sets, one of which is called Vapnik-Chervonenkis (or VC) dimension and was independently discovered by researchers in statistical learning theory in the 1970's.  One part of the project is studying the fine structure of systems with finite VC dimension. A related measure of the complexity of a class of sets is called stability and another aspect of the project is using the model-theoretic understanding of stable systems to compute the equations  satisfied by special functions such as the exponential function.  Describing the symmetries of spaces and systems is a pervasive aspect of the research which ties together its various components.<br/><br/>The project has four interrelated aspects, (i) stability theory and theories without the independence property, (ii) topological dynamics, model theory, and pseudo-finite groups, (iii) tame theories of differential fields, (iv) Ax-Lindemann for semiabelian families and differential Galois theory. At the abstract level model theory is about the classification of first order theories, and part (i) is firmly of this nature. The methods and results obtained in ""pure"" model theory are often mathematically meaningful in concrete contexts, leading to new interrelations with other areas of mathematics. In particular in (iv) the PI will study transcendence properties of ""exponential"" functions relative to certain families of commutative algebraic groups, making use of a certain Galois theory of differential equations which is given by constructions in stability-theory (part of model theory). The project also connects to and impacts on topological dynamics, and also potentially and indirectly combinatorics (via the study of certain measures on definable sets in theories without independence property)."

Many celebrated results in logic from the first half of the 20th century concerned the existence of objects considered wild. Gödel's proof of the undecidability of arithmetic established that this structure is complicated (or wild) from a logical viewpoint. Such results are negative in spirit as they point to the limitations of mathematical reasoning. However, in the second half of the last century the focus changed. Model theorists found a vast number of tame mathematical structures that exhibit no such wildness, and for often very different reasons are amenable to model-theoretic methods. This program of identifying and analyzing tame classes of structures whose model theory can be understood came to be known as the geography of tame mathematics, and in its various forms has dominated model theory throughout the last thirty years. Although arising as a program of foundational importance, it has led to striking applications of model theory to other areas of mathematics, most recently to the André-Oort conjecture in number theory. Since this program is to explore areas of tame mathematics, these connections are not coincidental at all. The development of such interactions has proven again and again to have far reaching applications outside of logic that could not have been envisioned beforehand.<br/><br/>This project continues this line of research in the setting of expansions of the real line. It aims to settle important open questions within model theory, but also naturally develops new connections between model theory and other areas in logic such as neostability and descriptive set theory, and outside of logic such as geometric measure theory and geometric group theory. The investigator will lead a large scale investigation of dividing lines between tame and wild behavior arising in the study of the geometry of definable sets in ordered structures. Building on early advances, the investigator will determine far reaching consequences of various logical tameness conditions on the topological and metric tameness of definable sets. Furthermore, the project comprises new challenges in the classification of classes of structures considered tame. The educational component of this CAREER grant ties together the investigator's research with his teaching and outreach efforts. This project involves undergraduate and graduate students and young researchers in the investigator's research program, strengthens the ties between model theory and other branches of mathematics, and continues the investigator's outreach efforts in the Urbana-Champaign area."

The subject has long thrived in its connections with classical areas of mathematics such as harmonic and functional analysis and logic. Over the course of the last 25 years, however, a vast number of new interactions have opened up the field to novel and exciting directions. The semester long program will organize a number of activities in and around modern aspects of descriptive set theory and its links with other areas of mathematics. An important focus is to facilitate research on the structure of Polish topological groups, which recently has gathered momentum partially due to work in descriptive set theory.

Whereas algebra studies various operations (addition, multiplication etc.) on various sets by classifying them according to what rules, or axioms, they satisfy, model theory takes a broader perspective and looks at all possible operations at once and attempts to classify them according to their combinatorial complexity. Some tame classes of operations are singled out for which then general theorems can be proved. Those in turn will apply to specific situations in different areas of mathematics (algebra, geometry, number theory...). This project lies at the border between the abstract and the applied side. The investigator plans to study two rather broad notions of tameness and apply this study to certain algebraic structures. <br/><br/>More precisely, the aim of this project is the study of definable groups in NIP and NTP_2 structures and more specifically in valued fields, and PRC fields and the general development of NTP_2. Our guiding intuition is that in NTP_2, ideals should work as a common generalization of non-forking extensions in simple theories and measures in NIP. Also, there should be an analogue of distality in this setting. On the more applied side, we plan to develop tools for the study of non-definably amenable groups both in NIP and NTP_2; test questions being the classification of all groups definable in PRC fields and a decomposition theorem for non-abelian metastable groups."

New techniques in previously impenetrable areas have exposed interplay between the prima facie disparate areas of forcing axioms, infinite cardinal combinatorics, and inner model theory. Although there have been some tremendous progress on the core problems of set theory, still some fundamental problems remain a mystery. The scope of the conference will include: the theory of definable actions of Polish groups, the structure and classification of their orbit spaces, the closely related study of definable equivalence relations and complete classification problems (in model theory, computability theory, groups representations, topological dynamics, ergodic theory, operator algebras, and combinatorics), advances in the study of PCF theory, cardinal arithmetic, the determination of the consistency strength of combinatorial principles, and application to other fields of mathematics."

First, the project will study possible behaviors of the mathematical universe using Zermelo-Frenkel set theory as a foundation. The main goal is to understand infinitary combinatorics through the lens of forcing and large cardinals. Second, the project will investigate the connections between set theory and an abstract view of model theory. Many assertions in model theory turn out to have set theoretic content, and the investigator will pursue the question of when there is such a connection and when there is not. Third, the project will explore the relatively recent field of descriptive graph combinatorics and its connections with classical questions in geometry and measure theory. <br/><br/>From infinitary combinatorics, the project will focus on the tree property, which is a compactness principle that abstracts the Konig infinity lemma to higher cardinals. A specific goal of the project is to explore the conjecture that modulo the consistency of large cardinals the least uncountable cardinal is the only cardinal which provably carries a counterexample to the tree property. The project will also pursue other similar questions. From model theory, the investigator will study model theoretic notions connected to the classification theory of abstract elementary classes and their set theoretic content. Particular properties of interest are tameness and locality, categoricity, and Hanf numbers. From descriptive graph combinatorics, the investigator will explore matchings and colorings in definable graphs. This study has already been shown to have interesting connections with questions in geometry, for example Marczewski's question about whether the Banach-Tarski paradox is possible using Baire measurable pieces."

Some mathematical objects, constructions, and proofs are more complicated than others. Logicians have developed various ways of measuring this complexity. When one is in interested in countable objects -- with which a large portion of mathematics is concerned -- the tools to measure these complexities come from computability theory. The objective of this project is to draw connections between complexity issues and structural issues to improve understanding of what shapes and forms complexity can take. <br/><br/>This project is part of an ongoing study of the structure that emerges when considering computability theoretic properties on a cone, that is, properties that hold relative to almost every oracle with respect to Martin's measure. In particular, the project will explore the connections between Vaught's conjecture and computability theory, and the generalizations of the uniform Martin's conjecture. A few years ago, connections between computable structure theory and Vaught's conjecture emerged unexpectedly. While it may take many years to see Vaught's conjecture settled, this project pursues a particular aspect: its connections to computability theory."
