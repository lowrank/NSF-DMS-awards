This multiverse of equivalent descriptions tends to grow in complexity as the associated objects of study become more complex, and it often becomes very difficult to solve the associated ?classification problem?, i.e., to design an efficient method for telling whether two concrete descriptions correspond to the same object or to two different objects. It is a notoriously hard problem for example to decide whether two different concrete solutions of Einstein?s equations are descriptions of the exact same physical reality and an open problem to find measurable quantities which are invariant under the arbitrary change of coordinates. Invariant descriptive set-theory is an area of mathematical logic which provides a formal framework for measuring the intrinsic complexity of such classification problems and for deciding, in each case, which types of invariants are ?too simple? to be used for a complete classification. It also provides an important link between topological dynamics and the meta-mathematics of classification as best exemplified by Hjorth?s theory of turbulence. Unfortunately, few things are known beyond the point of turbulence. Indeed, dynamical phenomena beyond the point of turbulence reside in groups of symmetries which are neither locally-compact nor non-archimedean, rendering classical methods of harmonic analysis and discrete model theory insufficient. However, a series of recent breakthroughs coming from the work of the PI and others suggest some new strategies for dealing with such dynamics. Through this program we initiate the systematic study of such dynamical phenomena which are ?wilder? than turbulence and which can serve as obstructions to more general forms of classification.<br/><br/>The proposed research program features four independent?yet mutually interacting?projects. The first project addresses the question of whether there exist obstructions to classification by actions of the unitary group of the infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space. In doing so it will examine the connections between the Borel reduction hierarchy and some recent developments in metric model theory regarding the correspondence between stability/NIP and reflexive/Rosenthal representability. The second project focuses on the dynamics of homeomorphism groups. Among others, it addresses the long-standing open problem of whether the homeomorphism group of the interval admits a turbulent action and it proposes some ?higher dimensional? variants of turbulence which could be used as obstructions to classification by actions of homeomorphism groups of n-dimensional compacta. The third project proposes a unified framework for extracting the geometric content of various turbulent phenomena which are associated with dynamics of Banach spaces. The fourth project addresses several questions regarding the dynamics of Polish groups that do not admit two-sided invariant metrics which stem from the recent work of the PI and others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Exhaustive classification of all such systems is impossible, and it is fruitful to study notions of equivalence when dynamical systems share orbits but traverse them in a different order or share paths but follow them with different speeds. Such relations are called orbit equivalence relations. Due to their statistical nature, ergodic theoretical conclusions always leave the possibility of an exceptional behavior on some outlying orbits. Borel dynamics is a mathematical discipline that strives to adapt and enhance ergodic theoretical methods to study all orbits of a dynamical system, ruling out any exceptions. The PI will investigate variants of orbit equivalence within the scope of Borel dynamics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>This project concentrates on the study of orbit equivalence relations of Borel flows. Complete classification of measure-preserving transformations is known to be an infeasible task, and ergodic theory has been advanced with the introduction of notions of equivalence that are weaker than the isomorphism. Notable examples include orbit equivalence, (even) Kakutani equivalence, and alpha equivalence, all of which can be viewed under the unified umbrella of restricted orbit equivalence formalism. The PI intends to investigate corresponding notions of orbit equivalence within the scope of Borel dynamics. Problems investigated in this project are likely to have connections with Borel combinatorics, ergodic theory, symbolic dynamics, and descriptive set theory of Polish group actions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, simple concepts are often used to approximate, illuminate, or even define more complicated concepts.  For example, calculus uses the extremely simple concepts of lines and rectangles to approximate very complicated functions and regions; and when a function cannot be nicely approximated by a line, the next-simplest kind of function (a polynomial) can often be used to do the approximation. This project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Approximation Problems abound in algebra too, where they often have the form: suppose C is a subcategory of a complicated category K. Can C be used to approximate, or extract information about, arbitrary members of the ambient category K? Approximation Problems appear in many guises in homological algebra and homotopy theory, and affirmative solutions to such problems can provide useful new invariants for K.  Starting with Shelah's work on the Whitehead Problem in the 1970s, set-theoretic methods have been surprisingly effective in dealing with such questions, which often turn out to be independent of the axioms of mathematics.  The project will employ a combination of set-theoretic and algebraic methods to address some open problems in this area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ramsey's Theorem states that given any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into finitely many colors, there is an infinite subset in which all pairs have the same color.  Since its inception, Ramsey theory has developed in multiple directions, often appearing as the core content in solutions to deep problems from a wide range of mathematical disciplines.  This project utilizes techniques in mathematical logic to more fully develop Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures.  A major motivation is to find dividing lines between those infinite structures which act like the natural numbers in the sense of possessing analogues of Ramsey's theorem, and those which do not.  Of particular interest is the advancement of Ramsey theory for structures with forbidden configurations.  Progress on infinite structures works in tandem with progress in mathematical logic and topology, creating new pathways between several areas of mathematics.  This project includes some important questions which are suitable for graduate students and early career researchers, thus providing opportunities to broaden participation of well-trained mathematicians via the PI's mentoring.<br/><br/>This research program will develop the Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures, especially those with forbidden configurations, an area which had been largely impervious to investigations prior to the PI's recent solution for the universal homogeneous triangle-free graph.  This will involve constructing new types of trees which code homogeneous relational structures and using the technique of forcing to produce (in ZFC) Ramsey theorems for these classes of trees.  These new techniques will be used obtain better bounds for finite structural Ramsey theory.  Computability theoretic strengths of varying Ramsey statements, and connections with classification schemes in model theory will be investigated.  Infinitary Ramsey theory will continue to be developed with a broad spectrum of implications for and applications to other areas of mathematics.  The techniques developed, involving simultaneous uses of logic, combinatorics and topology, will create new pathways between these areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often, the eventual behavior of these functions is of interest: Do they stabilize or tend to infinity? How fast do they grow? Valued differential fields are mathematical structures that abstractly formalize these questions and possible answers. This project will investigate valued differential fields from the perspective of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic which involves studying properties of mathematical structures that can be expressed in formal languages, in turn revealing new insights into these structures and their complexity. In recent years the ideas and tools of model theory have had fruitful applications in other areas of mathematics, a trend this project will continue in the setting of valued differential fields. The project includes the training and mentoring of undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Valued differential fields are algebraic structures that formalize the asymptotic comparison of solutions to differential equations. This project aims to deepen our understanding of such structures and their model theory in two primary ways. First, it will investigate unordered valued differential fields, most ambitiously complex transseries, which have been much less studied than ordered valued differential fields. These latter structures describe only non-oscillating behavior, while oscillating functions play an important role in mathematics and in describing the real world, from water waves to wave functions in quantum physics. This project will search for universal domains for the kinds of asymptotic differential algebra in which oscillation is permitted and study their complexity. Second, the project will investigate certain ordered valued differential fields that can arise from transexponential extensions of transseries. The work will then address natural next steps, most significantly the study of certain quotient structures, called imaginaries, associated to such ordered valued differential fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A generalized algorithm runs for transfinitely many steps, and even a single step is too hard for an ordinary computer, but this kind of algorithmic thinking gives a useful perspective on mathematics.  This project will use the algorithmic perspective of computability theory to analyze various hierarchies from classical analysis, topological dynamics, and descriptive set theory.  Sometimes a hierarchy-derived tool, such as the measurability of a Borel set, is less powerful than a full hierarchy analysis, but still strong enough for many purposes.  The research will explore this distinction, among other questions.  The project will also support the training of graduate students. <br/><br/>Theorems about Borel sets are sometimes proved by recursing along the structure of the Borel sets, but more often they are proved via measure or category. When the usual measure and category approaches do not pan out, reverse mathematics provides one framework for formalizing the question of whether any measure or category approach could succeed.  This framework will be applied to analyze various theorems about Borel sets, in particular theorems from descriptive combinatorics.  Second, the PI will address a number of questions about computability-theoretic properties of hierarchies in classical analysis, such as the Bourgain rank or the hierarchy of Denjoy integrable functions.  Finally, shifts of finite type (SFTs) are certain topological dynamical systems which are simply described but exhibit complex behavior, because their dynamics can simulate Turing computations.  It is not well understood which properties of the resulting dynamical system can be controlled by these computations.  The project aims to develop usable meta-theorems describing classes of algorithms that can be implemented in SFTs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use the tools of mathematical logic (and computability theory in particular) to study the way that information can be coded into mathematical structures of the types that arise in all areas of mathematics. The general paradigm is that information is encoded into a mathematical structure if it can always be recovered in an intrinsic way from the structure, without artifacts from the way that the structure is presented. For the simplest kinds of information, like a string of 0's and 1's, the situation is well-understood. But for more complex kinds of information, the situation is much less well-understood and there are many interesting phenomena to explore. Understanding the coding of information will help us understand both the nature of information and the ability of structures of various kinds to code information. This, in turn, informs and guides the mathematical practice of other mathematicians. This project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students and outreach to high schools.<br/><br/>More formally, we say that a piece of information A is coded in a structure B if from every copy of the structure, we can recover in a computable way a copy of the information A. For example if B is a countably infinite group then a copy of B is a Cayley table for the group, noting that for an infinite group there are many different Cayley tables obtained by listing the elements of the group in different orders. By a piece of information we mean, in order of increasing complexity, a binary string (or subset of the natural numbers), an infinite family of binary strings, an infinite tree, or some other structure. For the first case of a binary string, there is a good structural characterisation of when a structure codes a binary string; one can interpret this as saying that there is always a good reason for a binary string to be coded by a structure. This is not the case for any more of the more complicated types of information; it seems that there are structures which happen to code information, but there is no good structural reason as to why. This project aims to explore these phenomena and push them to their limit with one aim being to give new tools to attack difficult open problems on degree spectra which have been resistant to current techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of model theory concerns the ways in which a theory, which is simply a set of sentences in a formal language, controls its class of models. The PI has previously investigated on mechanisms by which a theory can either admit or forbid certain combinatorial configurations in its models; this project continues these investigations in several contexts. In some cases, this investigation melds well with computational learning theory. As one example, if a theory forbids the independence property, then all the concepts i.e., definable sets, arising in the models of the theory conform to the probably approximately correct (PAC) learning framework. This project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI has noted a strong connection between the complexity of hereditary classes C of finite structures and monadic expansions of infinite models of Th(C).  There is a hierarchy of dividing lines, such as monadic NFCP, monadic stability, and monadic NIP.  Working with Braunfeld, the PI has multiple characterizations of a model of Th(C) being monadically NIP.  The project expects to show that if some model of Th(C) is not monadically NIP, then the class is wild, e.g., the growth rate of unlabelled structures in C is superexponetial and the class is not n-wqo for some integer n.  Potential canonical Scott sentences have proved to be a useful tool in determining the Borel complexity of invariant classes of countable structures and the research intends to streamline these methods by exploring thickness and groundedness of classes of models. The project aims to compute the Borel complexity of every mutually algebraic theory.  Theories with non-maximal uncountable spectrum are classifiable. Recent technical results about the existence of prime models make it tractable to settle Vaught's conjecture for classifiable theories and possibly for superstable theories as well. In first order logic, aleph1-categoricity of a theory is an absolute notion, as can be seen by the Baldwin-Lachlan characterization of aleph1-categoricity. The PI aims to determine whether a similar characterization can be found for aleph1-categoricity of sentences of L(omega1, omega), or equivalently for classes of atomic models. Specifically, the project intends to determine whether aleph1-categoricity is absolute for classes of atomic models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While abstract set theory is replete with counterintuitive pathologies (such as splitting a ball into five pieces and reassembling them into two copies of the original ball), many of these are circumvented by imposing constraints on the definition of the sets involved.  Moreover, the search for definable solutions to some question is often tied closely with the study of algorithms in computer science.  In this fashion, algorithms for analyzing configurations in large finite networks often correspond to descriptive set-theoretically simple solutions to infinite problems, and there are notable examples of the infinite analysis shedding light on the finite counterparts as well.  Drawing out further connections between these finite and infinite settings is a major focus of the project, which is accessible to student researchers as well as more advanced mathematicians. The project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>More specifically, the project applies descriptive set-theoretic methods to examine the structure of definable graphs.  Such graphs often arise in topological dynamics and ergodic theory, and in particular their combinatorial properties are often intertwined with algebraic aspects of the acting group. Specific combinatorial problems under investigation include: determining definable chromatic numbers of graphs, identifying when matchings and circulations can be found, and characterizing when such graph admit useful acyclic subgraphs. The project also explores applications of these ideas towards finding tilings of group actions and understanding the equidecomposability relation arising from such actions.  These topics are all closely tied with the local model of distributed computing in theoretical computer science and also have interactions with finite combinatorics, graph limits, probability, and geometric group theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the lens of transfinite ordinal numbers, compactness, and large cardinals. This project includes the training of graduate students. <br/><br/>The first part of the research project involves using set-theoretic tools to study groups of piecewise linear and piecewise projective homemorphisms.  This includes attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is  elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected to have other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals.  This part of the research project also concerns use of set-theoretic tools such as compactness and the algebra of elementary embeddings to study the amenability problem for F.  The second part of the research project concerns further developing techniques in pure and applied set theory: methods for studying the vanishing of higher derived limits in homological algebra; the role that Jensen's diamond principle plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at most aleph1.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The set-theoretic methods forming the focal point of this project are various manifestations of the unifying theme of elementary submodels. Included in this theme are so-called ""L-like"" principles, like Jensen's square and its variants, that arise from considerations of elementarity and reflection in inner models. Making use of such principles in topology typically requires the assumption that the set-theoretic universe be close to Gdel's constructible universe L in some way. This project aims to explore the topological consequences of these L-like principles, as well as the sometimes exotic possibilities that can exist in their absence. The latter entails a topologically-minded investigation of large cardinals, forcing models built from large cardinals, and the singular cardinal combinatorics arising therein.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the first time in the history of this conference series, the STDC will be open to both in-person and remote participants.  By allowing for both in person and remote participation, the 55th STDC will be able to bring together a broad and diverse group of mathematicians to disseminate research and establish connections for future collaboration. The organizers expect to host more than 100 participants from the United States and from abroad on-site, as well as more than 100 remote participants.  A crucial part of the STDC is its involvement of researchers at all career stages?graduate students and early career researchers as well as established researchers?allowing for younger generations of mathematicians to find mentors and to establish their research trajectories. In addition, the STDC makes a conscious effort to promote diversity in mathematics in its recruitment of organizers and speakers, with a focus on ensuring representation of women and underrepresented minority groups. <br/><br/>The 55th STDC is structured around five special sessions, each with a focus on one aspect of topology?continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric group theory, geometric topology, and set-theoretic topology. The invited and contributed talks of these special sessions and their associated plenary and semi-plenary speakers provide an opportunity for the announcement and discussion of the most significant advances in the various subfields of topology over the last year. In addition, the STDC reserves a plenary address for the winner of the annual Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher award, which is given to an early-career topologist with outstanding contributions to the field. This year, the STDC will also host a workshop on Linear Dynamics, a relatively young subfield of dynamics, aimed at graduate students and early-career mathematicians, as well as a series of open problem, collaboration, and mentoring sessions. These talks and activities provide an excellent framework for the establishment of new collaborative efforts in mathematical research and for encouraging full participation of graduate students and early career researchers.

An important aspect of model theory is to study the underlying structure of mathematical objects from a formal viewpoint, and then to utilize this to obtain novel approaches to questions emerging from other areas of mathematics, such as algebra, geometry, arithmetic, differential equations, graph theory, or even beyond, such as from economics, machine learning or engineering. The particular focus of this project is on developing recent applications of certain model-theoretic tools to areas such as diophantine geometry (the study of solving equations in integers by means of algebra and geometry) and asymptotic analysis (the study of the growth behaviour of functions as their inputs become large), in order to obtain new insights in these different fields by exploring and profiting from the interplay between them, while also making fundamental contributions to our understanding of the foundational model-theoretic framework itself. The project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups through the Math Alliance. <br/><br/>The prevalent feature of the problems that this project proposes to address is their connection to the part of model theory known as o-minimality, a common generalization of semi-algebraic and subanalytic geometries, where the mathematical objects under consideration do not exhibit wild geometric behaviour (such as no oscillation, finiteness bounds being uniform in families, and good asymptotic growth behaviour of functions). A principal focus of this project is on the counting theorem of Pila and Wilkie, a seminal application of o-minimality to diophantine geometry, as well as on subsequent refinements and applications of this result. One key aim is to gain new insights into one of the main analytic-geometric tools used in this area, namely smooth parameterization. Another is to obtain further improvements to or new applications of these counting results, in particular by exploiting effective methods. This project moreover will use techniques from o-minimality to address questions in diophantine and asymptotic analysis, by furthering our understanding of the asymptotic growth behaviour of functions in the o-minimal setting, and making critical new insights into the wider applicability of this analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
