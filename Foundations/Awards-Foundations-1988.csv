For example, the principal                  investigator and J. Denef have previously shown that there is no                algorithm for deciding if a single ordinary differential equation               has an analytic solution on the non-negative real numbers, even                 given that it has a unique solution near zero.  Part 1 of the                   project is the development of a theory of nonarchimedean rigid                  semi-analytic and sub-analytic sets.  (By this is meant the                     theory of semi-analytic and sub-analytic sets over a                            nonarchimedean, algebraically closed, complete normed field.)                   This development will parallel the recent treatment of p-adic                   semi-analytic and sub-analytic sets of Denef and van den Dries.                 The principal investigator has proved an analytic elimination                   theorem (over nonarchimedean, algebraically closed, complete                    normed fields) which will facilitate the development of the                     theory.  Results sought include (a) that the complement of a                    rigid sub-analytic set is subanalytic; (b) that every subanalytic               set is a finite disjoint union of subanalytic manifolds; (c)                    nonarchimedean Lojasiewicz inequalities for rigid subanalytic                   sets and functions; and some further results.  In part 2 the                    principal investigator seeks to show that algebraic subsets of                  the p-adic integers Zp, defined by polynomials involving few                    monomials, if they are finite contain only few points in Zp.  In                part 3, he will investigate a decision problem about the                        existence of power series solutions of maximally overdetermined                 systems of partial differential equations."

Having found an effective test for the constructive truth of               propositions, in real algebra, of a bounded logical complexity,                 Scowcroft hopes to isolate a convenient set of axioms for these                 constructively true propositions.  Given such axioms, he would                  like to prove theorems in constructive real algebra by model-                   theoretic means.

Since then many mathematicians have applied this notion to algebraic structures and obtained an analogue of ""finite dimensional algebras."" Given a structure M of finite Morley rank, one associates to each definable subset of n-tuples from M, two integers, called the rank and degree of the subset. These definable subsets and their associated integers satisfy some number of axioms which may be thought of as an ""abstract dimension theory."" Making an analogy with algebraic geometry: definable subsets correspond to constructible subsets; the rank corresponds to the dimension; the degree corresponds to the number of irreducible components (if the given set is closed). If M is an algebraically closed field, the above correspondences become equalities. From these correspondences one may guess that groups of finite Morley rank must look like geometrical groups, but Macintyre's result, that infinite fields of Morley rank are algebraically closed, reduces the possibilities. Cherlin's conjecture: An infinite simple group G of finite Morley rank is an algebraic group over some algebraically closed field, and the set G, its multiplication, and its inverse function are defined by polynomials. On the other hand, Pillay and Steinhorn defined the concept of o-minimal structures, and Pillay began studying groups G defined in an o-minimal structure M. This new class of groups includes many real Lie groups (e.g. algebraic ones). They behave like groups of finite Morley rank: one has a notion of dimension and connectedness. The principal investigator of this project, Huseyin Ali Nesin, intends to work on these two classes of groups for at least the next two years. Many problems remain to be solved before their relation to the classical groups is fully understood."
