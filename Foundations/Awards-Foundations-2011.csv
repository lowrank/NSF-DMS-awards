"1101248","Integration and Preparation Theorems","DMS","FOUNDATIONS","09/01/2011","08/10/2011","Daniel Miller","KS","Emporia State University","Standard Grant","Tomek Bartoszynski","08/31/2013","$20,854.00","","dmille10@emporia.edu","1 KELLOGG CIR","EMPORIA","KS","668015415","6203415351","MPS","1268","9150","$0.00","This project consists of two lines of investigation.  The first part of the project studies the integration theory of real constructible functions, which by definition are sums of products of real globally subanalytic functions and their logarithms.  The significance of the constructible functions is that they form the smallest class of functions that extends the globally subanalytic functions and is stable under integration.  Properties of Lebesgue spaces and also multivariate harmonic analysis will be studied in the context of constructible functions, including asymptotic estimates of oscillatory integrals and possibly questions concerning the integrability of Fourier transforms of constructible functions.  The main tool employed to study integration of constructible functions is the subanalytic preparation theorem.  The second part of the project aims to show through a purely analytic proof that the subanalytic preparation theorem holds in a more general quasianalytic setting.  An important motivation for doing so is to obtain a more informative proof of the preparation theorem that could be used to study the decidability of expansions of the real field by functions from quasianalytic classes and power functions in order to combine the principal investigator's previous work on decidability, which dealt only with functions from quasianalytic classes, and the work of Jones and Servi on decidability, which dealt only with power functions.<br/><br/>The origins of this project stem from two very classical questions which are pervasive throughout much of mathematics and its applications to science and engineering: 1) how to solve equations and inequalities, and related to this, how to determine the truth or falsity of statements built up through the use of equations and inequalities and also logical operations; 2) how to compute and study properties of functions defined by integral formulas.  The subanalytic preparation theorem shows that, at least in theory, a wide class of equations (which includes all polynomial equations) can be solved by radicals in a more liberal sense that allows the use of locally defined analytic functions in addition to arithmetic operations and radicals.  One aim of this project is to obtain a new algorithmic proof of the preparation theorem which, incidentally, would also generalize the theorem to wider classes of functions.  In addition to studying equations, the preparation theorem is an important tool for studying the asymptotic behavior and integrals of constructible functions, which is a class of functions that contains, in particular, all algebraic functions.   The Fourier transform is an important operation used in many areas of mathematics and its applications, and it is defined by an integral formula.  Another aim of the project is to the lay groundwork for a theory of integration that could be used to show that Fourier transforms of constructible functions have simple properties."

One focus is on generalizations of Hilbert's Tenth Problem. Hilbert's Tenth Problem over the rational numbers and over number fields in general is still open while undecidability is known for several subrings of the rational numbers. One goal is to investigate for which subrings of number fields the problem is undecidable. Another is to extend the currently known undecidability results for function fields. Research on Hilbert's Tenth Problem has led to new areas of interaction between number theory, arithmetic geometry and logic. These will be further explored in this project. Another focus is the study of computational problems in arithmetic geometry that have applications to cryptography. One goal is to construct curves of small genus that are suitable for cryptographic applications. Another goal is to generalize the quantum algorithms for number fields to function fields.<br/><br/>The investigator proposes several research projects that involve studying the solutions to multivariable polynomial equations. Looking for solutions to such equations over the integers or rational numbers is one of the fundamental problems in number theory. It has a long history that goes back to ancient Greece. For the first project the investigator will study the fundamental question of whether it is possible to find a procedure that determines whether an arbitrary multivariable polynomial equation has a solution in a given number system. The second project focuses on computational aspects of certain special classes of equations that have applications to cryptography. This area of mathematics is very well-suited for motivating young students to study mathematics. The investigator will teach middle school and high school girls about cryptography and its mathematical background. There will be two yearly workshops which will involve hands-on experiments in the computer lab. There will also be professional development workshops for local mathematics teachers."

First, the classical subject of descriptive set theory has been found, in combination with techniques of ergodic theory and superrigidity theory, to have extensive applications to the analysis of problems of classification in algebra and elsewhere. In particular the subject of Borel equivalence relations will be applied to problems in geometric group theory, revolving around the central notion of quasi-isometry.  The now classical theory of Borel reductions will be sharpened by considering continuous reductions, which correspond in a number of cases to ""natural"" or ""invariant"" constructions. Second, the techniques of model theory will be applied to settle certain problems in combinatorics, notably the problem of the existence of universal graphs subject to one forbidden subgraph, and the classification of the metrically homogeneous graphs, first proposed in 1998 by Cameron and subsequently seen to have connections with topological dyamics in work of Kechris, Pestov, and Todorcevic. In both cases, new examples of homogeneous structures will be identified (in an appropriate refinement of the category of graphs), and then the relation to topological dynamics will involve the further study of structural Ramsey theory in the associated classes of finite structures.  The proposal includes a visitors' program based on extended visits by Saharon Shelah, one of the world's preeminent mathematical logicians, and a variety of his collaborators, who will collaborate on aspects of the proposed research, both on the side of descriptive set theory and in the applications to combinatorics.<br/><br/>The thrust of the research is interdisciplinary. The notion of classification is fundamental to many branches of mathematical research, and techniques of mathematical logic, in combination with more specialized tools from other branches of mathematics, some the result of very recent breakthroughs, make it possible to analyze the scope and limitations of this method, revealing a wealth of structure. The techniques of mathematical logic also provide a very broad perspective on problems of combinatorics, raising issues of computability and providing new and systematic techniques for the resolution of concrete problems regarding the complexity of classes of finite structures, and the problem of the existence of a single infinite limit of such a class with a tractable structure, which provides a way for distinguishing ""chaotic"" from ""highly structured"" classes, and the identification of new cases which can be analyzed structurally."

Many theorems in Ramsey theory can be proven using infinitary methods, in the form of ultraproducts, nonstandard analysis, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory.  Proof mining extracts finite information from these infinite arguments.  The proposed research will apply the methods of proof mining in order to investigate: 1) explicit bounds on numerical quantities which are not made apparent by infinite proofs, 2) approximations of infinitary Ramsey theoretic statements which ""quantify"" (typically, with a countable ordinal) how transfinite a given construction is, and 3) new finitary analogs of infinitary methods.  Where necessary, the proposed research will also expand the repertoire of proof mining tools by investigating how to interpret higher order notions, particularly the topological structure of the ultrafilters, in finitary terms.<br/><br/>Questions in mathematics about concrete, finite properties of the integers often turn out to have answers that make use of abstract, infinite notions.  The goal of the area of proof theory known as ""proof mining"" is to develop tools for explaining this phenomenon.  Often, we discover that there are finite methods which can replace the infinite ones, at the price of making the argument much more difficult to understand.  Some of these arguments are so unwieldy that it is difficult to imagine that they could be discovered directly.  By ""unwinding"" the infinite argument into finite arguments, however, we often discover new information.  For example, infinite proofs often prove that a number with some property exists while providing no information about which number it is; the corresponding finite argument, however, typically gives an upper bound on the size of that number."

The second involves using computational methods, such as interactive proof assistants, to verify the correctness of mathematical proofs. Avigad has formally verified a proof of the prime number theorem and has contributed to an ambitious project, directed by Georges Gonthier, to verify the Feit-Thompson theorem.

The second involves the use of computers to verify the correctness of mathematical arguments and calculations, and to assist in mathematical reasoning.

The problems she plans to study focus on when  a given c.e.  <br/>set is mapped by an automorphism of this structure to a set that   <br/>computes the halting problem.  On the other hand, Lange is examining the computational complexity of structures associated with real closed fields, generalizations of the ordered field of the reals.  Many of these questions cannot be answered without first solving purely algebraic or model theoretic problems.<br/><br/>The aim of computable structure theory, Lange's area of research, is  <br/>to examine mathematical structures from an algorithmic perspective.   <br/>There are many problems in mathematics for which there is no way to compute a solution.

Lange and others in  <br/>the field work to precisely calibrate the algorithmic difficulty of a mathematical problem by finding its place in  the standard computational framework that grew out of Turing's work.  A critical aspect of computable structure theory is understanding the relationship between definability and computability.

But much still remains unknown about the connection between strong axioms of set theory and the continuum. The motivating goal for the project is to deepen our understanding of this connection. This requires a deeper understanding of the axioms themselves, and of intermediary principles between these axioms and properties of the continuum: principles that can be obtained (provably or consistently) granted the axioms, and directly affect the continuum. The project seeks to extend work on both fronts, with research into models for the axioms, combinatorial principles on infinite sets, and saturation principles of the universe of sets that affect properties of the continuum."

More specifically, he plans on:  (1) using the techniques of nonstandard analysis to investigate problems in infinite-dimensional Lie theory and geometric group theory; and (2) continuing the development of continuous logic and model theory for metric structures.  In regards to item (1), he plans on investigating how one can use the technique of hyperfinite approximation in infinite-dimensional Lie theory by embedding infinite-dimensional objects inside of hyperfinite objects in the hopes that the finite-dimensional theory will apply to the hyperfinite objects and the infinite-dimensional objects embedded in them.  In regards to (2), Goldbring plans on continuing the study of foundational aspects of continuous logic, including definability of sets and functions and the behavior of independence relations in various metric structures.<br/><br/>Model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, studies what properties of mathematical structures can be described in terms of first-order logic.  This understanding can often lead to solutions to problems in various mathematical areas by taking general model-theoretic facts and interpreting them in specific contexts.  This approach has been most successful in discrete situations, such as algebra and combinatorics.  Recently, a model theory has been developed for structures arising in analysis, namely those for which a natural notion of distance exists.  This model theory could then prove useful for solving problems in areas where classical model theory has yet to be able to help.  That being said, model theory, in the form of nonstandard analysis, has found applications in analysis by providing a rigorous notion of infinitesimal and infinite numbers.  Nonstandard analysis has found applications in such diverse areas as number theory, probability theory, and economics.  This project proposes to use nonstandard analysis to answer questions in Lie theory, which is a very important mathematical area used in physics and engineering."

There are many applications of o-minimality to various areas of mathematics and recently such applications were found to arithmetic and algebraic geometry, yielding new proofs to classical problems (the Manin-Mumford conjecture) and and solving some open cases of the Andre-Oort conjecture. This proposed research project intends to take some of the ingredients which appeared in these recent applications to arithmetic and extend them to a more general setting (locally symmetric spaces), with the hope that such results will enable to solve other open cases of similar conjectures. An important feature of the proposed research is the inter-play between infinite discrete objects (eg. arithmetics groups or periodic functions), which are not definable in o-minimal structures, and their trace on definable sets in such structures. The goal is to prove definability of classical periodic maps when restricted to appropriate definable sets, and then to explore the implications which this definability might have on the periodic sets and functions.<br/><br/><br/>Model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, studies sets definable in  mathematical structures by first-order formulas. In many cases it allows one to eliminate wild phenomenas  and  to provide a rigorous  definition of a tame geometry.  This approach is useful for solving problems in areas such as number theory and arithmetic geometry. This project proposes to use tamness of various structures to answer some open problems in arithmetic geometry  which is a very important area of mathematics."

Univalent foundations are based on the combination of this view with the discovery that it is possible to directly formalize reasoning about homotopy types using Matin-Lof type theories. <br/><br/>We expect that this new approach to the foundations will finally make it practical for mathematicians to use proof development software in their everyday work.

The first grant had an enormous impact and greatly magnified the ties among researchers in the three countries.

Each session has an associated plenary speaker. More details and instructions on how to contribute talks can be found at: http://topann.comyr.com/SumConf2011.html<br/><br/><br/>With the invention of calculus came the need to understand limits, continuity, and shapes more general than classical geometric ones. The resulting branch of mathematics is topology, and among its more recent catch phrases is ""chaos theory"" (related to ""dynamics"", which studies the results of applying continuous functions repeatedly). In addition to a dynamics session there will be sessions in set-theoretic topology which considers spaces where limits and continuity can be defined, in topological groups and functional analysis which discuss uses of the interplay between topology and algebra. The remaining session is in asymmetric topology, a topic that has become useful in computer logic and the sorts of representations of infinite spaces by those where only a finite number of points can be used, such as with television and computer screens."
