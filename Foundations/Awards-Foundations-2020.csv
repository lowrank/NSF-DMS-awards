The first is related to algebra and  number theory, and the second is in machine learning. Model theory is a part of mathematical logic which has seen extensive applications in other areas of mathematics and computer science in the last several decades. The project aims to resolve several long-standing problems related to number theory and algebraic differential equations. Number theory and differential equations are central areas of mathematics with applications throughout the sciences, and this project aims to resolve fundamental questions in these areas. Connections between model theory and machine learning have emerged in the last several years, and this project seeks to build on those connections to bring new techniques to both disciplines. In the past several years open problems in both model theory and machine learning have been resolved using techniques from the other, a process this project will continue. Machine learning has emerged as one of the most influential technologies of the last decade and is in the process of rapid growth, and this project aims to attack foundational problems in machine learning using techniques from mathematical logic. The education component of the project involves training of graduate students and undergraduate students through research and outreach to high school students.<br/><br/>The first main area of this project centers around nonlinear ordinary differential equations which arise in a number of classical contexts. The project will study the differential equations satisfied by automorphic functions and apply the results to prove new transcendence results as well as obtaining diophantine applications around unlikely intersections. Here, the techniques include analysis, differential Galois theory, and geometric stability theory. Painleve equations will be studied, where the central goal is a classification of the algebraic relations between solutions. The second main area of this project is machine learning. In this area, model theoretic tools will be brought to bear to solve foundational open problems in learning theory. For instance, combinatorial characterizations of private versions of learnability in various settings will be pursued. Learnability in automata and other specific mathematical structures will also be pursued.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mathematics, as we all know, some objects, constructions, or proofs are more complicated than others. Logicians have developed various ways of measuring this complexity. When one is interested in countable objects, which are central to a wide range of mathematics, the tools to measure these complexities come from computability theory. The objective of this project is to draw connections between complexity issues and structural issues to improve understanding of what forms complexity can take. The investigator will also continue work on a book series that aims to make it easier for the logic community to learn about the subject of computable structure theory, to help graduate students reach a research-level understanding of the subject, and to provide researchers with a modern reference.<br/><br/>The main component of this project is the study of the structure that emerges when considering computability theoretic properties on a cone, that is, properties that hold relative to almost every oracle with respect to Martin's measure. The project will study generalizations of the uniform Martin's conjecture and the almost-everywhere structure of Turing equivalence. The study of on-a-cone properties led to structural characterizations for a variety of notions from computable structure theory over the last decade. This project investigates the one-a-cone structure of the Turing degrees, of Turing equivalence, and of other recursion theoretic objects. The research will pursue two lines of inquiry. On the one hand, recent work suggests Martin's conjecture is just the tip of the iceberg, and that there are other situations where one can get a nice structural classification of relativizable objects. This research will search further for such structural classifications for equivalence relations other than Turing equivalence. On the other hand, conjectures about properties of the Turing equivalence and its interactions with its sub-equivalence relations may provide information on where Turing equivalence is located in the landscape of Borel equivalence relations, and the project will investigate this possibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Abstract topological  dynamics extends the notion of time from the groups of real numbers and integers to arbitrary, possibly infinite-dimensional, topological groups, and restricts the space to be bounded and to contain all its limit points. Abstract topological dynamics encompasses methods from and applications into numerous areas of mathematics. This project mainly investigates its intimate relationship with combinatorics, in particular, Ramsey theory. Every topological group admits a natural representation as a group of symmetries of some mathematical structure. It turns out that wild dynamical behaviour of the group corresponds to chaotic behaviour of the corresponding structure, that is, lack of Ramsey phenomena, and tamer dynamical behaviour corresponds to a bounded number of patterns approximating the undelying structure. This relationship is a rich source of questions both on the level of general theory and concrete examples. The intent of the project is to address both hand in hand while isolating instances suitable for undergraduate and graduate research.<br/><br/>        To a great extent, dynamical behaviour of a topological group can be read from its minimal flows, in particular from the projectively largest one, the universal minimal flow. It has previously been studied by functional analytical means, whereas the PI developed a dual approach via ultrafilters, for groups of automorphisms of discrete structure, and more generally near ultrafilters for general topological groups. The corresponding Ramsey phenomena have a direct translation into the ultrafilter language as well and clarify the connection between dynamics and combinatorics. The goal is to continue studying universal minimal flows via (near) ultrafilters in general, such as what topological spaces can be the universal minimal flows, as well as concrete examples of groups and underlying structures that lead the direction of the theory, for example, whether groups of automorphisms of discrete structures exhibit all possible dynamical behaviour, or whether metric structure (allowing for small error) bring in new phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project investigates key remaining obstructions to the Algebraicity Conjecture by developing a newly found connection with approximately classical geometries. The project will also apply the existing partial solution to the Algebraicity Conjecture to establish natural limits to how much symmetry a group of finite Morley rank may encode, with the added goal of classifying those at the extreme. Additionally, the project explores the notion of ""relational complexity"" for finite symmetry groups, a key component of a classification theory for certain highly symmetric structures. This research addresses core problems about the complexity of certain natural families of groups and develops computational tools for further exploration. Finally, the project provides new opportunities and support for undergraduate and Masters students at California State University, Sacramento, to engage with and build skill in the model theory of groups.<br/><br/>The first thread of this project addresses remaining obstructions to the Algebraicity Conjecture with the goal of exploiting a connection between certain groups of small 2-rank and generically defined projective geometries. Specific aims include the elimination of a long-standing pathological configuration, a clarification of a second, and a significant expansion of the existing techniques for analyzing groups of small, but nonzero, 2-rank. The second thread of research studies permutation groups of finite Morley rank. The focus is on Borovik and Cherlin's guiding problem of classifying those groups with a sufficiently high degree of generic transitivity as being of a single form that arises naturally in projective geometry. The final thread investigates the relational complexity of finite permutation groups. The study of relational complexity is currently anchored by Cherlin's Binary Conjecture, which proposes a classification of the primitive groups of complexity 2. This project aims to broaden the scope of research on relational complexity by analyzing various natural families of permutation groups, focusing on the complexity of the symmetric and alternating groups acting on partitions. Moreover, this thread further develops algorithms and refines exiting code for computing relational complexity, with the additional goals of creating a public repository for the code and manual to support its use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its philosophical beginning had to do with the foundations of mathematics, which at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century was not standing on firm grounds. Set theorists of the time devised an axiomatic system known as Zermelo-Fraenkel with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), that removed all paradoxes of the time, and put all of mathematics on firmer grounds. On the other hand, Cantor, working on questions coming from the study of Fourier sequences, needed to device longer inductions then the set of natural numbers allowed him to do. His work led him to what is now known as cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers and above all the study of the real numbers. His work led to what is called The Continuum Hypothesis, which was the first open problem on Hilbert's infamous list of problems. Godel and Cohen  eventually showed that The Continuum Hypothesis is undecidable, i.e. neither provable nor disprovable, from, ZFC, thus exposing a major weakness in the axiomatic system ZFC. It does not decide simple questions about sets of reals, one of the most basic mathematical objects. Descriptive Inner Model Theory is one part of what is now called Godel's Program, which is the program of removing undecidability from mathematics by studying stronger and stronger natural axiomatic systems extending ZFC that decide more and more natural questions about sets of reals and other mathematical objects. Godel himself suggested that the Large Cardinal Hierarchy should be used for the aforementioned purpose. The goal of descriptive inner model theory is to build canonical models for large cardinals and also study their impact on the set of real numbers. For example, one of the greatest achievements of the subject due to many authors is that given large cardinals, projective sets of reals behave exactly as Borel sets of reals as far as their regularity properties are concerned (i.e. measurability, category and etc). In addition the project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI is proposing to attack some of the central open problems of the area such as the HOD Problem or the Iterability Problem. The HOD Problem essentially says that in models where sets of reals posses all regularity properties one may desire, the universe consisting of sets that are hereditarily definable from ordinals is a canonical inner model for large cardinals. It connects the desirable regularity properties of sets of reals with the existence of large cardinals in a fundamental way showing that the regularity properties of definable sets of reals are a consequence of large cardinals and vice versa. The HOD Problem was isolated in late 90s and early 2000s as one of the most central open problems of the area. Iterability Problem is of similar nature but avoids determinacy models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental questions include that of Cantor?s Continuum Hypothesis. This was the first question on the now famous list of proposed by Hilbert in 1900. By the results of Godel in 1940 and Cohen in 1963, this problem has been shown to be formally unsolvable on the basis of the axioms of Set Theory. But this does not mean that the question has no answer, rather it simply shows the accepted axioms of Set Theory are incomplete. In previously funded research, a single new axiom has been discovered which resolves not only the problem of the Continuum Hypothesis but essentially all the other questions which Cohen? method has been used in the last 50 years to show are also unsolvable. The compatibility of this new axiom with large cardinal axioms is now the central problem. The focus of this project is to bring the analysis of this new axiom to a conclusion, by either showing this new axiom cannot be refuted by large cardinal axioms, or by showing that some reasonable large cardinal axiom refutes this new axiom. In addition the project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The HOD Dichotomy Theorem isolates the fundamental issue raised by the Ultimate L Conjecture. This theorem shows that assuming reasonable large cardinal axioms, HOD must be either very close to V or very far from V. The HOD Conjecture is the conjecture that the ?far option? is vacuous. The only plausible approach at present to resolving the problem of the HOD Conjecture lies in the Ultimate L Conjecture. The focus of this project is in two parts. Either prove the Ultimate L Conjecture by extending inner model to the level of a supercompact cardinal, this would prove the HOD Conjecture, or refute the Ultimate L Conjecture which would strongly argue that the HOD Conjecture is false. The latter possibility is now a reasonable research target because of the increasing number of constraints which have been discovered that the inner model theory for a supercompact cardinal must satisfy. Either way, the successful conclusion of this project will resolve the problem of the compatibility of the axiom ``V=Ultimate? with large cardinal axioms. Depending on the outcome, one either verifies the HOD Conjecture or discovers why the HOD Conjecture is likely false.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Model theory is concerned with studying structures in a formal mathematical language. One can trace its origins in Gödel?s fundamental work on the completeness of first-order logic. Gödel, in his famous completeness theorem, settled once and for all the question of how truth and provability are connected. Roughly speaking a mathematical statement is provable if and only if it is true in all possible worlds. Although model theory seems to have originated in questions around the philosophy and foundations of mathematics, in recent years profound connections with core mathematical disciplines and computer science have been found. Hyperbolic geometry emerged from the refutation of Euclid?s fifth postulate, also known as the parallel postulate. After more than twenty centuries of efforts to prove the fifth postulate as a consequence of the rest, Lobachevsky and independently Bolyai started developing geometry synthetically employing its negation. This resulted to what is nowadays known as hyperbolic geometry. Although hyperbolic geometry is counterintuitive, in reality space can be curved at places, looking like a horse saddle, and hyperbolic geometry is the right model to apply. This project investigates the connections of model theory with hyperbolic geometry by studying major open questions about the model theory of nonabelian free groups.<br/><br/>Nonabelian finitely generated free groups are prototypical examples of hyperbolic groups, i.e. finitely generated groups whose Cayley graph is a hyperbolic metric space. They have attracted much model theoretic attention after the profound result that they share the same first-order theory (Sela, Kharlampovich-Myasnikov). The latter result answered a question of Tarski that remained open for more than fifty years. Maybe surprisingly this common first-order theory is stable. Stability is a tameness condition in Shelah?s classification program and maybe the most prominent dividing line in it. A major aim of this project is the study of natural structures, like fields and groups, interpretable in the first-order theory of nonabelian free groups, which continues prior work of the PI with Ayala Byron and with Chloé Perin, Anand Pillay and Katrin Tent. The first-order theory of nonabelian free groups seems to exhibit some unexpected behavior with respect to the geometry of forking, that will be investigated by the PI. The second component of the project involves the notions of model completeness and model companion. The first-order theory of nonabelian free groups is not model complete, but it might admit a model companion. In the same line of thought properties of existentially closed subgroups of omega residually free groups will be studied. The PI will use techniques from geometric stability theory and geometric group theory. In particular, as demonstrated by previous results of the PI and others, useful tools and notions include, forking calculus, one-basedeness and in general the ample hierarchy, omega residually free towers, test sequences, and the understanding of group actions through Rips machine. A more general goal of the project is to develop methods to tackle similar questions in wider classes of groups, like hyperbolic groups, free products of groups or right-angled Artin groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical theories which cannot be decided by ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs) are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. This is Gödel's program in Set Theory. If an LCA is ""correct,"" then the theories it decides are also correct. How can one test for correctness of an LCA? The Inner Model Program, a major program in modern Set Theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of Arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a correct theory). This project contributes to the Inner Model Program by advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various extensions of ZFC. The educational component includes annual conferences, curriculum development, and outreach and broadening participation activities. <br/><br/>The project fits into the general framework of studying the connections between inner models, sets of reals, hybrid structures (such as hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of determinacy models), forcing, and strong combinatorial principles (such as the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA)). The problem of building a canonical inner model for an LCA is referred to as the Inner Model Problem for that LCA. One of the project's main goals is to identify certain obstructions that may prevent the current approaches to resolving the Inner Model Problem for various LCAs from going further as well as proposing ways of overcoming them. Specifically, the project will study obstacles to the current techniques of the Core Model Induction (one such obstacle is the Sealing of the Universally Baire Sets) and develop new approaches to the Core Model Induction that overcome these obstacles. One main application of the above analyses is in constructing canonical inner models of large cardinals from various strong extensions of ZFC, like the Proper Forcing Axiom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most famous example is the Continuum Hypothesis, which states that any infinite subset of the real numbers is either countable or in a one-to-one correspondence with the whole set of real numbers. The technique known as forcing can be used to show that the Continuum Hypothesis is logically independent of the standard set of axioms for mathematics, known as Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).  A major theme in modern set theory is development of relative consistency results and ZFC-strengthenings. ZFC-strengthenings are given by large cardinal hypotheses, which assert the existence of certain highly compact mathematical objects, called large cardinals, with strong reflection properties, that is, if a property holds at the large cardinal, it must hold at many cardinals below it. Assuming large cardinals exist, the method of forcing can be used to create various mathematical models.  This project analyzes these constructions, motivated by two complementary notions: what is mathematically necessary? what is mathematically sufficient? The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The main objectives of the project are analyzing what is possible from large cardinals and forcing, versus what constraints are imposed by ZFC. Forcing in the presence of large cardinals is the main tool to create models of ZFC and prove consistency results. In contrast to having large cardinals, Gödel's constructible universe L is the minimal class model of set theory. Two central questions are how much the universe resembles L, and how much compactness can be achieved by forcing. Compactness is the phenomenon where if a certain property holds for every smaller substructure of a given object, then it holds for the object itself. It follows from large cardinals, and often fails in L. Compactness is captured by some key combinatorial principles such as the tree property and its strengthenings. On the other hand, square properties are the canonical instance of incompactness and serve as a yardstick how close a model is to L. The project will focus on the interplay between these principles and forcing extensions constructed from large cardinals. The PI will also investigate how they interact with cardinal arithmetic and especially with singular combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology is an area of abstract mathematics that emerged from analysis and geometry as its own discipline in the late 19th century.  It has since become one of the foundational disciplines of mathematics, underlying much of mathematics and its applications to the sciences.  Modern applications of topology include logic, computer science, data processing, life sciences, game theory, and enriched category theory.  In keeping with its predecessor conferences, SUMTOPO 2020 will be an important international event that reflects the ever-expanding world of topology and its applications, with sessions dedicated to natural and social sciences, category theory, computational topology (including block chains and data science), algebra and geometry, general and set-theoretic topology, dynamics and continuum theory, asymmetry and many-valuedness, and enriched categories and topology.  SUMTOPO 2020 will contribute to better understanding the topological structures inherent in big data, as well as solidifying topology as a foundation of data science, thus contributing to the NSF goal of Harnessing the Data Revolution. SUMTOPO 2020 will have special sessions for recent doctoral recipients and faculty at smaller institutions to help them develop sustainable research programs, as well as outlining strategies for recruiting women and minorities to mathematics.  Participants will comprise a diverse group of established researchers, junior researchers, graduate students, and retirees, with special emphasis on recruiting speakers and participants both internationally and from underrepresented populations. <br/><br/>SUMPTOPO 2020 features sessions on Algebra and Geometry, General and Set-Theoretic Topology, Dynamics and Continuum Theory, and Asymmetry, while beginning and/or expanding sessions on Topology in Data Science for Natural and Social Sciences, Category Theory, Computational Topology, Many-Valuedness, and Enriched Categories and Topology. In each session, ?topology,? whether explicitly stated or not, is a basis of the session. In the natural and social sciences, scientists and mathematicians are discovering that there are natural occurrences and phenomena that can be explained or better understood using topology and that some of the explanations raise new topological questions. Data science is of special interest in two of the sessions in SUMTOPO 2020. Data science is not only a rapidly developing area in its own right, it is also a driving force in important and on-going developments in many disciplines including most if not all the natural and social sciences. Topology is proving to be an integral part of the development of data science and its applications. Regarding category theory, we want to explore the ways in which category theory has influenced topology in the past and the ways that category theory will continue to influence topology in the future. Since the very nature of (big) data means that applications involving data science must be computational, computational topology is a critical area of focus. Computational topology also gives rise to new topological questions and areas of research. An asymmetric topology is one for which the associated specialization preorder is non-symmetric; while a many-valued topology is a collection of open sets, each of which is a mapping from the carrier set of a space to a designated complete lattice of ?truth values.? In recent years it has been discovered that these two areas of topology are linked to each other and to computational topology, particularly to spaces and topological systems often associated with programming semantics.<br/><br/>The conference web page is https://ysu.edu/sumtopo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combinatorics is the area of mathematics concerning discrete structures, such as graphs, which can be viewed as mathematical objects representing networks consisting of nodes with links between them. This area has experienced immense growth in the past several decades, owing in part to its close connection to computer science. Recently, it has become apparent that combinatorial insights can shed new light on problems in other, seemingly unrelated, areas, such as ergodic theory - the study of the evolution of dynamical systems, encompassing a range of applications from epidemic models to planetary motion. It turns out that one can often associate a graph or another discrete structure to a dynamical system and then use combinatorial methods to elucidate its properties. The goals of this project are to extend the range of applications of this approach and develop new powerful combinatorial tools for the needs of other areas.

Groups are studied through the way they act as symmetries of various other mathematical objects. These actions are ubiquitous in mathematics and in sciences and they come at various levels of resolution. The project considers group actions in the very broad context of preserving definable sets, and more narrow contexts of preserving a notion of being close and of preserving the size of sets. The ideas in the project use and connect several disparate areas of mathematics. In addition, the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.  <br/><br/>The project will tackle three types of issues all related to dynamics of topological groups. The first part aims to make progress on an important dichotomy in Descriptive Set Theory of Borel equivalence relations; the second part will investigate submeasures, concentration of measure in associated sequences of mm-spaces, and dynamics of associated topological groups; the third part, using measurable dynamics and unitary representations, will deal with the nature of the closed subgroups generated by generic measure preserving transformations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This amounts to providing a ""catalog"" or ""listing"" of these objects, in principle not unlike that of cataloging species in biology or stars and galaxies in astronomy. If such a classification is possible, one has a ""complete"" understanding of the mathematical structures involved.  Otherwise a more or less ""chaotic"" behavior is expected. It is thus very important to understand under what circumstances a classification is possible. This difficult foundational question is further complicated by the fact that what constitutes an acceptable classification is very much dependent on the particular field of mathematics studied, so the criteria for a ""good"" classification in one area might not be appropriate in another.  At its basic level, this project aims to develop a general quantitative theory, which in many situations can precisely measure the complexity of a classification problem and thus provide objective means by which one can decide, in any given field, whether a satisfactory classification of the objects in question is possible. Developments arising in this program often lead to the study of the symmetries of various mathematical structures and their dynamics as well as connections to areas of discrete mathematics, dynamical systems or probability and this is another important aspect of this project. In addition the project also provides research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/> <br/>The general aim of this project is the development of the theory of definable actions of Polish groups, the structure and classification of their orbit spaces, and the closely related study of definable equivalence relations and graphs. This work is motivated by basic foundational questions, like understanding the nature of complete classification of mathematical objects, up to some notion of equivalence, by invariants, and creating a mathematical framework for measuring the complexity of such classification problems. This theory is developed within the context of descriptive set theory which provides the basic underlying concepts and methods. On the other hand, in view of its broad scope, it has natural interactions with many other areas of mathematics, such as model theory, group theory, topological dynamics, ergodic theory, probability theory and combinatorics. Within this general program Kechris proposes to study: (i) the theory of countable Borel equivalence relations;  (ii) descriptive aspects of the global theory of measure preserving group actions and equivalence relations; (iii) descriptive graph combinatorics, including its relation to ergodic theory, geometric group theory and probability theory; (iv) classification problems for Polish non-archimedean groups; and (v) dynamics of Polish groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These two meetings, the North American Annual Meeting of the ASL and the Logic Colloquium (or European Summer Meeting), cover all aspects of logic: complexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of arithmetic, philosophical logic, pure and applied model theory, proof theory, computability theory, set theory, subsystems of analysis, topos theory and more.  They are well attended by logicians of all stripes, and are of paramount importance to young researchers entering logic.  The grants supplied by the ASL using this award will allow American students to attend each of these meetings, and will also support foreign PhD students coming to the U.S. for the North American Annual Meeting.  This has been the case for the past 21 years, as an ongoing series of NSF awards has allowed the ASL to offer such grants continuously since 1998.  The first meeting held under the auspices of this grant will be the 2020 North American Annual Meeting of the ASL, to be held at the University of California at Irvine in March 2020. <br/> <br/>These conferences promote all areas of modern mathematical logic and their applications to other areas of mathematics, and beyond. The invited presentations provide an opportunity for discussion of the latest developments in the field, and the contributed talk sessions give graduate students and young researchers an opportunity to  present their own work, thereby contributing to their training and professional development. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to students from groups underrepresented in logic and mathematics, as well as to students who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference. <br/> <br/>ASL website: aslonline.org<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combinatorics is the area of mathematics concerning discrete structures, such as graphs, which can be viewed as mathematical objects representing networks consisting of nodes with links between them. This area has experienced immense growth in the past several decades, owing in part to its close connection to computer science. Recently, it has become apparent that combinatorial insights can shed new light on problems in other, seemingly unrelated, areas, such as ergodic theory - the study of the evolution of dynamical systems, encompassing a range of applications from epidemic models to planetary motion. It turns out that one can often associate a graph or another discrete structure to a dynamical system and then use combinatorial methods to elucidate its properties. The goals of this project are to extend the range of applications of this approach and develop new powerful combinatorial tools for the needs of other areas.
