In the <br/>first set of problems he investigates several distinct combinatorial <br/>situations that arise in different contexts, including recursive <br/>model theory and classification theory.  In each of these situations <br/>a definable group is known to be present as well as an action of the <br/>group on the combinatorial configuration.  Laskowski will continue <br/>his investigations into what specific properties such a group must <br/>possess.  As the group is acting on the configuration, such results <br/>would immediately yield restrictions on the complexity of the <br/>configuration. In many different settings, Laskowski has been able <br/>to apply some of the tools from Descriptive Set Theory to answer <br/>questions in model theory, primarily for theories in a countable <br/>language.  Recent developments give him hope that the Main Gap for <br/>omega1-saturated models is within reach.  A third problem is to <br/>continue his investigations into the algebraic underpinnings of <br/>various fuzzy logics.  Specifically, he is aiming for a sharp bound <br/>on the computational complexity of determining which sentences are <br/>logically valid in various fuzzy logic systems. By building on previous <br/>results, this question is cast in terms of various embedding questions <br/>between certain ordered abelian semigroups.<br/><br/>Model theory is concerned with the interplay between theories (i.e., <br/>sets of sentences in a very formal language) and classes of algebraic <br/>structures (models).

These two events are arguably the most important<br/>meetings in the field of logic; since their inception, they have<br/>been international scientific meetings of the highest standard of<br/>excellence. The Association works to ensure that these meetings<br/>cover logic comprehensively and that they represent the highest<br/>quality work being done in this field. They accordingly have<br/>provided important opportunities for intellectual exchange, thus<br/>acting as a stimulus to advancement of research.  For graduate<br/>students in logic, the opportunity to attend one or both of these<br/>ASL meetings is an indispensible component of serious<br/>participation in the profession.<br/><br/>The Association for Symbolic Logic is the leading international<br/>professional society for logicians, whose membership includes<br/>researchers in computer science, cognitive science, linguistics,<br/>mathematics, and philosophy. It organizes and sponsors a number<br/>of important meetings. Most prominent among these are its Annual<br/>Meeting, held each year in North America, and its European Summer<br/>Meeting. The Association also has met for many years at the Joint<br/>Mathematics Meetings and with the American Philosophical<br/>Association. Recent sponsored meetings have taken place in Asia,<br/>Australia, Europe, and North and South America. During the last<br/>few years, the Association has actively sought to increase the<br/>range and number of meetings of which it is a sponsor. A<br/>particular aim of this effort is to embrace new and emerging<br/>fields in which logic has come to play an important role,<br/>including computer science, linguistics, and cognitive<br/>science. This project will permit the continuation of a<br/>successful program of graduate student travel awards that the<br/>Association has administered since 1993 and that has been partly<br/>funded by NSF since 1997. The program has proved to be a highly<br/>effective means of bringing students in logic to important<br/>professional meetings at which they can meet and exchange ideas<br/>with leading logicians, an experience which is a vital component<br/>in training future Ph.D.'s in the field. Almost fifty percent of<br/>the awards funded by N.S.F. during the period 1998-2001 (the<br/>first N.S.F.-supported awards were made in 1998) went to students<br/>who subsequently have earned their Ph.D.'s in logic.

The outstanding algorithmic questions: Is there an algorithm to determine whether the quasi-equations valid in a finite algebra F are finitely based?  Is there an algorithm to determine if the quasi-variety generated by F possesses a natural duality?  Is the class of finite algebras possessing a finite equational basis recursively enumerable?  Is the class of finite algebras generating a residually large variety recursively enumerable?  Among the important structural questions: What collection of algebraic properties is necessary and sufficient for a finitely generated variety to be finitely decidable, or to have few models?  <br/><br/>Purely theoretical research in this branch of general algebra is driven today not by the likelihood of supplying any pressing practical needs, but rather by the sheer difficulty of the intellectual challenge and the tremendous sense of satisfaction that accompanies success.  However, this work, like all of algebra, spawns a constant stream of algorithms, many of which, though feasible, are extremely difficult to implement efficiently on a computer, providing a severe test of the state-of-the-art in hardware and software and programming skills.  The current theorem-proving programs for equational logic are a good example of this phenomenon.  There appears to be a growing realization in the theoretical computer science community that general algebra is the mathematical language in which they most need to be fluent.  The principal investigator believes that research into the interplay between, on the one hand, the existence or nonexistence of algorithms to recognize fundamental properties of finite algebras, and on the other hand, the levels of structural complexity manifested in the algebras---what this project is all about---has the potential not only to expand our understanding of the structural possibilities in finite algebraic systems (which it has already done), but to produce, some day, superior codes and ciphers for secure information transfer.<br/><br/><br/>"

The central idea in the field of cardinal<br/>invariants is to assign cardinal numbers to various Borel (that is,<br/>suitably definable) structures on the real line or similar spaces.<br/>The comparison of these cardinal numbers provides a way to measure<br/>differences between distinct Borel structures, and the principal<br/>investigator has developed a method for comparing many of these<br/>cardinal numbers.  It turns out that the comparison of cardinal<br/>numbers frequently translates back to natural Borel questions about the<br/>Borel structures, without loss of information.  Questions to be studied<br/>under this grant include the extension of the syntactically defined<br/>class of problems for which the technique sketched above works; the<br/>relevance of large cardinal axioms to the translation method; particular<br/>cases of Borel structures arising in dynamical systems or in the study<br/>of Borel equivalence relations, and a duality that relates these results<br/>to a method recently found by W. Hugh Woodin.<br/><br/>Ordinary cardinal numbers are used for counting, i.e., for comparing<br/>the sizes of collections of objects.  For more than one hundred years<br/>mathematicians have had a version of cardinal numbers for infinite<br/>sets, beginning with the notion of comparison: if two sets A and B can<br/>be put into a one-to-one correspondence then we say that A and B have<br/>the same cardinality.  From this point of view the set of natural<br/>numbers {1, 2, 3, ...} and its subset of even natural numbers {2, 4,<br/>6, ...}  have the same cardinality (size) since multiplication by 2<br/>gives a one-to-one correspondence from the first set to the second<br/>one.  Both of these sets are infinite, i.e. larger than any finite<br/>set, and one of the key steps in the development of logic and set<br/>theory was the realization by Georg Cantor that the set of real<br/>numbers is definitely of a larger cardinality than the set of natural<br/>numbers.  Modern set theory has developed notions and tools for<br/>working with sets of larger cardinality than the real line, and<br/>these tools are becoming useful in exploring constructions and<br/>properties that arise in dynamical systems and measure theory."

On the pure<br/>side are problems involving definability and fine structure in<br/>models of simple theories, which will be approached using the<br/>theory of elementary pairs of models. Also questions on the<br/>structure of the Lascar group, a certain Galois group attached to<br/>any first order theory, raise new conjectural relationships<br/>between first order logic and descriptive set theory. The applied<br/>side of the proposal deals mainly with jet-space methods in<br/>differential fields, the Galois theory of differential equations<br/>in positive characteristic, and the model theory of Kahler<br/>manifolds. Among the common themes on the applied side is the<br/>manner in which model theory predicts that the further a<br/>definable set is from algebraic geometry, the more rigid is its<br/>structure, and the mathematical implications of this behaviour in<br/>the concrete situations under investigation.<br/><br/>The proposal is in a certain branch of mathematical logic called<br/>model theory.

Although the present proposal does not touch<br/>directly on computability questions, it is worth remarking that<br/>mathematical logicians such as Turing provided the first rigorous<br/>notions of computability and played a role in the development of<br/>actual computers. Model theory, on the other hand, is concerned<br/>with a detailed study of the language in which mathematicians<br/>express themselves and define mathematical<br/>objects.

The first part of the project is concerned with studying the composant equivalence relation on indecomposable continua using techniques and notions developed in the study of Borel equivalence relations. Solecki builds on his prior work on indecomposable continua. He primarily investigates the question whether on a comeager subset of an indecomposable continuum the composant equivalence relation is Borel isomorphic to one of two special Borel equivalence relations via an isomorphism preserving meager sets. The affirmative answer to this question would solve an old problem of Kuratowski and even partial results for special indecomposable continua would sharpen several theorems from the literature. In the second part of the project, Solecki studies ideals of closed subsets of a Polish space.  He investigates a certain very concrete representation of simply definable ideals of compact sets. This is connected with several open problems in this area of mathematics. Additionally, he continues his study of the ideal of Haar null subsets of a Polish group. Particular aims here are to develop the theory for all non-abelian Polish groups (the theory works fine for the class of Polish groups with invariant metrics) and to fully understand the connection between Haar null sets in infinite products of locally compact groups and amenability of the factor groups.<br/><br/>One of the themes of Solecki's project is the investigation of indecomposable continua. These are fascinating geometrical objects whose intricate topological properties attracted interest of mathematicians since the beginning of the (last) century. However, only quite recently it was realized how ubiquitous such continua are and how important a role they play in various contexts in dynamical systems and topology. There is an old conjecture, due to Kuratowski, which is still unresolved and whose confirmation would completely reveal the finer structure of indecomposable continua. Solecki works on particularly important instances of this hypothesis and other problems related to it.  Another theme of Solecki's project is the study of certain notions of smallness. These are important in various branches of mathematics to measure the size of sets under consideration. The starting point here is his observation that a vast class of such families of small sets admit surprising and very concrete type of representations. The possibility of representing a family of small sets in this fashion has deep implications for the structure of such families and, if realized, answers some old questions regarding this structure. Solecki studies the extent to which such representations can be established, interconnections between these type of representations and properties of notions of smallness, and other problems related to notions of smallness.  <br/>"

Uniformity has to be understood here in the following sense. Suppose an  algebraic-geometric object, such as  a variety or a coherent sheaf,  is presented to us by means of some polynomials over an algebraically closed field. From this object other objects or invariants can be derived by applying some algebraic-geometric process. The question posed is now when can this  construction be carried out by using only polynomials of degree bounded by the degree of the initial polynomials? In particular, when is an invariant associated to this object uniformly bounded by the initial degrees only? Provided such uniform bounds exist, the following transfer principle can be applied. Encode, allowing negations and quantification, the construction or some of its properties in the field by means of the coefficients of the polynomials involved--the existence of uniform bounds is certainly a necessary, but often even a sufficient condition for this to hold. Then use the Lefschetz Principle to carry over results from positive characteristic to zero characteristic, or, conversely, from zero characteristic  to almost all positive characteristics. The investigator has already successfully applied this method to the following non-trivial facts: the Bass Conjecture, the Zariski-Lipman Conjecture and the New Intersection Theorem. In this proposal, he is especially interested in applications to tight closure in characteristic zero. Moreover, he proposes to infer from the existence of uniform bounds, the constructible nature of certain algebraic-geometric constructions. For instance, he seeks to continue the following program originally initiated by Nagata and Grothendieck: for a given geometric property of a point on a variety,  when is the set of all points on the variety for which this property  holds, constructible?<br/><br/>This program provides an alternative approach to some open problems in the field, as well as a simplified treatment of previous results. The author takes a special interest in the following old problem, simple to state but yet so far resisting all known proof methods: is every curve in three dimensional space obtained by intersecting two surfaces? On a deeper level, the current proposal can be seen as an attempt to analyze and better understand the constructive nature of Algebraic Geometry, by looking at it from a logicians point of view. In this way, the Principal Investigator intends to present the domain in a more coherent and unified way and obtain an improved link between Geometry and Algebra.<br/>"

Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (CZF) provides a<br/>standard set theoretical framework for the development of constructive<br/>mathematics in the style of Errett Bishop.

In a similar vein, forcing<br/>methods germane to the intuitionistic context, as well as<br/>realizability structures, will be employed to tackle problems of<br/>independence on the basis of CZF. The theory of large cardinals has<br/>dominated research in classical set theory for the last 40 years. In<br/>the context of intuitionistic set theories large cardinal axioms have<br/>to be replaced by large set axioms. A central part of the proposed<br/>research will be concerned with studying notions of largeness couched<br/>in terms of elementary embeddings. It is hoped that this project will<br/>also shed light on the role of large cardinals in devising strong<br/>ordinal representation systems in the area of proof theory called<br/>ordinal analysis.<br/><br/>Constructive mathematics distinguishes itself from its traditional<br/>counterpart, classical mathematics, by insisting that proofs of<br/>existential theorems in mathematics respect constructive existence:<br/>that an existential claim must afford means for constructing an<br/>instance of it. The foundations of a systematic approach to<br/>constructive mathematics, known as intuitionism, were laid in<br/>Brouwer's response to the foundational crisis in mathematics at the<br/>beginning of the 20th century.  Nowadays, in computer science,<br/>constructive formal systems based on type theory, or on the<br/>Curry-Howard isomorphism have become increasingly widespread for<br/>program development and language design. The concepts of program and<br/>constructive proof are connected in a deep way. Via this connection<br/>proofs are used to support the development of reliable software<br/>systems.  The axioms of so-called Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory provide<br/>an accepted framework for formalizing classical mathematics whereas<br/>Constructive Set Theory (briefly CST) is a universal framework for<br/>developing mathematics from a constructive viewpoint.  This project is<br/>motivated by the desire to answer central questions regarding CST,<br/>questions that have shaped the research activity in classical<br/>Cantorian set theory for more than half a century. The work is<br/>expected to substantially enhance our understanding of models of<br/>constructive set theory and thereby enlarge the realm of<br/>constructivism.<br/>"

This research is an <br/>interdisciplinary area between applied analysis and computability and <br/>complexity theory, and sometimes also involves works in numerical <br/>analysis. The goal of the research is to understand the laws of real number <br/>computation, the computability content of existence results in analysis, and <br/>the computational complexity of computable operators. <br/><br/>Computability brings to mind computers, which are playing an ever larger<br/>role in our society. Computers operate on finite strings of digits.<br/>However most mathematical models describe continuous problems ranging<br/>from physical phenomena such as electromagnetism and sound waves, to<br/>engineering applications such as bridge designs and air flows around<br/>airplanes, to financial predictions such as expected investment returns.<br/>Continuous models are based fundamentally on the concept of real<br/>numbers. Although a large portion of computer resources is devoted to<br/>compute the solutions of such continuous problems, real number<br/>computation is not as well understood as it should be. There still <br/>exists a big gap between the continuous nature of problem from the <br/>physical world and the computability and complexity theory of discrete <br/>structures. The explosion of Ariane 5 rocket on June 4, 1996, is a drastic <br/>example. The problem at the center is that computers operate on finite <br/>strings of digits  while the real numbers are infinite mathematical objects.<br/>The increasing demand for reliable as well as fast software requires a<br/>better understanding of real number computation. Computable analysis is<br/>a theory which studies the laws of real number computation. Its goal is<br/>to bridge the gap between analysis, the mathematical theory of real<br/>numbers, on the one end, and computability on the other. It studies<br/>which computations in analysis, physical sciences, and engineering are<br/>possible and which are not. The research lets us understand why a<br/>problem cannot be solved on computers, or provides us with a better<br/>understanding of the computability content of a continuous problem and<br/>thus better tools for constructing more efficient algorithms. The<br/>research outputs of the conference series are substantial. The series<br/>has produced five volumes of proceedings containing more than 100<br/>(refereed) papers ranging from theoretical investigations of<br/>computability and complexity in analysis to new implementations of exact<br/>real arithmetics as well as further developments of existing<br/>software packages.<br/>"

(Sentences in logic are built out of a small<br/>repertoire of elements and constructions.  ""First-order"" refers to the<br/>number of quantifiers in a sentence, a measure of complexity.)<br/>A model for the algorithms and bounds sought in some of these projects<br/>is long division: if you are given two whole numbers to divide by hand<br/>then you can estimate the number of steps required by long division<br/>by comparing the number of digits in the decimal expansions<br/>of the dividend and divisor."

In many practically<br/>important cases, polynomials in the definition of a<br/>semi-algebraic set are sparse, i.e., have few non-zero<br/>coefficients. Sparsity is not preserved by many natural<br/>operations, such as projection to a subspace or closure.  The<br/>results of the proposed research would allow one to evaluate the<br/>complexity of operations on semi-algebraic sets in terms of the<br/>complexity of some auxiliary sets, retaining sparsity of the<br/>original polynomials. This may drastically improve upper bounds<br/>on the complexity of such operations, leading to more efficient,<br/>faster computer algorithms.<br/><br/><br/>"
