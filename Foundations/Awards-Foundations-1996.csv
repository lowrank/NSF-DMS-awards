Namely, a game theoretic version of the conjecture has been proved under that assumption.  It will be investigated whether these techniques can be applied to prove the entire conjecture.  Also, the necessity of the measurable will be studied.  In other work involving large cardinals, it has been proved that a very large cardinal assumption implies a combinatorial statement about a tower of finite left distributive algebras (algebras satisfying the law a(bc) = (ab)(ac)).  It will be studied whether the large cardinals are needed.  Also the possibility of implications of the combinatorial result for the classical braid groups will be investigated.    This research links large cardinal theory with some classical mathematics.  A ""cardinal"" is the mathematical notion of size as it applies to finite and infinite sets.  A ""large cardinal"" is an extremely large such size, with additional technical features.  It is known that large cardinals are so large that their existence can't be proved by the usual methods of proof.  This makes it very surprising that large cardinals have implications for the finite world, but they do.  Indeed, there are mathematical assertions about finite structures which, surprisingly, need a large cardinal for their proof.  Recently some finite statements which are in the vein of classical mathematics have been proved using large cardinals.  One of the statements is related to the ""braid groups"" (a subject which as been studied by mathematicians, with very intensive investigations since the mid-1980's upon discovery of its connections with physics).  The research in this project is twofold:  to determine if the large cardinal is necessary, and to pursue the fascinating possibility of implications of large cardinal theory for the braid groups and beyond."

The  research of Douglas Burke is primarily concerned with generic embeddings  in set theory.  These embeddings have been instrumental in using new  axioms (large cardinals) to prove statements that are undecidable in the  usual, basic axioms of set theory.  In particular, they have many  applications in descriptive set theory and combinatorial set theory. Burke  has two long term goals in his research program: (i) to apply large  cardinals and generic embeddings to combinatorial questions (and apply  combinatorial results to questions about generic embeddings), and (ii) to  extend the connection between large cardinals and definable well-orderings  of the real numbers to larger classes of definable sets. Derrick DuBose  has been engaged in establishing correspondences between inner models  closed under sharp functions and the determinacy of classe s near the  bottom of the analytic hierarchy.  He intends to establish similar  correspondences involving classes higher up in the analytic hierarchy.  He  will also continue to investigate moderate determinacy assumptions and the  determinacy strength of small ""mice"" and of mild large cardinal properties.    During the last fifty years, many natural mathematical questions have been  shown to be independent of the usual axioms of set theory.  In order to  decide such questions, new axioms have been introduced.  Of particular  importance are Large Cardinal Axioms and Determinacy Hypotheses. The Large  Cardinal Axioms are axioms of infinity, whereas determinacy hypotheses  state that certain definable infinite games have winning strategies.  Surprisingly, a strong connection exists between these two groups of  axioms. Also both are important in that they decide many properties about  sets of real numbers and other ``small'' sets."

Connecticut    Classification theory is concerned with determining whether a given class of mathematical objects admits a ""structure theory"".  In the best cases, a structure theory assigns certain dimensions which determine each object in the class up to isomorphism.  The class of vector spaces over a given field, with the usual notion of dimension, is a simple example of a good case.  More generally a structure theory aims to describe how each member of the class is built from smaller objects in the same class, or even from simpler objects belonging to a second, well understood class.  Shelah has isolated certain properties of a countable, complete first order theory which are necessary and sufficient for the class models of T to admit a structure theory.  One key property is that of being superstable, a guarantee that certain subsets of the models of T can be viewed as pregeometries, and thus carry the desired dimensions.  Investigating the precise nature of the aforementioned pregeometries, and the way in which they interact, can yield very deep information about the fine structure of the models; such investigation has become known as geometric stability theory.  Chowdhuiy will apply the methods of geometric stability theory to gain further information about superstable theories.  In particular, his work is aimed at extending Shelah's classification results to uncountable theories.  This should result in new structural information regarding the models of superstable theories, countable or not.  In addition, Chowdhury plans to examine which properties of superstable theories can be generalised to a broader class, called supersimple theories.  Supersimple theories, though not necessarily stable, exhibit some of the important characteristics of superstable theories.        In model theory one studies those mathematical objects (called 'models"") which satisfy a given collection of axioms.  While one may think of a group as the set of transformations , or symmetries, of a particular object - such as an organic molecule, the general class of objects known as groups are precisely the models of the three group axioms.  In algebra, one attempts to understand complicated objects (e.g., groups) in terms of how they are built from well-understood objects; when this succeeds, this is called a ""structure theory"".  In model theory, one considers a general set of axioms and the collection of models, and asks whether there are properties inherent in the set of axioms which guarantee the existence of a structure theory.  Rather remarkably, it turns out that certain abstract properties of a set of axioms do indeed imply certain structural features for the corresponding objects; one such property is called ""superstability"".  The principal investigator proposes to continue the study of superstability (and its variations) and of its structural implications for a broader array of objects, one which includes interesting and important mathematical classes."

From a constructive point of view, mathematics must   always have some concrete, computational meaning, from which it   derives its applicability.

While ""an o-minimal structure"" is a notion of model theory, it turns out that many important expansions of real numbers are o-minimal, and this model theoretical notion provides a natural framework for the study of ""analytic-geometric"" categories.  Tools of model theory have been successfully applied to these categories yielding interesting theorems about the real numbers.  The starting point for this project is the observation that groups definable in o-minimal structures can be viewed as Lie groups over real closed fields.  Certain aspects of these groups are easily overlooked when treated only over the field of real numbers.  These aspects come into full view, however, when we regard the groups as definable in model-theoretically well-behaved structures.  The main goal of Starchenko's project is to obtain a reasonable classification of o-minimal groups, in order to develop a model-theoretical analogue of Lie theory.  He conjectures that locally o-minimal groups are algebraic and Lie morphisms are, essentially, Nash morphisms.  If this is the case, then many properties of algebraic groups can be transferred to o-minimal groups, thus providing new tools to study such groups.  Since the field of algebraic real numbers is o-minimal, these tools can then be applied to study groups definable in expansions of number fields.  On the other hand, any negative example will provide new information about interactions between geometric and algebraic properties of Euclidean groups.  The second part of the project concerns some open questions in stability theory.  It has been shown that many ideas and tools of model theory have natural geometric analogues in o-minimal structures.  The investigator hopes that the presence of a nice geometry can help to solve o-minimal versions of the two most famous questions in stability theory.    This project employs l ogical tools of model theory, and specifically a notion called o-minimality, to deepen the mathematical understanding of several important number systems, including the real numbers.  An understanding of the real numbers and of their geometric properties is basic to mathematics, and also to many applications of mathematics, e.g. to manufacturing.  Model theory provides a valuable perspective in this understanding."

In spite of the dramatic effect the discovery of infinite  cardinals had on mathematics, some of the simplest questions regarding  their arithmetic remained unanswered, such as how large the continuum is.  The answer finally obtained to this question, by Godel and Cohen, was that  the cardinalities of powers of regular cardinals, in particular that of the  continuum, are independent of ZFC. The chaotic world-view which emerged  after Cohen's and Easton's independence results was challenged some years  later by Silver's theorem about powers of singulars, and eventually by  Shelah's work on cardinal arithmetic, which restored a dimension of order  and regularity to the arithmetic of singular cardinals.     The current project employs  set theoretic methods, especially those infinite combinatorics discovered in the context of cardinal arithmetic, to study a variety   of phenomena in infinite mathematical structures, such as embeddability and homogeneity.  Infinite sets come in different ""sizes"", called  cardinals: for example,  the whole numbers and the real numbers are both infinite but the set of  real numbers has the greater cardinal.   Infinite cardinals have their own  arithmetic; one can add, multiply and take powers, as with ordinary arithmetic. Research in the arithmetic of cardinals led to the development of Axiomatic Set   Theory, which in turn has provided a  foundations for mathematics.  There are two kinds of infinite cardinals, Regular and Singular. The arithmetic of  Regular cardinals was studied first and shown to be chaotic.  The arithmetic of Singular cardinals turns   out to be better behaved.  In recent years a coherent theory has developed, called   ""pcf theory"" by its inventor, Saharon Shelah, bringing some order to the realm of cardinal arithmetic, order  which was conspicuous in its absence for almost a century. This project employs pcf theory to discover patterns and interrelations among other infinite mathematical structures, in order to classify these structures according to complexity, generality, and various symmetry properties."

Cal-Berkeley            This project studies the recursively enumerable (re) sets of  integers, in a way which is independent of their enumeration and  independent of how integers are viewed as coding information. It is  the study of re sets purely in relation to each other. The main  ingredients of this study are: automorphisms of the collection of re  sets - the symmetries that exist among re sets; and invariant sets -  the walls that prevent symmetries. These two ingredients naturally go  hand-in-hand.  The main method used in this field is called `priority  arguments'. This is a technique for performing computable  constructions that ensure appropriate non-computable properties. A  current guiding problem is: if an invariant set has non-trivial  minimum information content then each of its members must have maximum  information content. It is known that settling this would involve an  extension of current automorphism techniques.             A set is ""re"" (recursively enumerable) if it can be  computably listed. For example, the set of all possible theorems of  mathematics (deduced from the usual axioms) is re. This project  studies the re sets themselves. Penrose, in his book The Emperor's New  Mind, suggests an analogy between computing and consciousness. This  projects seeks possibilities in the more strained analogy between re  sets (independent of their enumeration) and the timeless aspects of  consciousness. There are existing results which can be seen as  indicative of this direction. The main method used in this field is  called ""priority arguments"". This is a method whereby a common purpose  can be achieved by establishing an extensive field of ""world views"",  all working towards the common goal in their own separate ways, most  of which are conflicting. One interesting feature of the method is  that all reasonable world views must be allowed, including those that  deny the common purpose (those world views do their jobs by working  towards their own ne gations). Success in this project would strengthen  the potentially profound implications of the analogy linking  consciousness with a priority argument -like universe."

Cholak's research concerns the sets which can be listed using a Turing  machine, with the hope of further understanding the relationships between  sets which can be defined by formulas. Additionally, his research concerns  various dynamic properties of these sets -- how fast or slow their enumeration is,  and their information content."

Friedman      Friedman intends to work in four directions, all aimed at an understanding of the structure of the set-theoretic universe through the techniques of fine structure and forcing.  First, he intends to complete his book, entitled, ""Fine Structure and Class Forcing"".  Second, Friedman will pursue a number of questions in the area of class forcing over L through the use of the coding method and his method of iterated class forcing.  Third, Friedman intends to lay the foundation for an analogous theory relative to K=the core model for a strong cardinal, by first developing an improved fine structure theory for this model, and then adapting the coding method to this new context.  This work will be carried out jointly with his collaborators Jensen, Koepke and Wylie.  Lastly, Friedman will investigate a number of other forcing problems, related to 0# (with Velickovic), involving large cardinals (with Cummings) and in definability theory (with Bagaria).    Early this century, mathematicians developed the system ZFC of axioms for set theory, adequate to express and prove the theorems of mathematics.  However ZFC is incomplete:  there are statements that can neither be proved nor refuted in this theory.  An important task for the set theorist is to uncover new axioms to adjoin to ZFC so as to alleviate this incompleteness.  This will provide powerful new tools for the working mathematician, which may in addition have exciting applications for science in general.  Friedman's work is focused on the deepest possible understanding of the structure of models of ZFC, as a way of discovering the right axioms to add to this theory."

In recent years this connection has been developed with an eye to algebraic applications of first order methods to modules, and in particular to artin algebras.  The present project will expand this approach to include the model theory of modules with an endomorphism, or equivalently - the model theory of modules over the ring of polynomials.  Also to be considered are (1) first-order variants of the Brauer-Thrall conjectures for an artin algebra, and (2) a theory of homology for positive-primitive formulas.    This research involves the connection between logic and algebra.  Logic provides the context in which one can study the expressive power of mathematical language; as such it is an essential tool in computing.  Algebra provides a vehicle for understanding notions such as symmetry and mappings, and finds application in sciences and manufacturing.  Professor Herzog's research takes place in a part of algebra called module theory, which is akin to, but broader than, linear algebra.  The problems which arise are similar to solving systems of linear equations.  By forging the relationships between logic and algebra, his research will provide new understanding of modules."

This induces an orbit equivalence  relation : for the group G we have that the orbit of a point is the set of  all gx where g is in G . This in turn cues mathematicians to the abstract  study of the orbit equivalence relation, now isolated from the original  investigation of the action.  While work of some researchers on the edge of  ergodic theory illuminates the case when G is locally compact, the branch  of logic known as model theory is intimately concerned with the orbit  equivalence relations induced by the infinite symmetric group S of all  permutations of the countable set N, equipped with the topology of  pointwise convergence.  Hjorth's project is directed towards unifying these  very diverse areas under the study of continuous actions of separable  metrizable topological groups, commonly known as Polish groups.  This class  of groups includes some familiar topological groups which fail to be  locally compact, such as:  S,  the homeomorphism group of the unit  interval,  and the group of automorphisms of Hilbert space.      The notion of a group action can be understood by the following simple  analogy. Suppose  a fleck of sand is travelling through space, and we know  its position and velocity at a given time, call it t. In principle it  should be possible to calculate the position and velocity of the same fleck  at a later time, call it t + s. In this sense we can say that the real  number s ""acts"" on the collection of all possible positions and velocities.  From any position and velocity at time t, the number s produces the  position and velocity at time t+s.  All possible states reachable from a  specified starting point is what is called an orbit. The terminology  suggests an analogy: rather than looking at the position of a planet at one  fixed time, we look instead at the collection of all positions it can  occupy throughout its year: in  other words, its orbit. Hjorth's project  considers group actions and orbits in a very general context, with  particular focus on complicated groups which arise from logical  considerations.  Certain classifications are provided these group actions  and orbits, to give an understanding of when one is more complicated than  another. This research is foundational. A central goal  is  a deepened  understanding  of the subtle nature of  many  mathematical objects, such  as orbits of points in space."
