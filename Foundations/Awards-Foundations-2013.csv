"1300634","Classification of Unstable Theories","DMS","FOUNDATIONS","08/15/2013","07/30/2013","Maryanthe Malliaris","IL","University of Chicago","Standard Grant","Tomek Bartoszynski","07/31/2016","$129,998.00","","mem@math.uchicago.edu","5801 S ELLIS AVE","CHICAGO","IL","606375418","7737028669","MPS","1268","","$0.00","The proposed research focuses on unstable theories, primarily theories with the independence property. One direction of this work involves studying unstable theories from an asymptotic (ultrapower) point of view. Specifically, Malliaris plans to work on the structure of Keisler's order, a long standing program of comparing the complexity of theories, whose structure on the unstable theories has remained open since 1967. Keisler's order directly compares theories independent of language, and it was recognized early on that this order would likely give significant model-theoretic information. A complementary direction of this work involves developing further connections between model theory and graph theory. For instance, Malliaris plans to further develop the theory of characteristic sequences of hypergraphs (associated to formulas), a framework which brings ideas and techniques from graph theory and finite combinatorics such as Szemeredi regularity to bear on the analysis of types in unstable theories, and on various tradeoffs between independence and order in unstable theories. Informally, both the connections to graph theory and to ultrapowers give a perspective in which local noise is smoothed out and the nature of the significant jumps in the complexity of pseudofinite structure can be more clearly seen. This is an ideal context for studying the independence property, in which it is crucial to see finer distinctions between 'noise' or inconsistency arising from certain random structure, and more global compatibility. Broadly speaking, the proposed research program builds toward a more unified structure theory for the unstable theories, and aims to discover and further develop productive notions of complexity inherent to unstable theories.<br/><br/>The proposed work is in model theory, specifically the classification of unstable theories. A model is a structure given by the data of an underlying set along with an interpretation for all function, relation, and constant symbols in a fixed background language L; a theory is a complete consistent set of L-sentences of first-order logic; and an elementary class is precisely the class of models of some theory, e.g. algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0. A major interest of model theory is studying theories via elementary classes of models, that is, studying a theory at hand by classifying the possible variations within its associated elementary class. One of the most fertile contexts for model theoretic analysis has been stability theory, the study of so-called stable or 'tame' theories, developed by Shelah in the 1970s. While the much larger class of non-stable or 'unstable' theories are quite complex from the point of view of stability, they are of significant interest. Many mathematical structures are unstable, so provide both theoretical motivation and examples; and there are many conjectures and problems about unstable theories which naturally attract research. The proposed work aims to build tools and a perspective from which to identify and analyze jumps in model-theoretic complexity among the unstable theories from a more uniform point of view, as well as to develop certain productive analogies and interactions with finite and asymptotic combinatorics. At the same time, these tools will be tested, in part, via the large scale structural conjecture of Keisler's order."

The traditional view of this program has been that of an increment program with progress measured by a progression up the hierarchy of large cardinals. It is now known that this view is not correct. A critical transition occurs at the level of exactly one supercompact cardinal, and in solving the Inner Model Problem for this specific large cardinal axiom, one solves the Inner Model Problem for essentially all known large cardinal axioms. The solution must necessarily yield an ultimate enlargement of Godel's inner model L. This  Ultimate-L must closely approximate the parent universe V within which it is constructed. Though the detailed construction of Ultimate-L is open, the axiom, ``V = Ultimate-L'',  can be precisely formulated and its consequences explored even now. One can also precisely specify a conjecture which would be the final outcome of the construction of Ultimate-L. This is the Ultimate-L Conjecture. This conjecture is closely related to several other conjectures and these collectively are the focus of this research proposal.<br/><br/>The mathematical study of Infinity is the focus of Set Theory. This subject began on the basis of principles isolated by Cantor and then elaborated on by others. By the early part of the 20th century the basic Zermelo-Frankel Axioms had been isolated and these axioms together with the Axiom of Choice are the ZFC axioms. The ZFC axioms define the current conception of (mathematical) Infinity. The seminal discoveries of the latter half of the 20th century showed that most of the fundamental questions asked about infinite sets are unsolvable on the basis of the ZFC axioms. Famous among these unsolvable questions is that of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis which by the middle of the 20th century was widely regarded as one of the most important questions of mathematics.  This proposal focuses on the Ultimate-L Project. This project if successful will isolate (for the first time) an extension of the ZFC axioms that will resolve essentially all of these otherwise unsolvable questions (including that of the Continuum Hypothesis) and provide a framework for reducing all questions of Set Theory to questions of the existence of large infinite sets--these are the so called Axioms of Strong Infinity.  The new approach arises from a series of recent results which show that such an extension of the ZFC axioms might actually exist."

Ramsey theory is the study of finding canonical structures within a given class of structures.  Topological Ramsey spaces are topological spaces in which every subset X which has the property of Baire is Ramsey: every non-empty open set in the space contains a non-empty open subset which is either contained in or disjoint from X.  Such spaces unify a large body of results in Ramsey theory, including the theorems of Carlson-Simpson, Galvin-Prikry, Gowers, Graham-Rothschild, Milliken, and others.  Recent progress in the theory of topological Ramsey spaces due to Dobrinen and Todorcevic has proved useful in solving problems in Set Theory regarding the precise analysis of the difference between the Tukey and Rudin-Keisler reducibility notions.  Tukey reducibility, a weakening of Rudin-Keisler reducibility, is of high interest for its ability to classify ordered structures which defy classification by other means.  This research program seeks to develop a general framework for canonical equivalence relations on topological Ramsey spaces and provide a unifying theory for ultrafilters satisfying some weak partition property.  These new Ramsey theorems will be applied to classify the Tukey types of ultrafilters with partition properties.  Methods developed are intended to solve some long-standing problems in Ramsey theory.  Further, this research program aims to establish the full Tukey structure of ultrafilters and find the model-theoretic implications which Tukey ordering has for ultrapowers.<br/> <br/>A main driving force in mathematics is finding simplicity within seeming chaos.  Ramsey theory is the study of finding simple, canonical structures from within a maelstrom.  Tukey order is a useful means of classifying strengths of objects, thereby simplifying a morass of objects by grouping together all objects with the same strength.  Ultrafilters are of interest in many areas of mathematics, as they are used for constructing mathematical structures and models of mathematical theories.  In particular, ultrafilters are fundamental to mathematics, and Tukey order gives a good notion of the strength of an ultrafilter.  This project aims to develop methods which will solve long-standing open problems in Ramsey theory while significantly improving our knowledge of Tukey Order and Set Theory.  Being interdisciplinary and focused on fundamental problems, this project is expected to have high impact on several fields of mathematical."

The conference is organized with financial  support of the European Mathematical Society and Warsaw Center of Mathematics and Computer Science, Clay Mathematics Institute, and is endorsed by the Polish Mathematical Society.  The present application is not intended to provide any funding for the conference itself, only for funding for travel. There are several scientific themes of the conference, each represented by leading specialists. Professor Mostowski  made contributions to several areas of Mathematical Logic.  His most important work was in Set Theory, and the selection of topics reflects that.  Some of Mostowski's ideas have found their application in Foundations Computer Science. The program of the conference will include a lecture  and a tutorial on some recent  and rather unexpected developments in this area. Many can benefit from participation in the conference. In case this application is successful,  the opportunity to apply for travel grants will be advertised at the conference website, in the  Association for Symbolic Logic newsletter, and on popular logic-related websites. Travel grant applications will be reviewed by a committee set up and chaired by  Sergei Artemov of the Graduate Center  of City University of New York.  There are several faculty and graduate students at CUNY who are interested in going to the conference, but the committee will make every effort to make sure that the selection process is fair and open to everyone, with particular attention paid to applicants from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of the conference: In the sciences generally, disciplines and workers become increasingly specialized with the progression of generations.  This has certainly been the case with mathematical logic and foundational studies.  While this is not surprising, it is unfortunate for those whose concern is the foundations of mathematics itself.  A broad, informed, and unified outlook is important.  In 2013 there is a unique opportunity to have a conference aimed at bringing together and affecting researchers across the various sub-disciplines of foundational studies, encouraging interaction.  This year is the 100th anniversary of the birth of Andrzej Mostowski.  It will not be a commemoration meeting, but rather the organizers plan to use Mostowski  and his ideas  as a central organizing device, that will allow them to bring together researchers in all the basic areas of foundational studies. The expectation is that the speakers will present not only the panorama of results directly stemming from Professor Mostowski's research, but also proposals for research directions, unsolved problems, and possibilities for new applications.<br/><br/>The conference website is at http://mostowski100.mimuw.edu.pl/doku.php"

The PI's research is in three areas. It is well known that almost all of the basic notions of first-order model theory are absolute, i.e., their interpretation does not change depending on the model of set theory one is working in. The situation is known to be much more complicated for similar concepts in infinitary languages, where even simple concepts such as categoricity in power  can fail to be absolute, even for cardinal preserving forcings.   A few years ago, it was noted that if one places extremely strong stability theoretic conditions on a theory, then these conditions limit the quantifier complexity of  the elementary diagram of any model of the theory.  These bounds immediately give upper bounds  on the computable complexity of definable subsets of such a theory.  The model theoretic notion of definability of types over finite sets is intimately related to the notion of a compression scheme in computational learning theory.  This connection has beein fruitful in both directions. A number of examples of concept classes that posess compression schemes have been identified, and conversely this connection has led to a deeper model theoretic understanding of dependent theories.<br/><br/>Model theory is concerned with the interplay between theories, i.e., sets of sentences in a very formal language, and the classes of algebraic structures (models) that satisfy these sentences.  There is a well established taxonomy of theories, which is based on the embeddability or non-embeddability of certain configurations of elements into models of the theory. Laskowski has identified certain classes of theories that have direct connections to limitations on data compression and computational learning theory, and will continue his examination of these theories."

The two main meetings of the Association, arguably the most important meetings in the field of logic, are the North American Annual Meeting and the European Summer Meeting (also known as the Logic Colloquium). The Association also meets annually at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, where it typically co-sponsors one or more events with the American Mathematical Society and/or the Mathematical Association of America, and on a rotating basis with one of the three divisions of the American Philosophical Association. ASL-sponsored meetings are held throughout the world. The Association works to ensure that its meetings and those it sponsors cover logic and its applications comprehensively, and that they represent the highest quality work being done in the field. They accordingly provide important opportunities for serious intellectual exchange, thereby serving as a stimulus to advancement of research. For graduate students in logic, the opportunity to attend any of these meetings is a vital component of their training and subsequent entry into the profession. <br/><br/><br/>The Association for Symbolic Logic is the leading international professional society for logicians, whose membership includes researchers in computer science, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. It organizes and sponsors a number of important meetings. Most prominent among these are its North American Annual Meeting and European Summer Meeting, both held annually. Recent sponsored meetings have taken place in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America. The Association has actively sought to increase the range and number of meetings that it sponsors, a particular aim of which is to embrace new and emerging fields in which logic has come to play an important role, including computer science, linguistics, and cognitive science. This project will permit the continuation and appropriate expansion of a successful program of graduate student travel awards that the Association has administered since 1993 and that has been partially funded by NSF since 1997. The program has proved to be a highly effective means of bringing students in logic to important professional meetings at which they can meet and exchange ideas with leading logicians, as well as present papers on their original research. Approximately eighty-four percent of the awards funded by N.S.F. during the period 1998-2005 (the first N.S.F.-supported awards were made in 1998) went to students who subsequently have earned their Ph.D.'s in logic. Many of these awardees have obtained excellent postdoctoral and permanent positions. Several of the early award recipients already have served on ASL or ASL-sponsored meeting program committees and have been appointed to standing committees of the Association.

Von Neumann algebras do not contain significant information about the group or action that they were constructed from. Nevertheless, in the past decade, Popa's deformation/rigidity theory has led to an explosion of rigidity results. These show that many properties of groups or actions can be recognized by looking at their von Neumann algebras. Ioana will develop new methods to study rigidity for von Neumann algebras. Three specific directions of research will be pursued. Firstly, Ioana will expand the scope of super-rigidity for von Neumann algebras by providing new examples of groups and actions that can be entirely reconstructed from their von Neumann algebras. A second direction concerns  Cartan subalgebras of von Neumann algebras.  Finally, Ioana will investigate the notion of orbit equivalence for group actions. Several research projects on these topics will further the discovery of new knowledge in all of these directions.<br/><br/>This mathematics research project is in the general area of operator algebras, and it deals with the classifications of von Neumann algebras. These algebras are connected and have direct applications to a number of areas of science, such as quantum computing, biology (structure of DNA) and engineering (cell phone design).  As part of this mathematics research project, the principal investigator Adrian Ioana will develop two new courses at the undergraduate and graduate level, respectively.  Ioana is currently mentoring several graduate students and running a seminar in areas close to the research-related content of this project.  In addition to supporting graduate students, Ioana will hire and mentor one postdoctoral scholar.  Ioana will also organize a research workshop, whose goal is to acquaint young researchers with some of the latest exciting developments on the topics pertaining this project.  Finally,  Ioana will train high school students  and college students to participate in mathematics competitions."

One of the central goals of this investigation is to achieve a better understanding of the geometric consequences of the non-definability of the set of integers on the definability of fractals. Towards this goal, we will apply methods from real analysis, geometric measure theory and model theory, some of which have not yet been used in the study of expansions of the real field. The insights of this research are not only important in the fundamental study of tameness in ordered fields, but should also prove useful to questions in control theory and real-analytic geometry.<br/><br/>The study of o-minimal geometry, a branch of mathematical logic, can be considered as a framework for studying tame geometric objects. In the last two decades researchers proved that many classical phenomena from real-analytic geometry fall into the framework of o-minimality. This has led to advances not only in geometry, but also in other branches of mathematics like Lie theory and number theory, and in such diverse fields as general equilibrium theory in economics and neural networks in computer science. Unfortunately, o-minimality can only be used to model phenomena that are at least locally finite (more precisely, locally having only finitely many connected components). Many natural geometric objects like spirals or fractals do not have this finiteness property and hence the known techniques are unapplicable to such an object. Hieronymi aims to overcome this limitation by studying tameness even outside the setting of local finiteness."

The conference proper will be preceded by a four-day summer school. The scientific program of the combined events will include -- in addition to the Shanks Lectures -- invited lectures, training tutorials and contributed talks (standard and featured/selected).<br/><br/>The conference is of interdisciplinary nature and brings together a number of areas contributing to the study of logic, via semantic and syntactic methods. TACL allows for interaction between methodologies from different areas of mathematics (including Topology, Algebra and Category Theory) and the formation of hybrid approaches (for example, Algebraic Proof Theory). At the same time, via the study of classical<br/>and non-classical logics, the conference allows the investigation of the applicability of logic to diverse disciplines ranging from classical algebra, to constructive mathematics and analysis, topology, geometry, theoretical computer science, mathematical linguistics and philosophy.<br/><br/>The combined event will be publicized  widely. Due to the high quality of the planed scientific program, upwards of 120 mathematicians, logicians and computer scientists are expected to participate. This proposal supports attendance by principal speakers and other participants, particularly targeting those without other sources of support, early career researchers, women, disabled persons and minorities. <br/><br/>Information about the combined events can be found at the conference website:<br/>http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~tacl2013/"

It is hoped that this study will uncover analogies between measurable dynamics of such groups and that of a single measure preserving transformation. This study is also expected to shed light on the structure of generic measure preserving transformations. In the second part of the project, Solecki will investigate certain combinatorial phenomena (Ramsey phenomena) that come up in connection with topological dynamics. Building on his abstract approach to Ramsey theory, he will attempt proving certain concrete Ramsey statements that have been proposed in the past. He will also attempt classification of concrete Ramsey theorems in certain limited contexts. Finally, in the third part of the project, he will work on very general, set theoretic methods (Tukey reductions) that are used to compare partial orders coming up in various areas of mathematics. <br/><br/>Solecki will investigate problems that involve interactions of various areas of mathematics: logic, ergodic theory, topological dynamics, and combinatorics. Three connected themes serve as both motivation for and areas of applications of the research funded by the project: study of groups of broadly understood symmetries of mathematical objects; study of generic, that is, exhibiting all possible random behavior, symmetries; and study of spaces of objects exhibiting strong forms of homogeneity."

The BEST conference provides the western region of the United States with a conference in Set Theory that emphasizes diversity. The conference actively seeks to recruit and integrate student and early career dissemination of research in Set Theory and its affiliated mathematical disciplines into the conference agenda. The conference promotes interaction between different career stages in the field by also recruiting four plenary speakers.  The plenary speakers for BEST 2013 are Dr. Todd Eisworth (Ohio University), Dr. Masaru Kada (Osaka Prefecture University, Japan), Thilo Weinert (University of Bonn, Germany) and Dr. Lynne Yengulalp (University of Dayton). The conference seeks to increase participation by underrepresented groups in the field.<br/><br/>Set Theory is the foundation of Mathematics, and as such, of modeling and deductive reasoning in the natural sciences.  Offering BEST at the Annual Meeting of the Pacific division of the AAAS thus provides potential for significant broader impact. Mathematics has always benefited from an influx of ideas and problems in other sciences, and conversely. It benefits the natural sciences, and also Set Theory, when opportunities for such cross fertilization are nurtured and facilitated.<br/>"

Jointly with Veronica Becher and Pablo Heiber, both at the University of Buenos Aires, Slaman will apply methods from Computability and Descriptive Set Theory to normality of real numbers, the property that the digits in their representations occur with equal asymptotic frequency, especially considering representations in varying bases.  Will also collaborate with Laurent Bienvenu, University of Paris Diderot-Paris 7, and Kelty Allen, an advanced graduate student working with Slaman, on the effective theory of<br/>Brownian motion.  In parallel, Slaman will investigate the more foundational question, ""What are the number theoretic consequences of familiar infinitary principles?"" as formalized in first and second order arithmetic.  The phrase ""first order arithmetic"" refers to the structure of the natural numbers N={0,1,2,...} with the operations of addition and multiplication.  ``Second order arithmetic'' refers to the expansion of N to include all of the subsets of N and allowing for reference to and quantification over infinite sets.  Stated more precisely, Slaman will investigate the extent to which second order principles, such as the existence of a random sequence or the assertion of a frequently applied infinitary combinatorial principle such as Ramsey's Theorem, have non-trivial consequences in first order arithmetic.<br/><br/>This project comes from the perspective of Mathematical Logic, that understanding the means by which one can work with mathematical objects can be as important as, or even equivalent to, understanding those objects themselves.  In one of the more interdisciplinary parts of the proposal, this point of view will be invoked to study the problem of constructing real numbers so as to control the behaviors of their representations relative to all integer bases.  One goal is to exhibit a fast-running algorithm to output an absolutely normal number, which means that for any integer base b the digits in the base b representation of this number occur with equal frequency over time.  Absolute normality is often interpreted as an indicator of randomness, but such an accessible and predictable example would refute that view.  Another part of the project puts Mathematical Logic in the foreground by asking for exact information concerning the extent that the properties of the real numbers, in the form of combinatorics seen within infinite subsets of the natural numbers, have consequences among the finite sets."

The conference will have five parallel Special Sessions in Asymmetric Topology, Set-theoretic Topology, Geometric Topology, Continuum Theory and Dynamical systems, and New Trends in Topology.  The special sessions proposed cover the classical scientific focus of the conference as well as established and emerging research interests of the various groups of topologists in North America.   In addition to plenary talks connected to these research areas, and usually to more than one area, there will be two workshops:  (1) Coarse Topology, with an emphasis on connections to geometric group theory, dimension theory, and geometric topology, and (2) Homogeneous Compact Spaces, one of the most important classes of spaces, for instance, containing the class of compact topological groups.  Each workshop will consist of a series of lectures intended to enable participants to begin research in these areas.  Although the workshops will be tied to General Topology and Geometric Topology, each will focus on new theory and techniques, will have broad appeal to attendees in other sessions, and will feature connections to areas both inside and outside topology. The conference proceedings will be published in the fully refereed journal Topology Proceedings (http://topology.auburn.edu/tp/).<br/><br/><br/>There are two major conference series on Topology in North America: the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference and the Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications.  The summer conference brings together mathematicians who have research interests in general topology, set-theoretic topology, topological algebras, topological groups, functional analysis, geometric topology, topological dynamics, and continuum theory as well as applied areas such as  computer science and computational topology/geometry, and other areas where topology has  applications and connections.  The scheduled workshops, one on Coarse Topology and the other on Homogeneous Compact Spaces, will acquaint younger researchers, including recent PhDs and graduate students, with active research areas in topology and its applications.  Major speakers with international reputations have been selected who are active in these research areas and others.  Students and junior researchers, whose focus has necessarily often been narrow, will be exposed to research techniques and results that draw from multiple sources.  NSF support will enable at least 12 US-based students and junior researchers to attend the conference and expand their research horizons.    <br/>http://topology.nipissingu.ca/summertop2013/<br/>http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/13-14/topology/index.html"

One component of the research is foundational: it aims to better understand the relationship between classification problems (such as the basis problem for the uncountable linear orders and the metrization problem for compact convex sets) and the value of the cardinality of the continuum.  Currently we have an acceptable understanding of how to produce models of set theory in which the continuum is the second uncountable cardinal; the methods for producing models of set theory in which the continuum has some other value is considerably more limited.  Part of the present proposal aims to develop better techniques for producing models of set theory in which the continuum is larger than the second uncountable cardinal, while maintaining the ability to control other combinatorial properties of sets in the model.  Additionally, the proposal aims to further develop techniques in Ramsey theory needed to solve problems arising in other fields and in particular arising in the study of the amenability of groups.  Specifically the amenability of Thompson's group F - the subject of a longstanding problem in the field - is equivalent to a new type of Ramsey-theoretic statement relating to generalizations of Hindman's theorem to nonassociative operations.<br/><br/>Frequently in mathematics it is necessary to find a guiding heuristic in order to gain intuition in a setting where our own human experience falls short.  Two examples of this need are provided by the study of the combinatorial properties of infinite sets and the geometry of high dimensional spaces.  In both cases, guiding intuition is provided by a classical piece of mathematics known as Ramsey's theorem, concerning colorings of edges in a graph, a mathematical abstraction relating to networks.  The proposal aims to develop new techniques in Ramsey theory in order to improve our understanding of foundational issues relating to infinite sets and high dimensional geometric objects."

We anticipate between eight and ten researchers will be in residence for the entire period, accompanied by a similar number of graduate students. We also expect shorter visits, of two to four weeks, by another eight to ten researchers. There will be an intense and sustained research effort in computability theory, randomness, computable structures and reverse mathematics. The semester will bring together many of the area's most active researchers over an extended interval, allowing for a level of collaboration that is not usually possible and the accelerated progress that arises from such continuous interaction. In addition to the research effort, there will be a focus on training graduate students and disseminating recent research. We will organize a graduate-level course on Combinatorics, Complexity and Logic taught by Ted Slaman; a topics seminar in which all of the long term participants, including the graduate students, will take turns presenting advanced material; a weekly seminar on individual research interests and related open problems; and a regional seminar that will feature South American logicians.
