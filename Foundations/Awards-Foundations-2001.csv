Uniformity has to be understood here in the following sense. Suppose an  algebraic-geometric object, such as  a variety or a coherent sheaf,  is presented to us by means of some polynomials over an algebraically closed field. From this object other objects or invariants can be derived by applying some algebraic-geometric process. The question posed is now when can this  construction be carried out by using only polynomials of degree bounded by the degree of the initial polynomials? In particular, when is an invariant associated to this object uniformly bounded by the initial degrees only? Provided such uniform bounds exist, the following transfer principle can be applied. Encode, allowing negations and quantification, the construction or some of its properties in the field by means of the coefficients of the polynomials involved--the existence of uniform bounds is certainly a necessary, but often even a sufficient condition for this to hold. Then use the Lefschetz Principle to carry over results from positive characteristic to zero characteristic, or, conversely, from zero characteristic  to almost all positive characteristics. The investigator has already successfully applied this method to the following non-trivial facts: the Bass Conjecture, the Zariski-Lipman Conjecture and the New Intersection Theorem. In this proposal, he is especially interested in applications to tight closure in characteristic zero. Moreover, he proposes to infer from the existence of uniform bounds, the constructible nature of certain algebraic-geometric constructions. For instance, he seeks to continue the following program originally initiated by Nagata and Grothendieck: for a given geometric property of a point on a variety,  when is the set of all points on the variety for which this property  holds, constructible?<br/><br/>This program provides an alternative approach to some open problems in the field, as well as a simplified treatment of previous results. The author takes a special interest in the following old problem, simple to state but yet so far resisting all known proof methods: is every curve in three dimensional space obtained by intersecting two surfaces? On a deeper level, the current proposal can be seen as an attempt to analyze and better understand the constructive nature of Algebraic Geometry, by looking at it from a logicians point of view. In this way, the Principal Investigator intends to present the domain in a more coherent and unified way and obtain an improved link between Geometry and Algebra.<br/>"

Baldwin will continue to investigate the the construction of homogeneous universal models with respect to a notion of strong submodel. One application of this method links stability theory with probability on finite models by providing a technique for not only proving 0-1 laws but obtaining model theoretic properties of the almost sure theory.  These model theoretic properties of the almost sure theory can be applied to problems in finite model theory. Baldwin has been a leader in the application of stability theory to the development of logic with finitely many variables. This work has, for the first time, provided serious links between the deep work of Cherlin, Harrington, Lachlan, and Zilber on homogeneous structures and the mainstream of finite model theory. Baldwin and Baizhanov are studying expansions of stable structures by arbitrary predicates; this is motivated by the earlier work with Benedikt on embedded finite model theory. Baldwin's earlier work with Holland has included applications in the area of algebra, specifically group theory, and in expansions of the complex numbers by an arbitrary subset. The present project will try to find some specific new structures which expand the complex numbers by subgroups of the multiplicative group.<br/><br/>Most of Baldwin's work has been in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic.  The general aim of this work is to understand `ordinary mathematics' at a higher level of abstraction.  This abstraction allows the discovery of common features in widely different areas of mathematics, ranging from probability theory to combinatorics to algebraic geometry.  This kind of work has been fruitful both in a better understanding of algebraic structures and in providing a background for investigations in database theory. In particular, Baldwin's work with his co-author Michael Benedikt of Lucent Technologies on `embedded finite model theory' has found limits on the expressibility of database queries. Baldwin will continue his educational work - primarily focusing on developing innovative and effective ways to prepare mathematics teachers.

In mathematical logic, Buss investigates proof theory and proof complexity, especially weak proof systems with close connections to open problems in computational complexity.   He investigates aspects of theoretical computer science related to open questions such as the ""P versus NP"" problem and related problems in complexity including open problems in the mathematical foundations of cryptography. Buss studies the proof complexity of propositional systems such as Frege systems, cutting planes systems, Nullstellensatz proof systems, counting axioms, the polynomial calculus, and intuitionistic proof systems. He plans to extend previous work on bounded arithmetic and its relationships with proof complexity, computational complexity and cryptographic conjectures.  The goals of this research are firstly to give bounds on proof size and on proof search algorithms, and to determine what kinds of computational content can be extracted from formal proofs; and secondly to investigate open problems in computational complexity from the viewpoint of mathematical logic.<br/><br/>The work of this project is motivated by the desire to obtain a better understanding of open problems in computational complexity.  These open problems include the ""P versus NP"" problem regarding the difficulty of solving a large range of combinatorial problems including scheduling and optimization; they also include establishing the possibility of mathematically secure cryptographic systems.  It is commonly believed that many of the computational problems in NP and in cryptography are intractible, and it important for many applications that they be intractible.  However, mathematical proofs of intractibility have not been obtained yet, in spite of extensive efforts. Buss works on aspect of these problems in the setting of mathematical logic and proof theory.  His work addresses the logical and computational complexity of formal, symbolic proofs; this includes the analysis of proofs in a variety of proof systems corresponding to feasible computation, and the possibility of extracting computational information from proofs. <br/><br/>This project will be supported by the Foundations program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Theory of Computing program of the Division of Computer and Communications Research.<br/>"

The first part of the project is concerned with studying the composant equivalence relation on indecomposable continua using techniques and notions developed in the study of Borel equivalence relations. Solecki builds on his prior work on indecomposable continua. He primarily investigates the question whether on a comeager subset of an indecomposable continuum the composant equivalence relation is Borel isomorphic to one of two special Borel equivalence relations via an isomorphism preserving meager sets. The affirmative answer to this question would solve an old problem of Kuratowski and even partial results for special indecomposable continua would sharpen several theorems from the literature. In the second part of the project, Solecki studies ideals of closed subsets of a Polish space.  He investigates a certain very concrete representation of simply definable ideals of compact sets. This is connected with several open problems in this area of mathematics. Additionally, he continues his study of the ideal of Haar null subsets of a Polish group. Particular aims here are to develop the theory for all non-abelian Polish groups (the theory works fine for the class of Polish groups with invariant metrics) and to fully understand the connection between Haar null sets in infinite products of locally compact groups and amenability of the factor groups.<br/><br/>One of the themes of Solecki's project is the investigation of indecomposable continua. These are fascinating geometrical objects whose intricate topological properties attracted interest of mathematicians since the beginning of the (last) century. However, only quite recently it was realized how ubiquitous such continua are and how important a role they play in various contexts in dynamical systems and topology. There is an old conjecture, due to Kuratowski, which is still unresolved and whose confirmation would completely reveal the finer structure of indecomposable continua. Solecki works on particularly important instances of this hypothesis and other problems related to it.  Another theme of Solecki's project is the study of certain notions of smallness. These are important in various branches of mathematics to measure the size of sets under consideration. The starting point here is his observation that a vast class of such families of small sets admit surprising and very concrete type of representations. The possibility of representing a family of small sets in this fashion has deep implications for the structure of such families and, if realized, answers some old questions regarding this structure. Solecki studies the extent to which such representations can be established, interconnections between these type of representations and properties of notions of smallness, and other problems related to notions of smallness.  <br/>"

The space Riem(M) of Riemannian metrics (modulo diffeomorphisms) on certain manifolds is of considerable interest to a wide variety of mathematicians and physicists.  Topologists have proved for certain natural scale invariant functionals related to diameter on the space Riem(M), and for certain manifolds M of dimension > 4 that for every c.e. set A there is a sequence of points x_n, n in N, the integers, such that if n in A then x_n determines a local minimum on Riem(M) whose depth is roughly equal to the halting time of the Turing machine computation that n in A.  The investigator constructed an infinite sequence of sets A_i, i in N, of c.e. sets so that for all n the settling function (for stopping times of the associated Turing machine) of A_i dominates that of A_{i+1}, even when the latter is composed with an arbitrary computable function.  The two results together give a ""fractal"" like behavior with extremely big basins, and very much smaller basins coming off them, and those containing still smaller basins, and so on, where the relative size of one set of basins to the next exceeds any computable function, what the topologists describe in their paper on fractals as ""the astonishing richness of the space of Riemannian metrics on a smooth manifold, up to reparametrization.''  The investigator's work will also stress connections of computability to model theory and algebraic structures. With a junior colleague and a graduate student he will classify the degree spectrum of models which are prime or saturated but which have no computable isomorphic copy.  Finally, he will continue his work on the automorphisms and structure of c.e. sets.  He will put together these results to help obtain a classification of structure of c.e. sets and effective content of certain parts of mathematics."

He is particularly interested in  obtaining large cardinal strength from the Proper Forcing Axiom,  from the failure of Jensen's square principle at a singular cardinal, and from the failure of the Unique Branches Hypothesis. In descriptive set theory, Steel is working on various questions related to the structure of models satisfying strong forms of determinacy.<br/><br/>    Strong axioms of infinity, or as they are more often called, large cardinal hypotheses, have been a focal point of work in set theory and the foundations of mathematics for thirty or forty years, for at least two reasons.  First, large cardinal hypotheses can be used to decide in a natural way many questions which cannot be decided on the basis of the commonly accepted system of axioms for mathematics, and second, large cardinal hypotheses provide a way of organizing and surveying all possible natural extensions of this commonly accepted system.   One important way to study large cardinal hypotheses is to construct canonical minimal inner models in which these hypotheses are true. Such models admit a systematic, detailed analysis of their internal structure which makes them an invaluable  technical tool in both sorts of application of large cardinal hypotheses.   At the moment, we have a good theory of canonical inner models satisfying ``There is a Woodin cardinal"", and even slightly stronger large cardinal hypotheses.  A fundamental open problem, one of the most important open problems in set theory, is to extend this theory to models satisfying ``There is a supercompact cardinal"".

Major problem is to know when the simple structure has generic stable reduct. A generic stable reduct of a simple structure is the definitional stable reduct preserving forking independence. If a stable reduct of a simple structure is found, then every problem is reduced to the stable context from the simple context. Hence then stationarity can be used, which will resolve many open problems such as definable infinite group existence in 1-based structures, and group configuration problems. Unlike the well-known  opposite process of constructing simple structures from stable structures, questions on finding stable fragments in simple structures seem to be rather difficult.<br/><br/>Over the last 3 to 4 decades, model theorists have worked on stable structures. Kim's thesis in 1996 opened new research areas in model theory enlarging the scope of  study of stable structures. Namely he proved the fundamental notion of independence in stable structures also exists in the wider class of structures, called simple. After then the study of simple structures takes place one of the major research area in model theory, and grows rapidly. Kim's continued work on simple structures will deepen and strengthen the model theoretic understanding of mathematical structures more.<br/>"

Set Theorists work with such embeddings<br/>(""elementary embeddings"") in much the same way that one would work with<br/>functions on numbers, asking ""how similar is the target structure to the<br/>original structure?"" and ""what's the smallest size of a set actually moved<br/>by the embedding?"" Such questions about embeddings of the universe form a<br/>subfield of Set Theory known as the study of large cardinals. The<br/>terminology here hints at the answer to the last question mentioned.<br/>Indeed, the sets actually moved by elementary embeddings are substantially<br/>larger than any object studied in other branches of Mathematics<br/>(substantially larger than the set of real numbers for example). Yet it<br/>turns out that the existence of elementary embeddings has concrete effects<br/>on lower level objects, including concrete effects on real numbers. This<br/>project is part of the on-going effort to better understand large<br/>cardinals, and better understand their effects on the line of real<br/>numbers. The PI, like other researchers in the field, is motivated by the<br/>connection between the abstract and the concrete.<br/>"

Included in the first area are investigations of the structures of sets and functions ordered by relative complexity of computation. Particular emphasis will be placed on the issue of definability in the complexity structures of all sets and those which are effectively enumerable. Included in this area is the analysis of the relations between difficulty of computing functions and other issues such as rates of growth, complexity of their definitions in arithmetic and the strength of axiom systems needed to prove their existence. Applications of the methods of pure computability theory will be made in the areas of computable algebra and model theory. General methods will be developed for transferring results from arbitrary structures to ones in specific classes of interest such as lattices, groups and rings. Another area where issues of computability and complexity are to be studied is that of modal and intuitionistic logics and their model theory. These logics are now used to model issues in program verification and computer security. The second area includes the study of structures representable by finite automata, decision procedures, the analysis and development of nonmonotonic logic, concurrent programming models, and applications of linear programming ideas and algorithms to data structures and logic programming. A primary focus here will be the logical and mathematical foundations of hybrid (continuous and discrete) control theory as well as the practical implementation of algorithms for these subjects based on the theoretical work being done. An important tool to be developed in this area is that of infinitary automata.<br/><br/>The research proposed is of two types. The first is directed at a better understanding of the fundamental notions of computability and relative difficulty of computation for different tasks. The theoretical work deals both with the abstract notion of computability as well as with applications to specific branches of, and questions in, other areas of mathematics. One important application (within mathematics) concerns the general question of what starting information is needed to be able to compute various aspects of many important classes of mathematical structures. In practical terms, the results at times indicate that there are no algorithms for certain important tasks or that more information than might have been expected is needed to write programs calculating the desired results. Another aspect of this work stresses the impact that the specific concrete choice of representation of an abstract mathematical structure has on one's ability to compute specific functions and relations. The second type deals more directly with developing the mathematical (and especially logical) tools needed for the crucial areas of program verification, data management and automated control of real-world complex systems. Commercial applications are expected for some of this work and there has already been a spin off to a start-up company developing several applications including data compression and network management algorithms. Other applications of these techniques to be investigated include multimedia applications and distributed continuous systems.<br/>"

Each Meeting is a chance for young mathematical logicians, graduate students, and post-docs to hear about and to discuss current work in  mathmetical logic.  The National Science foundation  has provided critical support for this effort for at least twelve years.<br/><br/> In addition to invited talks by senior logicians, a large number of short contributed talks is given by younger logicians.  Space and time are set aside for informal discussions.  Women and minorities are invited to participate.  Approximately 100 people are expected to attend the meeting.<br/><br/>"
