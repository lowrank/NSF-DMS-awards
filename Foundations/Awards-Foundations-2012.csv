The conference will be held from Thursday March 22 to Saturday March 24, 2012 at UNAM university facilities in downtown Mexico City. Special sessions will be offered in Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory/Geometric Topology, Low-dimensional Topology  and Set-theoretic Topology, as well as six plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks covering the breadth of the special sessions. The conference is organized by the special session organizing committees, the conference steering committee, local organizers and the investigators on the grant. The grant provides funds to support travel for graduate students and young researchers, in addition to the invited speakers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The series of conferences is one of the longest running in mathematics. In the spring of 1967, the first conference was held at Arizona State University, and it was primarily a conference on general topology and continuum theory. In the past 45 years, the conference has grown in size and scope. It has continued to be the most important conference of the year in set-theoretic topology and continuum theory, while expanding to include the areas of dynamical systems, geometric group theory, and geometric topology. Over the years, the conference has made special efforts to broaden participation by women, underrepresented groups, graduate students, and young researchers, while expanding to cover a broader section of topology. Many of the most famous results of the last 45 years have been first announced at this conference. The conference proceedings will be published in the refereed journal Topology Proceedings.<br/><br/>Conference website: http://www.matem.unam.mx/STDC2012/"

The LFCS series represents the body of work in those areas of fundamental logic related to computer science. The conference is intended to encourage the interchange and interuse of ideas emanating from a wide variety of fields and applications. Since its origin in 1989, each LFCS meeting has resulted in a Springer volume of proceedings published prior to the conference and, as has been the norm, a post-conference volume of Annals of Pure and Applied Logic - a flagship journal in mathematical logic.<br/><br/>LFCS conferences appear to be of significant and growing importance for the logic and foundations community in the United States since computer and information sciences provide a cluster of areas in which the core logical methods are applicable in the most immediate and powerful way. Such a conference is pivotal for building a cadre of future logical foundations of computer science. The US community in logic and foundations will benefit greatly from such a conference. Logic life in the San Diego area is vibrant with many directions of logic and foundations interacting in most fruitful ways.

A basic goal is to determine how well this ""continuous"" model theory distinguishes analytic structures, and which properties it captures.  Among the applications is new information about isomorphisms and embeddings between structures and their ultrapowers, as these can be readily reinterpreted using continuous model theory. The project also develops the continuous version of many model theoretic concepts, such as stability, primeness, quantifier elimination, model companions, and existential closedness, both for general logical theorems and new paradigms in functional analysis. Up to this point the emphasis has been on tracial von Neumann algebras, but the approach is expected to be fruitful for C*-algebras, subfactors, algebras equipped with an automorphism, etc. <br/> <br/>The past few years have seen several surprising applications of logical techniques in functional analysis, mostly coming from combinatorial and descriptive set theory. This project aims to import concepts from model theory, the study of the relation between mathematical objects and their logical properties. Given an object, suppose one knows the answer to all the questions that can be formulated in a specific way (first-order syntax) -- how well does one understand the object?  In general one cannot recover the object itself, but this ""logical information"" is relevant to many lines of research, and only recently has an appropriate version of model theory been applied to operator algebras. This project will continue to develop the ties between logic and functional analysis, in particular supporting travel for researchers and training for graduate students. The results should offer insights into active topics with applications to other branches of mathematics, for instance  the Connes Embedding Problem and logical stability."

In 60s and 70s, major progress was made towards the resolution of the problem. In particular, such canonical models were constructed for many large cardinals in the region of measurable cardinals and strong cardinals. However, soon new obstacles were discovered and through a fundamental work done by Martin, Steel and Woodin, it became increasingly clear that the ultimate resolution of the problem has to incorporate ideas from descriptive set theory. In late 80s and early 90s, Martin, Steel and Woodin, discovered many bridges between inner model theory and descriptive set theory thus unifying the two areas of set theory. Descriptive inner model theory is the theory that has emerged through their work. Its main technical problem is the descriptive version of the inner model problem, namely, the problem of constructing canonical models capturing the truth. While many formal versions of this problem are available, the one that has been publicized most is the Mouse Set Conjecture (MSC) which conjectures that in models of determinacy, ordinal definability, the most powerful form of definability, can be captured via canonical models of set theory. Sargsyan, in his thesis, building on an earlier work of Woodin, developed techniques for proving MSC and used these techniques to obtained some partial results on MSC. These partial results then were translated into the ordinary language of inner model theory, producing canonical models with large cardinals. Sargsyan believes that the descriptive approach to the inner model problem is the most promising route to the resolution of the 50 year old inner model problem and he plans to pursue it further.<br/><br/>Set theory is the language of mathematics. It provides the basic foundations above which the rest of mathematics is build. One of the most basic problems in the foundations of mathematic has been the reduction of all of mathematics into basic set of axioms whose consistency can either be proven or convincingly argued for. Gödel's celebrated incompleteness theorems imply that the first option is impossible. However, because of major developments in the previous century, the second option is possible via a class of axioms of infinity known as large cardinal axioms which assert the existence of very large sets. Virtually, as Gödel himself predicted, every know natural mathematical theory has been reduced to some large cardinal axiom. The set theorists of the 21st century inherited the problem of arguing for the consistency of such axioms which is usually done by exhibiting canonical examples or rather models of such axioms. The problem of exhibiting such canonical models for large cardinals has been known as the inner model problem which is the main subject of the proposed research."

Reimann intends to use concepts from dynamical systems and fractal geometry to study computability theoretic structures, in particular, the set MIN of reals of minimal Turing degree. Being a central object in the study of degrees of unsolvability, minimal degrees have recently exhibited interesting properties with respect to geometric measure theory. An open problem is the determination of the Hausdorff dimension of MIN. This problem is related to questions concerning extraction of randomness, diagonally non-computable functions, and Sacks forcing. It also motivates questions about algorithmic independence of reals, and how effective randomness (with respect to arbitrary measures) behaves under splits and joins. In a second area of investigation, Reimann proposes to study algorithmic reducibilities from the point of view of Borel equivalence relations. In a remarkable confluence of methods from descriptive set theory, ergodic theory, topological dynamics, and other areas, researchers have successfully classified many equivalence relations. Yet most equivalence relations arising from computability theoretic reducibilities have so far resisted complete classification. Reimann intends to investigate LR-equivalence, an equivalence relation of fundamental importance in effective randomness, and also the role uniformity plays in the classification of Borel equivalence relations.<br/><br/>Computability and randomness are two of the fundamental ideas that drove the scientific revolutions of the 20th century and changed the way we think about the world. Computability theory concerns itself with trying to understand which problems are solvable by computers. It was developed as a rigorous mathematical discipline in the 1930s through the work of Gödel, Church, Turing and others. Around the same time, Kolmogorov provided the notion of randomness with a solid mathematical foundation in the form of measure theoretic probability. The theory of effective randomness, which brings together probability theory and computability theory, has made it possible to qualitatively and quantitatively study the ways in which the two notions, computability and randomness, delimit and condition each other. It gives a mathematically precise meaning to questions like ""Are random processes necessarily uncomputable?"" or ""If we have access to randomness, can we facilitate computation?"" The major objective of the proposed project is to further the study of the interaction between randomness and computability. In one part of the project, this interaction is to be studied with the help of concepts from two other areas of mathematics - geometric measure theory and ergodic theory. In another part, Reimann plans to explore the role computability and randomness play in certain areas of dynamical systems. The latter objective can be seen as a first step of a long-term project - to help pave the way for a better, more exact understanding of the forms in which randomness does occur in this world, through the theory of effective randomness."

This requires intricate interplay of computability theory with algebra, topology, and geometry. Harizanov?s goal is to understand the computability theoretic properties of countable structures and their isomorphisms, and of natural relations on the domains of the structures. She studies the connections between definability and computability. The Turing degree spectra of structures can be related to the degree spectra of relations via spectrally universal structures, which are often obtained as Fraisse limits. Harizanov?s project includes model-theoretic complexity of computable structures measured by their Scott rank.  It also includes classification problems such as the isomorphism problem and the embedding problem for natural classes of algebraic structures. Harizanov studies the left orders and bi-orders of various torsion-free groups, including free groups, surface and braid groups, and how the topological properties of the spaces of orders relate to the computability-theoretic properties of orders. The project involves important new directions in computable structure theory, including the study of Turing degrees of the isomorphism types of geometric objects, such as varieties and schemes, and of structures with a nonassociative binary operation of importance in low-dimensional topology, such as quandles. <br/> <br/>Computable structure theory is a very active research area that has blossomed in the last few decades. It is of importance in theoretical mathematics and computer science and in the philosophy of mathematics. Some mathematical constructions are essentially nonalgorithmic, while the others are algorithmic, or can be replaced by algorithmic ones yielding the same results.  Computability theory has developed powerful and unique techniques to further analyze and classify nonalgorithmic mathematical objects. Such methods involve syntactic descriptions using computable infinitary language, as well as Turing and other degree theoretic measures of relative computational complexity of sets and problems they encode."

In regards to item (1), he plans on investigating how one can use the technique of hyperfinite approximation in infinite-dimensional Lie theory by embedding infinite-dimensional objects inside of hyperfinite objects in the hopes that the finite-dimensional theory will apply to the hyperfinite objects and the infinite-dimensional objects embedded in them.

This understanding can often lead to solutions to problems in various mathematical areas by taking general model-theoretic facts and interpreting them in specific contexts.  This approach has been most successful in discrete situations, such as algebra and combinatorics.  Recently, a model theory has been developed for structures arising in analysis, namely those for which a natural notion of distance exists.  This model theory could then prove useful for solving problems in areas where classical model theory has yet to be able to help.  That being said, model theory, in the form of nonstandard analysis, has found applications in analysis by providing a rigorous notion of infinitesimal and infinite numbers.  Nonstandard analysis has found applications in such diverse areas as number theory, probability theory, and economics.  This project proposes to use nonstandard analysis to answer questions in Lie theory, which is a very important mathematical area used in physics and engineering."

The PI is engaged is studying various aspect of these tools, both applying the resulting structure theory of Polish groups to problems in functional analysis, as witnessed in his recent collaboration with V. Ferenczi on the existence of optimal norms on Banach spaces, and calibrating properties of countable first-order structures M with topological properties of their automorphism group Aut(M). In addition, the PI is studying the block Ramsey theory originating in the work of W.T. Gowers, which has led to significant results in the geometric theory of Banach spaces, in particular, a classification program for separable Banach spaces based on infinite-dimensional Ramsey theory. As has become clearer recently, the underlying Ramsey theoretical results are best understood in terms of infinite games of perfect information with very strong winning strategies and to which usual determinacy does not immediately apply. <br/><br/><br/>The research described in the proposal is largely inter-disciplinary, connecting a variety of fields from mathematical logic to functional and harmonic analysis. The PI aims to further the continuous integration of descriptive set theory with other branches of mathematics and thus provide new venues for a field traditionally having benefited enormously from deep work in purer areas of set theory. In part through the PI's work, eventually, these results will hopefully trickle down to applications to rather tame problems in analysis, i.e., not a priori involving set theory or logic."

The driving idea is contained in the book ""Canonical Ramsey Theory on Polish Spaces"", coauthored by the PI, to appear in 2013. Given a Borel or analytic equivalence relation on a Polish space, is it possible to find a large subset of the space on which the equivalence is as simple as possible? Here, the largeness is to be interpreted in the sense of some sigma-ideal on the space, and the simplicity in the sense of the Borel reducibility rating of complexity of equivalence relations. This question, stated in terms similar to canonical Ramsey theory, uncovers a broad landscape indexed by sigma-ideals and equivalence relations, generalizing such results as the Proemel-Voigt theorem on canonization of smooth equivalence relations on Ramsey cubes, or Blass theorem on canonization of analytic graphs on perfect sets. The overarching general theme is a correspondence between Borel equivalence relations and models of set theory. The applications include nonreducibility results with the strongest possible statements and Silver type theorems for various sigma-ideals encountered in mathematical analysis. The project offers numerous other offshoots as well.<br/><br/>The project follows the general theme of classification of equivalence problems in mathematics. Most areas of mathematics start with a class of objects and a notion of similarity between them. It is often of paramount importance to that branch of mathematics to evaluate the complexity of that notion of similarity. It turns out that there is a natural rating of complexity of such similarity problems that ties together most branches of (infinitary) mathematics. In order to evaluate the complexity correctly within this rating, one needs, among other things, tools for showing that one such notion of similarity is not reducible to another. The project offers a novel way for doing that: certain notions of similarity greatly simplify when one is allowed to restrict attention to a smaller, but still significant, class of objects--while others do not. Results of this type may not have immediate practical applications, but they do help with the understanding of methodology of mathematics. As is typical for this field, they also tie the fabric of mathematics closer together, showing that concerns of one field may reduce to questions solved by another field."

More specifically, the proposed research will develop the emerging field of Computable Stability Theory, where the methods of stability theory plays a key role is the study of effective properties of first order theories. Stability theory is the part of model theory which focuses on the underlying geometrical or structural nature of the mathematical objects. Generally speaking, the more underlying structure the mathematical object respects, the easier it is to compute information about the object. This forms a back-and-forth relationship between stability and computability, and this interplay is the focus of Computable Stability Theory. Questions arising from Computable Stability Theory lead to new questions in classical model theory as well as computability, which sheds light on both subjects. Among these questions is when quantifier elimination to some level can be derived from geometrical properties.<br/><br/>Computable Stability Theory endeavors to explore the basic statement that ""structurally simple objects ought to be easier to compute."" Model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, offers tools to analyze structural simplicity by studying objects in the context of their first order language. The understanding of the language associated to an object or class of objects can often be translated to a deeper understanding of the objects themselves. Computability theory studies questions of computation and relative computation with regard to mathematical objects. By combining tools from both fields, Andrews will examine the question of when structural simplicity does and when it does not translate into computational simplicity."

Three areas  will receive special emphasis: triangulations of compact manifolds (with and without boundary) and closely related spaces,  finite linear quotients of spheres, and matroids.     Compact manifolds are one of the cornerstones of modern mathematics and physics.   In the last century a tremendous amount of research has been directed toward unlocking their topology and geometry.  However, questions of a combinatorial character have remained largely unanswered. What is the minimum number of  facets  required to triangulate a given manifold? How do various  topological invariants  determine how complicated it is to represent the manifold on a computer?  What methods are there to construct manifolds with particular combinatorial properties?   Conversely, given limits on the combinatorics of a triangulation, what does that imply about the possible geometries on the manifold?   Similar questions, where even less is known, apply to spaces with singularities which include algebraic varieties, quotients of group actions, or limits of Riemannian manifolds.  Finite linear quotients of spheres lie at the intersection of representation theory, topology, geometry and combinatorics.   How are the topology and geometry of the quotient space related to the combinatorics and algebra of the representation theoretic data?  Matroids are a combinatorial abstraction of linear independence with a variety of applications including hyperplane arrangements, linear optimization, reliability, order restricted statistical inference, and the aforementioned linear quotients of spheres. The project will concentrate on enumerative properties of matroids.  The questions above are representative of the research that will be conducted by the PI during the project.<br/><br/> How does one study complicated spaces and structures? One approach is to approximate them with simpler objects. For instance, an n-dimensional object might be represented as a collection of n-simplices - the higher dimensional analogues of triangles and tetrahedrons. How complicated are these representations? How many of the smaller pieces are needed? How is this reflected in the shape and geometry of the original object? Are there computationally practical ways of producing these models? These are types of questions addressed in this research."

These techniques, developed over the last several years, involve new types of marker structures on the equivalence relations. For example, these new structures have led to a proof that all orbit equivalence relations of countable abelian group actions are hyperfinite. An important goal is to extend the results to larger classes of groups, and to delineate the extent of hyperfiniteness. A second new method concerns marker structures on arbitrary countable groups, also referred to as ``blueprints"". The bluprints, for example, give a proof that the Bernoulli shift action of every countable group has a free subflow. They have also been used to give other results for general actions, such as results on the complexity of the topological conjugacy relation. Another goal of this project is to explore the connections between the possible blueprints that can exist on groups and the marker structures on the equivalence relations induced by actions of these groups. It is expected that progress along these lines will improve our understanding both of actions by special types of groups, and of the nature of Borel actions for general countable groups.<br/><br/><br/>Countable Borel equivalence relations are fundamental mathematical objects which occur in many mathematical contexts. Aside from their intrinsic interest, their theory interacts with other important areas of mathematics such as dynamics, ergodic theory, and geometric group theory. Thus, work in this area involves techniques from logic as well as dynamics, combinatorics, and other areas. Consider an equivalence relation studied by the ancient Greeks, that of commensurability: two positive real numbers are equivalent if their ratio is rational. A very basic question about this simple relation was not known until recently, namely whether it can be described in an effective way as an increasing union of finite relations. Several natural generalizations of this question are still open. This project seeks to further develop some of the new techniques to further the study of these fundamental questions. It is expected that this study will also make new connections with other areas of mathematics."

The workshop will be held immediately prior to a conference in logic and dynamics to be held at UNT June 4-8, 2012. The workshop will bring together the leading experts in an active and central area of mathematical logic, inner model theory, as well as experts in associated areas of descriptive set theory. The workshop atmosphere should be conducive to an exchange of ideas among the attendees as well as the dissemination of research results and ideas the experts have been working on. By holding the conference in proximity to the logic/dynamics conference, we feel it also has the possibility of attracting an expanded set of participants. Support for the workshop will allow us to support graduate student travel to the workshop and thereby enhance the impact. We will make publicly available the slides and lecture notes from the workshop to further the information exchange. Having the workshop at UNT will enhance the RTG program at UNT and allow the RTG post-docs and graduate students to interact with leaders in related, but different fields of logic. As with the logic/dynamics conference, we will, where possible, seek to increase the presence of women and underrepresented groups."

Broadly speaking, the major research proposed by the PI is directed at analyzing complexity and relative complexity. One area of study concerns functions on the natural numbers and then more broadly general mathematical structures. The primary measuring rod for this investigation is Turing's notion of relative computability which captures our usual intuitions and corresponds to computations by idealized versions of standard computing machines and program languages. The other major thrust of the proposed research is directed at an analysis of the complexity of mathematical theorems and constructions. Here, one compares the complexity of the inputs/hypotheses to that of the outputs/conclusions of the constructions/theorems. Strength is measured both computationally and in terms of the axioms needed to prove the theorem or correctness of the construction. The co-PI has proposed directing research in areas of logic with applications to computer science including the study of very simple machine models as well as logical languages useful for verifying that computer programs do what they are designed to do and not other (perhaps dangerous) things. He is also involved in developing and patenting methods for quantum control of ordinary (macro)processes. While this work has been influenced by his previously supported theoretical work, it now lies outside the scope of this proposal.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the PI's proposals deal with analyzing the structure of the Turing degrees (of relative complexity of computation) and of particularly important substructures. The emphasis here is on questions of definability and nondefinability as well as (bi)interpretations of arithmetic in the relevant structures. Particular emphasis will be placed on relations to external notions such as rates of growth for functions and the complexity of the definitions in arithmetic or other languages of the functions or structures. His other major focus is on reverse mathematics. In particular, the analysis of theorems that, in terms of their proof theoretic and computational strength, lie outside the scope of the standard systems studied. Thus it demonstrates that there are many truly distinct types of construction principles occupying different levels of complexity with involved relations among them. Problems to be studied come from the realms of combinatorics, algebra, model theory and determinacy. The co-PI's proposals primarily deal with automata theory, particularly as related to control theory, and modal logics used to capture notions of awareness and belief."

Fifty years ago Paul Cohen developed the method of forcing to solve Hilbert's first problem: the truth of the Continuum Hypothesis.  Today this method is more relevant than ever.  While it was originally developed as a meta-mathematical tool, it has been also used to solve problems arising in combinatorics, functional analysis, and topology.  As the method matured and became even more powerful, its scope and reach has been significantly broadened. New directions in forcing are ever more influenced by fundamental questions in a broadening range of fields.  Stunning breakthroughs in these related fields are being propelled by the equally exciting advances in the forcing method.  Still, the method has largely remained a tool used internally by set theory.  The program aims to further develop the method and its applicability analysis, combinatorics, operator theory, set theory, and topology.<br/><br/>The Fields Institute is one of the premier mathematical institutes in the world.  Each semester it sponsors a thematic program in a focused sub-discipline of mathematics, bringing senior leaders in the field together with graduate students and junior researchers, all under one roof.  In fall 2012, the focus of the thematic program is Cohen's method of forcing.  The semester will feature three focused workshops and two semester long graduate courses, all attracting an international audience.  One of the primary goals of the program is to make this important technique accessible to a broader cross section of the mathematical community."

Many theorems in Ramsey theory can be proven using infinitary methods, in the form of ultraproducts, nonstandard analysis, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory.  Proof mining extracts finite information from these infinite arguments.  The proposed research will apply the methods of proof mining in order to investigate: 1) explicit bounds on numerical quantities which are not made apparent by infinite proofs, 2) approximations of infinitary Ramsey theoretic statements which ""quantify"" (typically, with a countable ordinal) how transfinite a given construction is, and 3) new finitary analogs of infinitary methods.  Where necessary, the proposed research will also expand the repertoire of proof mining tools by investigating how to interpret higher order notions, particularly the topological structure of the ultrafilters, in finitary terms.<br/><br/>Questions in mathematics about concrete, finite properties of the integers often turn out to have answers that make use of abstract, infinite notions.  The goal of the area of proof theory known as ""proof mining"" is to develop tools for explaining this phenomenon.  Often, we discover that there are finite methods which can replace the infinite ones, at the price of making the argument much more difficult to understand.  Some of these arguments are so unwieldy that it is difficult to imagine that they could be discovered directly.  By ""unwinding"" the infinite argument into finite arguments, however, we often discover new information.  For example, infinite proofs often prove that a number with some property exists while providing no information about which number it is; the corresponding finite argument, however, typically gives an upper bound on the size of that number."

One topic is the so-called universally measurable sets, where the fundamental open question is whether all such sets can have the property of Baire. One topic concerns the fragment of the Axiom of Choice which holds when a model of determinacy is expanded by adding a Ramsey ultrafilter. Another concerns lifting to the third uncountable cardinal Woodin's results on getting forcing axioms at the second uncountable cardinal by forcing over a determinacy model. The fourth concerns application of techniques from set theory to Shelah's study of Abstract Elementary Classes. Finally, Larson proposes to study ideals on the first uncountable cardinal from the point of view of certain inner models satisfying a small fragment of Choice. <br/><br/>The standard axioms for set theory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, serve as the commonly accepted foundations for mathematics, though as mathematics becomes more abstract, more and more issues arise which are not resolved by these axioms. Many of these issues are studied by set theorists, in hope of finding the right extension of these axioms. Developments in the study of such possible extensions have had a dramatic foundational impact in the last thirty years, affecting many areas of mathematics, and even philosophy.  The PI works on the border between some of the more technical, inward-directed areas of set theory and more classical areas with connections to other fields. Much of his work consists of finding applications of these more technical areas, and exposing them to a wider audience."

In particular, given a one-parametric monotone (increasing) definable family of subsets of a definable compact K, the goal is to construct a definable triangulation of K such that, inside each simplex of the triangulation, the family is equivalent to one of the ""standard"" families, classified by lex-monotone Boolean functions. Other classical geometric constructions that can be extended to definable families include cylindrical cell decomposition and Whitney stratification. Existence of such geometric constructions would allow one to investigate the ""fine structure"" of a definable family, and to compute its topological invariants, such as vanishing homology, intersection homology and the homotopy type of its Hausdorff limit. A monotone one-parametric definable family can be alternatively viewed as the family of sub-level sets of a definable function, so the proposed research can be viewed as a topological resolution of singularities of definable functions. The original motivation for the proposed research comes from the theory of approximation of definable sets by homotopy equivalent definable families of compact sets developed by Gabrielov and Vorobjov. Triangulation of a definable family would provide a crucial tool for the proof of the main conjecture of that theory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The proposed research would substantially enhance our understanding of geometry, topology and combinatorics of the sets definable in an o-minimal structure, and of the families of such sets. It suggests a new approach to the resolution of singularities of definable functions. The expected results would be new even for real semi-algebraic sets, the most basic (and the most important in applications) of all o-minimal structures. The proposed research will have impact in several different areas of pure and applied mathematics. Firstly, it will introduce fundamental new tools in the areas of real algebraic and o-minimal geometry, which will have direct impact in the the study of geometric and topological properties of definable sets in arbitrary o-minimal structure, including topological resolution of singularities in this context. It will also potentially have impact in certain areas of currently active interest in algebraic geometry and topological combinatorics. Finally, it is very likely the theory of semi-monotone sets and monotone maps will find applications in the extremely active areas of discrete and computational geometry (around the theory of persistent homology), as well as in control theory and dynamical systems.  One such application  to ""toric cubes"" emerged recently. These semi-algebraic sets which are related to edge-product sets in phylogenetics  are closures of graphs of monotone maps, thus they are topologically closed balls. At a higher level, the proposed research will bring ideas and techniques developed originally in the context of o-minimal geometry, to currently important problems in several other areas - in particular, algebraic geometry, discrete and computational geometry and control theory."

The current line of research has its origins in Hilbert's Tenth Problem and its solution by Davis, Putnam, Robinson and Matiyasevich. When Yurii Matiyasevich showed that over rational integers, Diophantine sets were the same as computably enumerable sets, he showed that objects originating in two different branches of Mathematics were the same. This result initiated a search for common roots of algebra and logic, a search centered on the two most important objects: integers and rational numbers. While the methods employed in the search are for the most part algebraic or geometric, the questions asked originate in Model Theory or Computability Theory. Mazur's conjectures, their extensions and their consequences for existence of Diophantine definitions and Diophantine models are a fine example of a question in Computability Theory/ Model Theory generating a question in Algebraic Geometry which in turn produces a consequence in Computability Theory/Model Theory. Another example of interaction between the fields spurred by this line of research are the recent results by Mazur and Rubin concerning ranks of elliptic curves over number fields which were produced to answer some questions of Diophantine definability. In this proposal the author plans to continue her investigation of definability and decidability over algebraic extensions of rational numbers and rational function fields of all characteristics. In particular, we plan to explore first-order definability over infinite algebraic extensions of global fields and existential undefinability of a large class of function fields of positive characteristic. <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>This proposal investigates questions of the following sort: given a polynomial equation in several variables, is there an algorithm (or a computer program) that can tell us if this equation has solutions in a particular set. These kinds of questions go back to a German Mathematician David Hilbert who asked at the beginning of the XX century whether we could algorithmically decide when a polynomial equation in several variables with integer coefficients has integer solutions. It turned out that such an algorithm does not exist and the solution by Davis, Putnam, Robinson and Matiyasevich took quite a few years. Unfortunately, we still don't know whether there is an algorithm to determine existence of solutions in rational numbers (fractions) as opposed to integers. That problem turned out to be even harder than the original one. As it is often the case with difficult problems, in order to solve it or even just to understand better the difficulties, an area of Mathematics has been created. This area considers polynomials as a part of a special Mathematical language (used by many areas of Mathematics and many sciences) and tries to determine what one can say in this language and whether one can decide algorithmically whether a sentence in this language is true. The current project considers these questions in various settings such as ``big rings'' (subsets of all rational numbers (fractions)) and function fields (objects formed by considering ratios of polynomials)."

The first topic is a global theory of finite-dimensional representations of a semisimple Lie algebra. The classification of such representations is classical, but only offers a local theory, giving criteria for when two finite-dimensional representations are isomorphic. By considering the theory of finite-dimensional representations, the project seeks to study the representations called pseudo-finite dimensional representations, because they satisfy in the formal language all the theorems of finite-dimensional representations. These nonstandard representations will be used to study varieties of finite-dimensional representations, and thus lead to a global theory of finite-dimensional representations. The second activity of the project is to study the precise nature of the relationship between the Model Theory of Modules over a ring and the K-theory} of that ring. One hopes to establish a precise relationship between these two areas in terms of a theory of homology introduced to study formulae in the formal language of representations. Finally, a theory for complete exact categories is to be developed not by using the techniques of model theory directly, but rather by mimicking in a categorical setting the intuition used in the model theory of modules to study purity.<br/> <br/>The project will be devoted to a close examination of the relationship between activities carried on by algebraists most interested in applications to geometry and physics, but using the formal methodology of mathematical logic. These activities will use the language to study the symmetries that arise in algebra, and conversely, apply these symmetries to formal language. In other activities of the project, the PI will continue to act as consultant to professional development programs offered to elementary and middle school mathematics teachers in Northwest Central Ohio."
