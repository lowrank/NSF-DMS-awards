It has two parts:                    (1)Disprove the conjecture by finding a potential counter-example               (a bad group) in SO3(R); (2)Prove the conjecture for good groups                (i.e., for simple groups with involutions).  This is too ambitious,             and the main emphasis will be on BN-pairs of ranks 1 and 2.  The                investigator expects to be able to extend methods of finite group               theory and come up with new methods (as was done in joint work with             Borovik and DeBonis).                                                                Groups are basic structures of algebra, the mathematical                   embodiment of symmetry.  Model theory is one of the main branches               of the foundations of mathematics.  The investigator will bring                 methods from model theory to bear upon an outstanding conjecture in             group theory.  The conjecture is interesting in itself but also as              a test case to see how far methods of this type will avail."

Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations for             all of mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do this                being Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, dating from                the early days of the 20th Century.  Important foundational                     questions concern the independence and the consistency of the                   axioms used to establish set theory.  Zermelo and Fraenkel's axioms             (ZF for short) are one of the most convenient sets of basic axioms.             However, it has been known since the work of Kurt Goedel in the                 1930's that no axioms for set theory can be complete as well as                 consistent.  This means that no set of axioms can be powerful                   enough to prove every possible proposition or else its negation,                but not both.  Upon this startling theorem has been erected a rich              theory, treating possible propositions P such that either P or Not              P can be added to ZF without resulting in a contradiction.  Any                 such proposition P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken             as an additional axiom of set theory.  The principal technique for              finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-called              method of forcing and its offspring.  This is the circle of ideas               involved in and motivating a large part of the investigator's                   research."

(1) Is the generic triangle-free graph pseudofinite.               (2) Is there a zero-one law for large finite labelled directed                  graphs containing no transitive tournament of order 3.  (3) What is             the minimal complexity of a language, admitting quantifier                      elimination, for the structures given by the action of the wreath               product Sym(n)*Sym(d) in its action on d-tuples of k-sets?  (4)                 What is the classification of infinite primitive homogeneous                    structures for a language with three symmetric 2-types, under the               hypothesis that a negative constraint is imposed on a substructure              of order three.  The co-investigator, Thomas, will continue related             work on reducts and expansions of omega-categorical structures.

The subarea of model theory within mathematical logic concerns             itself with axiomatic systems, particularly questions about                     theories founded on systems of axioms, which can be answered purely             from considering the forms of the axioms without real regard for                their content.  It is surprising how much can sometimes be learned              in this way, for it often seems to be getting something for                     nothing.  Model theorists have developed a rich subject and have                been able to shed light even on such well-studied topics in algebra             as the theory of groups and the theory of fields."

Thus questions about decidability              of fragments of elementary theories of degree structures are                    pursued, in order to determine which degrees are definable, and how             complicated the definitions must be.

The logical systems to              be studied include fragments of arithmetic, especially bounded                  arithmetic, and pure first-order logic and propositional logic.                 The low-level complexity classes to be studied include alternating              log time and the polynomial time hierarchy.  He is particularly                 concerned with developing new and fruitful connections between                  computational complexity and the proof theory of formal systems.                Past research has already established intimate connections between              these areas.  This project concerns primarily (1) formal theories               with proof-theoretic strength closely related to various                        computational complexity classes and (2) the structure of first-                order and propositional proofs, especially, the lengths of proofs.                   Proof theory is concerned with such properties of proofs as                their length, correctness being understood and taken for granted.               Thus a typical result might assert that the proposition P is a                  deeper result than the proposition Q in the sense that any proof of             P (in a specific formal system) is longer than some known proof of              Q (in the same system).  A slightly more complicated type of result             considers a sequence of propositions  P1, P2, P3, ..., Pn, ..., all             provable both in the formal system F and in the formal system G.                If, for example, the lengths of the best proofs of these                        propositions in F grow in length as the square of n, while their                best proofs in G grow exponentially in n, then it would seem that               F is a more powerful system than G.  Buss has found ways to relate              questions of this nature to complexity classes of arithmetic                    functions that have already been studied by computer scientists."

Convergence, i.e.             termination of this method produces finitistic proofs of                        combinatorial identities and numerical realizations of provable                 Sigma-zero-one-formulas.  The problem of convergence was treated by             von Neumann (1927) for quantifier-free induction and by Ackermann               (1940) for the system of first-order arithmetic.  The problem for               analysis remained open until very recently, when it was settled by              Mints (1990).  Mints now intends to investigate convergence                     problems for other systems where the problem is still open,                     including the following:  1) predicative analysis and predicatively             reducible systems, 2) stronger subsystems of analysis whose proof-              theoretic ordinal is known, 3) the theory of types, 4) full                     analysis with the axiom of choice, 5) Zermelo set theory and                    possibly stronger systems.                                                           Proof theory examines questions about proofs that lie to one               side of their correctness.  Correctness is understood and taken for             granted.  For example, what axioms are required, all the axioms of              a system or only a proper subset?  Indeed, certain axioms are                   particularly critical in such studies, the necessity of employing               the so-called Axiom of Choice, involving orders of infinity greater             than that of the set of all the positive integers, 1, 2, 3, ...,                being considered particularly interesting.  Other strong axioms of              infinity often play this role too.  In another direction, one can               ask of a proof that shows that something or other exists whether it             provides an explicit recipe for constructing the thing shown to                 exist.  Proofs which do are called ""constructive,"" and others,                  ""non-constructive.""  A particularly intriguing part of proof theory             concerns itself with whether a non-constructive proof can be                    reworked in some automatic way into a constructive one.  It turns               out that the answer depends on the theory being studied.  The                   investigator has shown that a method known as the Hilbert                       substitution method can be used to turn any non-constructive proof              in a certain formulation of analysis into a constructive one by                 essentially turning a crank, and he would like to know if the                   argument he gave can be adapted to obtain the analogous result for              certain other mathematical systems."

Although answers             to such questions have the ability to illuminate practical                      questions, they are really practical only when their answers are                negative, for it is a very strong statement indeed to say that                  something cannot be computed even when one puts no limits on                    resources available for the purpose.  The finer structure of                    computability theory is sometimes more relevant to actual                       computations, and various aspects of that will also be considered."

He will also investigate newly discovered connections                   between logic and set theory on the one hand and topological                    dynamics and ergodic theory on the other.                                            A famous paradox of measure theory, the Banach-Tarski paradox,             shows that ordinary intuition about volumes of sets in three-                   dimensional space is unreliable.  In particular, if the sets are                allowed to be sufficiently bizarre, certainly not anything that can             be drawn or easily imagined, then a solid ball in 3-space can be                dissected into a finite number of sets, and these sets can be                   rearranged and reassembled to form two solid balls, each congruent              to the original one.  An old question that had resisted numerous                attempts was whether the sets involved in such a paradoxical                    decomposition of the ball could have at least a minimal degree of               regularity known as the property of Baire.  Although not easy to                draw or imagine, non-measurable sets with the property of Baire do              arise in classical analysis and so are not considered so remote                 from reality as to be easy to ignore altogether.  The investigator              and a co-worker have defied widely held suspicions that such                    decompositions are impossible, developed some technical machinery               for treating this and related questions, and shown that such                    decompositions do indeed exist.  Other topics in pure set theory                and its applications will be considered."

In             addition, he will study the computational complexity of logical                 decision problems, including the theory of the real exponential                 field.  Carl Jockusch will work in classical recursion theory and               its connections with other areas.

L. van den Dries will investigate definability in             algebraic and analytic structures.

Large parts of the instant project bear                this out.  A typical result of the investigators' recent work is                the proof of a completeness conjecture raised by Tarski:  Is there              a finite list of true identities combining polynomial formation and             exponentiation of constants from which all other such true                      identities can be derived?  (Counterexamples are known to exist if              exponentiation of variables is allowed.)  Another area in which a               natural role for logic can be found is the complexity of                        algorithms.

The investigator will                   continue to work on the analysis of priority arguments in the                   theory of recursively enumerable degrees and on the proof-theoretic             strength of these arguments.  Groszek and Theodore A. Slaman (Univ.             of Chicago) have been developing a uniform presentation for all                 levels of priority argument and tying these arguments to a standard             proof-theoretic hierarchy of fragments of Peano arithmetic.  In                 addition to continuing this development, Groszek will investigate               specific statements about the partial order of recursively                      enumerable Turing degrees, considering whether and how their proof-             theoretic strength reflects this analysis.

However, it has been known                    since the work of Kurt Goedel in the 1930's that no axioms for                  set theory can be complete as well as consistent.  This means                   that no set of axioms can be powerful enough to prove every                     possible proposition or else its negation, but not both.  Upon                  this startling theorem has been erected a rich theory, treating                 possible propositions P such that either P or Not P can be added                to ZF without resulting in a contradiction.  Any such proposition               P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken as an                        additional axiom of set theory.  The principal technique for                    finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-                    called method of forcing and its offspring.

All three topics are related to analysis and topology. The third topic is also related to other parts of mathematical logic, such as Vaught's Conjecture and the theory of definable cardinality. Some of the problems in the project will be considered under the assumption of strong set theoretic axioms such as the axiom of determinacy. Considering that the real numbers can be thought of as the ordinary number line of grade school arithmetic, it is surprising how much structure can be imposed upon them and how intricate the questions that can be asked about this structure. Descriptive set theory is the theory that addresses these questions with all the machinery of modern mathematical logic. For example, a standard construct of this theory is the Borel hierarchy of sets, consisting of two infinite sequences of families of sets, the Pi sets and the Sigma sets, defined inductively, and hence of increasing complexity. One of the obvious applications of the theory is to locate precisely in this hierarchy a particular set which arises in analysis, say the set of points at which a function is differentiable. In fact, it is a typical and classical theorem of descriptive set theory (due to Mazurkiewicz) that any such set of differentiability belongs to the family Pi-one-one in the Borel hierarchy. The investigator is focussed on questions such as these, which make logic relevant to the wider world of mathematics."

The subarea of model theory within mathematical logic concerns itself with axiomatic systems, particularly questions about theories founded on systems of axioms, which can be answered purely from considering the forms of the axioms without real regard for their content. It is surprising how much can sometimes be learned in this way, for it often seems to be getting something for nothing. Model theorists have developed a rich subject and have been able to shed light even on such well-studied topics in algebra as the theory of groups and the theory of fields."
