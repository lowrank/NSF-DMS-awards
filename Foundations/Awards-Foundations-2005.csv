It<br/>consists of four parts that are connected through methods of<br/>research. The first part is devoted to the analysis of the internal<br/>structure and combinatorial properties of extender models, an area<br/>of research launched by Jensen in the late 60's; the emphasis here<br/>is on extending the methods recently developed by Schimmerling and<br/>Zeman, and creating a ""catalogue"" of such methods with broad<br/>applicability. The second area focuses on optimal forcing<br/>constructions in infinite combinatorics. A typical question in<br/>this category is obtaining the exact consistency strength for<br/>the failure of Jensen's principle ""square"" at a singular cardinal.<br/>Although the emphasis here is on developing new forcing methods,<br/>inner model theory (even at its current state of development)<br/>provides large cardinal axioms that are likely candidates for the<br/>consistency strengths in question. The third area comprises<br/>applications of inner models in establishing lower bounds for<br/>consistency strengths at large cardinal levels below one Woodin<br/>cardinal, as well as applications in descriptive set theory<br/>related to correctness of canonical inner models and inner model<br/>theoretic characterizations of descriptive set theoretic objects.<br/>The last area focuses on the theory of inner models; the main<br/>objective here is to make a progress on extender models matching<br/>higher levels of the large cardinal hierarchy, as well as<br/>exploring possibilities for constructions of the core model below<br/>one Woodin cardinal with no background large cardinal assumption<br/>on the set-theoretic universe.<br/><br/>Set theory can be viewed as a mathematical theory that formalizes the<br/>methods currently accepted as valid working methods in mathematics.<br/>It is based on the so-called Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms that describe<br/>basic mathematical constructions. The developments in mathematics<br/>in the twentieth century brought the entire subject to a new stage:<br/>It turns out that there are more and more natural questions answers<br/>of which are sensitive to the background axioms, that is to the axioms<br/>of set theory. Such questions arise even in classical disciplines like<br/>algebra or analysis. They cannot be decided from Zermelo-Fraenkel<br/>axioms alone. In order to decide such questions, it is necessary<br/>to augment the axiomatic system by additional axioms; such axioms<br/>are usually formulated in the language of infinitary combinatorics.<br/>This has to be done in a manner that will not introduce an<br/>inconsistency of the augmented axiomatic system. In some cases,<br/>the consistency of the augmented system (relative to the<br/>Zermelo-Fraenkel system) can be proved using methods formalizable<br/>in the Zermelo-Fraenkel system itself. However, there is an entire<br/>hierarchy of axioms, the so-called large cardinal axioms, which do not<br/>allow this. It is believed that every mathematical statement that is not<br/>decidable from the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms alone -- or at least the<br/>consistency of such a statement -- can be decided using the right large<br/>cardinal axiom. The mathematical praxis provides a lot of support for<br/>this belief. Thus, the large cardinal hierarchy constitutes a kind of<br/>a ""scale"" that ""measures"" the complexity of mathematical statements, and<br/>each such statement has an exact match on this scale. The large<br/>cardinal axiom, that together with Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms provides<br/>the very piece of information necessary and sufficient to decide the<br/>(consistency of) the statement, is called the consistency<br/>strength of the statement. Expressed informally: By determining the<br/>consistency strengths, set theory is able to isolate the precise amount<br/>of information that that has to be used along with the standard<br/>mathematical methods in order to decide certain mathematical questions.<br/>Inner model theory, forcing, descriptive set theory, and infinitary<br/>combinatorics constitute crucial tools for this task.<br/><br/>"

The project aims to<br/>better understand how algebraic properties of structures interact with<br/>the algorithmic ones.  Topics of investigation include: complexity of<br/>structures and their isomorphic copies, complexity of additional<br/>relations on their domains, complexity and structure of partial and<br/>total isomorphisms, and the correspondence between computability and<br/>definability.  The complexity is often expressed by computable<br/>infinitary formulae, and measured by Turing degrees or by other<br/>computability theoretic degrees.  Since these degrees are not invariant<br/>under isomorphisms, we investigate their spectrum, which consists of all<br/>degrees in the isomorphism type of a structure.  An important goal is to<br/>relate the degree spectra of relations to the degree spectra of<br/>structures by studying the so-called spectrally universal structures. <br/>The project involves investigations in general model theoretic setting,<br/>such as algorithmic versions of categoricity, but also more concrete<br/>well-known classes of algebraic structures, such as commutative groups,<br/>non-commutative groups, rings, fields, vector spaces.  Another goal of<br/>the project is to integrate computable algebra with algorithmic learning<br/>theory in Putnam-Gold's framework of inductive inference machines, which<br/>has so far been developed mainly for computably enumerable sets.  This<br/>study is also important in the philosophy of inductive reasoning. <br/><br/>In the 1930's, Turing, Goedel, Kleene and others developed the<br/>mathematical theory of computability.  Their results paved the way for<br/>the invention of modern computers.  Model theory, which emerged as a<br/>distinct field in the 1940's through the works of Skolem, Goedel,<br/>Tarski, Malcev and others, provides a rigorous framework for the notions<br/>of language, meaning and truth.  A model, a concept used in all of<br/>sciences, describes a portion of reality by using a formal language to<br/>express properties under study.  Interaction of computability theory<br/>with model theory, as well as other areas of mathematics, has resulted<br/>in computable model theory and, more generally, in computable<br/>mathematics.  Goedel's incompleteness theorem is a striking early result<br/>in computable model theory.  While some mathematical constructions are<br/>algorithmic, or can be replaced by algorithmic ones yielding the same<br/>results, others are intrinsically non-algorithmic.  Problems that can be<br/>solved algorithmically are called decidable.  Examples of negative<br/>results in computable mathematics include the undecidability of the<br/>Hilbert's tenth problem, and the undecidability of the word problem in<br/>combinatorial group theory.  Undecidable problems can be more precisely<br/>classified by considering generalized algorithms, which require external<br/>knowledge.  Turing degrees, which play a significant role in this<br/>project, provide an important measure of the level of such knowledge<br/>needed.  An important goal of the project is to use Turing degrees to<br/>investigate structures of importance in other areas of mathematics.<br/>"

This work is motivated by basic foundational questions, like <br/>understanding the nature of complete classification of mathematical objects, <br/>up to some notion of equivalence, by invariants, and creating a mathematical <br/>framework for measuring the complexity of such classification problems. This <br/>theory is developed within the context of descriptive set theory, which <br/>provides the basic underlying concepts and methods. On the other hand, in <br/>view of its broad scope, it has natural interactions with many other areas <br/>of mathematics, such as model theory, recursion theory, the theory of <br/>topological groups and their representations, topological dynamics, ergodic <br/>theory, operator algebras, and combinatorics. Within this general program it <br/>is  proposed to study: (i) problems arising in the theory of countable Borel <br/>equivalence relations, particularly concerning hyperfiniteness and <br/>treeability, including descriptive aspects of free actions of free groups; <br/>(ii) newly developed connections between the topological dynamics of <br/>automorphism groups of countable structures and finite Ramsey theory as well <br/>as a related semigroup framework for such connections with infinite Ramsey <br/>theory; (iii) the concepts of genericity and ample genericity in Polish <br/>groups and their relation to other structural properties of groups such as <br/>the small index property, uncountable cofinality, the Bergman finite <br/>generation property, fixed point properties for actions on trees and <br/>automatic continuity; (iv) complexity of classification problems concerning <br/>the isometric or topological classification of various kinds of metric, <br/>topological or Banach spaces.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A fundamental question that arises in many fields of mathematics is that of <br/>classifying a given collection of objects under study. This amounts to <br/>providing a ""catalog"" or ""listing"" of these objects, in principle not unlike <br/>that of cataloging species in biology or stars and galaxies in astronomy. If <br/>such a classification is possible, one has a ""complete"" understanding of the <br/>mathematical structures involved.  Otherwise a more or less ""chaotic"" <br/>behavior is expected. It is thus very important to understand under what <br/>circumstances a classification is possible. This difficult foundational <br/>question is further complicated by the fact that what constitutes an <br/>acceptable classification is very much dependent on the particular field of <br/>mathematics studied, so the criteria for a ""good"" classification in one area <br/>might not be appropriate in another.  At its basic level, this project aims <br/>to develop a general quantitative theory, which in many situations can <br/>precisely measure the complexity of a classification problem and thus <br/>provide objective means by which one can decide, in any given field, whether <br/>a satisfactory classification of the objects in question is possible. This <br/>is achieved by associating with each collection of objects to be classified <br/>an appropriate concept of ""magnitude"" or ""size"", which in a precise sense <br/>measures the difficulty of its classification problem. This new theory of <br/>""magnitude"" as well as problems in different directions that arise in the <br/>course of the development of this theory are investigated in this project.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

In algebra, the investigator works on algebraic<br/>systems such as quasigroups and loops.  Automated reasoning tools<br/>are very useful here.  These algebraic systems are described by<br/>fairly simple axioms, and a computer search can often reveal<br/>interesting new consequences of these axioms.  However, the<br/>investigator combines the computer use with classical arguments<br/>involving combinatorics and group theory.<br/><br/>The investigator's research studies a number of topics in pure<br/>mathematics which arose naturally in an attempt to generalize<br/>properties of the physical universe.  For example, topology arises<br/>naturally in an attempt to generalize the geometry of physical space.<br/>Measure theory is a natural extension of the notion of probability.<br/>The research also studies algebraic properties of loops, which naturally<br/>generalize the concept of groups, which arise in the study of symmetry.<br/>There is also a computational component to this research, especially<br/>involving loops.  Frequently in this area, one wants to know<br/>whether one equation implies another.  A proof of such an implication<br/>involves symbolic manipulation which can be performed by a computer program.<br/>In recent years, the hardware and software have become powerful enough<br/>to discover new implications and to solve problems which had been<br/>intractable without computer assistance.  The investigator's<br/>research here is of interest both for the mathematics itself,<br/>and for the advancement of the computer tools used.<br/>"

On the theoretical side the PI proposes to study the structures of Polish groups and the dynamics of their actions. The scope of the groups ranges from countable nilpotent groups to the full unitary group. On the application side the PI proposes to study the major open problems concerning classification of mathematical structures arising in analysis, topology and geometry. The main focus, though, will be classification problems that are comparable to the orbit equivalence relations induced by actions of the unitary group. One example of such a problem is the classification of bounded linear operators on a separable complex Hilbert space.<br/><br/>Many important open problems in various fields of mathematics ask for satisfactory classification of mathematical objects studied in the fields. These classification problems can often be formalized as definable equivalence relations, sometimes even orbit equivalence relations induced by Polish group actions. A striking theory of definable equivalence relations has been developed in the past 15 years or so and complete understanding of the complexity of many classification problems has thus been obtained. This project seeks further development of the descriptive set theory of definable equivalence relations. It is anticipated that mathematics of different fields be brought together in this foundational framework.

Previous work has shown that certain combinatorial<br/>characterization problems do not have first-order solutions. For example, in<br/>general there is no first-order definition of the set of subsets of omega-2<br/>that, in some omega-1 and omega-2 preserving outer model, have a closed<br/>unbounded subset. Other examples regarding subsets of other cardinals,<br/>branches through trees of certain sorts, and large homogeneous subsets for<br/>certain partitions are known. One line of work concerns settling some further<br/>cases. Another line of work concerns a more fundamental question. Can this<br/>phenomenon can be mitigated by working relative to some reasonable extension<br/>of ZFC, for example, one that is consistent with all large cardinal axioms.<br/>The logically most simple case of incompleteness of the third kind lies<br/>(necessarily) just beyond the scope of Woodin's celebrated generic<br/>absoluteness theorem: Assume CH. Consider Sigma-2-1 sentences of analysis<br/>with sets of reals as parameters. In general the set of such sentences that<br/>are satisfiable in some outer model having the same reals is not first-order<br/>definable. Does there exist an extension of ZFC that is consistent with all<br/>large cardinal axioms and relative to which this set is (lightface) Delta-2-2<br/>definable? Finally, the PI is interested in several questions regarding class<br/>forcing.<br/><br/>The proposed work centers on incompleteness of a ""third kind"" in set theory.<br/>Incompleteness in set theory is important because all mathematics can be<br/>formalized in set theory. Propositions that are neither provable nor<br/>refutable from the axioms of set theory cannot be settled<br/>mathematically, at least in our current understanding. Goedel's famous<br/>Incompleteness Theorems show that such propositions exist. Sentences<br/>demonstrating this first kind of incompleteness formalize metamathematical<br/>statements. For example, the formalization of ""ZFC is consistent"" is neither<br/>provable nor refutable from the axioms of set theory (ZFC), provided those<br/>axioms are, in fact, consistent. Even though ""ZFC is consistent"" is not<br/>provable from ZFC, there is an obvious reason to favor it over its<br/>negation---studying mathematics within ZFC presupposes that ZFC is consistent.<br/>Incompleteness results proved using Cohen's method of (set) forcing represent<br/>a second kind of incompleteness. Typically, given a ""standard"" model of ZFC,<br/>one constructs an outer model in which a given statement is true and one in<br/>which it is false. In the case of this<br/>second kind of incompleteness, there is often no reason to favor a statement<br/>or its negation. Deep work by Woodin, Steel, Martin, Foreman,<br/>and a number of others has suggested reasons to favor certain statements up<br/>through a certain level of logical complexity. Just beyond this level of<br/>logical complexity lies incompleteness of a third kind. Here it is not<br/>possible even to say which statements are satisfiable in some outer model.<br/>""Characterization problems"" are the combinatorial form of this phenomenon.<br/>Past work of the PI has highlighted that, in general, it is not<br/>possible to characterize in set theory the ""satiable objects"" of certain<br/>sorts. Precise statements are technical, but an analogy gives the general<br/>idea. In this analogy, the ""objects"" correspond to equations. An object is<br/>""sated"" if the corresponding equation is solvable. An object is ""satiable"" if<br/>the corresponding equation is potentially solvable, that is, either solvable<br/>or solvable in some larger number system. In elementary mathematics, there is<br/>no reason to distinguish solvable and potentially solvable equations because<br/>typically there exist maximal number systems in which every potentially<br/>solvable equation of a particular sort is actually solvable. Such ""maximal<br/>standard models"" do not exist in set theory. The analog of an<br/>anticharacterization result in set theory would be a type of equation for<br/>which there cannot be a good criterion for potential solvability.<br/>Anticharacterization is troubling for two reasons. First, in mathematics one<br/>expects that anything that is true is true for a good reason---so there ought<br/>to be a criterion for insatiability. Secondly, in their strongest form, these<br/>anticharacterization results hold only if the universe fails to be<br/>""sufficiently non-minimal"". To some extent this threatens the well established<br/>thesis that all of mathematics is formalizable in first-order set theory,<br/>because non-minimality cannot be expressed in this language. The PI<br/>seeks to explore three aspects of anticharacterization. First, he seeks to<br/>determine whether some specific cases of characterization problems are<br/>solvable. Secondly, he seeks to discover whether adding auxiliary axioms to<br/>the usual axioms of set theory might allow satiable objects to be<br/>characterized. This could be construed as evidence in favor of these axioms.<br/>Finally, he seeks to continue work on abstract class forcing with an eye<br/>towards understanding general outer models, at least in the presence of<br/>conditions that render models highly non-minimal."
