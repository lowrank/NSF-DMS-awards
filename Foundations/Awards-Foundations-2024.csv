"2348901","Structure and regularity in continuous model theory","DMS","FOUNDATIONS","07/15/2024","07/15/2024","Gabriel Conant","OH","Ohio State University","Continuing Grant","Tomek Bartoszynski","06/30/2027","$145,144.00","","gconant@uic.edu","1960 KENNY RD","COLUMBUS","OH","432101016","6146888735","MPS","126800","","$0.00","This project focuses on research connecting multiple fields of mathematics, namely, analysis, combinatorics, and model theory. Analysis and combinatorics can be seen as two different approaches toward using mathematics to study the physical world. In analysis, which evolved from calculus, the approach is based on continuous and dynamical methods of an infinite nature. By contrast, combinatorics seeks to understand complicated and subtle patterns in discrete (and often finite) systems. The proposed research centers on using model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, to bridge these two different perspectives. Model theory is the abstract study of mathematical objects using properties that can be described with formal language and semantics. The leverage provided by model theory stems from the fact that two mathematical objects can appear substantially different in nature, but share enough semantic properties so that an understanding of one object leads to understanding of the other. This approach has led to significant breakthroughs in mathematical research, which will be further developed in this project. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will also allow for collaboration between researchers and students from a variety of mathematical backgrounds and levels.<br/><br/>The broad theme of the research proposed is the use of continuous logic (model theory for metric structures) to develop a stronger foundation for the interaction between analysis and combinatorics described above, with a focus on arithmetic combinatorics in noncommutative groups. There are two main goals. The first is to prove a fully general arithmetic regularity lemma valid for arbitrary groups using a Radon-Nikodym-type strategy (similar to the nonstandard proof of Szemeredi's regularity lemma for graphs). Previous attempts toward such a theorem have been impeded by fundamental drawbacks of classical (discrete) logic, and this project proposes a new strategy based on continuous logic. This theorem is envisioned as a necessary step in the ongoing development of a model-theoretic framework for arithmetic combinatorics. The second main goal is based on recent work on the structure of stable functions on groups, which establishes a connection to existing results in arithmetic combinatorics (e.g., on approximate groups). A majority of these results are only currently understood at a qualitative level, and thus a quantitative understanding of stable functions on groups should lead to quantitative breakthroughs in these other areas. Moreover, model theoretic ideas were previously successful in obtaining a quantitative analysis of stable sets in groups. This project will pursue an analogous quantitative analysis of stable functions, motivated by applications to arithmetic combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Roughly speaking, a geometric structure modeled on a geometry (G,X) is a space that locally (i.e. upon zooming in) looks like the given space X and on which there are local symmetries coming from the action of the group G on X. These structures have been studied extensively since their introduction by Ehresmann in the 1930?s and in this project the PI aims to continue to explore their connections to number theory and differential equations. The project will involve training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The main objective is to make progress on fundamental questions about the algebraic nature of the wide class of special functions coming from geometric structures (as well as from other physical applications) and to use those to attack related problems in diophantine geometry. More precisely, building on his recent work on a differential approach to functional transcendence, the investigator aims to 1)  tackle major transcendence problems such as the Ax-Lindemann-Weierstrass and Ax-Schanuel conjectures for uniformizing functions of geometric structures in higher dimensions, 2) initiate the study of the Existential Closedness and the Zilber-Pink conjecture for Fuchsian functions using a differential approach and 3) study the structure of the sets defined by (possibly other) classical differential and difference equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within mathematical logic, three major subfields are studied. Model theory understands mathematical objects by considering them through the lens of a formal language. Computability theory understands mathematical objects by considering them through the lens of computational complexity. Set theory understands mathematical objects through the foundational axioms of mathematics and how those axioms imply the object?s existence. This project focuses on some connections between computability theory and the other two subfields of logic. Regarding model theory, the project involves exploring the phenomenon when two mathematical objects look the same in terms of their formal languages, but one can be computed while the other cannot. In set theory, there is a rich theory exploring the complexity of 2-dimensional sets in terms of constructively embedding one into another. These embeddings are constructible in terms of the basic set-theoretic operations of unions and complements, but they may not be computable. The project will explore an analogous theory where one considers embeddings that must be computable. This project involves work with undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The computable spectrum of a first-order theory asks which dimensions of models of that theory are computable. The spectrum problem in computable model theory, which has been a major open problem since the 70s, asks for which sets may be computable spectra of uncountably categorical theories, with a focus on strongly minimal theories. In this project,  the aim is to give a reduction of the problem from a fully general framework down to the locally modular strongly minimal theories, which are geometrically tame and are closely related to groups. From there, the hope is to be able to give concrete answers as to which sets are spectra. Separately, this project will examine computable reduction on equivalence relations. One major direction is to use this complexity notion to examine algebraic decision problems in detail. In the past, the Turing degrees have been used to analyze algebraic decision problems, but these form a coarse yardstick, so all computably enumerable degrees seem to contain all natural algebraic decision problems. Using computable reductions on equivalence relations, there should be a much more interesting structure emerging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its elements are precisely the symmetries of the algebraic closure of the rational numbers.  In practice, though, this group is particularly difficult to study.  There are continuum-many of these symmetries, most of which cannot be computed by any computer (or Turing machine) running any finite-length program whatsoever.  However, the symmetries that mathematicians encounter on a regular basis are essentially always computable -- perhaps because these are fundamental to the group, or perhaps just because noncomputable symmetries are naturally more difficult to examine and work with.  This project aims to determine just how much difference there is between the computable symmetries (as a group) and the larger group of all symmetries. The research work lies at the interface of logic and number theory and is likely to attract the interest of both communities. Graduate students from CUNY Graduate Center will participate in this project.<br/> <br/>An analogous situation exists with the field of all real numbers:  only countably many real numbers have computable decimal expansions, so the vast majority of real numbers are noncomputable, yet the computable ones are the only ones ever encountered in daily life.  Here, it is known that the computable real numbers form a subfield extremely similar to the full field of all real numbers, an elementary subfield with exactly the same first-order properties. This grant will fund research to attempt to determine whether Gal(Q) is analogous in this way:  do the computable symmetries form an elementary subgroup of the full group?  (Or, at a minimum, are the two elementarily equivalent?)  If so, then mathematicians should be able to determine many results about the full group just by examining the computable symmetries, which are far more accessible.  If not, that would suggest that the absolute Galois group is a thornier object than the field of real numbers, with its noncomputable symmetries somehow essential to its character.  However, even then, it is possible that the subgroup might be elementary for relatively simple properties (e.g., purely existential statements about the group), in which case this project will attempt to find the first level at which the subgroup stops imitating the full group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Zermelo-Frankel axioms of set theory (ZFC) emerged in the decades that followed as an answer to the question: what are the basic assumptions of mathematics? From the nine postulates of ZFC, one can derive all known theorems of mathematics. Despite this triumph of logic, a <br/>major problem remains: there are mathematical problems that cannot be solved assuming the ZFC axioms alone. Most famously, Godel and Cohen showed that starting with these axioms, it is impossible to prove or refute Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis. One of the main goals of modern set theory is to analyze and classify axiomatic systems beyond ZFC that are strong enough to answer these undecidable questions. This project studies a framework for generating set-theoretic axioms by mining the structure of large cardinals in inner models of set theory. This project involves student training and conference organization and will have an impact on the philosophy of mathematics.<br/><br/>ZFC can be seen as an attempt to axiomatize the structure of the class of all sets. It is incomplete because our mathematical intuitions about arbitrary sets do not suffice to determine all their properties. To get around this problem, one can restrict attention to smaller subclasses of sets that are somehow canonical. Gödel discovered that there are subclasses that are rich enough to satisfy the ZFC axioms yet constrained enough that all their properties can be determined. Such a subclass is called a canonical inner model. For example, in canonical inner models, the Continuum Hypothesis is true. One obtains extensions of ZFC by considering the statements that hold in canonical inner models. One such statement is the Ultrapower Axiom, identified and studied by the PI in his dissertation. The axiom imposes a rich structure on the upper reaches of the hierarchy of infinite cardinals, or large cardinals, one of the central objects of study in set theory. Taking advantage of a recent breakthrough of Woodin, the PI was able to formulate strong generalizations of the Ultrapower Axiom, which this project proposes to study in hopes that they will shed further light on major open problems in inner model theory and large cardinals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a broad field to study, so important distinctions are made based on how the class of structures is described (or axiomatized). If the class is describable in first-order logic, it is called an elementary class. First-order logic has many powerful properties, especially the property of compactness. Compactness allows model theorists to build structures with exotic properties and has driven much of the model theory of elementary classes, most notably classification theory. However, many classes of structures are not describable in first-order logic (these are called nonelementary classes). Lacking compactness, the development of nonelementary model theory and classification theory has proceeded much slower than its elementary counterpart. Recent work in nonelementary classes has shown that various fragments of compactness can still hold in some nonelementary classes and are still powerful enough to prove various results of elementary classification theory. The PI will develop more of these fragments in nonelementary classes. Additionally, the PI will run a program to build research infrastructure at their home institution (an R2 institution and HSI).  This program will support undergraduates conducting research in logic, supported by a speaker series that will build connections between expert logicians and faculty and students.<br/><br/>This research will develop fragments of compactness in a variety of ways.  From category theory, methods from accessible categories and from topoi will be used to find compactness principles in certain nonelementary classes.  Drawing on model theory and set theory, generalized indiscernibles and generalizations of the Erdos-Rado theorem will find compactness principles that hold in all nonelementary classes.  Further drawing on set theory, the connections between large cardinals and compactness principles (along with other model-theoretic ideas) will be extended.  The connections formed in categorical logic will be extended to higher category theory to open new areas for model theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
