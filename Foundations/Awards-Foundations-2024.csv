The field of descriptive set theory gives a general framework for studying these types of classification problems and comparing their relative difficulties. The PI proposes research in descriptive set theory and its connections with other mathematical fields including computability, operator algebras, topological dynamics, and ergodic theory. The PI will continue facilitating connections with these mathematical communities, and engaging with graduate students and young researchers. The project will support the training of graduate students at UCLA.<br/><br/>The PI proposes research on Weiss's question on amenability and hyperfiniteness using tools from Gromov's theory of asymptotic dimension. This approach to Weiss's question has already greatly extended and simplified prior results on the problem and clarified their proofs. This investigation has applications to topological dynamics and operator algebras. The PI also proposes research on classical geometrical paradoxes such as the Banach-Tarski paradox and Tarski's circle squaring problem. Recent advances in measurable combinatorics have led to new theorems giving measurable solutions to these problems using combinatorial techniques from the study of flows and matching problems on Borel graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conferences in this series have as their central theme the study of randomness at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. Randomness is a natural informal notion in our lives and a formal, mathematical notion in probability theory, but here we seek to use different types of algorithms to quantify the levels of randomness that a mathematical object (such as an infinite binary string) can possess. Since the pandemic has made it far more difficult for American early-career researchers and graduate students to form international professional networks, it is extremely important for them to be able to travel, share their work, and build in-person collaborations with their colleagues abroad now.<br/><br/>The Computability, Complexity and Randomness conference series has been ongoing since 2004 and promotes research in algorithmic randomness, complexity theory, and computability theory as well as applications of algorithmic randomness to areas of mathematics such as ergodic theory and geometric measure theory and other areas of computability theory such as computable structure theory and reverse mathematics. This year, we are seeking to extend the focus of this conference and welcome researchers in related areas such as effective set theory and continuous combinatorics. It is a common venue for early-career researchers and graduate students to present their own work in contributed talks and encounter areas of research that are new to them, accelerating their professional development and enhancing their research networks.

The Zermelo-Frankel axioms of set theory (ZFC) emerged in the decades that followed as an answer to the question: what are the basic assumptions of mathematics? From the nine postulates of ZFC, one can derive all known theorems of mathematics. Despite this triumph of logic, a <br/>major problem remains: there are mathematical problems that cannot be solved assuming the ZFC axioms alone. Most famously, Godel and Cohen showed that starting with these axioms, it is impossible to prove or refute Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis. One of the main goals of modern set theory is to analyze and classify axiomatic systems beyond ZFC that are strong enough to answer these undecidable questions. This project studies a framework for generating set-theoretic axioms by mining the structure of large cardinals in inner models of set theory. This project involves student training and conference organization and will have an impact on the philosophy of mathematics.<br/><br/>ZFC can be seen as an attempt to axiomatize the structure of the class of all sets. It is incomplete because our mathematical intuitions about arbitrary sets do not suffice to determine all their properties. To get around this problem, one can restrict attention to smaller subclasses of sets that are somehow canonical. Gödel discovered that there are subclasses that are rich enough to satisfy the ZFC axioms yet constrained enough that all their properties can be determined. Such a subclass is called a canonical inner model. For example, in canonical inner models, the Continuum Hypothesis is true. One obtains extensions of ZFC by considering the statements that hold in canonical inner models. One such statement is the Ultrapower Axiom, identified and studied by the PI in his dissertation. The axiom imposes a rich structure on the upper reaches of the hierarchy of infinite cardinals, or large cardinals, one of the central objects of study in set theory. Taking advantage of a recent breakthrough of Woodin, the PI was able to formulate strong generalizations of the Ultrapower Axiom, which this project proposes to study in hopes that they will shed further light on major open problems in inner model theory and large cardinals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a heavy concentration of non-classical logicians, especially in South American nations, making it important for external researchers to come to the SLALM in order to keep current on progress in this area.  In contrast, computability theory is much more prominent in the US than in Latin America, and US-based researchers who attend the SLALM will be able to detail and explain recent advances in this area.  Model theory is well represented in Colombia and Costa Rica in particular, as well as in the US, while set theorists are scattered all over the Americas, both North and South.  There have often been fruitful collaborations between US and Latin American scholars in these fields, and we confidently expect this SLALM to produce many more.<br/><br/>Further information is available at https://xxslalm.cmat.edu.uy/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within mathematical logic, three major subfields are studied. Model theory understands mathematical objects by considering them through the lens of a formal language. Computability theory understands mathematical objects by considering them through the lens of computational complexity. Set theory understands mathematical objects through the foundational axioms of mathematics and how those axioms imply the object?s existence. This project focuses on some connections between computability theory and the other two subfields of logic. Regarding model theory, the project involves exploring the phenomenon when two mathematical objects look the same in terms of their formal languages, but one can be computed while the other cannot. In set theory, there is a rich theory exploring the complexity of 2-dimensional sets in terms of constructively embedding one into another. These embeddings are constructible in terms of the basic set-theoretic operations of unions and complements, but they may not be computable. The project will explore an analogous theory where one considers embeddings that must be computable. This project involves work with undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The computable spectrum of a first-order theory asks which dimensions of models of that theory are computable. The spectrum problem in computable model theory, which has been a major open problem since the 70s, asks for which sets may be computable spectra of uncountably categorical theories, with a focus on strongly minimal theories. In this project,  the aim is to give a reduction of the problem from a fully general framework down to the locally modular strongly minimal theories, which are geometrically tame and are closely related to groups. From there, the hope is to be able to give concrete answers as to which sets are spectra. Separately, this project will examine computable reduction on equivalence relations. One major direction is to use this complexity notion to examine algebraic decision problems in detail. In the past, the Turing degrees have been used to analyze algebraic decision problems, but these form a coarse yardstick, so all computably enumerable degrees seem to contain all natural algebraic decision problems. Using computable reductions on equivalence relations, there should be a much more interesting structure emerging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Classical model theory focuses on studying classes of structures that can be defined by sets of finite sentences (first-order logic). Although many classes are defined by sets of finite sentences, there are many that can only be defined using sets of infinite sentences (infinitary logic). The setting of this project is that of abstract elementary classes (AECs for short) which is a setting where one can study classes defined by sets of infinite sentences. AECs have been studied since the late seventies, and recently, the theory has developed very rapidly. The objective of this project is to continue the PI's work on finding interactions and applications of AECs to algebra. <br/><br/>More precisely, the project focuses on finding interactions and applications of AECs to module theory and acts (polygons, G-sets) theory. The first part of the project focuses on continuing the development of AECs of modules. A key problem is to determine the stability behavior of AECs of modules with pure embeddings. The second part of the project focuses on developing a parallel theory for acts to what the PI has been able to accomplish for modules.   A fundamental notion that will be studied on AECs of acts is independence relations (non-forking for AECs). The PI expects that these studies will help him better understand the strengths and limitations of independence relations, so he can apply them in other settings in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Its elements are precisely the symmetries of the algebraic closure of the rational numbers.  In practice, though, this group is particularly difficult to study.  There are continuum-many of these symmetries, most of which cannot be computed by any computer (or Turing machine) running any finite-length program whatsoever.  However, the symmetries that mathematicians encounter on a regular basis are essentially always computable -- perhaps because these are fundamental to the group, or perhaps just because noncomputable symmetries are naturally more difficult to examine and work with.  This project aims to determine just how much difference there is between the computable symmetries (as a group) and the larger group of all symmetries. The research work lies at the interface of logic and number theory and is likely to attract the interest of both communities. Graduate students from CUNY Graduate Center will participate in this project.<br/> <br/>An analogous situation exists with the field of all real numbers:  only countably many real numbers have computable decimal expansions, so the vast majority of real numbers are noncomputable, yet the computable ones are the only ones ever encountered in daily life.  Here, it is known that the computable real numbers form a subfield extremely similar to the full field of all real numbers, an elementary subfield with exactly the same first-order properties. This grant will fund research to attempt to determine whether Gal(Q) is analogous in this way:  do the computable symmetries form an elementary subgroup of the full group?  (Or, at a minimum, are the two elementarily equivalent?)  If so, then mathematicians should be able to determine many results about the full group just by examining the computable symmetries, which are far more accessible.  If not, that would suggest that the absolute Galois group is a thornier object than the field of real numbers, with its noncomputable symmetries somehow essential to its character.  However, even then, it is possible that the subgroup might be elementary for relatively simple properties (e.g., purely existential statements about the group), in which case this project will attempt to find the first level at which the subgroup stops imitating the full group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a broad field to study, so important distinctions are made based on how the class of structures is described (or axiomatized). If the class is describable in first-order logic, it is called an elementary class. First-order logic has many powerful properties, especially the property of compactness. Compactness allows model theorists to build structures with exotic properties and has driven much of the model theory of elementary classes, most notably classification theory. However, many classes of structures are not describable in first-order logic (these are called nonelementary classes). Lacking compactness, the development of nonelementary model theory and classification theory has proceeded much slower than its elementary counterpart. Recent work in nonelementary classes has shown that various fragments of compactness can still hold in some nonelementary classes and are still powerful enough to prove various results of elementary classification theory. The PI will develop more of these fragments in nonelementary classes. Additionally, the PI will run a program to build research infrastructure at their home institution (an R2 institution and HSI).  This program will support undergraduates conducting research in logic, supported by a speaker series that will build connections between expert logicians and faculty and students.<br/><br/>This research will develop fragments of compactness in a variety of ways.  From category theory, methods from accessible categories and from topoi will be used to find compactness principles in certain nonelementary classes.  Drawing on model theory and set theory, generalized indiscernibles and generalizations of the Erdos-Rado theorem will find compactness principles that hold in all nonelementary classes.  Further drawing on set theory, the connections between large cardinals and compactness principles (along with other model-theoretic ideas) will be extended.  The connections formed in categorical logic will be extended to higher category theory to open new areas for model theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
