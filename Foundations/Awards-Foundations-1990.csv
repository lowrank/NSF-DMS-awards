Here ""ordinary mathematics""                  refers to the parts of mathematics which are not overtly set                    theoretical.  For instance ""ordinary mathematics"" includes                      subjects such as geometry, differential equations, real and                     complex analysis, countable algebra, countable combinatorics, and               the topology of complete separable metric spaces.  On the other                 hand, ""ordinary mathematics"" does not include topics such as                    general topology and uncountable cardinal arithmetic.                                It has been found that the language of second order                        arithmetic is an appropriate context for the study of the above                 question.  (This is because ""ordinary mathematics"" is to a large                extent identifiable with countable and separable mathematics.)                  Moreover, a great many key theorems of ordinary mathematics, when               formalized as sentences of second order arithmetic, turn out to                 be equivalent to the set existence axioms which are needed to                   prove them.  (The equivalent is proved over a weak base theory.)                Surprisingly, the number of inequivalent set existence axioms                   which arise in this way is rather small.  This is the theme of                  Reverse Mathematics, which has been developed by Simpson and                    others and will be further developed under the current project."

These strengthenings are obtained by placing size restrictions on               various aspects of a Turing calculation.  In particular, she is                 interested in truth table reducibility, weak truth table                        reducibility, and polynomial-time bounded Turing reducibility.                  She plans to develop technical methods for solving structural                   questions about the degrees, and to analyze the degree structures               in terms of the proof techniques which are appropriate to the                   structures.

One of his main ongoing research interests concerns                the theory of the model L(R) with the axiom of determinacy.  The                sets of reals in L(R) form a far-reaching extension of the                      projective sets, and the goal of obtaining a more or less                       complete theory of this model with the axiom of determinacy                     (which is a natural strong set theoretic axiom for this model) is               one of his central interests.                                                        Secondly, he is working on problems connected with the                     theory of equivalence relations in ZFC.  Recently, R. Dougherty,                A.S. Kechris (who introduced the term ""descriptive dynamics"" for                this area) and the investigator obtained some results which                     suggest the beginnings of a possible classification for the Borel               equivalence relations with countable classes.  There are many                   open problems here, such as identifying a canonical cofinal                     hierarchy of equivalence relations.                                                  Thirdly, some problems of descriptive set theory of a more                 classical nature have arisen recently.  D. Mauldin and the                      investigator have recently obtained a non-uniformization type                   result for co-analytic sets.  There are open problems here, such                as how far these results can be extended in ZF, as well as other                problems in descriptive set theory which he will work on.                            Finally, he would like to devote some time to problems which               have arisen from the inner model theory for large cardinals, such               as questions about iteration trees.                                                  There is nothing more basic in mathematics than set theory.                It is arguable that the natural numbers (0,1,2,3,...) are no more               fundamental.  For this reason it is perhaps surprising to find                  questions about these fundamental objects under active                          investigation and to see that even the choice of axioms for a                   theory of sets is controversial."

This shift has already been shown to produce at least                 one gain in metrizable spaces (the standard setting) although                   there are three or four losses.

The                  major aim is to generalize the core model, first to include                     everything up to Woodin cardinals, and then to include Woodin                   cardinals as well.  Preliminary results have revealed the                       probable structure of this core model, and the main remaining                   problem is to find a condition on the extenders in the core model               which will ensure that iterated ultrapowers of the core model are               well-founded.

There are now several such methods: the method of ""workers"", developed by Harrington, two versions of ""alpha-systems"", both developed by Ash, and a method of Lemmp and Lerman. The method of workers and the original alpha-systems have each yielded quite a number of results in recursive model theory. Knight has a metatheorem for workers, similar to the one Ash proved for his original alpha-systems, except that not so much is assumed to be r.e., and the conditions are more complicated. Knight hopes both to simplify and to improve the metatheorem for workers. In Knight's metatheorem, as in Ash's original metatheorem, the object produced on the bottom is recursive. Ash's new alpha-systems (simpler than the old), and the method of Lemmp and Lerman, are designed to produce an r.e. object on the bottom. There are many problems in recursive model theory (existence of recursive presentations of groups, etc.), as well as in recursion theory, on which these new methods ought to yield results. Recursion theory as a topic in the foundations of mathematics is motivated by a desire to formalize the property of being computable by an algorithm. The algorithm need not be a practical one, but it must exist and terminate in principal after some finite number of steps."

Having found an effective test for the constructive truth of propositions, in real algebra, of a bounded logical complexity, Scowcroft hopes to isolate a convenient set of axioms for these constructively true propositions. He also wants to learn whether first-order real algebra in Dana Scott's model for intuitionistic analysis is recursively undecidable. Scowcroft's new model for intuitionistic analysis may permit him to develop a new model for first-order real algebra, and recent work on subanalytic sets may allow him to extend his effective test for constructive truth to propositions involving certain transcendental functions. In the model-theory of p-adic fields, Scowcroft plans to study the properties of definable equivalence relations, the differences in expressive power between the first-order languages commonly used to describe a p-adic field, and the efficiency of quantifier-elimination procedures for Macintyre's first-order theory of the p-adics. These issues in the foundations of algebra bring modern mathematical logic to bear upon another related area.
