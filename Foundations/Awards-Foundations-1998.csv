The first involves continuing investigations into combinatorial set theory. This focuses on the use of strong ideals and generic embeddings to prove reflection properties and other combinatorial consequences.  These are wide ranging, from stationary set reflection at singular cardinals to infinitary Ramsey theory. The tools include methods of forcing, the PCF theory and large cardinals.  The second is the use of descriptive set theory to provide new invariants for studying objects of interest to ergodic theory.  The main thrust is to be able to classify the complexity of various classes of transformations with the hope of being able to distinguish between previously indistinguishable classes (e.g one may be Borel and the other true analytic.) An example of an important problem that may yield to such a technique is to show that there is an ergodic, finite entropy, measure preserving transformation that is not isomorphic to a smooth measure preserving transformation on a compact manifold. <br/><br/>This work is in the Foundations of Mathematics:  how mathematics fits together and why it works.  These studies often involve consideration of problems that are not solvable by the usual assumptions of mathematics:  The Zermelo-Frankel Axioms with the Axiom of Choice.  Methods to be used imclude generic large cardinals, or symmetries of the mathematical universe that reveal powerful regularities that often solve intractable problems.  Considerations arising from studies of the foundations of mathematics have led to classifications of problems based on their inherent complexity.  These measures of complexity, in turn, can be applied to natural problems in dynamical systems and ergodic theory, as will be pursued in this project.<br/><br/>"

In addition Cherlin, working with Shi, seeks to introduce model theoretic methods into the study of universal graphs, and to show the role of the model theoretic algebraic closure operator for this class of problems. Thomas will study interactions of set theory and group theory in connection with automorphism towers and the cofinalities of infinite analogs of finite groups, making use of forcing, pcf theory, and large cardinals, as well as character theory. An outstanding problem is the relationship of the cofinality of the infinite symmetric group to Blass' invariant, the groupwise density.  The role of matrix groups in modern mathematics is well established and occupies a central place in both pure and applied mathematics.  It has been conjectured that these groups also play a predominant role in the detailed analysis of many apparently unrelated structures of general type.  One of the goals of the present project is to confirm this in the so-called ``tame case'', which is more immediately accessible. A separate goal is to demonstrate that standard ideas of logic (model theory) can cast new light on existing problems in combinatorics (graph theory).  It is hoped that graph theorists will themselves adopt these methods in such cases. The work of Thomas uncovers previously unsuspected relations between algebraic and set theoretical issues, and should lead to new ``forcing'' tools, which are among the most powerful foundational tools of modern set theory. The general thrust of the proposal is to show how techniques arising naturally in one area can be transported fruitfully to other subject areas."

One underlying technique is the construction of homogeneous universal models with respect to a notion of strong submodel.  On the one hand, this links stability theory with probability on finite models by providing a technique for not only proving 0-1 laws but obtaining model theoretic properties of the almost sure theory.  These model theoretic properties of the almost sure theory can be applied to problems in finite model theory.  On the other hand, this technique is exploited to attempt to construct a bad field.  Finally, investigations of embedded finite models solves problems of database database theory using techniques from stability theory.     One theme in this work is model theory, a branch of mathematical logic.  The general aim is to understand `ordinary mathematics' at a higher level of abstraction.  This has previously resulted in applications in the area of algebra, specifically group theory.  The present project will involve an attempt to find some specific new structures which expand the complex numbers.  Some of these same insights will be used to explore the asymptotic properties of finite graphs.  A further application of this abstract framework has been in the development of `embedded finite model theory,' where the techniques of model theory are employed to find limits on the expressibility of database queries."

The first objective is to study computability on the computably enumerable sets, and to relate their algebraic structure to the degree of information they encode and to the speed with which they can be enumerated with respect to some measure of computational complexity.  Here attention is focused on the computably enumerable sets because they are generated by an algorithm, and hence most easily approximated by a computable function.  The second objective is to study the relationship of computability to other mathematical objects, for example to models of Peano arithmetic, and to algebraic structures, such as Boolean algebras, and models of special theories like totally transcendental ones.  For algebraic structures, the general problem is to determine exactly what information can be coded into the isomorphism type of that structure.    The fundamental aim is to deepen our understanding of computability and its relation to structures in mathematics and computer science.  In the 1930's various definitions of computable function were proposed by Turing, Church, Kleene, Goedel, and others.  They were soon proved equivalent and they (particularly Turing's model) contributed during the war to the development of high speed digital computers.  These models can be restricted with respect to computing resources such as time and space and give rise to computational complexity, an important part of modern computer science.  Computability and algorithms now permeate many aspects of our lives.  Modern researchers in computability and complexity are heirs to the founders like Turing and Goedel in that they are trying to classify the computable content of modern mathematics."

Ever since the work of Godel and Tarski, the question of whether a given elementary theory is decidable has been of central interest to logicians.  Nies will study this question for the theories of nonabelian free groups and for the degree structure of recursively enumerable reals compared under Solovay's domination reducibility.  As a main tool, he will use coding with first-order formulas.  This method yields not only undecidability of the elementary theory of a structure, but also further global properties of the structure itself (rather than its theory). Typical results obtained by this method are definability results and limitations on automorphisms.  Nies will study such properties, in particular for the central structure of recursively enumerable Turing degrees.      Nies' work introduces a unifying aspect into the vast and diverging area of modern mathematics, by analyzing through common methods structures from such different domains as computability theory and analysis. These methods are called coding methods. They consist of representing an object of one kind in an object of a second kind (the structure under investigation) using first order formulas.  First-order languages are central to mathematical logic and computer science.  In a sense, they are a formalization of a fragment of natural language. The first-order theory of a structure is the collection of   all facts about the structure which can be expressed in that language.  For instance, the existence of infinitely many prime numbers is a first-order fact about the structure of natural numbers (with addition and multiplication). In part, Nies investigates the question whether first-order theories are decidable. Moreover, he uses coding methods to explore global properties of the structures, like the existence of symmetries.  In several cases, the structures investigate d are considered central for the area in question (like free groups in algebra or the structure of recursively enumerable Turing degrees in computability theory)."

The motivation for this proposal is to investigate in great detail certain fundamental mathematical structures where the solutions of differential equations automatically have a definite asymptotic behavior.  (Differential equations are a ubiquitous mathematical tool in the sciences.) The novelty is that this study is undertaken from the point of view of model theory, a branch of mathematical logic which has made enormous strides in recent years. The techniques of model theory have never been applied to such asymptotic questions before, and it will be extremely interesting to see what this new perspective will reveal in this area of algebraic analysis."

Methods from computability theory will be used to analyze the complexity of these homogeneous sets relative to the complexity of the partition, both for single partitions and families of partitions.  Also, the logical strength of various versions of Ramsey's theorem and related principles will be studied, again largely using the methods of computability theory.  Other topics of investigation include the conditions under which a Boolean algebra has a computable copy and the conditions under which a group has a finitely presented expansion.<br/><br/>The purpose of this work is to achieve a better understanding of what can in principle be computed and of relationships among noncomputable sets of numbers.  Many proofs of mathematical results show the existence of certain sets without giving a procedure (or algorithm) for determining membership in the sets.  This work involves an attempt to come as close as possible to giving an algorithm.  This is closely related to finding what axioms are needed to prove the result and finding the consequences of the result.  The particular result this work is centered on, Ramsey's theorem, states, roughly speaking, that in the midst of patterns which may be very complicated, there must be patterns which are very simple.  However, it may be impossible to compute where the simple patterns occur, even when the original complicated patterns can be computed.  In this work, the possibilities for finding optimally simple descriptions of the places where the pattern is simple will be investigated, as well as the consequences that can be obtained from various versions of Ramsey's theorem in restricted logical systems.<br/><br/>"

Recent progress in the area of large cardinals indicates that it should be possible to prove the determinacy of such games using large cardinals in the region of Woodin cardinals.  The principal investigator has already proved results in this direction which introduce a basic technique for converting a general long game to an iteration game on a given model M, provided that M has enough large cardinals.  (The precise large cardinal needed of course depends on the length of the game in question.)  If M is an iterable model then the iteration game is determined, implying the determinacy of the original long game. The particular result proved is that continuously coded games with Pi 1-1 payoff are determined, assuming the existence of an iterable inner model with a cardinal which is `strong past a Woodin cardinal.' Using the techniques of this proof,  as a main building block we propose to study more closely the correlations between large cardinals and the determinacy of long games.    Games of infinite length play a major rule in current study of Descriptive Set Theory. Typically such games are played as follows: Fix a set A contained in the interval of reals between 0 and 1. We view those reals as written in binary base, so that a real has the form 0. a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5 ......  where a0, a1, etc. are ""digits"" namely either a 0 or a 1. Consider now a game played between two players (player I and player II) who take turns playing digits. I begins playing the digit a0, II follows playing the digit a1, then I plays the digit a2, II plays a3, etc. The two players continue playing ad-infinitum eventually producing the real number x = 0. a0, a1, a2, a3, .....  We call x a ""run"" of the game G(A), and say that the run x is won by player I in the case that x is in the set A. We say that the game G(A) is ""determined"" if one of the players has a winning strategy, or a set of instructions telling this play er precisely what to do in each round, and as long as these instructions are followed, the player is guaranteed to win.  For a general set A, the game G(A) need not be determined. However, it turns out that G(A) is determined if the set A is definable in certain ways. For example, Martin showed in 1970 that if A is the projection of a closed set then G(A) is determined. Recent progress in the study of large cardinals allows us to prove determinacy of longer games, and the purpose of this project is to study further the relationships between large cardinal axioms and the determinacy of several long games.  We expect this to help our understanding of large cardinals, since long games occur naturally in the study of large cardinals."

This effort is closely connected to pure descriptive set theory, the general study of definability for sets of real numbers. Steel plans to work in this area too, and in particular on questions related to the determinacy of infinite games. One very nice question here is whether all closed (in the countable-initial-segment topology) games of length aleph-one with projectively definable payoff are determined.    Many questions of mathematical interest are left undecided by ZFC, the commonly accepted system of axioms for mathematics. The most natural and successful way to extend ZFC so as to decide such questions is to add ""large cardinal hypotheses"" to ZFC. Such hypotheses play a central role in the foundations of mathematics, and because of this have been studied intensively over the last 30 to 40 years. One way to understand and use large cardinal hypotheses is by constructing canonical minimal universes, or ""inner models"", in which these hypotheses hold true. Inner model theory began with work of Kurt Godel in the 1930's, and from the late 1960's to the present the theory has undergone more or less continuous development. Set theorists have constructed and analyzed in detail canonical inner models for many large cardinal hypotheses, and these models have proved quite useful. Nevertheless, there are important large cardinal hypotheses which are beyond the reach of current inner model theory.  Steel will attempt to extend the theory so that it applies to these hypotheses."

Included in the first area are investigations of the structures of sets and functions ordered by different notions of relative complexity of computation.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the complexity structures of sets which are effectively enumerable and on the most general notion of relative computability as defined by unrestricted Turing machine computations.  Computation procedures that place effective bounds on the access to oracle information or the run time of the computations will also be investigated, as well as reductions between real numbers based on the relative rates of convergence of effective approximations to the real numbers. Applications of the methods of pure computability theory will be made in the areas of computable algebra and model theory. The second area includes the study of structures representable by finite automata, decision procedures, the analysis and development of nonmonotonic logic, concurrent programming models, and applications of linear programming ideas and algorithms to data structures and logic programming. A primary focus here will be the logical and mathematical foundations of hybrid (continuous and discrete) control theory as well as the practical implementation of algorithms for these subjects based on the theoretical work being done.<br/><br/>The work proposed in the first area is directed at a better understanding of the fundamental notions of computability and relative difficulty of computation for different tasks. The theoretical work deals both with the abstract notions of computability as well as with applications to specific branches of, and questions in, other areas of mathematics. One important application (within mathematics) concerns the general question of what starting information is needed to be able to compute other aspects of many important classes of mathematical structures. In practical terms, the results at times indicate that there are no algorithms for certain important tasks or that more information than might have been expected is needed to write programs calculating the desired results. The second area deals more directly with developing the mathematical (and especially logical) tools needed for the crucial areas of program verification, data management, and automated control of real-world complex systems. Commercial applications are expected for some of this work and there has already been a spin off to a start-up company developing several applications including data compression and network management algorithms.<br/>"

One group of combinatorial problems concerns characterizing which stationary sets can contain closed unbounded subsets in cardinal and GCH preserving outer models. Every stationary subset of aleph-one has this property. Previous work has shown that in general there is no such first-order characterization for subsets of aleph-two. On the other hand, for a restricted class of subsets of the successor of aleph-omega, such a characterization is possible. Some interesting cases remain open. Similar characterization questions can be asked regarding partitions and trees. Another area for continued work is the study of outer models and class forcing. Notwithstanding some technical qualifications, essentially only one method is known for constructing outer models, namely, Cohen's forcing method. Work to this point has shown that this is not an accident: Granted a technical assumption, every outer model is a class forcing extension, in one sense of the notion. An open problem is to characterize outer models that are class forcing extensions in a certain stronger sense. One point of this work is reducing certain set theoretical questions to more concrete combinatorial questions. All mathematical statements can be translated into statements about sets. If a given statement is mathematically provable, then the corresponding statement about sets is derivable from the axioms of set theory. Thus statements whose translations are neither provable nor refutable from the axioms of set theory are themselves neither provable nor refutable mathematically. Such statements are said to be ""independent"". In some cases, a given mathematical object may have a certain property for provable reasons; in others, for independent reasons. One subject of this research is, for a certain class of objects, to determine whether it is possible to characterize those objects which have certain properties for pr ovable reasons. Surprisingly, it can be shown that in some cases this is not possible---which objects have the specified property depends on global features of the entire universe of sets. Another subject of this research is class forcing. Essentially, only one method is known for proving that statements are independent, namely, Cohen's forcing method. Recent work has shown that there is a good reason for this. In many cases, any independence result that can be obtained can be obtained by class forcing, in one sense of the term. However, this sort of class forcing is combinatorially far removed from the sort that is typically used to establish independence results. It is a goal to close this gap (or to explore why it is not possible to close it). A hope is that this will provide a means of reducing certain problems to tractable questions regarding forcing."
