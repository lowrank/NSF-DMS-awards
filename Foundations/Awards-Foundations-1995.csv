On the one hand a new Galois theory for   differential fields is developed, using model-theoretic methods (and   generalising the Picard-Vessiot theory), and various inverse Galois   problems are posed.  On the other hand, it is asked whether a differential   field which supports a model-theoretic dimension theory must be   differentially closed (namely contain solutions to all algebraic   differential equations over the field).  Other components of the project   involve (1) more traditional questions in model theory such as determining   the number of models of complete theories, and (2) studying groups   definable in O-minimal theories, which amounts to trying to develop a   reasonable theory of Lie groups over arbitrary real closed fields.       The understanding of collections of symmetries (also called groups)  is an important part of mathematics and of its applications.  Pillay's   project concerns symmetries arising from various situations: differential   equations, algebraic equations, and more abstract contexts.  He will use   methods from logic (specifically model theory) to analyse, identify, and   make connections between such groups of symmetries. The expressive power of   logic thus applied will gain concrete mathematical information.  ***"

Morley rank, a 30-year-old concept due to Michael Morley,   measures in some sense the complexity of the structure.  In a structure of   finite Morley rank, certain subsets (the so-called definable subsets) are   endowed with a natural number, and these natural numbers behave like the  ""dimension"" of the set to which they are attached.  For example, every  variety over an algebraically closed field is a structure of finite Morley  rank. In particular, every algebraic group over an algebraically closed field  is a group of finite Morley rank.  The Cherlin-Zil'ber conjecture states a   partial converse: A simple group of finite Morley rank is an algebraic   group over an algebraically closed field.  If true, the conjecture will show   that the concept of algebraic group is independent of the base field when   the latter is known to be algebraically closed: just a concept of dimension   satisfying certain simple axioms is enough to insure that a simple group is   an algebraic group, i.e., a geometric object.  Apart from its use in model   theory, this almost philosophical (even metaphysical!) consequence of the   conjecture suffices to make the subject worthwhile.  If the conjecture is   false, it will give rise to new groups that are not algebraic but that  look very much like both infinite algebraic and finite groups.  Nesin's   research is a fundamental part of the program of showing the   Cherlin-Zil'ber conjecture.       The primary purpose of mathematics is the understanding of  geometry and natural numbers.  Algebra was invented to understand better the   nature of geometry and numbers.  The concept of dimension is, of course, very   important in geometry; in general, any geometric object has dimension.  One   can ask the reverse problem: suppose each object in a class has a   dimension and that these dimensions behave well, i.e. they satisfy some   natural axioms.  Is it then true that th ese objects are geometric?  The work   of Nesin concerns this problem in a particular setting.  His objects are   groups.  His research is part of a large project whose goal is to show that   groups on which a certain concept of dimension is defined are groups of   transformations of a geometric object.  ***"

The first kind lies within ergodic theory and has to do with   conjugacy of invertible measure-preserving transformations.  In particular,   Foreman will use the tools of descriptive set theory to attempt to   determine whether every invertible ergodic transformation with finite   entropy is conjugate to a smooth transformation on a compact smooth   manifold.  The second kind of problem concerns the strength and consequences   of very large ideals on cardinals such as the second uncountable cardinal.   Foreman intends to use these ideals to investigate partition relations.       In the early twentieth century, ergodic theory arose as a technique  for studying complicated models of physical phenomenon by looking at   the statistical behavior of the associated flows.  Dynamical systems   arising in physics with otherwise intractible behavior were amenable   to this kind of analysis.  A prominent problem in ergodic theory deals   with the extent to which the general statistical behavior of measure   preserving systems models the behavior of physically realistic  situations.  Foreman will continue to investigate these problems using the   tools of descriptive set theory, an unconventional approach which brings   logic to bear on the problem.  ***"

(2) Applications of set theory, especially   in the theory of abelian groups. (3) Semantics of linear logic, especially   game semantics and its variants. (4) Logic of topoi, particularly the   logical properties of geometric morphisms.  The research project of Glen   Whitney concerns interpreting general recursive definitions, especially in   non-determinisitic and concurrent contexts.  Specific questions include:   (1) Finding a universal class of structures with a recursion operation, so   that every structure will be contained in one from this class. (2)   Comparing proposals for the semantics of concurrent programming languages.   (3) Seeking connections with fixpoint logics used in finite model theory.   (4) Extending the current theory to allow more detailed modelings of   parameter and message passing between subprograms.          Both the formal language of recursion FLR, which Whitney will  study, and Girard's linear logic LL, one of Blass' research topics, can   serve as mathematical models of certain aspects of computing.  FLR models   recursion, i.e., programs using subroutines identical to the programs   themselves.  Whitney's project is directed toward improved understanding of   recursion in the context of parallel computing, i.e. computations done   collaboratively by many machines operating simultaneously.  LL models data  types; its game semantics models the situation where accessing data   involves more of an interaction (access protocol) between the provider and  the user of the data than mere transmission of data.  Both theories are  currently at the stage of mathematical exploration, but it is hoped that  the information obtained w ill be of use in the design of future programming  languages and in the formal verification of correctness of programs.   Cardinal characteristics of the continuum are a way to exhibit and clarify  the combinatorial content of difficult problems from various areas of  mathematics -- originally topology and analysis, more recently algebra as  well.  They provide connections between these different areas and thus  allow progress on a problem in one area to be applied in another.  In  addition, they make these problems amenable to treatment by the methods of  modern set theory.  The final topic in Blass' proposed research, topos  theory, also serves to connect apparently disparate areas, mostly within  mathematical logic.  The particular topic of geometric morphisms of topoi  combines ideas from set theory, from information systems (introduced as a  model of computation), from sheaf theory (a part of topology), and from  constructive logic.  ***"

Cherlin   will investigate a class of groups arising in model theory, whose simple   sections are conjectured to be algebraic groups.  Within this class, the   class of ""tame omega-stable groups"" provides a test case in which it is   conjectured -- the Borovik philosophy -- that a modification of the   strategy used in the classification of the finite simple groups will   suffice to prove the conjecture.  This amounts in practice to doing   somewhat more than the classification of simple algebraic groups over   algebraically closed fields, using methods of finite group theory, and very   little algebraic geometry beyond rudimentary properties of dimension.  The   Borovik philosophy has been fleshed out fairly clearly in odd   characteristic, and requires similar scrutiny in characteristic two.  (The   definitions of even and odd characteristic are group theoretic but quite   different from the ones used in finite group theory.)  Thomas will continue   the study of the cofinalities of permutation groups.  This investigation   goes back to a question of Serre, the precise answer of which is heavily   dependent on set theoretic hypotheses.  Results in this area tend to rely   heavily on delicate set theoretic forcing constructions and also involve   character theoretic computations relating to rapid generation by conjugacy   classes.  There are also relationships, largely obscure, between these group   theoretic cofinalities and more standard set theoretic cardinal invariants   attached to the continuum.  Most recently it has been seen that there are   also solid connections to pcf theory, an area of set theory developed by   Saharon Shelah.  This theory is seen as a new approach to cardinal   arithmetic that is less affected by independence phenomena than the   classical app roach.       Model theory attempts to classify mathematical theories.  The  ""best"" theories are those whose models (realizations) can be given   structural classifications.  Twenty years ago Zilber showed that all such   theories can be built from familiar algebraic structures: groups.  Cherlin   and Zilber then conjectured a classification scheme for the groups that   arise in this way. One promising route is to mine the literature on finite  simple groups.  As a result of the combined labors of about one hundred  mathematicians in journal articles filling about 10,000 highly condensed  journal pages, the finite simple groups were classified.  A parallel  strategy is developed for a large class of the infinite groups arising in  model theory.  This should require considerably less than 100 mathematicians  or 10,000 journal pages, for two reasons: (1) much of the work in the  finite case relates to the properties of 26 bizarre finite groups which are  not involved to any significant extent in the infinite case; (2) the somewhat  haphazard evolution of the original proof in the finite case, over more than  two decades, can be avoided on the basis of lessons learned from that proof.  It is nonetheless a large-scale project, and large-scale planning will be   critical to its success.  At the present time the plan, though still   incomplete, is already being implemented.  Cherlin will address the urgent   need for a ""top-level"" analysis to serve as a guide for the mathematicians  working on this strategy in parts of the U.S. and also in South America and  Europe.  Set theory has developed rapidly and steadily since Paul Cohen  settled some of the oldest questions in the subject in his 1963 breakthrough.  Many areas of mathematics involve surprisingly deep questions in set theory.  Recently this has been shown by Thomas to be the case in the study of the  structure of those infinite groups which are best approximated by finite  groups. Work in this area has two quite different aspects which mesh toge ther   well.  This subject serves as a site in which to develop new set theoretic  methods, providing a new link between computational methods in algebra and  set theory.  ***"

As the continuum   hypothesis seems far from the basic properties of Lebesgue integral, these   principles seem far away from mathematical practice.  However, as in the   case of the continuum hypothesis, they affect the standard objects of modern   mathematics.  Set-theorists are developing a network of infinitary   combinatorial principles that provide answers to otherwise unsolvable   problems.  Some of these principles involve the existence of two-cardinal   combinatorial objects (e.g., morasses, or families of sets whose existence   is equivalent to the existence of morasses); these objects may be viewed as   generalizations of cardinals.  Although constructions which employ these   structures are usually more complicated than constructions by the usual   transfinite induction, they may be necessary in more complicated   situations.  The first objective of the project is to extend and develop   new canonical methods of applying Velleman's simplified morasses for   constructing structures in Boolean algebras, topology and other fields.  A   second objective is to develop new methods of constructing forcing  notions using two-cardinal combinatorial principles.  These forcing notions   are used directly for proving undecidability.  If the new combinatorial   methods are applied to forcing theory, this may result in a series of new   consistency results in pure set theory as well as in its applications.  The   third objective is to introduce relatively manageable principles equivalent   to higher gap morasses and develop methods of applying them to the theory   of Boolean algebras, topology and other fields.  Koszmider has selected   well-known open problems from various fields as test cases, conjecturing   that some of these can be solved using the above new methods.        Mathematics is the language of science.  Scientific problems are  translated into formal, precise and abstract mathematical problems.   Mathematical machinery provides solutions to these problems and gives   blueprints (known as theorems) that provide conclusions to given   assumptions.  Proving theorems is what mathematics is all about; theorems   directly or indirectly affect the way we formulate and solve scientific   problems.  Is proving theorems a perfect method?  No!  In 1930, Godel showed   that in any reasonable system of mathematics there will be conjectures which   will never be decided and probems that will never be solved, unless we add   new axioms in the foundations of mathematics.  Are these unsolvable problems   only artificial logical constructions?  No!  In 1964, Paul Cohen invented  the method of forcing, which since then has been used for demonstating   unsolvability of many problems of mainstream mathematics.  We need to know   what problems are unsolvable and what extra assumptions in the foundations   of mathematics (new axioms) make them solvable.  Based on his work in the   field and on partial research, Koszmider conjectures that certain   combinatorial principles will provide a new method for demonstrating   unsolvability of a large collection of important problems.  These principles   could thus serve as extra axioms.  These problems arise in various parts of   mathematics, such as infinitary combilatorics, Boolean algebra, and   topology.  Koszmider plans to formalize this underlying theme and to prove   its relation to classical principles in order to use them efficiently.  ***"

We also plan to explore the problem of conjugacies of such    systems, to study random systems and invariant continua for attractors and    repellors. In the second section we plan to deal with the phase transitions of    pressure on Julia sets and integral means of Riemann maps of a simply connected    basin of attraction to a periodic stable point or rationally indifferent    periodic point. We intend to provide appropriate definitions of pressure, to    establish relations between pressure and integral means and to investigate the    phenomenon of phase transitions by means of dynamical systems and thermodynamic    formalism. We also want to explore the geometry and dynamics of equilibrium    states of Holder continuous functions. In particular we are interested in the    asymptotic behavior of of iterates of the Perron-Frobenius operator and the    sequence of random variables generated by Holder continuous functions.

He is interested in proving undecidability of fragments of  elementary theories consisting of sentences with few quantifier  alternations, in particular, for theories of classes of finite  groups, the theory of finite distributive lattices, and for the   theory of the lattice E of enumerable sets.  Interest in such fragments   arises from their containing the first-order sentences that usually occur  in mathematical practice.  Moreover, he will work toward determining the   complexity of theories of degree structures from structural complexity   theory and toward using coding methods to investigate model-theoretic  properties of the structure D of enumerable Turing degrees.  Both E and D  are central structures in computability theory.  Also using coding methods,  he intends to prove nonelementary equivalence of various degree structures  and intends to introduce a measure of the informational content of  isomorphism types of structures belonging to various classes of structures  from model theory.  In a further project, he plans to separate complexity  classes that are generalizations of deterministic and nondeterministic  linear time.       The general idea of coding is to represent objects of one kind by  objects of another kind, with a fixed decoding key used to retrieve the   information from an object of the second kind.  In this project, the   objects are certain structures from algebra, computability theory, and   model theory.  The decoding key consists of a collection of formulas  in first-order logic, a formal language which can be viewed as a   formalization of a major part of natural language within mathematics.  A   coding of a structure A in a structure B guarantees that B is at least as   complex as A.  Nies will investigate the abstract ordering on classes of all   possibly infinite structures by comparing their co mplexity and will apply   similar methods to classes of finite structures, a field which has been the  focus of interest in recent years for its connections with computer science.  In a second part of this project, coding methods will be applied to  computability theory, that part of mathematical logic which deals with  computability in the ideal sense.  Undecidable sets can vary with respect to  their computational complexity.  The goals here, beyond determining the  complexity of the associated first-order theory, are to find out the  symmetries of the structures and to find a simple characterization of these  structures.  These questions are important for deepening the understanding  of computation.  ***"

This research will contribute to developing a complete understanding of   the degree-theoretic structures associated with relative definability,  such as the global structures of the Turing degrees D and the Turing   degrees of the recursively enumerable sets R.  Missing ingredients   necessary to this understanding include determining whether the   universal-existential theory of R is decidable, characterizing when a   relation on R or D is definable within that structure, and  calculating the automorphism groups of these structures.  Secondly,   Slaman plans contributions to the proof-theoretic understanding of   second-order arithmetic.  In that context, one considers formal axiom   systems which postulate that the universe (of sets or of reals) is   closed under definable operations.  For example, one considers the   collection of axioms that states that the reals are closed under   relative computation of arithmetic definability.  Slaman plans   systematically to study the combinatorial set-theoretic properties of the   continuum in this context.  He is particularly interested in   conservation questions: When do closure properties of the continuum   have nontrivial consequences for first-order number theory?       The algebraic structure of definability is well represented by the  Turing degrees, a classification of sets of integers in which two sets   that can be computed from each other are considered equivalent.  Slaman   will study the Turing degrees in several settings, to address fundamental   questions about their critical features.  The necessity of noneffective   means, such as the existence of sets which are not computable, can also be   demonstrated proof-theoretically; this motivates Slaman's program for the   systematic investigation of the combinatorial set-theoretic properties of   the continuum (i.e., of an infinite set of size equal to that of all real   numbers).  He is particularl y interested in questions which relate the set   theory of the continuum to other important sets.  When do certain properties   of the continuum have bearing on elementary properties of the integers?  ***"

Computability in arithmetic gives rise to degree   structures, given by collections of sets of natural numbers of equal  information content.  Two related issues involved in this research are (i)   the existence of automorphisms for such structures (yielding   nondefinability results) and (ii) the decidability of fragments of their   first-order theories.  Computability in group theory involves the existence  of algorithms for deciding certain properties of finitely presented groups.   Lempp plans to determine the complexity of some of these problems in the   Kleene-Mostowski hierarchy, and to show the undecidability of related   problems for finite groups.

Lempp's   project deals with these notions, both inside his field of expertise,  computability theory, and in the connections to other areas.  As mentioned   above, computability in arithmetic classifies sets of natural numbers  according to their information content.  Lempp will investigate   the existence of transformations which preserve this content, and the  related question of deciding certain elementary properties of these sets.   In group theory the goal is to investigate the transfer of undecidable   problems from the infinite to the finite.

Included in the first area are   investigations of the structures of sets and functions ordered by different   notions of relative complexity of computation.  Particular emphasis will be   placed on the complexity structures of those sets which are effectively   enumerable, and on the most general notion of relative computability as   defined by unrestricted Turing machine computations.  Computation procedures   that place effective bounds on the access to oracle information or on the   run-time of the computations will also be investigated.  The second area   includes the study of structures representable by finite automata, decision   procedures, the analysis and development of nonmonotonic logic, concurrent   programming models, and applications of linear programming ideas and   algorithms to data structures and logic programming.  A study of the logical   and mathematical foundations of hybrid (continuous and discrete) control   theory will be conducted, as well as of the practical implementation of   algorithms.       This research project on computability is primarily concerned with  analyzing various ways of measuring the complexity of functions on the   natural numbers (0,1,2,...) and other common mathematical structures, in   terms of how hard they are to compute.  A primary goal is the study of the   relations between various notions of complexity of a function, notions   which are based on machine models of computation and other notions, such as   how hard it is to define or describe the function.  Techniques developed   here will also be applied to the study of the difficulty of proving the   existence of various mathematical objects, as well as to the relationship   between abstract proofs of existence of an object and the possibility or   difficulty of actually computing it.  Shore's project also includes   applications to logics such as (i) those designed to  model the real life   development of knowledge, taking into account the possibility  that what we think we know today will seem false tomorrow, and (ii) ones   designed to interact with real measuring devices to implement procedures to   control systems that must both react to outside stimuli and follow logical   decision procedures.  ***"

A Polish space (group) is a separable, completely metrizable topological space (group). Becker's reqearch concerns the actions of Polish groups, in connection with -- or from the point of view of -- descriptive set theory. The basic classes of definable sets are the classes of Borel, analytic and coanalytic sets. These constitute the main topic of the project, although other classes of definable sets are also considered. A major theme of the project is discovery of dichotomies of the orbit space, i.e. theorems stating that either the orbit space is ""small"" or else it contains a copy of some specific ""large"" set. The Vaught Conjecture, a famous open problem in logic concerning the number of countable models of a first order theory, asserts such a dichotomy (either this number is countable or of size the continuum). Much of the project is related to that conjecture. Becker's project employs the standard methods of descriptive set theory together with one new method, whereby the underlying topology is changed. Some of the topics in this project are considered in the presence of strong set theoretic axioms. Becker's work relates to several branches of mathematical logic, as well as to other fields of mathematics, particularly ergodic theory and operator algebras. This research, in the area called descriptive set theory, is of a fundamental kind, and deepens the understanding of exactly those sets which arise in natural ways throughout mathematics. ***"

Delzell of a continuous solution to Hilbert's seventeenth problem. The principal investigator aims to prove an analogous result for the Kochen representation of an integral-definite rational function. This requires finding an appropriate p-adic analogue to the real notion of a pre-ordering. By studying the universal theory of p-adic fields, the principal investigator and her collaborator Luc Belair think that a successful definition of ""pre-valuation"" can be found. A further goal is to study the ""fine"" p-adic spectrum, in which the structure of the sets of nth powers is added. The second project is also related to the structure of nth power sets in a p-adic field. The principal investigator and her collaborator D. Macpherson have recently defined the notion of ""P-minimality"" and have shown that a field with this property must be p-adically closed. Important further questions are to show that expansions of p-adically closed fields by analytic functions are P-minimal, and to study the differentiability of definable functions in P-minimal structures. Model theory is concerned with the study of mathematical objects which are defined by axioms. Model-theoretic algebra applies the theory to particular algebraic objects, in this case to p-adic fields. P-adic fields are number systems in which a notion of distance exists, in a way similar to that for the real number system, but in which the prime integer p plays a special role. The first problem in this research concerns a representation of certain functions of p-adic fields which reveals some of their essential properties; the question is whether this representation varies in a predictable way. The second problem, also at the heart of understanding the nature of the p-adics, asks whether the geometry of sets definable in the p-adics in first order logic has important features in com mon with the corresponding sets of real numbers. ***"
