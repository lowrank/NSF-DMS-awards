The first meeting will take place August 6-10, 2008, at the University of Denver.  The PI's are Natasha Dobrinen and  Nikolaos Galatos.<br/><br/><br/>The meeting is to rotate on a yearly basis between the following universities: New Mexico State University - Las Cruces, University of Colorado - Boulder, University of Denver, University of Kansas - Lawrence, University of Missouri - Kansas City, and University of Nebraska - Omaha.  The researchers at these universities, who form the Core Group of BLAST and who will be in turn organizing future BLAST meetings, are the following:  Richard Ball, Guram Bezhanishvili,  Natasha Dobrinen,  William Fleissner,  Nikolaos Galatos,  Eric Hall,  John Harding, Keith Kearnes,  Richard Laver, Donald Monk,  Jack Porter, Judith Roitman,  Andrzej Roslanowski, and Agnes Szendrei.<br/><br/> <br/>The conference will focus on the areas of logic in which the above researchers work: Boolean Algebra, Logic/Lattice Theory, Universal Algebra/Algebraic Logic, Set Theory, Set-theoretic Topology; thus the name BLAST.  Together, these areas form a cohesive sub-unit of logic and have strong connections with other mathematical disciplines such as Algebra, Combinatorics,  General Topology, and Mathematical Physics.  Some combinations of these areas, such as Boolean Algebra/Set Theory/Set-theoretic Topology or Algebraic Logic/Lattice Theory/Universal Algebra, have  well-established histories of drawing from and propelling each other.  More recently, applications of Set Theory to Algebraic Logic have proven fruitful.  BLAST will provide a forum for furthering research in these interdisciplinary combinations, and for developing more cross-pollination between other pairs of the research areas of BLAST.  In addition to this, the goals of BLAST include building and strengthening collaborations between Core Group members and other researchers from around the world, inviting at least one specialist from each of the six fields to give a plenary talk, and providing  a venue for graduate students and young researchers to showcase their work, interact with leading researchers, and provide exposure to other areas of logic early in their careers.<br/><br/><br/>The BLAST 2008 program includes 9 invited speakers, 4 tutorials, and 30-60 contributed talks.  There will be substantial funds designated to supporting travel and lodging for graduate students and postdocs"

The SLALM was established in 1970 to strengthen working relations between researchers in the United States and Latin America. Thanks in no small part to the success of these relations, today, mathematical logic thrives in Latin America. The region has become a significant source of graduate students and postdocs to logic programs in the United States and elsewhere.  While the amount of research activity and the number of specialized conferences that are held in the region continues to grow, the SLALM remains the largest Pan-American logic conference. <br/><br/>The first SLALM was held in Santiago, Chile, under the leadership of Abraham Robinson, who at the time was President of the Association for Symbolic Logic. The meeting included two-week minicourses followed by a week-long conference. The minicourses were taught by A. Levi (The Hebrew University), R. Sikorski (Warsaw), and J. R. Schoenfield (Duke). Subsequent SLALM's were held in Brasilia, Brazil (1972), Campinas, Brazil (1974), Santiago, Chile (1978), Bogota, Colombia (1981), Caracas, Venezuela (1983), Campinas, Brazil (1985), Paraiba, Brazil (1989), Bahia Blanca, Argentina (1992), Bogota, Colombia (1995), Caracas, Venezuela (1998), San Jose, Costa Rica (2004), and Oaxaca, Mexico (2006). <br/><br/>The meeting is sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic.  It is expected that the proceedings of the 14th SLALM will be published by a major scientific publisher. Proceedings of past symposia have been published by North-Holland (in the series Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics) and Kluwer Academic Publishers. <br/>"

The first project is to study<br/>generalizations of Hilbert's Tenth Problem. The problem in its<br/>original form asked for an algorithm to decide whether an arbitrary<br/>multivariable polynomial equation with integer coefficients has an<br/>integer solution. In 1970 Matiyasevich proved that no such algorithm<br/>exists, i.e. Hilbert's Tenth Problem is undecidable. This motivated<br/>studying analogues of this problem by considering equations and<br/>solutions in other commutative rings. The biggest open problem in the<br/>area is Hilbert's Tenth Problem over the rational numbers. The PI has<br/>proved the undecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for various<br/>function fields. These generalizations have used tools from<br/>arithmetic geometry, such as the study of rational points on elliptic<br/>curves. One research goal is to extend these results and prove<br/>undecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for the function fields for which<br/>the problem is still unresolved. The biggest open problems are<br/>function fields of one variable over an algebraically closed field.<br/>Another goal is to explore Hilbert's Tenth Problem for various<br/>subrings of number fields. The second project is to study several<br/>problems that deal with computational aspects of curves and their<br/>Jacobians. Elliptic curves and, more generally, Jacobians of curves<br/>of small genus have many applications to cryptography, and the second<br/>project focuses on these applications. One goal of the second project<br/>is to explore curves of small genus and work on constructing curves<br/>that are suitable for cryptographic purposes. The PI will also work on<br/>applications of pairings to cryptography.<br/><br/>Both projects involve studying the solutions to multivariable<br/>polynomial equations. Looking for solutions to such equations over the<br/>integers or rational numbers has a long history that goes back to<br/>ancient Greece. For the first project the investigator will study the<br/>fundamental question of whether it is possible to find a procedure<br/>that determines whether an arbitrary multivariable polynomial equation<br/>has a solution in a given number system. The second project focuses<br/>on computational aspects of certain special classes of equations that<br/>have applications to cryptography. For these applications one usually<br/>looks for solutions to these equations over finite fields.<br/><br/>"

The two main meetings of the Association, arguably the most important meetings in the field of logic, are the North American Annual Meeting and the European Summer Meeting (also known as the Logic Colloquium). The Association also meets annually at the Joint Mathematics Meetings, where it typically co-sponsors one or more events with the American Mathematical Society and/or the Mathematical Association of America, and on a rotating basis with one of the three divisions of the American Philosophical Association. ASL-sponsored meetings are held throughout the world. The Association works to ensure that its meetings and those it sponsors cover logic and its applications comprehensively, and that they represent the highest quality work being done in the field. They accordingly provide important opportunities for serious intellectual exchange, thereby serving as a stimulus to advancement of research. For graduate students in logic, the opportunity to attend any of these meetings is a vital component of their training and subsequent entry into the profession.<br/><br/><br/>The Association for Symbolic Logic is the leading international professional society for logicians, whose membership includes researchers in computer science, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. It organizes and sponsors a number of important meetings. Most prominent among these are its North American Annual Meeting and European Summer Meeting, both held annually. Recent sponsored meetings have taken place in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America. The Association has actively sought to increase the range and number of meetings that it sponsors, a particular aim of which is to embrace new and emerging fields in which logic has come to play an important role, including computer science, linguistics, and cognitive science. This project will  permit the continuation and appropriate expansion of a successful program of graduate student travel awards that the Association has administered since 1993 and that has been partially funded by NSF since 1997. The program has proved to be a highly effective means of bringing students in logic to important professional meetings at which they can meet and exchange ideas with leading logicians, as well as present papers on their original research. Approximately eighty-four percent of the awards funded by N.S.F. during the period 1998-2005 (the first N.S.F.-supported awards were made in 1998) went to students who subsequently have earned their Ph.D.'s in logic. Many of these awardees have obtained excellent postdoctoral and permanent positions. Several of the early award recipients already have served on ASL or ASL-sponsored meeting program committees and have been appointed to standing committees of the Association.

Most of the effort directed toward the study of finite structures involves asymptotic classes of finite structures, their infinite analogues (measurable structures), and robust classes of finite structures. <br/>Broadly speaking, this research has as its aim the development of a model theory for classes of finite structures that is in analogy with mainstream model theory for infinite structures. Other ongoing work involving finite models will solve a conjecture on the relative expressive power of two logics, which in particular will demonstrate that one of these logics cannot capture the polynomial time computational complexity class. The projected research devoted to problems about extensions of o-minimality concentrates on the continued development of a model theory for ordered structures of rank greater than one. Important foundational results already have been obtained and the proposed investigations build on these. Some of this work appears to have intriguing applications to preference and utility theory in mathematical economics, and possibly to other aspects of economic theory. Another aspect of the research to be undertaken dealing with extensions of o-minimality concerns questions arising from previous work on expansions of o-minimal structures whose definable open sets form an o-minimal reduct of the original structure.<br/><br/>The research outlined above has as its foundation model theory, one of the principal subfields of mathematical logic. Model theorists study properties of familiar mathematical structures that can be expressed in a formal mathematical language such as predicate logic. <br/>This distinctive point of view can provide understanding and insights into such structures that otherwise could not be easily obtained. One of the two principal aspects of the project deals with classes of finite structures, that is, classes of mathematical structures whose domain consists of a finite set. Finite structures in general are central to computer science: any database can be interpreted as a finite structure in the sense in which they are studied in here, and a particular class of finite structures called finite fields are especially important in cryptology.<br/>The second major aspect of this project focuses on structures that include and behave in significant respects like the ordered field of real numbers, that is, the real numbers together with the polynomial and algebraic functions that are studied in calculus and describe a wide range of phenomena in the physical and life sciences, as well as in the more quantitative social sciences. Research arising from the model-theoretic point of view has deepened our understanding of familiar mathematical systems in such diverse areas of the mathematical sciences as the analysis and geometry of real functions, neural nets, relational database theory, and estimation theory in statistics. Some of the most intriguing applications of the proposed research relate to and unify within a single framework both the neoclassical theory of utility in economics and contingent valuation theory that has become prominent in environmental economics, for example. During the period of the award the principal investigator also intends to continue to direct the Vassar Science Scholars Program, an academic year science and mathematics outreach program for students from a local high school with inner city demographics which he initiated and has directed since its inception.<br/>"

Many results of so-called classical mathematics are very general: They apply to a wide range of input, so to speak, and thus tend to produce a wide range of output. But one could hope that if the input is particularly well behaved in some respect, then the output would be similarly well behaved. This turns out to be true in many important cases, but usually requires new, more constructive, proofs of classical results, as well as a deeper understanding of which inputs should be regarded as well behaved. The theory of o-minimal structures on the real field, a sub-discipline of mathematical logic, has been developed in large part to deal with this issue. This has been a rapidly developing area for the last two and a half decades, with many contributions from, and cooperation between, researchers from several branches of mathematics and logic, in particular, model theory and real analytic geometry. Applications have been found in areas as diverse as theoretical economics, neural-net learning theory, and hybrid control systems, as well as in pure mathematics.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the project arises primarily as follows. It is an important goal of the program to introduce or elaborate the main themes of the program to U.S. mathematicians, and mathematicians in training, as the combination of o-minimality and real-analytic geometry is not currently widely practiced in the U.S. The direct impact of NSF funding will be the training and advancement of research of a significant number of U.S. researchers---especially junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students---who will gain the opportunity to participate in the program.<br/><br/>"

In the project Rosendal will investigate both algebraic and topological properties of these groups, such as the small index property, the Bergman property, phenomena of automatic continuity of homomorphisms and extreme amenability. The main problems investigated are to a great extent motivated by the model theoretical problem of reconstructing a countable structure from its group of automorphisms. One of the principal tools used in this connection is the automatic continuity of isomorphisms of automorphism groups, which motivated the study of the broader phenomenon of automatic continuity of arbitrary homomorphisms between classes of Polish groups. Rosendal also plans to apply these ideas to study the topological dynamics of uncountable discrete groups most notably in connection with the fixed point on metric compacta property. The study of Polish groups using the very diverse methods of several fields seems likely to promote the further integration of separate knowledge and deeper understanding of the objects considered.<br/>In a separate project, Rosendal intends to continue his work with V. Ferenczi on a question of G. Godefroy concerning the number of non-isomorphic subspaces of a non-Hilbertian Banach space. The methods that have proven useful at this moment have been highly set theoretical in nature and have reduced the problem to the case of minimal spaces. Probably more analytical tools will be of greater utility for the next steps. In connection with this, Rosendal plans to revisit Gowers' determinacy theorem and by using set theoretical tools extend its applications beyond its nominal reach of analytic sets. This should provide tools in Banach space theory not obtainable by classical geometric considerations.  <br/>Also Rosendal will pursue another ongoing project with B.D. Miller of classifying Borel transformations up to a descriptive notion of Kakutani equivalence. This is a completely parallel project to the theory of Kakutani equivalence in ergodic theory, but due to the nature of the objects, the methods used are completely descriptive set theoretical and go back to works of Glimm and Effros in operator algebra. <br/>By stressing the interconnections of mathematical logic with other domains of mathematics, Rosendal hopes to enrich both logic itself and provide new insight into objects outside of mathematical logic. The main applications of his research will be in functional analysis (Banach space theory), topological groups, and ergodic theory."

The current issues include among others rectangular Ramsey problems, in which the homogeneous sets have forms of rectangles with sides positive with respect to a suitable sigma-ideal, characterizations of sigma-ideals given by collections of measures, and canonical Ramsey theorems, in which Borel equivalence relations attain simple prescribed forms on sets positive with respect to a suitable sigma-ideal.<br/><br/>Paul Cohen invented forcing as a method for proving that various questions are unsolvable on the basis of the usual axioms for mathematics. Saharon Shelah sharpened this tool with his method of proper forcing. The method depends on complicated combinatorial ad hoc constructions of partial orders. The PI considers partial orders of a special form--those of Borel subsets of the reals positive with respect to a suitable sigma-ideal ordered by inclusion. It turns out that little generality is lost in this way, the decades of previous work on sigma-ideals in other branches of mathematics can be brought to bear on the resulting questions, and the approach is in fact provably optimal in certain important aspects.

It is a natural outgrowth of the efforts to understand and formalize the notions of algorithm and computable function undertaken in the early part of the twentieth century. It is of both pure mathematical and foundational interest, and has important connections with computer science. This project aims to further our understanding of how structure affects computability, and how computability interacts with other fundamental notions of modern mathematics and foundations of mathematics, such as randomness and proof-theoretic strength. Computability theorists have developed a highly successful theory of relative computational complexity of sets of numbers, which, in addition to its intrinsic mathematical interest, has been influential in theoretical computer science. One of the goals of this project is to continue the development of an emerging parallel theory of relative algorithmic randomness, which can act as a theoretical framework in which to consider questions such as: When should we say that an infinite set is more random than another, and what consequences does the relative randomness of sets have for their relative computational complexity?<br/>"

First, the theory of models of arithmetic, usually considered to stand somewhat apart from set theory, has several fundamental questions exhibiting a deep set-theoretic nature, and an inter-speciality approach now seems called for. The most recent advances on Scott?s problem, for example, involve a sophisticated blend of techniques from models of arithmetic and the Proper Forcing Axiom. <br/>Second, large cardinal indestructibility lies at the intersection of forcing and large cardinals, two central concerns of contemporary set-theoretic research and the core area of much of Professor Hamkins? <br/>prior work, and recent advances have uncovered a surprisingly robust new phenomenon for relatively small large cardinals. The strongly unfoldable cardinals especially have served recently as a surprisingly efficacious substitute for supercompact cardinals in various large cardinal phenomena, including indestructibility and the consistency of fragments of the Proper Forcing Axiom. Third, Professor Hamkins will investigate questions in the emerging set-theoretic focus on second and higher order features of the set-theoretic universe.<br/><br/>This research in mathematical logic and set theory concentrates on topics at the foundations of mathematics, exploring the nature of mathematical infinity and the possibility of alternative mathematical universes. Our understanding of mathematical infinity, fascinating mathematicians and philosophers for centuries, has now crystallized in the large cardinal hierarchy, and a central concern of Professor Hamkins' research will be to investigate how large cardinals are affected by forcing, the technique invented by Paul Cohen by which set theorists construct alternative mathematical universes. The diversity of these universes is astonishing, and set theorists are now able to construct models of set theory to exhibit precise pre-selected features.<br/>In his final project, Professor Hamkins will pursue research aimed at an understanding of the most fundamental relations between the universe and these alternative mathematical worlds.<br/><br/>"

The one-day conference will be the second in the series. The first NYWIMN Conference was held on December 9th, 2006 at the CUNY Graduate Center. The conference is being organized by Delaram Kahrobaei and Victoria Gitman of the NYCCT, who successfully organized the 2006 meeting. The conference will consist of invited talks by women mathematicians, a poster session by graduate and undergraduate women students, and a panel discussion of issues affecting women in mathematics. <br/><br/>The meeting will be in the fields of algebra, combinatorics, and logic, with added emphasis on interdisciplinary research and establishing connections between mathematics and computer science. The organizers will focus on the areas of combinatorial, geometric, and computational group theory, applications of model theory to algebra and combinatorics, computational complexity, and set theory. All these areas are relatively new to mathematics. They have developed in response to the deep interconnections discovered in the last century between theoretical mathematics, algorithmic processes, and formalizing our notions of information. Because these areas are so young and so wide in scope and application, the most fascinating questions still remain to be answered. These questions will determine how theoretical mathematics and the world of modern technology will reinforce each other in the near future.  The first objective of the conference is to advance our knowledge in these areas by supporting women mathematicians who work in them and promoting research collaboration among them. The second more global aim of the conference is to increase the participation of women in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The definition of AECs and the basic theorems were introduced by Shelah in the seventies. An AEC can be thought of as a semantic generalization of the class of models of a first order theory and has roots in work of Jonsson in universal algebra.  Toward the end of 2001 activity in and attention to classification theory of Abstract Elementary Classes grew substantially. <br/>The most influential event leading to the fast-growing interest in non-elementary model theory was Zilber's attempt to understand Schanuel's conjecture over the complex numbers.  Zilber introduced a natural class of models containing the complex numbers with an exponentiation-like function that satisfies Schanuel's conjecture. <br/>While this class was not manageable by first order logic, the class is an AEC which is categorical in all uncountable cardinals and shares properties with Shelah's excellent classes.<br/>In a parallel development,  Rami Grossberg and the PI  introduced the notion of tameness and studied Galois-stable AECs under this assumption.  A weaker notion than tameness appeared implicitly in Shelah's work as an internal property of categorical AECs. Grossberg and VanDieren went on to prove a special case for tame classes of the main test question in the classification theory for AECs, namely Shelah's Categoricity Conjecture.  The purpose of this investigation is to expand this program of non-elementary model theory with the effects of improving the body of knowledge of first order stability theory and developing a natural framework within which problems outside of logic, for instance in algebraic geometry, can be interpreted and better understood. <br/><br/><br/>The research proposed is in model theory, a branch of mathematical logic. A model theorist typically starts with a set of axioms (a theory) and studies the different interpretations or models of these axioms.  The ultimate goal is to classify the theories to predict the underlying structure of the models.<br/>This involves introducing new machinery such as abstract independence relations which can then be used to answer problems in other branches of mathematics. <br/>Most work in model theory has been confined to examining sets of axioms which can be expressed using first-order logic.  <br/>Since there are many natural theories in mathematics that do not admit an appropriate treatment in first-order logic, the application field of the classification theory for first-order logic has  limits.  Recent interest in non-first-order (non-elementary) examples from algebraic geometry and number theory has triggered increased involvement in Shelah's program of classification theory for non-elementary classes. The proposed research involves (1) proving an important case of the main test-question in the classification theory for non-elementary classes (Shelah's Categoricity Conjecture) and (2) developing a stability theory for the general non-elementary context of tame AECs, while (3) facilitating under-represented group participation in mathematics.<br/><br/><br/>"

The fundamental question is to estimate the topological complexity of a definable set in terms of the structural complexity of its defining formula.  Recent developments in algorithmic real algebraic geometry and topological o-minimality suggest that an answer to that question can be obtained for a wide class of sets definable in o-minimal structures with the Bezout-type finiteness property. Notably, a combinatorial-geometric construction suggested by A. Gabrielov and N. Vorobjov allows one to approximate arbitrary definable sets by homotopy equivalent definably compact sets, simplifying considerably the study of their topology. Furthermore, homotopy colimit construction allows one to approximate a set defined by a formula with existential quantifiers by a homotopy equivalent simplicial object defined by a quantifier-free formula, and to employ the descent spectral sequence to compute topological invariants of the original set.  The proposed research will advance our understanding of the topological properties of the sets definable in o-minimal structures, and of the algorithmic complexity of operations with such sets and their families. It will provide new tools for the o-minimal algebraic topology.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to develop new upper bounds on the topological complexity of semialgebraic sets (defined by formulas with equations and inequalities between polynomials in several real variables)and their generalizations known as definable sets in o-minimal structures.  Given an appropriate measure of complexity, such as Bezout theorem bounding the number of zeros of a polynomial, the topological complexity of a definable set depends on the structural complexity of its defining formula.  Recently A. Gabrielov and N. Vorobjov suggested a construction replacing a general definable set with a homotopy equivalent compact set, applying a simple combinatorial procedure to the defining formula of the original set.  Thus the problem of the topological complexity of the general definable sets can be reduced to the more tractable problem for the compact sets.  The proposed research will establish new connections between o-minimal theory, topology, combinatorics, and real algebraic geometry.  It will provide new combinatorial and topological tools for development of faster computational algorithms in real algebraic and analytic geometry and its applications in control theory, visualization, and computer-aided design."

All of the Cholak's projects are motivated by the goal of understanding the relationship between computability and definability.  For example, Cholak studies automorphisms of the computably enumerable sets.  Take two computably enumerable sets A and B; if they are in the same orbit then A and B satisfy the same infinitary formulas.  Conversely, if A and B satisfy the same infinitary formulas then A and B are in the same orbit.  One of the structures that Cholak will continue to explore is the collection of all computably enumerable sets with the inclusion relation. In addition, Cholak will study what is definable in the collection of all effective closed classes of reals under inclusion and also under Medvedev reducibility which is defined via Turing reducibility.  Cholak is also in engaged in other projects involving reverse mathematics and various models of second-order arithmetic, computable structure theory, and effective measure theory and randomness.<br/><br/>Cholak works in the area of mathematical logic called computability theory. The central theme in computability theory is the relationship between Turing machines and definability.  Informally, a Turing machine is a computer with unlimited time and memory.  We say a natural number x is accepted by a Turing machine if the Turing machine halts with input x. We say a subset A of the natural numbers is computably enumerable iff there is a Turing machine that accepts x iff x is in A.  A set R is computable iff A and its complement are computably enumerable.  For Cholak, definability or expressibility means formulas, mainly in first-order logic, although many times we will have to move to stronger logics.  The classical result of Post in arithmetic relating computability and definability is that the computably enumerable sets are the sets that can be defined by a formula of the form ""there exists a number x such that some computable relation hold of x."

One topic in this class of problems concerns the problem of producing a model of Choice with the same ordinal cardinalities as some inner model of determinacy. Another concerns the question of whether the minimal model containing the reals, the ordinals and one ultrafilter on the the integers collapses any non-ordinal cardinals in the minimal inner model containing the reals and the ordinals.<br/>Related problems concern forcing-absoluteness for models of Choice, determinacy for games of uncountable length, and properties of the nonstationary ideal on the first uncountable cardinal.<br/><br/>Set theory provides a foundation for mathematics, in that the axioms of set theory aim to describe the universe of mathematical concepts. Many set theorists study questions which are not resolved by the standard axioms for set theory, in hope of finding the right extension of these axioms. Developments in the study of such possible extensions have had a dramatic foundational impact in the last twenty years, affecting many areas of mathematics, and even philosophy.  The PI works on the border between some of the more technical, inward-directed areas of set theory and more classical areas with connections to other fields.

The strength of a randomness notion can be increased by allowing more complicated tests, where the complexity of a test is measured in terms of the aforementioned hierarchies. A basic result due to Reimann and Slaman established that for any natural number there are only countably many reals not random for any continuous probability measure. One goal of the project is to find a topological or measure-theoretic characterization of these countable sets. Furthermore, Reimann will try to extend the results obtained for arithmetical randomness to higher notions of randomness, i.e. to tests having access to projective parameters, proving co-countability and correlating it with large cardinals in set theory. An essential tool for realizing these objectives is the construction of a measure relative to which a given real is random. The project aims at finding new ways to do this, in particular it investigates how methods from measure theory and analysis can be used. Finally, the principal investigator will study the relation between randomness for probability measures and non-finite measures, most prominently Hausdorff measures. Previous results indicate an intriguing difference between the two concepts with respect to computability theoretic hierarchies.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Randomness is a fundamental mathematical phenomenon whose understanding and investigation is one of the prime achievements of mathematics, and science in general, in the 20th century. Classical measure and probability theory do not allow for considering individual random objects, such as the outcome of a sequence (finite or infinite) of coin tosses. The theory of algorithmic randomness, as developed by Kolmogorov, Martin-Loef, Levin, and others, provides a uniform framework for defining such individual random content in a spectrum that spans from finite words to transfinite cardinals. It is inherent in our understanding of randomness that random objects should exhibit a rather high complexity, usually phrased as unpredictability or presence of chaos. Twentieth century logic, on the other hand, has put forth numerous hierarchies that capture the complexity of an object such as an infinite binary sequence with respect to its descriptive complexity, i.e. how hard it is to define or compute this object in a given mathematical theory such as first or second order arithmetic.  <br/>Reimann's main goal is to study<br/>how logical complexity and randomness are intertwined. Previous research has shown that certain levels of logical complexity imply the presence of random content. The understanding of this relation, however, is far from complete. Among the principal questions Reimann tries to answer are: How is the the presence of randomness related to the definability strength of large cardinals? Are there other ways to capture the presence of random content within the hierarchies of logical complexity? Can in turn the logical complexity help to distinguish between randomness for different kinds of measures?<br/>"
