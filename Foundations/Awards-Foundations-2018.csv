In recent years there has been increasing interest in the relatively new field of descriptive dynamics in which tools from these areas combine to study problems of common interest to these subjects. A particular focus is to study the structure of certain natural mathematical objects which occur as definable equivalence relations on the reals. These objects greatly generalize the objects of traditional study in descriptive set theory, and also extend naturally the objects, dynamical systems, studied in dynamics. The focus of this project is to use recently developed, cross-disciplinary techniques to study some of the fundamental properties of these objects. There are several important open questions for which the new techniques seem promising, and with which we can benchmark progress. Further progress in this area will lead to a better understanding of these areas of mathematics and their connections.<br/><br/>A major focus of the proposal concerns the combinatorics of countable Borel equivalence relations. These are the relations generated by the Borel actions of countable groups. A natural plan of study is to proceed by increasing complexity of the group generating the relation. Even for relatively simple groups, the combinatorics of their group actions is interesting. As an example, recent methods allow for a computation of both the continuous and Borel chromatic numbers of free Bernoulli shifts by finitely generated abelian groups. There have also been recent developments to extend the proposers' result that all actions of countable abelian groups are hyperfinite to countable nilpotent groups (Schneider and Seward) and to some solvable, non-nilpotent groups (Conley, Jackson, Marks, Seward, and Tucker-Drob). The proofs show an interesting interplay between the properties of the equivalence relations and the combinatorial structure of complete sections in the relation. The project seeks to explore this interplay and to extend the current methods and results to actions of more general groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
"1762648","Computing with Positive Information: Definability and Structure of Enumeration Degrees","DMS","FOUNDATIONS","06/01/2018","02/28/2020","Mariya Soskova","WI","University of Wisconsin-Madison","Standard Grant","Tomek Bartoszynski","05/31/2023","$159,517.00","","soskova@wisc.edu","21 N PARK ST STE 6301","MADISON","WI","537151218","6082623822","MPS","1268","","$0.00","Turing degrees are used to measure how difficult it is to determine whether an arbitrary number is a member of a given set of natural numbers. This measure can be extended to capture the effective content of other objects in mathematics, such as real numbers. In other cases, Turing reducibility is not sufficient. For example, it is known to be impossible to assign a Turing degree to every continuous function on the unit interval. In that and many other cases, an extension of Turing reducibility, enumeration reducibility, turns out to provide a better framework for constructive mathematics. However, enumeration degrees have not been as thoroughly investigated as Turing degrees. The goal of this project is to expand understanding of the structure of enumeration degrees and their relationship to Turing degrees. The project aims to develop new methods, investigate combinatorial properties of the structure, and isolate special classes of degrees that determine the logical character of the structure, with a special focus on first-order definability. Constructive mathematics, specifically algebra and topology, will be the source for such classes. The project aims to utilize the intimate interplay between the partial orders of the Turing degrees and the enumeration degrees to extract new information in both directions.<br/><br/>A major open problem in degree theory asks if the structure of the Turing degrees is rigid. This problem is strongly connected to a possible classification of the first-order definable relations on the Turing degrees. Prior work has established a link between this problem and the rigidity problem for the enumeration degrees: if the Turing degrees are rigid then so are the enumeration degrees. The rigidity of the enumeration degrees, while still open, can turn out to be more approachable. The investigator and collaborators have established the first-order definability of a series of relations on the structure of the enumeration degrees via natural structural relations. An important goal of this project is to continue this line of investigation, building an arsenal of first-order definable relations on the enumeration degrees and bringing us closer to a solution to the rigidity problem for the enumeration degrees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our knowledge of the mathematical universe comes through deduction from axioms. This knowledge is inherently incomplete, and there is a wide range of questions that cannot be decided from the standard axioms. Set theorists have developed and studied additional axioms that allow settling some of these questions. These axioms are broadly divided into two types: Large cardinal axioms, and forcing axioms. The large cardinal axioms form a natural hierarchy ordered by axiomatic strength. Forcing axioms have applications outside set theory. This project involves the development of new forcing axioms primarily meant to deal with questions related to the second uncountable cardinal, methods for applications of these axioms, the theory of large cardinal axioms primarily at the level of strength expected to be connected to the new forcing axioms (the level of supercompact cardinals), and other applications of large cardinal axioms at this strength, primarily to questions of infinitary combinatorics. While there has been a large body of work on forcing axioms related to the first uncountable cardinal, analogous forcing axioms related to the second uncountable cardinal were only discovered recently. Similarly the theory of large cardinal axioms at the level of supercompact cardinals is only now beginning to come into focus. This project will obtain results in these emerging subjects, develop methods that open these subjects to broader research, and aim to apply them to some long standing open problems.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This project deals with several central areas in set theory: (i) forcing axioms and their applications; (ii) inner models theory; and (iii) infinitary combinatorics. Forcing axioms are strengthenings of the Baire category theorem that allow meeting a prescribed number of dense sets with filters in prescribed classes of partial orders. In connection with (i) this project is particularly concerned with higher analogues of the proper forcing axiom (PFA). PFA, developed in the early 1980s, allows meeting aleph_1 dense sets in proper partial orders. It has proved incredibly useful both as a starting point for consistency proofs and as an axiom leading to set theoretic structure theorems. Recent work of the PI shows that there are analogues of PFA which involve meeting more than aleph_1 dense sets. Separately, the PI developed new reflection principles at aleph_2. It is one of the goals of this project to combine the higher analogues of PFA with these reflection principles, and use the new resulting axioms to extend applications of PFA to new contexts. The inner models program has as its main goal the construction of models for large cardinal axioms from assumptions that do not directly involve large cardinals (for example from forcing axioms). In connection with (ii), this project is primarily concerned with the theory of inner models at the level of supercompact cardinals. In connections with (iii) this project is primarily concerned with the tree property, a remnant of large cardinal strength that can consistently hold at small cardinals. One of the goals of the project is to obtain it simultaneously at all successors in increasingly large intervals of cardinals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They often appear as the set of symmetries of a geometric object, for example, of 3-dimensional space, a molecule or a crystal. Oftentimes, the set of symmetries themselves, i.e., the group, has a natural topological structure. That is, one can speak of one symmetry being close to another, as in the case of two rotations of 3-dimensional space being close if they differ by a small angle. These latter groups are called topological transformation groups and are trivially related to geometry via the geometric object of which they are the set of symmetries. However, other topological groups are not so easily viewed as coming from geometry. This is, for example, the case for the systems of solutions to many differential equations which form a group under addition called a Banach space. However, one of the principal ideas of the present project is that all topological groups have natural intrinsic geometric structure which is defined jointly by their topological and algebraic structure. Moreover, this geometric structure can in many cases provide significant insight into the structure of the group by blotting out finer details that obscure the global or large scale properties of the group.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to investigate the coarse geometry of topological and, in particular, Polish groups. In earlier research, the PI has established and investigated a natural coarse structure that every topological group is equipped with and which coincides with that traditionally studied on finitely generated or locally compact groups, Banach spaces or even homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds. Particularly interesting subclasses to be studied are the Polish groups of bounded geometry for which the geometric structure theory is well-advanced. Several interesting questions on the extent of this class of groups remain open, for example, whether every Polish group of bounded geometry is coarsely equivalent to a locally compact group. The research program is by nature interdisciplinary. While its origins lie in descriptive set theory, the main examples of groups to be studied arise in various disciplines of mathematics, including functional analysis, logic, and geometric and differential topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

He asked whether the properties of his integral are really fundamental and follow from more familiar integral axioms.  The class of amenable groups was introduced and studied by von Neumann in 1929, and he explained why a paradox appeared only in dimensions greater or equal to three. In the 1940s the amenability theory shifted into the field of functional analysis.  Currently amenability theory appears in many fields of mathematics, most notably in operator algebras, functional analysis, ergodic theory, probability theory, and harmonic analysis.<br/><br/>The core part of the project is based on the recent technique used by PI to prove that certain groups are amenable. PI plans to develop this technique in a more conceptual way using random walks on Schreier graphs. There are several classes of groups to which the technique can potentially be applied. They include Thompson group F, interval exchange transformation group, topological full group of abelian groups. The expected impact of the project is to give deeper understanding of analytic properties of the group actions and relate them to other fields. One of the central impact of this proposal is through its educational goals, in particular, in organizing of several summer schools and workshops.

This dual algebraic/geometric view is applied in many branches of mathematics, especially for the study of algebraic equations involving numbers (under the name of Diophantine geometry), the study of solutions to polynomial equations (under the name of algebraic geometry), or the study of the possible algebraic relations among solutions to systems of differential or difference equations (under the names of differential algebraic geometry or difference algebraic geometry,  respectively), among others. In practice, some of the questions considered in these areas suffer from extreme complexity inherited from their connection to number theory or to even more complicated domains. Work in mathematical logic has elucidated the boundary between those complicated theories and those admitting a tame, geometric theory. This research project aims to extend the class of theories for which a tame geometry can be established and to use these results from mathematical logic to answer questions from the target domains. <br/><br/>This research project studies the connections between geometries of various kinds, including algebraic, differential, Diophantine, and analytic geometries, through the model-theoretic lens of definability in suitable theories.

Areas of mathematics with physical applications tend to appear in the low levels of the corresponding complexity hierarchy. Passing to higher levels of complexity enables mathematicians to make connections between different areas of mathematics, and to develop productive general theories. There is a corresponding division of the universe of mathematics into an absolute part, where natural questions tend to be resolved by the standard axioms, and a more abstract part where extensions of the standard axiom system are needed to resolve many fundamental questions. The main focus of Larson's research is the relationship between these parts. The technical machinery involved in this project includes Cohen's forcing technique, axioms asserting the existence of winning strategies in infinite games, and axioms asserting the existence of infinite objects whose existence cannot be proved from the standard axioms for mathematics. These techniques originate in set theory, which serves as the most commonly accepted foundations for mathematics. Larson's work applies them to other areas, including model theory, topology and analysis. Larson hopes to make progress with this approach on several longstanding well-known open problems.<br/><br/>One aspect of Larson's work concerns forcing over models of determinacy to produce canonical models. Woodin's Pmax forcing, when applied to a model of determinacy, produces a model which is maximal for subsets of the set of countable ordinals. One project, initiated by Woodin, and continued by Larson in collaboration with other researchers, is the extent to which this maximality can be made to hold for larger cardinals. Another product, largely in collaboration with Jindrich Zapletal, converts a number of classical ZFC constructions into partial orders, which when applied to determinacy models produce models of fragments of the Axiom of Choice. This approach has resolved a number of classical questions about the relationship between forms of the Axiom of Choice, but may also be able to shine light on newer problems in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Other aspects of the project include a new approach to Vaught's Conjecture, one of the oldest problems in model theory, and the study of the notion of universally measurability, a fundamental concept from analysis which is still not well understood. Finally, Larson is working on a book on unpublished work of W.H. Woodin, on extensions of the Axiom of Determinacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a body of work designing procedures for computing certain functions, and there is work designing useful approximation procedures for other functions.  There are many real-world functions (involving population, revenue, location of objects in space or events in time, etc.) that we can know only through approximations.  Knight is particularly interested in computability and computable approximation in number systems and other algebraic structures.  Traditionally, computability theory has dealt with countable objects.  However, important algebraic structures such as the field of real numbers are uncountable.  Some of the problems that interest Knight involve computability in uncountable structures.                      <br/><br/>With Karen Lange and Reed Solomon, Knight is trying to measure the complexity of the process of finding roots of polynomials in fields of generalized power series.  Some of the ideas go back to Newton.  With Uri Andrews, Knight is interested in the problem of when an elementary first order theory that is well-behaved from the point of view of model theory has a computable model.  Andrews and Knight have a result for ""strongly minimal"" theories, with conditions on the complexity of fragments of the theory guaranteeing that the countable models all have computable copies.  For some cases, the models are produced by ""workers"" constructions, involving nested approximations.  Knight is interested in applying the techniques of computability to uncountable structures.  There are different approaches.  Some involve changing the definition of what is computable.  Noah Schweber defined a reducibility that allows us to compare the computing power of structures of arbitrary cardinality, using the standard computability notions.  The idea is to collapse cardinals so that the structures being compared become countable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Systems of such equations describe or model behavior and phenomena throughout the sciences; epidemiology, population dynamics, mechanics etc. The project will use methods from model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, to develop or improve procedures for showing consistency (existence of solutions) of systems of such equations, for identifying auxiliary parameters in systems of such equations, and for eliminating unknowns from such systems. The project will also extend the existing classification of sets of solutions from the case of over-determined (or finite-dimensional) systems to under-determined (or infinite-dimensional systems). <br/><br/>In this focused research group project, the team of researchers studies differential, difference, and differential-difference equations, from the point of view of model theory in the sense of mathematical logic. Among the aims is to provide decision procedures or improve existing decision procedures regarding consistency and elimination. Applications to a variety of modelling problems for physical systems are expected. The proposed research is threefold. The first is to develop efficient algorithms in cases where the existing methods from theories of differential or difference fields provide algorithms in principle. The second is to extend the existing model-theoretic classification of finite-dimensional solution spaces of systems to infinite-dimensional solution spaces, as well as developing methods to apply the classification in practice. The third is to introduce and study new first order theories of rings with operators, whose decision procedures will apply to new examples arising in applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical theories that cannot be decided within ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs) are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. Thus LCAs pursue Godel's program in set theory. How can one test for ""correctness"" of an LCA? The inner model program, a major program in modern set theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a correct theory). This research project contributes to the inner model program by advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various extensions of ZFC. <br/><br/>The project focuses on studying the connections between inner models, sets of reals, hybrid structures (such as hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of determinacy models), forcing, and strong combinatorial principles (such as the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), (generalizations of) the tree property, the Unique Branch Hypothesis (UBH)). This research project aims to advance the basic theory of hybrid structures, as well as developing methods for the core model induction beyond its current state. In particular, the project aims to make advancements in answering two fundamental questions in descriptive inner model theory: (1) Is HOD of a determinacy model fine-structural (e.g. do the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) and various square principles hold in HOD)? (2) What is the consistency strength of PFA?"

This conference is the 13th in a series of conferences run as Computability, Complexity and Randomness (CCR), which deal with problems at the interface of mathematics and computer science where the notion of randomness plays a central role. Although randomness is a primitive notion in probability theory, this alone does not help to determine when an individual mathematical object can be considered as random for a given application. It does not help either to understand how applications will behave on individual random inputs. Also one may require the notion of randomness relative to different models of computation, and possibly consider randomness in a grey scale down to notions of anti-randomness. Another main question is how to define, and perhaps construct, explicit instances of random objects. These problems meet at classical computability theory, computational complexity theory, probability theory, information theory and the theory of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This CCR conference will continue to disseminate the expertise that has been rapidly developing in the area and foster new collaborations. CCR 2018 will be held at the Mathematics Department of Universidad Andres Bello, which is associated to the internationally recognized Center for Mathematical Modeling (CMM) of the University of Chile.

This object might be a single algebraic structure or a class of structures that share a common description (theory). In this project, the PI will study the phenomenon of pseudo-finiteness, in which every (finite) fragment of the description of an infinite object also describes a finite object -- even while the full description captures only infinite structures. In recent years, pseudo-finiteness has been exploited to prove theorems in finitary discrete mathematics and additive combinatorics. On the other hand, pseudo-finiteness has only been completely characterized in a small number of settings. Ax's characterization of pseudo-finite fields is probably the best known. Here, the PI intends to give such a characterization of pseudo-finiteness for theories that are ""purely non-algebraic"" -- theories that arise from classes of structures that are specifically of interest in discrete mathematics, such as classes of graphs and regular hypergraphs. In the very long term, one might expect to see applications of this research in network analysis, treating very large networks (i.e. graphs) like the internet and the human brain.<br/><br/>Here are some more technical details. The project provides a detailed study of the phenomenon of pseudo-finiteness in what is called ""combinatorial theories"" -- countably-categorical theories with quantifier elimination and trivial algebraic closure operation. Such theories correspond immediately to commonly studied classes of finite structures from discrete mathematics, such as graphs (directed and undirected) and regular hypergraphs. In practice, it is quite difficult, if not impossible, to construct pseudo-finite combinatorial theories without appealing to probability theory in apparently essential ways: either the constructed theory is itself obtained from a 0,1-law or it is some sort of limit of such theories. Upon determining exactly what the appropriate limit processes are, the PI plans to show that this is, in fact, the only way to construct pseudo-finite combinatorial theories. A proof of this sort of claim will require a more or less complete understanding of 0,1-laws in this setting -- especially, connections and equivalences between conditional independence and higher amalgamation properties in classes of finite structures. In turn, this analysis seems to require deep exploration of connections between model theory, on one hand, and (for example) functional analysis and measure-theoretic probability on the other. Capturing pseudo-finite theories as limits of almost-sure theories will require development of an extensive technology for selecting/extracting well-behaved sub-classes inside of a given class of finite structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is well-known that the results of this study are incomplete, and may lead to statements which cannot be decided from the fundamental principles of mathematics (the ZFC axioms). Set theory is a field of mathematical logic which provides tools to analyze the consistency of mathematical statements. The systematic approach by which consistency results are obtained comes through the construction of alternative mathematical universes in which the consistency of various statements can be examined and validated. This project deals with several such construction methods. It aims to develop new methods to address several important problems in infinitary combinatorics, and to study existing methods and their limitations. <br/><br/>The main objects of study are (i) algebras in set theory; (ii) diamond sequences, (iii) the Mitchell order; and (iv) inner models of hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD). In connection with (i), the project aims to study different notions of singular stationary, which were introduced by Foreman and Magidor, and make advancements in answering questions regarding Jonsson algebras. In connection with (ii), the project addresses diamond type principles and their interaction with compactness principles and cardinal arithmetic assumptions.  In connection with (iii), the project aims to study the connection between forcing theory and inner model theory by studying problems concerning the consistency strength of various Mitchell order structures. In connection with (iv), the project aims to study the extent to which HOD is close to the set-theoretic universe V, and address the HOD-conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
