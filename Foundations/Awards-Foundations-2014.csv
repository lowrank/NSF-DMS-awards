The SLALM is the largest inter-American meeting in mathematical logic. It was established in 1970 to strengthen working relations between logicians in the United States and Latin America. Thanks in no small part to the success of these relations, today, mathematical logic thrives in Latin America. While the amount of research activity and the number of specialized conferences of international prestige that are held in the region continues to grow, the SLALM remains the largest inter-American logic conference. Since inception, the SLALM's have been organized in the form of a working conference preceded by a series of training tutorials aimed at students. The tutorials, the plenary talks, and the special sessions aim to represent major areas of mathematical logic. The SLALM has a strong tradition of being a student-focused event. The tutorials that precede the conference are attended by students from Latin America, the United States, and Canada. For the US students, the SLALM is a unique opportunity to attend lectures and tutorials given by some of the world's top logicians. The meeting is sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic. Abstracts of the talks have been published in the Bulletin of Symbolic, one of the three official journals of the Association."

He will concentrate on problems coming from descriptive inner model theory and will work on advancing the theory of hod mice. The long term goal of the project is to prove the Mouse Set Conjecture, which is a central conjecture in descriptive inner model theory. Immediate goals include advancing the core model induction technique beyond its current levels, and computing better consistency lower bounds for the failure of  square at a measurable cardinal. <br/><br/>Mathematics is the language of science; it is what is used to express scientific predictions and theories. Mathematics is simply the most fundamental and indispensable part of science. However, just as scientific achievements must be tested for their validity, mathematical discoveries too must be tested for their consistency. Mathematical theories are based on axioms known as the axioms of Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Provided that the proofs from ZFC and its various extensions are correct, it is believed that the resulting theories are correct. Set theory is the part of mathematics that deals with the consistency of ZFC and its extensions via Large Cardinal Axioms (LCA). Because of the celebrated Godel's incompleteness theorem one cannot hope to prove that ZFC or any of its extensions are consistent. Nevertheless, one can hope to provide naturally occurring models for ZFC + LCA in the same spirit that the set of natural numbers is the natural model of the axioms of Peano Arithmetic (PA). PA is the axiomatic system that guides and controls the usage of arithmetic in everyday life. The inner model program is a set theoretic program whose primary goal is to construct such canonical models for ZFC + LCA. The proposed project is a contribution to the inner model program. One specific objective of the proposed project is to advance the most successful recent method for constructing natural models for various extensions of ZFC, the core model induction, to new levels, and thus to construct natural models for extensions of ZFC that were unreachable before."

Techniques of modern mathematical logic, in combination with more specialized tools from other branches of mathematics, make it possible to analyze the scope and limitations of such classifications and reveal a wealth of additional structure.  The techniques of mathematical logic also provide a broad perspective on combinatorial problems. Here one must first separate the ""chaotic"" problems which cannot be neatly categorized and identify the subclass of more tractable problems, looking ultimately for an algorithm to carry out this part of the analysis at a completely general level.  This research project investigates such classification problems.  In particular, issues of computability are an essential component of the program.  The research is interdisciplinary, establishing new relationships between mathematical logic and classical mathematics.<br/><br/>This award supports a group research project.  Using methods of topological dynamics, combinatorial group theory, model theory, and algebra, the two investigators will investigate a variety of classification problems in analysis, algebra, and combinatorics. Simon Thomas will combine these methods with modern descriptive set theory to analyze classification problems in algebra, particularly those associated with representation theory and the subject of ""invariant random subgroups"" in the sense of Vershik, while Gregory Cherlin will pursue joint work with visitor Saharon Shelah on the existence of universal graphs with forbidden subgraphs and the associated structural Ramsey theory, as well as the classification of all metrically homogeneous graphs and analogous problems for finite permutation groups. A further component of the project is an active visitor's program under the direction of Shelah when he is in residence at Rutgers."

These areas include field theory, commutative and differential algebra, model theory, and number theory, as well as the possibility of describing uncountable structures and studying them effectively.  Traditional computability theory examines the capabilities of digital computers and the limits on the problems which can be solved using such computers.  Since the pioneering work of Alan Turing, it has been known that many problems cannot be solved by any digital computer running any program whatsoever.  Even these ""noncomputable"" problems can be ranked by difficulty, however: problem A is easier (or at least, no more difficult) than problem B if we can show how a hypothetical program solving B would allow us to solve A as well.  Indeed, in certain cases we can learn whether a particular problem is computable or not by determining where related noncomputable problems sit in this hierarchy.  Recently, the PI has made contributions ranging from solutions to concrete problems about deciding whether certain polynomial equations can be satisfied using rational numbers, to more abstract questions about the difficulty of solving algebraic differential equations and the relative difficulty of considering structures from different areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>The PI recently collaborated with several number theorists to produce new evidence for the undecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for the rational numbers, the problem which asks for an algorithm to decide which Diophantine equations have rational solutions.  He plans to continue this work, considering the specific question of subrings of the rationals of density 0 (i.e., ""very close"" to the integers).  In field theory, he has made substantial progress, both by asking and answering natural computable-model-theoretic questions about the difficulty of computing isomorphisms between fields, and also by using computability theory to answer general questions about the complexity of fields in relation to the complexity of other mathematical structures. He hopes to address a key question in differential algebra, whose solution would help mathematicians better understand differentially closed fields and solutions to differential equations. (These are analogous to algebraically closed fields, but are much less well understood at present.)  For some years now he has taken the lead in introducing computability techniques to researchers throughout mathematics, and has often been able to interest such people in his questions and his methods.  With this grant, those efforts will most certainly continue."

The traditional view of this program has been that of an increment program with progress measured by a progression up the hierarchy of large cardinals. It is now known that this view is not correct. A critical transition occurs at the level of exactly one supercompact cardinal, and in solving the Inner Model Problem for this specific large cardinal axiom, one solves the Inner Model Problem for essentially all known large cardinal axioms. The solution must necessarily yield an ultimate enlargement of Godel's inner model L. This  Ultimate-L must closely approximate the parent universe V within which it is constructed. Though the detailed construction of Ultimate-L is open, the axiom, ``V = Ultimate-L'',  can be precisely formulated and its consequences explored even now. One can also precisely specify a conjecture which would be the final outcome of the construction of Ultimate-L. This is the Ultimate-L Conjecture. This conjecture is closely related to several other conjectures and these collectively are the focus of this research proposal.<br/><br/>The mathematical study of Infinity is the focus of Set Theory. This subject began on the basis of principles isolated by Cantor and then elaborated on by others. By the early part of the 20th century the basic Zermelo-Frankel Axioms had been isolated and these axioms together with the Axiom of Choice are the ZFC axioms. The ZFC axioms define the current conception of (mathematical) Infinity. The seminal discoveries of the latter half of the 20th century showed that most of the fundamental questions asked about infinite sets are unsolvable on the basis of the ZFC axioms. Famous among these unsolvable questions is that of Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis which by the middle of the 20th century was widely regarded as one of the most important questions of mathematics.  This proposal focuses on the Ultimate-L Project. This project if successful will isolate (for the first time) an extension of the ZFC axioms that will resolve essentially all of these otherwise unsolvable questions (including that of the Continuum Hypothesis) and provide a framework for reducing all questions of Set Theory to questions of the existence of large infinite sets--these are the so called Axioms of Strong Infinity.  The new approach arises from a series of recent results which show that such an extension of the ZFC axioms might actually exist."

Recently, the paper of Kechris, Pestov, and Todorcevic connecting Ramsey theory with topological dynamics led to the recent boom in research regarding applications of Ramsey theory applied to finding minimal flows; and the recent book of Todorcevic on Ramsey Spaces has prepared a path for a surge in progress on Ramsey theory.

It will serve as a unifying point for the subject of infinitary Ramsey theory and increase future collaborations.    It will also provide entry to the field for young researchers with diverse backgrounds.  As such, the field of infinitary Ramsey theory will be strengthened, very likely speeding up the rate of progress in this area and areas in which it is applied.

But given a particular theorem, can we specify precisely which axioms are needed to derive it? This is a natural question, and also an ancient one: over 2000 years ago, the Greek mathematicians were asking it about Euclid's geometry. Reverse mathematics is an area of mathematical logic that offers a modern approach to this kind of question, by classifying mathematical theorems according to their logical strength. This offers a deeper insight into the fundamental ideas and methods needed to prove a given theorem. More precisely, reverse mathematics provides a framework in which to compare and contrast results from disparate areas of mathematics, which helps elucidate the underpinnings of various branches of the mathematical sciences, and thereby leads to a better understanding of mathematics and its applications.<br/><br/>A striking fact repeatedly demonstrated in this area is that the vast majority of mathematical propositions can be classified into one of a small number of categories. But for some very important and fundamental theorems this is not the case. Dzhafarov's research focuses on theorems of this ?irregular"" type, including Ramsey's theorem, various equivalents of the axiom of choice, and principles arising from certain problems in cognitive science. In this project, Dzhafarov will work to achieve a greater understanding of the complexities of these ""irregular"" theorems, to find new examples of such theorems from previously unexplored areas of mathematics, and to apply the reverse mathematics analysis to questions from outside of mathematics. This will be facilitated by the application of methods from computability theory and proof theory, and by the addition of ideas from various collaborations across a number of areas of pure and applied mathematics, as well as interactions with members of the multidisciplinary University of Connecticut logic group."

For example, Gödel and Cohen showed that the Continuum Hypothesis (that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers) is independent of this axiom system. Since then, a long standing project in set theory has been to find the ""right"" strengthening of the axioms. There are several candidates, and this project contributes to understanding of the nature of these extensions. <br/><br/>This project explores various aspects of combinatorial set theory. The main goal is to investigate the interplay between large cardinals, forcing, and principles such as square, the tree property, and Shelah's theory of possible cofinalities and their applications to singular combinatorics. The work is part of a project to determine the canonical structures that exist at singular cardinals and their successors in extensions of ZFC by large cardinals or strong forcing axioms. The long term goal is understanding what is possible relative to large cardinals, what can be obtained as remnants of large cardinals, and developing the theory of certain forcing posets. Forcing is used to test both the power and limitations of these strengthenings of ZFC, and combinatorial principles like the tree property provide the key test questions."

Besides being an interesting subject in its own right, model theory has had major impacts on almost every other branch of mathematics.  In this project, we focus on applications of model theory to operator algebras, that is, various subalgebras of the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are closed under adjoint and are closed in various topologies.  The union of model theory and operator algebras has already proven to be fruitful and we plan on continuing the emerging evolution of model-theoretic methods in operator algebras.  We also plan to continue our work in using nonstandard analysis to solve questions in diverse areas of mathematics, including infinite-dimensional Lie theory, topological graph theory, and combinatorial number theory.  Nonstandard analysis takes advantage of idealized elements to replace limiting processes and offers new insights into difficult problems.<br/><br/>The study of operator algebras originally began as a rigorous mathematical formulation for studying various phenomena in quantum physics.  A Hilbert space is a space consisting of vectors that can be added and multiplied by scalars and for which a notion of angle makes sense.  An operator on a Hilbert space is a continuous transformation of the Hilbert space that respects the addition and scalar multiplication; operators can themselves be added and multiplied and there is also a notion of an adjoint of an operator, which in some sense is akin to taking a matrix and taking its transpose.  An operator algebra is a collection of operators on a Hilbert space that is closed under addition, scalar multiplication and adjoint and is closed under taking limits in a suitable sense.  Understanding the properties of various kinds of operator algebras and attempting to classify them has been an important venture in functional analysis for over half a century.  In this project, we propose to continue the use of techniques from logic to study operator algebras and their model-theoretic properties, that is, the properties they possess that can be expressed in logical terms."

The goal of the Center is two-fold:  first, to provide students at the undergraduate and graduate level with the necessary mathematical background so they can understand and appreciate recent developments in mathematical research.   This is accomplished through a series of mini-courses taught by leading researchers, who aim their lectures at the appropriate level.  The second goal is to broadly disseminate current advances in these areas by hosting a conference in the final week of the program.   The Center also seeks to increase the diversity of the mathematical work force by actively recruiting underrepresented groups to attend the activities.  This grant supports the programs planned at the Center for the next three summers.<br/><br/>The program in 2014 will be dedicated to Nonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics. Many physical principles are an expression of an underlying variational principle; at the same time, physical laws often have a purely geometric description. The goal of the Program in Nonlinear PDEs in Geometry and Physics is to bring together researchers who are working on PDEs with connections to differential geometry and mathematical physics.  The program in 2015 will be dedicated to Boundaries and Dynamics.  In recent years a number of problems and techniques have used statistical properties of a group action on an object at infinity which can be considered as a boundary. The goal of the Program on Boundaries and Dynamics is to explore themes involving a notion of boundaries in geometry and ergodic theory.  The program in 2016 will be dedicated to Generalized Stability, Pseudo-finite Combinatorics and Related Topics.  The last few years have also seen a remarkable convergence of ideas in model theory, combinatorics, Lie groups, number theory, and dynamics. The main goal of the Program on Generalized Stability, Pseudo-finite Combinatorics and Related Topics is to facilitate interactions between mathematicians working in these related areas."

In their many applications,  differential and difference equations describe the evolution and dynamics of complex systems.  Various  methods, computational and analytic, for example, are commonly employed to understand and solve these equations. With this project, ideas from algebra and logic, especially related to the principles of definability and  tameness of structure, will be used to understand differential and difference equations.   This basic research should have consequences in mathematics and the sciences broadly due to the importance of differential and difference equations in the applications of mathematics to the sciences. <br/><br/>Concretely, with regards to differential equations, this project will extend the fundamental model theoretic results about differential fields to the class of D-fields in a more expansive sense. Secondly, the project involves a study of the fine structure of definability and dependence in D-fields. In particular, the project will extend the Zilber trichotomy (or, at least, results of a similar flavor) to infinite dimensional types, and, thus, specializing to classical theories, to underdetermined difference-differential, partial differential, and Hasse differential equations. Moreover, a goal of the project is an explicit characterization the induced structure on sets with trivial forking geometry. Thirdly, the project will develop a theory of specializations of D-rings through a model theory of valued D-fields. Fourthly, the project includes a development of general D-Galois theories based on multiple model theoretic perspectives. Finally in connection to D-fields, the project  includes an ambitious application of the theory of D-fields which may have transformative consequences; that is, to realize Borger's F-1-geometry as the study of finite dimensional definable sets relative to a certain theory of D-rings. With regards to diophantine geometry, the project will address Zhang's dense orbit conjecture and the dynamical Mordell-Lang through the model theory of difference fields and methods from o-minimality.  The project includes a program establish the decidability of complicated fragments of the theory of C(t), the field of rational functions over the complex numbers."

Our knowledge of the mathematical universe comes through deduction from axioms. This knowledge is inherently incomplete, and there is a wide range of questions that cannot be decided from the standard axioms. Set theorists have developed and studied additional axioms that allow settling some of these questions. Some of these axioms are purposely applicable outside set theory; others are of a nature that is, at face value, largely internal to set theory, but turn out to have effects on basic mathematical objects, for example on sets of real numbers. This project deals with axioms of both types, and with methods that compare their relative strengths. It involves the development of new axioms of the first type that should have applications in contexts that were previously out of reach, the construction of minimal models for axioms of the second type within set theory, and applications of both the axioms and their minimal models, within set theory and to the real numbers.<br/><br/>This project deals with several central areas in set theory: (i) forcing axioms and their applications; (ii) inner models theory; (iii) applications of inner models theory to descriptive set theory; and (iv) infinitary combinatorics. Forcing axioms are strengthenings of the Baire category theorem that allow meeting a prescribed number of dense sets with filters in prescribed classes of partial orders. In connection with (i) this project is particularly concerned with higher analogues of the proper forcing axiom (PFA). PFA, developed in the early 1980s, allows meeting $\aleph_1$ dense sets in proper partial orders. It has proved incredibly useful both as a starting point for consistency proofs and as an axiom leading to set theoretic structure theorems. Recent work of the PI shows that there are analogues of PFA which involve meeting more than $\aleph_1$ dense sets. It is one of the goals of this project to develop these analogues further, and to use them in extending applications of PFA to new contexts. The inner models program has as its main goal the construction of models for large cardinal axioms from assumptions that do not directly involve large cardinals (for example from forcing axioms). In connection with (ii), this project is primarily concerned with the construction, nature, and combinatorial properties of inner models at the level of supercompact cardinals. This is a long-standing project in the area and one that saw a great deal of recent progress. In connections with (iii) this project is concerned with applications of inner models theory at the level of Woodin cardinals to questions in descriptive set theory. The structure of inner models at this level is well understood, and there are well known connections to descriptive set theory. These connections already yielded solutions to several previously intractable questions in descriptive set theory. Finally, in connection with (iv) this project is primarily concerned with the tree property, a remnant of large cardinal strength that can consistently hold at small cardinals."

The part of mathematical logic which is relevant to the proposed research is model theory,  which is about the ways in which mathematical objects or classes of objects are defined linguistically.  Although mathematical logic has traditional connections with the philosophy and foundations of mathematics, there have been many recent applications to core areas of mathematics, and the proposed research is in the latter tradition.  Among key problems to be studied are: (i) classifying the ways in which a ""group"" (collection of symmetries) can act as symmetries of a nice space, sometimes under some model theoretic assumptions, and (ii) what are the equations satisfied by some very special functions, such as exponential functions.<br/><br/>Here are some more details, written for mathematicians. The proposed research has two main parts. A central theme of the first part is the  classification of groups definable in models of a first order theory without the independence property.  This belongs to the ""tame"" model theory of groups, generalizing ""stable group theory"" which itself generalizes part of the theory of algebraic groups.  Although the motivation belongs largely to ""pure"" model theory, this part of the proposal touches also on topological dynamics and Lie groups. For example we expect to  produce ""new"" invariants of a discrete group, with many questions raised. The second part of the proposal deals with applications of model theory to diophantine geometry over function fields, building on earlier work of the PI and others. One problem is the extension of Ax-Schanuel-type theorems, on exponentiation and transcendence, to families of semiabelian varieties.  Another problem is to obtain a ""transparent"" account of the positive characteristic Mordell-Lang conjecture (due originally to Hrushovski)."

He is interested in the interplay between complexity and mathematics. In mathematics, as we all know, some structures are more complicated than others, some constructions more complicated than others, and some proofs more complicated than others. He plans to apply methods from computability theory to study the complexity of various areas of both classical mathematics and foundations of mathematics.<br/><br/>One of our objectives is to study of the computational properties of counterexamples to Vaught's conjecture, which is one of the most well-known and longest-standing conjectures in logic. This is with an eye towards either showing that those counterexamples do not exist, or just trying to understand them if they do exist. Montalban has already shown that being a counterexample to Vaught's conjecture is equivalent to a couple of purely computability-theoretic properties, and he has in mind a few other properties that might also end up being equivalent."

Its twenty-first meeting will be held on the campus of the University of California, Riverside, during June 17 - 20, 2014 as a symposium of the 95th annual meeting of the Pacific Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS-PD). Likewise, BEST's twenty-second meeting will be held on the campus of San Francisco State University during June 16-19, 2015, as a symposium of the 96th annual meeting of the AAAS-PD. BEST provides the western region of the United States with a conference in Set Theory that emphasizes diversity. The conference actively seeks to recruit and integrate student and early career dissemination of research in Set Theory and its affiliated mathematical disciplines into the conference agenda. The conference promotes interaction between different career stages in the field by also recruiting four plenary speakers. BEST also promotes broader understanding between mathematics and the sciences through opportunities arising from integration with the annual meeting of the AAAS-PD. BEST seeks to increase participation by underrepresented groups in Set Theory and Mathematics. <br/><br/>Set Theory is the foundation of Mathematics, and as such, of modeling and deductive reasoning in the natural sciences. Offering BEST at the Annual Meeting of the Pacific division of the AAAS thus provides potential for significant broader impact. Mathematics has always benefited from an influx of ideas and problems in other sciences, and conversely. It benefits the natural sciences, and also Set Theory, when opportunities for such cross fertilization are nurtured and facilitated. For each of the 2014 and 2015 meeting of BEST, the conference provides travel support for up to 10 student speakers, 4 postdoc speakers, 2 pre-tenure faculty speakers and 4 invited speakers.<br/><br/>Conference web site:  http://diamond.boisestate.edu/~best/"
