Besides being an interesting subject in its own right, model theory has had major impacts on almost every other branch of mathematics.  In this project, we focus on applications of model theory to operator algebras, that is, various subalgebras of the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that are closed under adjoint and are closed in various topologies.  The union of model theory and operator algebras has already proven to be fruitful and we plan on continuing the emerging evolution of model-theoretic methods in operator algebras.  We also plan to continue our work in using nonstandard analysis to solve questions in diverse areas of mathematics, including infinite-dimensional Lie theory, topological graph theory, and combinatorial number theory.  Nonstandard analysis takes advantage of idealized elements to replace limiting processes and offers new insights into difficult problems.<br/><br/>The study of operator algebras originally began as a rigorous mathematical formulation for studying various phenomena in quantum physics.  A Hilbert space is a space consisting of vectors that can be added and multiplied by scalars and for which a notion of angle makes sense.  An operator on a Hilbert space is a continuous transformation of the Hilbert space that respects the addition and scalar multiplication; operators can themselves be added and multiplied and there is also a notion of an adjoint of an operator, which in some sense is akin to taking a matrix and taking its transpose.  An operator algebra is a collection of operators on a Hilbert space that is closed under addition, scalar multiplication and adjoint and is closed under taking limits in a suitable sense.  Understanding the properties of various kinds of operator algebras and attempting to classify them has been an important venture in functional analysis for over half a century.  In this project, we propose to continue the use of techniques from logic to study operator algebras and their model-theoretic properties, that is, the properties they possess that can be expressed in logical terms."

How might we compare their complexity in a productive way? The foundations of the present approach to this question were built in the 1960s with the development of the ultrapower construction. Roughly speaking, ultrapowers give a way of amplifying the original object in accordance with a coherent set of conditions, called an ultrafilter. Different ultrafilters produce different amplifications, but nonetheless by observing the range and characteristics of such amplifications  it is in a few fundamental cases possible, and in more complex cases conjecturally possible, to detect and classify the basic drivers of structure. One can make this description precise via a pre-order known as ""Keisler's order. Some important and striking special cases of the structure of Keisler's order were worked out in the seventies within the mathematical field of model theory and were very productive for its development. The difficulty in going further had long been double: a mathematical theory sufficient to detect and explain the details of the amplification by ultrafilters had not been developed, and little was known about the construction of ultrafilters - perhaps they may vary much more than the known examples suggest.  The PI's 2009 PhD thesis and early papers re-opened this area, developing our understanding of the interaction of ultrafilters and theories. Among these developments were connections to some phenomena in extremal combinatorics, such as Szemeredi's celebrated regularity lemma. Recently, joint work of the PI and Shelah has leveraged this developing approach to the comparison of complexity to solve problems in diverse areas of mathematics, such as a sixty-year-old question about cardinal invariants of the continuum and a characterization of the existence of irregular pairs in the regularity lemma.  A broad aim of the present project is therefore to develop our understanding of the nature of the complexity which ultrafilters detect and classify, in light of its possible applications, while addressing related problems from model theoretic classification theory and working to settle certain basic questions about the structure of Keisler's order. By means of assistantships, courses, summer programs, and visits, the project aims to include both undergraduates and graduate students from within the PI's institution and to support visitors with a range of relevant expertise. A component of the associated education project will involve training mathematically talented high school students.<br/><br/><br/>In more detail, the proposed research concerns a large-scale classification program in model theory, which builds a framework for comparing the complexity of theories, and its emerging connections to the study of complexity in finite combinatorics, set theory, and general topology.  A longstanding open problem in this context is the problem of determining the structure of Keisler's 1967 order on theories. Recall that if D is a regular ultrafilter on I, and M, N are elementarily equivalent models in a countable language, we have that the D-ultrapower of M realizes all types over sets of size no more than |I| iff the D-ultrapower of N does. If so, let T be the associated theory, and let us say that D saturates T. Keisler's (pre-)order on countable theories, often considered as a partial order on the equivalence classes, sets T less than or equal to T' if every regular ultrafilter which saturates T' also saturates T. Three main research aims of the present project are the following.  The first is to investigate the model theory of simple unstable theories via the framework of Keisler's order. The second is to build the beginnings of a structure theory for the class of theories which are not simple but do not have the strong tree property SOP2, those conjecturally not maximal in Keisler's order, and to address related questions of ultrafilter construction. The third is to develop further the interactions with Szemeredi regularity and Ramsey theory and to investigate the effectiveness of earlier results with a view towards applications."

However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical theories that cannot be decided within ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs) are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. Thus LCAs pursue Godel's program in set theory. How can one test for ""correctness"" of an LCA? The inner model program, a major program in modern set theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a correct theory). This research project contributes to the inner model program by advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various extensions of ZFC. <br/><br/>The project focuses on studying the connections between inner models, sets of reals, hybrid structures (such as hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of determinacy models), forcing, and strong combinatorial principles (such as the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), (generalizations of) the tree property, the Unique Branch Hypothesis (UBH)). This research project aims to advance the basic theory of hybrid structures, as well as developing methods for the core model induction beyond its current state. In particular, the project aims to make advancements in answering two fundamental questions in descriptive inner model theory: (1) Is HOD of a determinacy model fine-structural (e.g. do the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) and various square principles hold in HOD)? (2) What is the consistency strength of PFA?"

The classic example of this is Ramsey's Theorem, which states that for any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into two colors, there is an infinite set of numbers from which every pair has the same color.  Extensions of this theorem to more complex structures, rather than just pairs of numbers, have led to and continue to lead to breakthroughs in  mathematics.  The finding of exact copies of complex structures in which all small structures of some form behave simply is a means for sorting structural results in mathematics.  Topological Ramsey space theory unifies many of the important  theorems in the area into one general framework.  The interrelations between  in Ramsey theory, set theory, and Tukey order fuels progress in each of these areas.  The project aims to continue development of topological Ramsey space theory and its applications to mapping  exact structures in some fundamental topological spaces constructed from the natural numbers; to promote better understanding of the axiomatic foundations of mathematics; and to find dividing lines between those complex structures, for instance networks, which have large copies in which all small structures behave simply and those which do not. <br/><br/>Ramsey theory and set theory overlap both in problems of interest and in methods of proof.   This is seen in particular in the theory of topological Ramsey spaces, classic examples of which include the Ellentuck space, the Carlson-Simpson space of equivalence relations, and the Milliken space of infinite block sequences.  Tukey reduction between partial orderings is a means for classifying partial orderings when isomorphism is too fine a notion to be useful.   The Tukey structure of ultrafilters on the natural numbers is exactly  the structure of the neighborhood bases in the Stone-Cech compactification of the natural numbers.  The project's  goals are to continue developing topological Ramsey space theory and its connections with set theory and Tukey structure, with applications to ultrahomogeneous relational structures and analysis.  The aims of the project are several-fold but all interrelated.  These include mapping the exact Tukey structure of ultrafilters on the natural numbers, and on Boolean algebras in general, and proving new pigeonhole principles relevant to the ultrafilters.  In forcing theory, the project aims to streamline some areas of forcing by characterizing those partial orderings which are forcing equivalent to a topological Ramsey space, one particular focus being on creature forcings, again involving new pigeonhole principles.  Another line of work is Ramsey theory at large cardinals, extending classical Ramsey theorems on countable structures to the uncountable.  Finally, the project aims to solve problems regarding Ramsey theory on ultrahomogeneous relational structures, and to construct new types of Banach spaces via topological Ramsey space theory."

Modern computability theory and theoretical computer science grew out of these efforts, and led in particular to an interest in studying the computational content of mathematics. At the same time, developments in the foundations of mathematics led to the investigation of the relative power of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning. These two areas of inquiry turn out to be closely related, and this project is concerned with questions at their intersection. It aims to further our understanding of how structure affects computability, and how computability interacts with other fundamental notions such as randomness, the power of formal systems, and the interactions between formal systems and the mathematical structures they describe.<br/><br/>In particular, this project lies in two related areas: computable mathematics and reverse mathematics of combinatorial, model theoretic, and related principles; and notions of robust information coding, including their connections with algorithmic randomness. Reverse mathematics and computable mathematics are closely related and complementary approaches to calibrating the strength of theorems and constructions throughout mathematics, and revealing the fundamental structure behind them. The investigation of combinatorial and model-theoretic principles from this point of view has proved to be a particularly rich line of research, and this project will pursue it from several angles, for instance the study of first order consequences of second order principles and notions of computability theoretic reduction that provide a particularly fine-grained analysis of the comparative strength of mathematical statements. Several of the combinatorial principles that play a central role in this area concern the existence of particular kinds of subobjects, which leads to a natural connection with the investigation of notions of robust information coding, which are reducibilities capturing the idea of being able to obtain partial information about an object from partial information about another. This project will further the study of these notions, in particular versions of infinite information reducibility, which are particularly closely connected with the computability theoretic aspects of versions of Ramsey's Theorem, and versions of coarse reducibility, which have already been found to have significant connections with algorithmic randomness."

Many questions in quantum information theory can be naturally studied within the mathematical framework of operator systems.  The recent realization that operator systems can be regarded as quantum analogs of graphs has stimulated work with impact in the theories of both operator systems and quantum information.  At the same time, classical notions and results from first order logic have been generalized within the framework of continuous logic to the setting where continuous structures, such as operator systems and other objects arising from quantum physics, are considered.  The main goal of this research project is to build upon these developments to extend results from discrete mathematics and classical computing to the quantum setting.

The next step in this direction is to determine the complexity of testing isomorphism of operator systems from the perspective of quantum computation. This question is of significant current interest for its implications for quantum physics and theoretical computer science. More broadly, the goal of the investigator is to extend classical descriptive complexity theory to the quantum setting, working within the framework of continuous logic. This research has the potential to address fundamental questions about quantum computing, including characterization of problems for which quantum computing provides a super-polynomial speedup over classical computing. Further aspects of the project involve the development of the theory of noncommutative Choquet simplices within the framework of operator systems, and the use of tools from model theory to build examples of C*-algebras that are not accessible via standard constructions."

This research project in the foundations of mathematics investigates the effective, and more generally definable, aspects of Diophantine approximation, the meta-mathematical status of familiar theorems in countable combinatorics, and the pure structure theory of relative definability. <br/><br/>One can view classical theorems in Diophantine approximation, such as Borel's almost-every real number is absolutely normal or Roth's every irrational algebraic number has irrationality exponent 2, as asserting properties of real numbers in terms of our descriptions of them. Borel's theorem asserts a property of expansions by integer bases, and Roth's theorem asserts a property of approximation by rational numbers. There is a natural affinity between this tradition in number theory and the study of definability in recursion theory. This research project will investigate the connections between these areas. For example, what is the exact relationship between the irrationality exponent of a real number, or more generally its Mahler transcendence measures, and the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial segments of its binary expansion? Second, a real number is absolutely normal if for every integer base b, each digit appears with asymptotic frequency 1/b. What other patterns of asymptotic frequencies are possible?

This research project aims to elucidate how a mathematical object having an understandable theory relates to computability of facts about the object.<br/><br/>In particular, this project works towards understanding certain problems in computable model theory: the spectrum of computable models question asks which sets of dimensions can arise as the dimensions of computable models of some uncountably categorical theory. The project will investigate distinguishing this problem based on the geometric nature of the theory, with the goal of advancing understanding in the cases where the theory satisfies the Zilber trichotomy. This project also aims to advance understanding of the degree spectra of theories. The degree spectrum of a theory measures how hard it is to compute any model of that theory. The investigator aims to develop a newer notion that will highlight connections between properties of the theory and the properties of the spectrum, providing a further link between computability and model theory. The project also investigates index sets of model theoretic notions; this is a computability-theoretic way to measure the complexity of a property.

In particular, there are problems on Scott sentences for groups. Some problems concern uncountable structures such as the ordered field of reals. There are problems on ``jumps'' of structures and a strong notion of ``jump inversion''. There are problems on complexity of isomorphisms, and on automorphisms, in particular, for vector spaces. There are problems on degree structures (enumeration degrees, and ``continuous'' degrees). There are problems on ``numberings''.

This method of study originated in questions around the philosophy and foundations of mathematics, but in recent years it has found striking applications in the study of some central objects of classical mathematics and computer science. This project investigates further these connections, in particular in the context of graphs (mathematical ways of describing networks and related systems) and group actions (mathematical ways of describing collections of symmetries of a space). This study has the potential to open up a route for applications of the powerful infinitary model-theoretic machinery to open questions in finite graph combinatorics, and conversely for applications of deep results in combinatorics to open questions in model theory.<br/><br/>Motivated by Morley's conjecture on the possible number of uncountable models of first-order theories, Shelah isolated several important classes of ""tame"" theories and developed a rich machinery for analyzing models and definable sets for some of those classes, particularly for stable theories. Later work by many researchers demonstrated that notions and methods of generalized stability reflect important phenomena in other areas of mathematics. This project will investigate two such connections. 1) Improved Ramsey-type bounds and strong regularity lemmas were obtained for semi-algebraic graphs by Fox et al. and for algebraic graphs in large finite fields by Tao, with numerous applications in the corresponding areas. These results can naturally be viewed as results about graphs definable in certain structures fitting into the classification picture. 2) Study of definable group actions turns out to be closely related to certain questions in topological dynamics, especially around weakly almost periodic dynamical systems and tame systems studied by Glasner and others. The investigator will work on developing further methods of generalized stability and applying them to questions in combinatorics of graphs definable in various ""tame"" structures (stable, o-minimal, distal, dependent) and to study dynamical properties of definable group actions in those structures."

The symposium aims to: (1) recognize and advocate collective achievements by female mathematicians in the Midwest, and (2) stimulate collaborations, networking, and mentoring relations. The meeting builds upon the success of previous symposia to establish the WIMS as an annual event rotating among colleges and universities in the Midwest. The symposium will attract female mathematicians in the Midwest at all stages of their careers; it is expected to draw about 100 participants, in particular, graduate students, early-career researchers, and faculty at small institutions who have limited access to resources enabling them to attend conferences. <br/><br/>The symposium will feature two plenary lectures by distinguished senior researchers and eight shorter ones by promising junior researchers. The speakers are chosen to reflect the variety of institutions in the Midwest. Collectively, they will discuss a broad spectrum of cutting edge research. Lectures will be accompanied by open problem sessions, where the participants will work in small groups to discuss field-specific problems and develop new collaborations. Students and recent PhDs will contribute to the intellectual activity of the symposium by making poster presentations. This workshop is jointly funded by eight programs within the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences: Algebra & Number Theory, Analysis, Applied Math, Infrastructure, Mathematical Biology, Topology & Geometric Analysis, Foundations, and Probability.

These topics lie at the interface of descriptive set theory, measured group theory, graph theory, ergodic theory, probability theory, and operator algebras. In recent years, mathematicians in these fields have come to realize that problems concerning algebraic, dynamical, and descriptive structural complexity of countable group and equivalence relations can be fruitfully studied via descriptive combinatorial and graph theoretic means. The principal investigator and collaborators have employed this combinatorial perspective to create new tools used to answer several open problems in these fields. In addition to a combinatorial perspective, research in these fields is also facilitated by a global perspective, from which problems in ergodic theory, for example, may be seen as topological-dynamical and descriptive problems concerning actions of the group of automorphisms of a standard probability space. This research project aims to generate more new general tools and to promote fruitful interactions among these fields. <br/><br/>Measured group theory seeks to understand countably infinite groups through ergodic theoretic properties of their measurable actions on standard probability spaces, and particularly through structural properties of the orbit equivalence relations generated by these actions. The motivating phenomenon is that algebraic properties of an acting group are often expressed through measurable properties of the associated equivalence relation. An extreme form of this phenomenon is seen in orbit equivalence and cocycle rigidity and superrigidity theorems, which state that in certain settings an equivalence relation completely remembers the group from which it was generated. At the other extreme are what might be called orbit equivalence anti-rigidity theorems, stating that certain groups and actions cannot be distinguished by looking at the equivalence relations they generate. This research project touches upon phenomena at both of these extremes. The questions are motivated by rigidity/anti-rigidity results established by the principal investigator and collaborators, which have led to new questions addressed in this project. The project will address problems concerning algebraic, dynamical, and descriptive structural complexity of countable groups and equivalence relations, specifically in the areas of orbit equivalence, treeability, cocycle superrigidity, weak equivalence rigidity, and measurable combinatorial properties and parameters of graphs and group actions. The project pursues a descriptive combinatorial and graph theoretic approach to these problems."

Short, conceptual proofs can avoid complicated calculations, but sometimes cannot provide the detailed quantitative information those calculations would reveal.  A recent insight is that, sometimes, mathematics can have it both ways.  By studying the structure of mathematical proof itself, techniques from the field known as proof theory make it possible to take abstract proofs and to extract detailed calculations from them.  Used in the opposite direction, these techniques can take certain kinds of lengthy calculations and replace them with short, abstract arguments which can then be generalized to prove new results.  The focus of this project is to both further extend these techniques to new areas, particularly recently discovered applications in statistics, as well as continue the application of known techniques to new problems, especially in areas where probability and randomness play a central role.<br/><br/>In this project, Towsner will build on previous applications of ultraproducts to studying the way mathematical objects can be separated into structured and random parts.  An explicit quantitative approach to such dichotomies has long been central to extremal graph theory, but recent work has shown that these can also be viewed in measure-theoretic terms by using ultraproducts to mediate between the finitary and infinitary perspectives, leading to new results in the area.  Towsner will study this connection systematically, both developing new tools in the infinitary setting and using the proof-theoretic functional interpretation to translate these tools back to the classical setting, extracting explicit calculations from these infinitary arguments."

Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the lens of transfinite ordinal numbers.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project involves attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected to have a number of other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals. The second part of the research project concerns further developing techniques in pure set theory: methods for studying the combinatorics of the second uncountable cardinal via forcing axioms; the role that Jensen's diamond principle plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at most aleph1. The project also supports graduate students working in other fields of logic, including computability theory and model theory."
