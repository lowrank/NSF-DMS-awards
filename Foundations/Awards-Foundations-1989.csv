The investigator intends to develop this set of                    techniques further in the search for new classes of structures                  which cannot be analyzed in this fashion.  He will follow up                    progress by Ehud Hrushovski of M.I.T. by attempting to construct                new strongly minimal sets with an algebraic flavor or to prove                  that they do not exist.  Two other problems in model theoretic                  algebra are also on his agenda.                                                      Model theoretic algebra of this sort is a mixture of                       mathematical logic and the study of classical algebraic                         structures.  It has a characteristic flavor of its own but can                  shed light on difficuties which have arisen in traditional                      approaches to the classification and analysis of such structures."

The main goals of this work are to analyze further the types of                 search procedures needed to obtain results in Recursion Theory,                 and to see how well the information content of a set is                         mirrored by the degree of that set.  The first goal is to                       develop a O(n) -priority argument for all n: Lerman will try to                 do so in the context of deciding the existential theory of the                  recursively enumerable degrees with Steffen Lempp.  He will                     then try, with Lempp and Kucera, to find a priority-free proof                  of this theory.                                                                      The second goal will be pursued by studying automorphisms                  of sets of degrees, primarily the recursively enumerable                        degrees.  This project is already underway, jointly with Lempp,                 Shore and Soare, and the hope is to produce a nontrivial                        automorphism."

Forcing is a powerful method for examining the extremes of set                  theoretic behavior permitted by given axioms of set theory.  One                uses it to construct models of set theory obeying the axioms, the               object being to show that some additional property does not                     follow from the axioms.

The first involves the relationship between the                   ""generic"" large cardinal axioms and conventional large cardinal                 axioms.  Closely related to this is the problem of whether                      aleph-omega is Jonsson.  A successful resolution of these                       problems would unify the various proposed strengthenings of the                 ordinary assumptions of mathematics.  If the results                            conjectured by the P.I. are true it would also shed                             considerable light on the continuum hypothesis.                                      The second type of problem examines the combinatorial                      characteristics of definable partial orderings and graphs.                      Frequently, adding a definability hypothesis to a class of                      partial orders implies that they have very nice properties,                     devoid of the ""pathologies"" induced by arbitrary choice.                             The third kind of problem involves investigating                           applications of set theory in functional analysis."

C.

Jockusch's work will be of the former kind, while a portion of                  Henson's and of van den Dries' work will be of the latter.  For                 example, Henson will continue to assess the relative complexity                 of different mathematical theories and will seek ways to                        recognize easily ones with lower measures of complexity."

Various problems and their relationship to the constructible                    universe of Godel and to certain other models of set theory                     will be considered.

A postdoctoral                    researcher, Michael Chris Laskowski, and an advanced graduate                   student will be involved too.

A highly                        developed axiomatic set theory exists, however, driven by the                   desire to make the foundations of mathematics absolutely secure                 and free from paradox of any kind.  Research of this nature is                  in some sense mathematical hygiene, for paradoxes of the                        infinite abound, and mathematical intuition is not fully                        reliable as a protection from them."

It was shown that they               are all built around projective spaces over finite fields.  It                  was expected that a similar but much deeper theory exists for                   aleph-one categorical theories; here the corresponding geometries               would include algebraically closed fields.  Recently a non-                     classical geometry controlling an aleph-one categorical structure               has been constructed.  The proposed research would proceed in two               directions.  The first would directly investigate the limits of                 such constructions and attempt to create a new picture of the                   subject.  The most important test-question here is whether                      Cherlin's conjecture that every simple group of finite Morley                   rank is an algebraic group over an algebraically closed field is                still viable.  The second direction involves a given geometry                   inside an ambient structure; in the simplest case the structure                 is obtained from a strongly minimal set by blowing up each point                to a finite set; the question is how the structure may be                       expanded without disturbing the base.  This would have                          applications both to the classification of the totally                          categorical theories and to the general theory.  The immediate                  results of such a project in abstract model theory are likely to                be mainly of foundational interest, but the refined                             combinatorical techniques developed in order to prove them may                  have much wider appeal and utility."

That is, those of the                      first group to be discussed arise from what one thinks of as                    traditional infinitary combinatorics, while those of the second                 group arise from the subarea of mathematical political science                  launched into prominence by the Nobel Prize winning work of                     Kenneth Arrow.                                                                       The considerations within traditional infinitary                           combinatorics will begin with a specific question about                         definable graphs on the real line.  The result it is hoped to                   establish for all Borel sets has been shown to hold for closed                  sets by M. Foreman and the investigator; the desired extension                  would provide a simultaneous generalization of two elegant                      known results.  The more general investigations will be in the                  area of partition theory and primarily involve some hoped for                   extensions of recent joint work with A. Blass and P. Erdos.                          Arrow's Impossibility Theorem can be regarded as an                        elegant characterization of the ultraproduct construction                       applied to linear (or pre-linear) orderings.  (Since                            ultrafilters on a finite set are principal, this yields the                     ""dictator"" one associates with Arrow's theorem).  The instant                   investigations in social choice theory will focus on the                        investigator's recent work generalizing Arrow's theorem in both                 the finite context and that of ultra-products."
