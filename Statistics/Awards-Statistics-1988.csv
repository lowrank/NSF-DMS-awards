By approximations,                     Berry.Essen bounds and asymptotic expansions are also included.                 The method that will be used will be different from the usual                   method of characteristic functions and will also give                           approximations uniformly over all Borel subsets, which is also                  one of the aims of the project.

Such constraints                 arise naturally when the parameters are known to follow a                       pattern.

Statistical and                          computational problems involving simulation are motivated by the                need to calculate complicated statistical quantities.  Most of                  the problems center around integration, both high dimensional                   integration and simultaneous integration of thousands of related                integrals.

The first one called multistage testing can be seen as                 the practical compromise between the standard fixed sample size                 methods and the optimal sequential methods.  Sequential one-at-a-               time testing procedures have significant practical problems.                    Previous work of the investigator has shown that asymptotic                     optimality can be achieved by a three stage procedure where the                 size of the sample may depend on the previous stage.  Multistage                procedures change the error probabilities of the problem in                     complex ways.  Dr. Lorden will study the error probabilities and                the choice of successive sample sizes.                                               The second problem is detecting the change in the underlying               distribution as soon after it occurs, as possible.  The new                     method will employ Bayes procedures to utilize the prior                        information on the location of the change point.                                     In sequential tests, both the standard Neyman-type approach                and the Bayesian approach have proved to be valuable.  Dr. Lorden               investigates a partial-Bayes method in which a weighted average                 of the expected sample size is minimized subjected to the                       required error probabilities."

Two approaches to confidence intervals are                to treat the bias of the estimate as a random variable or to                    replace the bias by an upper bound.  The first method yields                    short intervals that are accurate only in an average sense while                the second method gives longer conservative intervals.
