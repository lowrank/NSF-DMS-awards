One of the most interesting is the                   problem of robust spline smoothing.  The typical spline                         estimator of a regression function is found by minimizing a sum                 of squared errors plus a penalty function.  However the sum of                  squared errors is highly sensitive to outliers.  By                             substituting absolute error for squared error (or another                       appropriate function of the error) one can make the estimator                   more robust to outliers.  Eubanks will examine the effect of                    incorporating and estimating a scale factor for the error terms                 in these more appropriate and general functions of the errors.                  He will also examine jackknife confidence intervals for the                     underlying regression function.  These nonparametric regression                 models will also be applied to the traditional analysis of                      variance, analysis of covariance and intra-class regression                     models.  Another problem he will address is the incorporation                   of the covariance structure of order statistics in the                          estimation of quantile functions and their densities.                                The problem of relating two variables (such as height and                  weight) for pairs of observations on individuals is addressed                   by nonparametric regression.  Finding a functional relationship                 between the two variables is made considerably harder if some                   information is miscoded or extremely unusual individuals are                    included in the data.  Eubank will investigate methods of                       finding functional relationships that will be less sensitive to                 outliers in the sample and more representative of the whole                     population."

Included are                     practical designs, in which external and possibly, opposing                     constraints affect the class of rules available.  Topics include                multi-stage rules, biased coin designs, repeated significance                   tests, bandit problems, and Bayesian designs which utilize                      historical controls. The second part involves problems of optimal               stopping with the main emphasis on derivations of simple-to-use                 procedures that are nearly optimal.  Optimal solutions to some                  generalized secretary problems are also considered.  The third                  part concerns methods of adjusting estimators of survival rates                 to account for effects of random censoring.  In locating                        acceptable correction terms, techniques of transforming                         parameters to have well-behaved likelihood functions are combined               with those of deriving integrable asymptotic expansions for                     posterior distributions.

The                     forecast takes the form of a probability distribution on the                    possible values of the random variable.  (The true distribution                 of the random variable is unknown.)  Assessment criteria or                     ""scoring rules"" which judge the ""calibration"" or accuracy of the                forecast are to be examined.  The scoring rules will be examined                under the assumption that the forecast distribution is correct as               well as under the assumption that it is incorrect in certain                    aspects.  The investigator will also consider these problems for                a forecast region or ""prediction region"" rather than a complete                 forecast probability distribution.  (By a prediction region we                  mean the interval from 65 to 73 in a forecast such as : ""There is               a 90% chance that the temperature will be between 65 degrees and                73 degrees."") The  problems involve using distance measures                     between distributions. Continguity arguments and direct                         martingale arguments will be needed.                                                 The investigator's work involves assessing sequential                      forecasting procedures that use probabilty.  Such procedures                    occur in the following examples:  a meteorologist gives a                       probability that it will rain the next day; medical clinicians                  (or expert systems) give subjective probabilities that particular               patients are suffering from specific diseases; a computer                       specialist predicts the distribution of future failure times of                 software or hardware based on past experience.  Sequential                      feedback is essential in the process in the sense that as the                   outcome for previous forecasts becomes known to the forecaster                  this and other information is incorporated into the next                        forecast.
