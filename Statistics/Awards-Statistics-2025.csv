Unlike explicit labels, preference feedback is often easier to collect and can be particularly valuable in subjective tasks where defining ideal outcomes is difficult. However, real-world preference data are often noisy, sparse, and heterogeneous, posing significant challenges to existing statistical methods. For example, recommendation systems may encounter incomplete feedback from users who abandon tasks due to fatigue or provide inconsistent inputs due to individual biases. This project aims to address the challenges of learning from preference feedback by developing robust statistical methods and advancing the theoretical foundations of preference-based learning. Additionally, it seeks to prepare students to tackle these challenges by integrating the research findings into innovative teaching platforms and educational curricula.<br/><br/>The project will focus on three key areas of learning from preference feedback: ranking from pairwise comparisons, user-item rating systems, and reinforcement learning from human feedback. To advance the field, the project will (1) develop robust algorithms for ranking that account for ill-conditioned sampling mechanisms and relax parametric modeling assumptions; (2) propose new estimation and uncertainty quantification methods for user-item ratings that work effectively in sparse and heterogeneous settings; and (3) introduce novel frameworks for reinforcement learning that incorporate ?out-of-list? preference feedback while addressing the issue of distribution shifts. Through these contributions, the project will bridge the gap between statistical theory and practical applications, creating tools to enhance decision-making systems across diverse domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER project is driven by three fundamental research questions: (1) How to balance interpretability and accuracy in high-dimensional time series modeling and inference? (2) How to adaptively select time series models in real time for nonstationary data, while managing uncertainty? and (3) How to efficiently combine information from time series data with varying quality? This project aims to advance the field of time series analysis by developing novel statistical models, theories, and inference methods to address these issues. The results of this research will enhance dynamic network inference, facilitate real-time decision-making, and promote the integration of diverse time series data sources. This project will achieve educational impacts by integrating our research with mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, developing courses, and high-school outreach. Additionally, an interdisciplinary time series seminar series will be organized to promote cross-disciplinary interactions and provide students and junior researchers with exposure to diverse research in time series analysis.<br/><br/>This project will advance time series analysis on three main fronts: (1) develop Granger causality interpretable, recurrent neural network-based high-dimensional time series models to balance interpretability and accuracy; (2) develop an online, distribution-free procedure for adaptive time series model selection in nonstationary settings, addressing uncertainty via conformal miscoverage rate calibration; and (3) introduce new methods to efficiently combine time series data with different granularities and to impute data under general missing patterns. Underlying this research agenda is our overarching goal to tackle challenges due to the high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, nonstationarity, different granularity, and mixed quality and completeness of modern time series data. With an emphasis on statistical inference, we seek novel solutions by integrating existing statistical frameworks (Granger causality, model confidence sets, and factor models) with contemporary ML approaches (RNNs, model predictive control, and transfer learning).

Such distributions are often utilized in statistical modeling to incorporate non-linearity, robustness to large observations, and sparsity in high-dimensional data. The overarching goal of this project is to build new scalable statistical methods that incorporate heavy-tailed prior distributions in three disparate application areas: independent component estimation that recovers independent, latent sources from their observed mixtures, astronomical distance estimation from parallax measurements, and statistical modeling of compositional data. The research will result in powerful Bayesian tools with rigorous theoretical justification. This project will also narrow the critical gap between methodological advances in statistics and the tools used by the scientific community and promote increased usage and transparency of state-of-the-art Bayesian tools.

By leveraging heavy-tailed priors within hierarchical models, this work provides a new framework for controlling higher-order moments in blind source separation and as mixing densities for normal scale mixtures for handling non-linearity, robustness, and sparsity. The methods to be developed will be rigorously tested in applications spanning astronomy, blind source separation, community detection, and ecological modeling of species diversity and affinity, demonstrating their broad utility.

However, obtaining high-quality labels in many fields is extremely costly, so most available data remain unlabeled. For example, although millions of images and videos can be easily collected from social media platforms, manually labeling them is a tedious and time-consuming process. To address the challenge of limited labeled data, self-supervised representation learning has emerged as a promising approach in computer vision and natural language processing. It has already played a key role in the success of recent large language models. Despite its strong performance in practice, the theoretical understanding of self-supervised representation learning remains limited. Moreover, the problem of scarce labeled data also affects biomedical research, but the existing self-supervised methods cannot be directly applied due to the unique nature of biomedical datasets. This project aims to address these gaps by developing new theoretical frameworks for self-supervised representation learning, along with computational tools tailored to biomedical studies. It also includes educational efforts to engage students and the broader public with this growing area of research.<br/><br/>This project aims to advance the theoretical foundations of self-supervised representation learning and transform how unlabeled data are utilized in biomedical research. On the theoretical front, the project will investigate self-supervised learning on a low-dimensional nonlinear model, which effectively captures the invariant and intrinsic low-dimensional structure underlying observed data. Building on this nonlinear modeling framework, this project will develop a novel theory that explains the empirical success of self-supervised learning and clarifies the role of pseudo labels generated from unlabeled data. This theoretical foundation will inform the design of innovative and principled learning methodologies. On the application side, the project will integrate self-supervised representation learning into biomedical applications, including microbiome studies and omics-based longitudinal (trajectory) data. The project will develop new computational tools and software tailored to these contexts, enabling the effective use of large-scale unlabeled biomedical data.

In mathematical terms, a ?group? is a collection of elements combined with an operation that links any two elements to form a third, adhering to closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility principles. A ?group action? involves applying elements of a group to another set?s elements, transforming them in structured ways, such as through rotations or reflections. These transformations are crucial in many data processing applications, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), image registration, and multi-reference alignment. Each observation in these problems involves a common, unknown signal and an unknown group element, with the primary goal being to infer both the signal and the group elements accurately. This project aims to significantly advance statistical understanding and develop effective methodologies for handling data influenced by group actions. The wide existence of such data ensures that the progress we make towards our objectives will have a great impact not only on the statistics and machine learning community but also on a much broader scientific community, including fields such as structural biology, computer vision, and signal processing. This project will have educational outcomes that result in curriculum development, teaching, and outreach activities, including activities to K-12 students through the University of Pennsylvania Data Science Academy. The project will advance applications in image recognition and time series alignment, which have broad application in areas like medical imaging.<br/><br/>This project is structured around three main aims, each designed to tackle distinct aspects of group actions. First, the PI will improve the accuracy of orbit recovery in scenarios where the prior distributions of group elements are non-uniform, developing computationally efficient procedures that are effective under realistic conditions. Second, the PI will develop theories and methods for group synchronization problems, particularly under high noise levels and in situations with incomplete data, aiming to reduce the error of group recovery and provide entrywise inference. Third, the PI will address theoretical and computational challenges in the multi-reference alignment problem, developing procedures specifically designed for the cyclic structural nature of data, thereby enabling more precise uncertainty quantification. Together, these aims will not only enhance the theoretical understanding of and the ability to analyze group actions but also lead to the development of accurate and computationally efficient algorithms designed to tackle real-world challenges in data analysis where group actions are integral.  This research project will have impacts more broadly, in that it will result in software development and in the education of technical experts. These experts will use this software to advance applications in image recognition and time series alignment, which have broad application in areas like medical imaging.

This project tackles both challenges at once. It advances statistical foundations for such problems by (1) providing a new framework to theoretically study empirical Bayes methods in these complex models that learn the latent-parameter distribution directly from the data, and (2) developing cutting-edge unsupervised dimension-reduction techniques that embed the high-dimensional observations into lower-dimensional representations while preserving the essential structure and relationships within the data. Together, these tools will transform ad-hoc prior modeling into an objective, data-driven procedure and yield principled, scalable inference for large-scale applications. Further, collaborations with astronomers will ensure immediate scientific impact, and several of the research directions will shape the Ph.D. dissertation of multiple Columbia graduate students, fostering the next generation of data-science leaders.<br/><br/><br/>The project integrates two tightly linked research thrusts. (a) Building on recent advances in nonparametric empirical Bayes, the PI will design flexible empirical Bayes estimators for latent-variable distributions for exchangeable parameters. The central innovation is to merge empirical Bayes ideas with variational approximations in general probabilistic latent-variable models, producing estimators that remain computationally tractable, and achieve optimal risk. (b) Classical linear dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling are often inadequate for datasets that are growing increasingly complex in fields such as genomics, astronomy, and finance. To tackle these challenges, the PI will design non-linear reduction techniques --- combining manifold learning with low-rank factor models ---informed by ideas from optimal transport and algebraic geometry.

These bounds are crucial, for example, in reinforcement learning, which underpins the success of systems like AlphaGo. Additionally, they play a key role in uncertainty quantification and the theoretical analysis of black-box machine learning algorithms. However, classical finite sample bounds have a significant limitation: they are often overly conservative. This conservatism leads to underperforming algorithms and unnecessarily loose guarantees. This project is built around a novel yet straightforward idea: finite-sample bounds can be derived from infinite-sample results. By leveraging recent breakthroughs in optimal transport and probability theory, the project aims to develop a new method for deriving such inequalities. These methods will be applied to problems such as online data-driven decision-making, early stopping rules, and machine learning for multiscale physical models. The PI will interweave their research and teaching throughout the research period and beyond. In particular, the PI will provide research training opportunities to graduate students and develop undergraduate and graduate courses, with course materials made publicly available and with joint participation from industry.<br/><br/>Classical concentration inequalities, such as the ones derived by Hoeffding or Bernstein, are over-conservative, are regularly inadequate for heavy-tail distributions, and often rely on the assumption of independence. In this project, the PI tackles those limitations from a new angle, starting with an infinite-sample result for a given problem, such as a central limit theorem, and translating it into a finite-sample result for the same problem by using the concept of distributional approximations. The advantage of this novel proof method is threefold: Firstly, the derived bounds improve as the sample size grows. This leads to inequalities that are considerably tighter than the classical ones. Secondly, limit theorems often hold for many forms of dependent data. This opens a more promising path to derive finite sample probability bounds than conventional Chernoff-based techniques. Lastly, by extending this approach to non-Gaussian limits, the PI develops finite sample concentration inequalities for heavy-tailed statistics. This project will (1) develop a completely novel method for obtaining concentration inequalities, as well as new results for transport distances and optimal transport, (2) provide machine learning theorists with a new set of powerful probability tools for obtaining high-probability guarantees for high-dimensional estimators and dependent and structured data, and (3) provide tighter tail bounds which will lead to algorithmic improvements and improved uncertainty quantification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, genomicists may need to assess thousands of genes using data from only a few subjects, while survey statisticians might analyze average incomes in many towns based on limited surveys. To address these challenges, researchers often borrow information from related questions, a process that requires sophisticated statistical reasoning due to varying underlying characteristics. Empirical Bayes offers a method to enhance individual question inference by sharing information, potentially improving statistical accuracy. However, it relies on strong modeling assumptions, limiting its applicability. This research aims to make empirical Bayes more powerful and accessible by integrating it with modern machine learning and causal inference, demonstrating its effectiveness under fewer assumptions, and developing methods to assess uncertainty more effectively. These advancements will help practitioners utilize empirical Bayes in various scientific and industry contexts without extensive statistical modeling. Additionally, the project will produce a monograph and provide training for students and preceptors on modern data science challenges using empirical Bayes.<br/> <br/> <br/>This research aims to advance empirical Bayes by developing new methodologies and statistical theories to address four key limitations: the assumption of known likelihoods, the treatment of nuisance parameter heterogeneity, the development of nonparametric inference methods, and the integration with machine learning. The project will create new inference methods for primary parameters by using empirical partially Bayes methods and Bayesian nonparametrics, enhancing frequentist Bayes multiple testing theory with guarantees like false discovery rate control. Additionally, the research seeks to learn the unknown Bayes rule through neural networks with a specialized loss function, incorporate James-Stein shrinkage for combining unbiased estimates with semisupervised machine learning, and integrate empirical partially Bayes inference with doubly robust double machine learning for large-scale causal inference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A generative model is an abstraction, and often a simplification, of a data generating mechanism using probabilistic tools, where specific features of interest regarding the generating mechanism are encapsulated into parameters of the generative model. Bayesian statistical inference is a popular statistical paradigm for combining such generative models for data with prior information about model parameters in a principled fashion to perform statistical inference on the unknown parameters. Some of the salient aspects behind the tremendous growth in popularity of Bayesian inference  include principled incorporation of domain information, an in-built penalty for model complexity allowing automatic model selection, and facilitating borrowing of information across different domains via hierarchical modeling. However, being inherently model-based, Bayesian statistics is intrinsically susceptible to departures from the postulated generative model.  Through this project, the investigators will explore and develop new statistical methodology for performing Bayesian inference allowing flexible departures from the generative model under consideration. A major focus will be the user-friendliness of the proposed approaches, circumventing the need for a user to explicitly build probabilistic models of increasing richness. The research will be disseminated through articles at prominent avenues and research presentations. Additionally, software packages for the methods developed will be made available publicly. The investigators are committed to enhancing the pedagogical component of the proposal through advising students and developing graduate and undergraduate topic courses.<br/><br/>Flexible nonparametric Bayesian methods have gained in popularity to address perceived issues of traditional Bayesian modeling regarding model-misspecification. The last thirty years have seen a proliferation of such methods, both in mainstream statistics as well as the machine learning community, as we continue to encounter increasing levels of complexities in modern datasets. However, nonparametric Bayesian methods can be challenging to implement as well as interpret. Furthermore, in many applications, the targets of interest are quite simple and it is essentially futile to model all aspects of the data. The fundamental aim of the proposed research is to develop a flexible Bayesian non-parametric approach that retains the generative modeling aspect of traditional parametric Bayesian modeling while avoiding a complete probabilistic specification of the data generating mechanism as typically performed in nonparametric Bayesian modeling. This will be performed by defining a modified likelihood function, leveraging ideas from the empirical likelihood literature as well as optimal transport theory, that centers around a user-specified parametric family of densities. An automated calibration procedure will be developed to control the extent of centering around the parametric model. The investigators will offer a firm theoretical underpinning of the proposed procedure and develop computationally efficient algorithms to carry out inferential tasks. The developed methods will be applied to scientific learning problems in neuroscience and nuclear physics to allow departures from existing scientific models in situations where their operating characteristics are less understood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But discovering key features and important relationships in complex and huge data poses major statistical and computational challenges. The investigator aims to develop new statistical machine learning approaches and theory for this task that break up huge data sets into small random subsets called minipatches to facilitate both faster computation and improved statistical efficiency. The new methods will be implemented in open-source software and applied to huge biomedical datasets in genomics and neuroscience. The project will provide undergraduate and graduate students training and professional development opportunities.<br/><br/>Discovering key features and important relationships in complex and huge data commonly found in biomedicine poses not only major computational challenges but also critical statistical challenges. To tackle these challenges, the investigator plans to develop a new framework termed minipatch learning. Inspired by the successes of random forests, stability approaches in high-dimensional statistics, and stochastic optimization strategies, the investigator will build ensembles from many random tiny subsets of both observations and features or variables called minipatches. While ensemble learning strategies are commonly used in supervised machine learning, the investigator will use minipatch learning for the tasks of feature selection, model-agnostic inference for feature importance, and learning relationships amongst features through graphical models. The approach, which trains on very tiny subsets of the data, is expected to have dramatic computational and memory savings. The investigator aims to show both theoretically and empirically that such a strategy poses significant statistical advantages as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing accuracy in projections of wildland fire activity, fire behavior, and wildland fire weather is the key toward developing more efficient fire control strategies and reducing the risks of wildfires. Recent studies have demonstrated that the tools of artificial intelligence (AI) can help in planning for upcoming prescribed burns by providing higher spatial and temporal fire weather forecasts and can also assist in developing more efficient strategies for wildfire risk mitigation. However, the modeling tools that are currently used to predict fire activity are largely subject to a number of temporal or spatial constraints. For instance, most deep learning (DL) approaches for wildfire risk analytics tend to be restricted in their capabilities to systematically capture the multidimensional information recorded at disparate spatio-temporal resolutions. Furthermore, such DL architectures are inherently static and do not explicitly account for complex dynamic phenomena, which is often the key behind the accurate assessment of wildfire driving factors. Finally, these models primarily rely on supervised learning approaches where a large number of task-specific labels (e.g., fire or no fire) are needed. To address these challenges in wildfire risk analytics, this project will leverage inherently interdisciplinary approaches at the interface of Earth system sciences, DL, computational topology, statistics, and actuarial sciences. <br/><br/>The project aims to introduce the concepts of topological data analysis (TDA) to wildfire predictive modeling, coupling them with such emerging AI machinery as time-aware graph neural networks. The resulting new methods are expected to better capture the shape patterns in the wildland fire processes with respect both to time and space and to assist in a more reliable statistical assessment of wildfire risks. The new high-fidelity predictive approaches will have the potential to deliver forecasts of fire behavior, fire activity, and fire weather at multiple spatial and temporal scales under scenarios of limited, noisy, or nonexistent labeled information. To enhance the utility of the research solutions in wildfire analytics, the researchers in this project will work in close collaboration with stakeholders, particularly, focusing on the insurance sector. The project will provide multiple interdisciplinary training opportunities at the nexus of wildfire sciences, AI, and mathematical sciences at all educational levels, from undergraduate students to practicing actuaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This workshop aims to unite experts from various disciplines to develop and discuss recent advancements in experimental designs that combine classical approaches with cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques. In today's data-driven world, understanding cause-and-effect relationships is essential across fields such as healthcare, social policy, and industry, and randomized experiments serve as the gold standard for establishing causal relationships by systematically testing the effectiveness of treatments, interventions, or policies. Well-designed experiments not only yield reliable insights but also reduce costs, accelerate outcomes, and enhance public benefits. However, designing experiments that meet the complex needs of different fields, each with unique challenges and data requirements, is a significant task. While traditional experimental designs have been successful for decades, recent advancements in data collection and AI potentially offer new opportunities to enhance experimental efficiency and insights. This workshop aims to foster collaboration among researchers across different fields to create new experimental design strategies suitable for today's complex data environments.<br/><br/>The workshop aims to address the need for a unified approach to experimental design by bridging classical design of experiments (DoE) and modern adaptive methodologies, including reinforcement learning and AI-assisted designs. Classical DoE has been foundational in manufacturing, engineering, and quality control, emphasizing optimized balance and limited sample sizes. However, recent applications in clinical trials and digital platforms may require more adaptive approaches that dynamically adjust based on accruing data. These modern adaptive strategies ? such as response-adaptive randomization, enrichment designs, micro-randomization, and multi-arm bandits ? offer enhanced statistical efficiency and personalization but necessitate tailored statistical frameworks and causal inference methods. Despite their potential, the application of modern designs has been hindered by limited cross-disciplinary dialogue and implementation guidance. This workshop will convene experts in statistical design, biostatistics, econometrics, political science, and industry to foster interdisciplinary innovation in experimental methodologies. Objectives include fostering knowledge exchange across fields, advancing the integration of adaptive and classical designs, and applying AI tools to optimize experimental processes. By addressing practical challenges and promoting collaboration, the workshop aims to advance experimental design theory and practice, leveraging AI to tackle the complex data landscapes of modern research and industry applications.<br/><br/>For more information, please visit the workshop website at: https://www.design-ai.site/Berkeley-2025/ .<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Statistical inference of such time series is a fundamental problem in modern time series analysis and has broad applications in many scientific areas, including bioinformatics, business, climate science, economics, finance, genetics, and signal processing. Compared with existing methodologies, this research project will provide nonparametric inference procedures that can accommodate a wide range of dimensionality and require weak assumptions on the data generating processes. The methodology ensuing from the project will be disseminated to the relevant scientific communities via publications, conference and seminar presentations, and the development of open-source software. The project will involve multiple research mentoring initiatives, including efforts on broadening participation, and will offer advanced topic courses to introduce the state-of-the-art techniques in time series analysis. The project will provide a broad range of interdisciplinary training opportunities at all educational levels and will contribute to the future workforce professional development.<br/><br/>The project will develop a systematic body of methods and theory on inference for both multivariate (including high-dimensional) time series and functional time series based on sample splitting (SS) and self-normalization (SN). Recently, the SN technique has been advanced to the inference of high-dimensional time series, but it requires the use of a trimming parameter. Also, its scope of applicability is limited to high-dimensional time series with weak panel dependence which might be unrealistic in many modern time series applications. In turn, the existing SN for functional time series relies on dimension reduction by functional principal component analysis and, hence, the resulting procedure may be powerless when the alternative is orthogonal to the space spanned by the top principal components used in the procedure. To address these major limitations, this project will develop a new unified framework based on SS-SN, in conjunction with inference for multivariate and functional time series, and investigate its utility in application to analysis of time series of low, medium, high or infinite dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the intraday return path of a financial asset, the age-at-death distributions, the annual composition of energy sources, social networks, phylogenetic trees, and EEG scans or MRI fiber tracts of patients can all be viewed as random objects in certain metric spaces. For many endeavors in this area, the data being analyzed is collected with a natural ordering, i.e., the data can be viewed as an object-valued time series. Despite its prevalence in many applied problems, statistical analysis for such time series is still in its early development. A fundamental difficulty of developing statistical techniques is that the spaces where these objects live are nonlinear and commonly used algebraic operations are not applicable. This research project aims to develop new models, methodology and theory for the analysis of object-valued time series. Research results from the project will be disseminated to the relevant scientific communities via publications, conference and seminar presentations. The investigators will jointly mentor a Ph.D. student and involve undergraduate students in the research, as well as offering advanced topic courses to introduce the state-of-the-art techniques in object-valued time series analysis.<br/><br/>The project will develop a systematic body of methods and theory on modeling and inference for object-valued time series. Specifically, the investigators propose to (1) develop a new autoregressive model for distributional time series in Wasserstein geometry and a suite of tools for model estimation, selection and diagnostic checking; (2) develop new specification testing procedures for distributional time series in the one-dimensional Euclidean space; and (3) develop new change-point detection methods to detect distribution shifts in a sequence of object-valued time series. The above three projects tackle several important modeling and inference issues in the analysis of object-valued time series, the investigation of which will lead to innovative methodological and theoretical developments, and lay groundwork for this emerging field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ASD is characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and behavior, such as difficulties in forming relationships, understanding nonverbal cues, speech development, repetitive behaviors, and sensory sensitivities. The project will create a unified system integrating clinical and neuro-developmental data, analyzed using a DT healthcare paradigm. The DT technology will enable individualized models, and its predictive capabilities will allow healthcare providers to anticipate progression and adjust treatment or intervention proactively.
