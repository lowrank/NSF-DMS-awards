In this application there are computer programs                 that simulate the physics of the fabrication and the operation                  of semiconductor devices.  The result is that electrical                        properties of semiconductors can be computed as a function of the               process specifications in their fabrication.  A combination of                  long running times for the programs and a large number of                       variables that describe the process make it necessary to use                    statistical techniques to find optimal settings of the input                    variables.

(1)  In the development of                     mathematical tools for molecular biology, the investigators will                study protein sequence analysis, physical mapping, and                          statistical tests for pattern analysis.  (2) Computational                      algorithms will be developed for database searches, sequence                    alignment, and sequence assembly.  (3)  Ongoing work in                         mathematical population genetics includes studies of genealogical               trees, the finite sites models and genealogy and selection.

The first part is concerned with problems of                   estimation and prediction for time series models whose theory is                not yet fully understood.

Nonparametric                   and linear models have been used extensively in many fields.                    Although there are many procedures available for selecting the                  bandwidth or the order, it is recognized that the classical                     selectors are subject to large sample variation, and thus may                   not be very useful in practice.  Recently, using the technique                  of Fourier analysis, the investigator proposed some stabilized                  procedures to reduce the variation in selecting the bandwidth                   for kernel regression of density estimation.
