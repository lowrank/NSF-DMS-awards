Phase transitions are one important theme -- vanishing thresholds for homology or homotopy groups as some parameter varies, for example. Also of interest are more geometric notions, such as isoperimetric inequalities and hyperbolicity. Random cell complexes provide high-dimensional analogues of expander graphs, a subject that has been a very active lately, with connections to random matrix theory. The probabilistic method provides a powerful and general framework for generating objects with extremal geometric properties, and progress in this area will lead to intriguing new examples and counterexamples in topological combinatorics and geometric group theory.<br/><br/>This research draws on several areas of mathematics to study subtle qualitative features of randomly generated shapes. These interactions are of intrinsic interest within mathematics itself, and the work is also being done with a eye towards practical applications in the emerging area of topological data analysis. The educational activities supported by the grant will be naturally integrated with the research, and the PI will mentor graduate and undergraduate researchers working on projects related to the grant. The PI will continue to be involved with various outreach activities: Colorado Math Olympiad, Canada/USA Mathcamp, math circles, undergraduate math clubs, and problem solving seminars."

Topology can be viewed as the study of the structure and shape of the space we live in, particularly of the properties of the space that are not changed as the space is continuously deformed.  There are deep relationships between topology, geometry, and physics, as well as applications to topics such as fluid dynamics, robotics, and image analysis. It is this diversity of approaches to central problems that has always energized research in topology.<br/><br/>The Georgia Topology Conference is an annual event that has been organized by topologists at the University of Georgia over the past half-century. An important aspect of this conference is that the organizers have consistently stressed the participation of new and recent doctoral recipients as speakers and encouraged participation by graduate students. With a format featuring the participation of several senior mathematicians and a larger group of junior researchers, this conference series plays a significant role in both disseminating the newest research and preparing graduate students and postdocs for a successful career in mathematics. The conference encourages and supports participation by members of under-represented groups. The Georgia Topology Conference in 2014 will be centered on the theme of automorphisms of surfaces. <br/><br/>More information can be found on the conference web site<br/>http://www.math.uga.edu/~topology/"

The central objects of study in this area are spaces called 3-manifolds. A 3-manifold is an object that locally looks like the ordinary 3- dimensional space but whose global structure can be complicated. An important part of 3-dimensional topology is also the study of knots (loops embedded in some tangled way in 3-manifolds) and their classification. The solution of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture has established that 3-manifolds (and complements of knots in them) decompose into pieces that admit explicit geometries and that hyperbolic geometry is the one that appears more often. In practice, however, 3-manifolds are often given in terms of combinatorial topological descriptions and it is both natural and important to seek ways to deduce geometric information from these descriptions. One of the ways that topologists have been approaching the study of 3- manifolds is through the use of invariants. In the last few decades ideas originated in physics led mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. Understanding the connections of topological and combinatorial quantities and invariants to geometry is a central and important goal of low dimensional topology. The main theme of this project is to establish such connections and explore their ramifications and applications to other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>This project will establish relationships between geometry and combinatorial descriptions, properties, and quantum invariants of links and 3-manifolds. The PI has developed a setting for establishing new unexpected relations between the colored Jones link polynomials, the topology and geometry of essential surfaces in link complements, and hyperbolic geometry. One part of the project will continue developing this theory and exploring its applications. Another part, will combine several new techniques, to develop methods for recognizing geometric structures on 3-manifolds from purely combinatorial input, and derive estimates on geometric quantities from topological data. A third part will study skein link theory in 3-manifolds, its invariants, and its interaction with geometric decompositions of 3-manifolds.  A fourth part will explore the applicability of  quantum knot invariants to classical questions in knot theory and search for a classification of crossing changes that do not alter the topology of the underlying knots. The project also involves the  research of graduate students currently working with PI."

A theme common to all of the goals of this project is the use of representation theory to study geometric spaces.  Three dimensional topological quantum field theories, quantum link invariants, and vertex operators were all developed in the 1980s and 1990s using various algebraic inputs. One main objective of this project is to lift these constructions to higher dimensions through the use of algebraic structures from representation theory.  This objective is part of a program known as categorification.<br/><br/>The program of categorification was introduced by Louis Crane and Igor Frenkel.  Generally speaking, the aim is that vector spaces should be replaced by categories and actions on vector spaces should be replaced by actions of functors on categories.  The categories involved in this project are of a representation theoretic or combinatorial nature.  New category-theoretic ideas need to be developed in order to achieve the most ambitious goals of the categorification program.  Another part of this project is the application of representation-theoretic techniques to the classification problem of certain algebraic varieties equipped with a group action.  The four areas of this project are the following:  (1) categorification of the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant, (2) categorification of the Turaev-Viro invariant, (3) categorification of Lie superalgebras, and (4) understanding the multiplicative structure of the coordinate rings of affine spherical varieties."

Attending and giving talks at conferences is a necessary part of every mathematician's life, but many conferences cater to established specialists. Such an environment can prove too intimidating for graduate students who wish to give talks of their own. The Binghamton University Graduate Conference in Algebra and Topology (BUGCAT) was specifically designed to meet the need for an alternative. It is a math conference run by graduate students, for graduate students. Like all conferences, BUGCAT provides a gathering place for professors and graduate students from various institutions to present their research to a wider audience, to collaborate, and to share ideas. The focus at the BUGCAT, however, is on the graduate student. The BUGCAT gives graduate students doing research in any area of algebra or topology an opportunity to practice giving talks and to network with other mathematicians sharing related research interests. At the same time, it gives graduate students an opportunity to hear talks by world renowned mathematicians doing groundbreaking work.<br/><br/>This award supports the Binghamton University Graduate Conference in Algebra and Topology, which will take place at Binghamton University on November 17-18, 2014. Now in its seventh year, the BUGCAT is a venue where algebra and topology graduate students in all stages of their research can present their work.  The graduate students who attend the BUGCAT are better equipped to find academic positions and continue research and collaboration.  Attendees are exposed to a wide variety of current research, ideas, and results, and they have ample opportunity to meet senior researchers and students of their generation who may become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging and supporting participation by women and minorities."

A graph is a set of points called vertices and curves between the points called edges.  A spatial graph is a graph that is sitting in three-space.  A spatial graph can be very complicated and knotted.  Spatial graph theory is a recent field which grew out of knot theory, the study of knotted circles in three-space.  In addition to contributing to our understanding of connections between spatial graphs and their surrounding three-space, this project has direct applications to biological questions.  Knot theory has become important within the life sciences, in the field of DNA Topology.  Most of the DNA that is worked with in laboratories is in small circular molecules that are called plasmids.  Circular DNA also appears in nature.  Plasmids can naturally be modeled with knots.  With every cell division the DNA is copied in a process called replication.  This is a complicated process that involves a number of enzymes.  After replication the two new plasmids are linked (or catenated) and sometimes knotted.  The reason for knotting is not completely understood.  In the middle of replication DNA forms the more complicated structures, that of a knotted graph, this is an area of DNA topology that has yet to be investigated by mathematicians.  This project will have immediate contributions to our biological understanding of DNA replication.  <br/><br/><br/>In particular, the PI will focus on three main projects centering around spatial graphs:  First, the PI will study a number of aspects of Legendrian graphs.  Central results in contact geometry use Legendrian graphs in their proofs. Thus this opens an exciting new area with great potential. These projects will increase the overall understanding of Legendrian graphs, further increasing their potential to use Legendrian graphs as a tool to understand 3-manifolds, and potentially distinguish contact structures.  Second, the PI will develop new invariants and better understand existing invariants of spatial graphs and knots, including graph Floer homology.  Third, the PI will begin classification of unknotting number one theta-graphs to understand unknotting in DNA replication intermediates."

Undergraduate students are exposed to a wide variety of current research, ideas, and results, often more comprehensive than the topics available at their home institutions. A one-day workshop at the start of USTARS focuses on specific stages in professional careers and the critical transitions associated with each stage. Participants have the opportunity to network with underrepresented professors and students who may become future collaborators, colleagues, and/or mentors. USTARS participants continue to influence the next generation of students in positive ways by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.

The motive of an algebraic variety is built from geometric relationships, and is designed to be the universal motif for cohomological invariants (hence the name), so its structure reveals aspects of geometry. In contrast, the K-theory of a ring or variety is built from relationships involving linear algebra using algebraic topology, so its structure reveals aspects of algebra and topology. Clarifying the relationships between these constructs will help our understanding of many phenomena that are currently understand only poorly.<br/><br/>One part of the project is to find clean proofs of major pieces of the proof of the recently-verified Bloch-Kato conjecture. This includes trying to: find a general degree formula which combines various degree formulas due to Rost, in terms of algebraic cobordism theory; establish an equivalence between models of the symmetric powers of a normal variety; and understand motivic cohomology operations better. These all play a role in the proof. This part of the project will be invaluable in training young researchers around the world. A related part of the project is to understand how Voevodsky's slice filtration is related to algebraic cobordism and other motivic spectra. The goal is to verify several of the slice conjectures, especially in finite characteristic, using homological algebra and algebraic Thom spaces. Part of this will be joint work with graduate students, contributing to their training. The project will also study the relationship between the singularities of a variety, its K-theory and its cdh-cohomology, using recently developed cohomological techniques and the relationship to cyclic homology and de Rham-Witt theory. This should shed some light on classes of singularities related to du Bois singularities. The final part of the project is to formulate an archimedean cohomology for a motive over a number field and relate it to Serre's local factors for the L-functions of the motive. This generalizes work of Connes and Consani, and uses cyclic homology for schemes."

The Midwest is a traditional and continuing center of algebraic topology; hence there is a strong source of local speakers. Programs are augmented with featured speakers from around the country. The audiences are always large and diversified, drawing faculty and graduate students from a broad range of institutions. The Midwest Topology Seminar serves as a nexus for a vibrant community of research mathematicians, optimizing the distribution of new ideas through the field, especially among early career research mathematicians and mathematicians away from the traditional centers of research.

Almost all surfaces appeared in any computer screen are polyhedral surfaces. An urgent task is to produce a coarse categorization and classification of these surfaces. A mile stone result in mathematics dealing with surfaces is the classical uniformization theorem of Poincare-Koebe.  It is an extremely powerful tool to classify smooth surfaces in the 3-space up to angle preserving diffeomorphisms (i.e., conformality). However, to algorithmically implement the classical uniformization theorem is very difficult. The PI and his collaborators introduced a discrete counterpart of conformality and proved a discrete version of uniformization theorem for polyhedral surfaces recently. This proposal investigates theoretically whether the discrete conformal geometry converges to the smooth conformal geometry as triangulation meshes become finer and finer.  The numerical evidences for the convergence are very strong.  The successful resolution of the convergence issue will have impacts on the applications of the discrete uniformization theorem in many fields.<br/><br/>The classical uniformization theorem of Poincare and Koebe is the most powerful tool to classify smooth surfaces with Riemannian metrics according to conformal diffeomorphisms.  This theorem is one of the pillars of the 20th century mathematics and has a wide range of applications within and outside mathematics. However, it is very difficult to use it algorithmically for categorizing polyhedral surfaces. Luo and his collaborators introduced a notion of discrete conformality for polyhedral surfaces and proved a discrete uniformization theorem recently. Two main features of the discrete conformality are the following. First, the discrete conformality is algorithmic and second, there exists a finite dimensional (convex) variational principle to find the discrete uniformization metric. The goal of the proposal is to investigate several major remaining issues in the discrete conformal geometry of polyhedral surfaces. For instance, there are strong numerical evidences suggesting that the discrete conformality converges to smooth (classical) conformality when the triangulations are suitably chosen. However, a theoretical proof of it is still lacking. This is the main problem to be resolved in the proposal. Luo plans to use the finite dimensional variational principles that he developed in the past 10 years to approach the convergence problem."

It is the purpose of this proposal to use techniques in topology to solve long-standing open problems in number theory, and to use results in number theory to establish new and interesting projects in topology.  The central themes are that topology provides an incredibly flexible tool for doing computations of objects of importance in number theory, and that number theory provides very interesting examples of objects useful to topologists.<br/><br/>Specifically, this proposal aims to establish number-theoretic conjectures of Malle and others in the setting of function fields using computations of the homology of Hurwitz spaces of branched covers.  We will further develop invariants of Lefschetz fibrations using this machinery.  In the opposite direction, we will use the arithmetic of etale cohomology to re-imagine the theory of p-compact groups as a form of arithmetic geometry.  These techniques should, for instance, lead to a further development of the representation theory of these objects.  Lastly, we will pursue computations in stable homotopy theory using arithmetic and geometric techniques via the chromatic homotopy theory program."

The investigator plans to use the framework provided by these disciplines to create and teach courses for and mentor high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>More specifically, the principal investigator will investigate the DT invariants of 2-dimensional sheaves in Calabi-Yau threefolds inspired by ""M5-brane elliptic genera"" and ""BPS invariants of D4-D2-D0 systems"" studied by string theorists. The PI plans to prove 1) the modularity of these DT invariants and  2) find their relation to the ""BPS invariants of D6-D2-D0 systems"" predicted from dualities in string theory. The latter BPS invariants are manifested in DT invariants of 1-dimensional sheaves as well as in GW invariants. The PI also plans to develop an algorithm for computing the rank 2 DT invariants of toric threefolds and then study their properties. This is known as the ""Topological Vertex Algorithm"" and has been a very powerful tool for computing GW and rank 1 DT invariants of the toric threefolds. The advanced tools that will be employed for these projects are localization, deformation, degeneration, categorification, wall-crossing, and mirror symmetry techniques."

This subject arose from several threads in the 19th century: (1) symmetries of crystals, which developed into the theory of crystallographic groups; (2) conformal mapping, and the corresponding holomorphic differential equations and their monodromy groups, which led to the classical theory of uniformization; (3) classical differential geometry of surfaces, generalized to Riemannian geometry, and later to Lorentzian geometry influenced by Einstein's theory of gravitation. The notion of a geometry itself was algebraicized by Felix Klein, who interpreted a geometry as the properties invariant under a transitive action of a Lie group. The present study investigates the possible ways of putting a geometric structure on a topological manifold in terms of the fundamental group and the Lie group. The goal is to describe when a given topology (often described by a combinatorial object) can be given the given geometry. In several cases, there is a complete classification of geometric structures, and the moduli space itself enjoys both a rich geometry of its own and symmetries of its own, which lead to intricate dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The specific goals and scope of this project involve flat projective and conformal structures, especially in dimension three. The recent classification of complete affine 3-manifolds leads to many questions about more general structures. In particular the proposal asked which groups which admit proper affine actions; at present the only known hyperbolic groups are free groups. The methods involve a combination of dynamical systems, algebraic group theory, topology and geometric group theory and representation theory. Other important questions include finding obstructions for a 3-manifold to admit a projective structure; at present only one such closed 3-manifold is known. Computer experiments can help in this direction, and projects in the Experimental Geometry Lab can suggest new examples of geometric structures."

Understanding these spaces and structures is central to understanding the shape of our macroscopic universe, and many of the theories the PI intends to study have applications and origins in physics. A major goal of the PI's proposal is to develop methods which might be used to unify several existing and important tools for studying 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds. Such a unification would likely reveal interesting connections between quite disparate fields of mathematics. The PI also plans to use some of these tools to study contact structures and knots in new ways. Both serve as probes by which to study 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds. Contact structures are also important in classical mechanics, thermodynamics, dynamical systems, and in the study of liquid crystals, while knot theory has found many recent applications in the study of DNA knotting. This proposal also contains several explicit directions for student research, at both undergraduate and graduate levels, and will support the PI's teaching and mentoring activities.<br/><br/>Over the last couple decades, Floer theory has revolutionized the study of the topology and geometry of smooth manifolds in dimensions 3 and 4. There are multiple distinct Floer theories for 3-manifolds defined using techniques from quite different branches of mathematics. Amazingly several of these theories appear to give the same information, indicating deep connections between fields like symplectic geometry and gauge theory. These connections have lead to beautiful results like Taubes' proof of the Weinstein conjecture. Despite remarkable progress in understanding these connections, one wonders whether there is a simpler, unifying explanation. Indeed, a fundamental open problem and a distant lodestar for the PI's proposal is to axiomatize Floer theory. One approach to this and to the related problem of computing Floer theories is to develop invariants of bordered 3-manifolds and a means of computing the invariant of a closed manifold from those of its pieces. The first such invariant was defined by Lipshitz, Ozsvath, and Szabo in Heegaard Floer homology. The PI's proposed bordered monopole Floer theory is novel in that it may provide methods for computing invariants of 4-manifolds as well (it is defined in the HM-from, ""master"" version, of monopole Floer homology), and can likely be ported to other Floer theories (an important ingredient for an approach to axiomatization). This proposal will support the further development of this theory. A closely related aspect of the proposal involves fleshing out connections between Floer theory and Khovanov homology, an invariant of links motivated by representation theory. Such connections were instrumental, for example, in Kronheimer and Mrowka's celebrated proof that Khovanov homology detects the unknot. Often these connections arise in the form of a spectral sequence from Khovanov homology and Floer thoery. A goal of this project is to better understand these spectral sequences. The PI proposes a means for combinatorially computing their terms and for proving that the sequences are functorial with respect to link cobordisms. The hope is to use these combinatorial methods and functoriality to better understand Floer invariants in dimensions 3 and 4. A final, complementary aspect of this proposal involves defining new invariants of contact structures. The PI has done so in recent work, using instanton and monopole Floer homology. An exciting future project is to use the instanton Floer invariant to uncover hitherto unexplored links between the Stein and symplectic fillings of a contact 3-manifold and its fundamental group."

Three projects aim to use topological methods to understand the Brauer group, Azumaya algebras, and more generally torsors on schemes. (1) The PI will study the extent to which the foundational results of Jackowski, McClure, and Oliver on maps between classifying spaces of complex algebraic groups can be extended to finite approximations to these classifying spaces. Progress on this problem will enable the solution of a host of problems about when torsors for complex algebraic groups extend from the generic point of a scheme to the entire scheme. In low dimensions, early progress on this problem has been used by the PI and Ben Williams to settle an old question of Auslander and Goldman on the existence of Azumaya maximal orders in unramified division algebras, where it transpires that there are purely topological obstructions to the existence of these Azumaya maximal orders. (2) The PI will work toward computing the Chow groups and singular cohomology of the classifying spaces of special linear groups by various central subgroups. This has been done in special cases by Vezzosi and Vistoli. However, greater generality is needed for most applications. These Chow groups are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry, controlling the characteristic classes associated to certain torsors of fundamental importance in the study of the Brauer group. The computations will be directly useful to the first project, and to the following project. (3) The PI and Ben Williams previously formulated the topological period-index problem and established first results. They will continue this study, especially as it relates to the algebraic period-index conjecture. In particular, their results in low dimensions suggest a method for disproving the period-index conjecture, which would be a fundamental advance. Following this idea to its conclusion is the major aspiration of the first set of projects. A fourth project aims to continue to build a bridge between higher category theory and classical algebraic geometry, bringing the formidable techniques of the former to bear on various questions in the arithmetic of derived categories. For example, the PI is developing a toolbox using higher category theory that will allow a purely derived-category proof of Panin's computations of the K-theory of projective homogeneous spaces, once the existence of certain exceptional objects on the split forms of these spaces is known.<br/><br/>The PI proposes work in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, two areas of modern mathematics. Algebraic geometry is an ancient subject with many connections to real-world problems. Its goal is to understand the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, equations of central importance in various disciplines, such as theoretical physics, cryptography, and the modeling of dynamical systems like weather. Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to the analysis of large data sets that occur in computer vision and cancer research, frequently finding patterns that more traditional methods of data analysis fail to find. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several questions in algebraic geometry which have been identified by the community as among the most important."

Northwestern has a long history of successful 'emphasis years' following the broad pattern of the proposed activities.  This year's emphasis will be placed on connecting new physics to mathematics.  Recent advanced in physics pioneered by Nekrasov-Shatashvili, Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa, and Kapustin-Witten have spawned hundreds of papers and interest around the globe.  A mathematical perspective has been offered by Maulik-Okounkov and there is related work of Goncharov-Kenyon.  These results should be understood not only on their own merit, but also as a part of a broader emerging relationship between integrable systems, representation theory and quantum fields.  The workshop and conference will do just that.  The bulk of the proposed funding will support graduate students and postdocs either directly, by funding their participation, or indirectly by funding speakers at the graduate workshop.  These students will largely be US nationals from US institutions, thus furthering the goal of the solicitation to support the development of professional mathematicians in the United States.<br/><br/>The general theme of the program is to explore the interplay between symmetry groups and the physical systems in which they arise.  Physical phenomena have analogous mathematical descriptions, and vice versa:  the geometric Langlands program has an analogue in a dimensional reduction of a topologically twisted supersymmetric gauge theory, through the work of Kapustin and Witten.  The Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa conjecture relates two-dimensional conformal field theory to four-dimensional supersymmetric theories. A mathematical manifestation of this conjecture is the action of  Virasoro and W-algebras on the cohomology of moduli spaces of bundles on a complex surface constructed by Maulik and Okounkov.  Integrable systems relating to string compactification on singular Calabi-Yau threefolds have descriptions as dimer problems in statistical physics, which in turn relate to cluster integrable systems (Nekrasov-Shatashvili, Kenyon-Goncharov).  All of these phenomena will be explored in the workshop and conference.   The conference webpage is located at the following address:  http://www.math.northwestern.edu/emphasisyear/."

Church<br/><br/>The physical distinction between bosons and fermions explains why photons can cohere into a laser, or helium-4 nuclei into a superfluid, whereas neutrons resist each other, as is necessary for the stability of neutron stars. Mathematically, this distinction is explained by the shape of their configuration space, which describes all possible ways that a collection of indistinguishable particles (such as photons or neutrons) can be configured in space. The investigator studies configuration spaces via their symmetries, proving that no matter what space the particles move within, the topology of configurations will stabilize, yielding identical behavior no matter how many particles are present. Configurations in restricted spaces have widespread applications: when electrons are confined to 2-dimensional surfaces as in field-effect transistors, new topology on the configuration space predicts new types of quasiparticles, which manifest in the fractional quantum Hall effect; in robotics, the topology of robots configured on a factory floor describes when one robot can be trapped by others. The proposed project would extend this stability to new types of configuration spaces possessing even more symmetry, whose stability cannot currently be understood or proved.  The investigator will also develop and teach Math Discovery Lab, a new discovery-based course for undergraduates which develops critical skills in independent research. Students in MDL will investigate open-ended problems, collect data via computer experimentation and simulation, formulate conjectures, and prove theorems about their results, presenting their findings through written reports and lectures.<br/><br/>The investigator's research focuses on representation stability, a technique applying representation theory to stability problems in topology and algebra. Representation stability has been very successful, leading to 20+ papers since its introduction by the investigator three years ago. The investigator proposes to extend and strengthen the power of representation stability by undertaking a long-term project to develop the combinatorial, categorical, and homological properties of FI-categories. These provide a coherent framework for studying a wide variety of symmetry groups, including many which could not be handled using previous methods. The proposed project will unify four distinct strands of stability as facets of the same theory: representation stability, homological stability, twisted stability, and central stability. A key advance is that the dependence on representation theory is removed, replaced instead by the combinatorial and homological properties of FI-categories, so that representation stability can be applied even to integral or modular representations."

Manifolds are a generalized concepts of space, appearing all over mathematics and science.  The defining property of a manifold is that it is locally parametrized by a finite number of parameters (for example, the surface of the earth can locally be parametrized by two parameters, namely longitude and latitude).  A classical topic in algebraic topology, Galatius' field of research, is the classification of manifolds: How does one decide whether two manifolds are isomorphic, and how does one write a list of all possible manifolds?  The research conducted here concerns the related question of classifying how manifolds may vary in families: what are their symmetries and what are their deformations.  The research conducted under this grant will apply new methods to study these classical and important questions.  Another part of the research conducted under this grant concerns deformations of objects arising from number theory, studied using methods from homotopy theory.<br/><br/>The proposed activity will continue the development of a relatively new area of mathematics in which homotopy theory is used to study various moduli spaces.  An important early result this area is the solution, by Madsen and Weiss, of a conjecture of Mumford.  Significant new developments have happened since then, many of which, such as the solution to a 1995 conjecture of Hatcher, are due to the principal investigator.  This subject lies in the overlap between algebraic topology and other branches of mathematics, with expected applications in algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and possibly theoretical physics.  Another part of the project concerns applications of homotopy theoretic ideas in number theory.  Working in a derived setting is a very familiar idea in homotopy theory, and has often been successfully imported into algebra and other fields.

The project will develop and apply these techniques to Galois representations, objects of fundamental importance in number theory."

This international meeting will bring together junior researchers in the mathematical fields of algebraic and geometric topology, and provide an opportunity for them to speak publicly about their research and to learn about recent developments by their future colleagues.  Mini-courses will give broader introductions to two important subjects in the field, as seen through the eyes of more experienced researchers.  The conference provides opportunities for networking, for meeting future research colleagues, and for forming research collaborations.  Previous instances of the YTM have had mostly participants based at European institutions; support from this award will enhance opportunities for international collaboration by allowing more significant participation of US-based junior researchers. The diverse atmosphere at the conference and among the speakers and participants will also encourage people from underrepresented groups to pursue research careers in topology.<br/><br/>The YTM is an annual event, alternating between Copenhagen and Lausanne, Switzerland, organized mainly by graduate students and postdocs.  The meeting will consist mainly of talks given by junior topologists, in addition to two mini-course lecture series given by distinguished senior researchers.  The lecture series this year will be given by Jacob Lurie (Harvard University, US), who will speak about Tamagawa numbers via algebraic topology, and Lars Hesselholt (Nagoya University, Japan and University of Copenhagen, Denmark), who will speak about trace methods in algebraic K-theory.

In this project, the PI proposes to develop two possible approaches to calculate the hyperbolic structure on 3-manifolds, and an approach of quantizing the spaces of certain geometric structures. Part of the intellectual merit of the proposal comes from the fact that it lies at the  frontier of its research area, and also provides a link between different beaches of mathematics, and between mathematics and theoretical physics. During the last ten years, most major open problems on 3-manifolds have been solved, including the Geometrization Conjecture and the Virtually Fibered Conjecture. However, 3-manifolds are still far from being classified. Based on those great achievements, the PI plans on making a further progress in understanding the geometry and topology of 3-manifolds. As a broader impact, the PI plans on involving graduate students in his work. Stanford University has a large number of excellent graduate students, a good amount of which are interested in geometry and topology. As such, the PI is planning to teach a series of graduate courses on the topics, and should start collaborations with some of the graduate students in the future. This work also involves collaborations with people from outside the University.<br/><br/>Due to Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture and Perelman's proof, the interior of every compact 3-manifold has a canonical decomposition into geometric pieces, most of which have a unique hyperbolic structure. In turns, explicitly calculating the hyperbolic structure becomes necessary to understand the geometry and topology of 3-manifolds. The PI's first approach is to realize Casson's program using angle structures and volume optimization. This amounts to finding an ideal triangulation of the 3-manifold that admits the maximum volume angle structure. A good family of candidates come from Lackenby's taut ideal triangulations; and we propose to examine if some of them admit the maximum volume angle structure. The second approach consists in studying the hyperbolic cone metrics on triangulated 3-manifolds developed recently by the PI and a collaborator. The key object in this approach is the space of combinatorial curvatures of all hyperbolic cone metrics on a given triangulated 3-manifold, the zero vector belonging to which implies the existence of the hyperbolic structure. The quantum invariants and their relationship with classical geometric structures provides another possible approach to understand the geometry and topology of 3-manifolds. At the heart of this relationship is the Teichmuller space and character varieties of surfaces, which in their nature contain all the geometric information of the surfaces and are candidates for quantization. The PI's approach is based on a relationship between the quantum Teichmuller space and the skein algebra of arcs and links developed by the PI and a collaborator. The key observation in this construction is that Penner's Ptolemy relation satisfied by the lambda-lengths of geodesic arcs could be viewed as a skein relation. In turns, the related objects fit into the picture of Bullock--Frohman--Kania-Bartoszynska and Przytycki--Sikora for the skein quantization of the SL(2,C)-character variety. Ultimately, the PI wants to develop a topological quantum field theory associated to the non-compact Lie group PSL(2,R) using the skein quantization."

They are important in geometry, physics and number theory. Moduli spaces of curves parametrize all curves of a given topological type. This type is classified by a whole number called the genus of the curve. Some questions about moduli spaces of curves of all genera can be resolved by answering the the questions in genus zero and one. This proposal focuses on understanding the interaction between the topology of moduli spaces of curves, especially in genus one and the ""arithmetic symmetries"" of topological invariants of the moduli spaces. Resolving such basic questions is important in advancing our understanding of whole numbers and of the topological symmetries of zero sets of polynomials.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to understand motivic aspects of completions of fundamental groups and path torsors of moduli spaces of curves in all genera $\ge 0$. Although motivic structures on path torsors of moduli spaces of genus 0 curves are reasonably well understood (work of Deligne-Goncharov and Brown), fundamental problems remain, such as determining the Zariski closure of the image of the absolute Galois group in the automorphism group of the unipotent fundamental group of the thrice punctured projective line (a de~Rham version of the Grothendieck-Teichmuller program), and understanding why and how classical cusp forms impose relations in the associated graded of its depth filtration. Much of the PI's attention will be focused on the genus one case as it is the most central and also because of its connection to the theory of classical modular forms.  It influences the genus 0 case by degeneration to the nodal cubic and should help explain why modular forms impose conditions on the Galois action on the unipotent fundamental group of the thrice punctured projective line. The higher genus cases can be reduced to the genus zero and one cases by results in topology that go back to Harer. This project will also clarify Manin's work on iterated Shimura integrals and arithmetic aspects of the elliptic KZB equation, which arose in physics, but plays a special role in this project."

This project focuses on one current area of interplay, between topology (the study of shapes) on the mathematical side and string theory on the physics side. The jumping-off point for the project is an intriguing and unexpected connection, recently discovered by the Principal Investigator and collaborators on both sides, between two separate algebraic structures associated to knots in space: one in topology developed by the Principal Investigator, and one in string theory that has been the focus of much research in the past few years. In the course of this project, the Principal Investigator will establish this connection, which is currently only supported circumstantially; it is hoped that this work will create and strengthen new lines of communication between mathematics and physics, introducing techniques from each discipline into the other. The Principal Investigator will also use this project to train future mathematicians at all levels, from contributing to the annual USA Mathematical Olympiad for high school students, to supervising the research of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, to organizing conferences and seminars for established researchers.<br/><br/>In the past decade, the Principal Investigator has introduced and studied a package of knot invariants called knot contact homology, which arises by counting holomorphic curves in certain symplectic manifolds, using a method in symplectic geometry pioneered by Gromov and Floer and more recently culminating in the Symplectic Field Theory of Eliashberg, Givental, and Hofer. Previous work has shown that knot contact homology is a robust invariant that is effective at distinguishing knots and contains classical topological information about the knot. In 2012, it was discovered by Aganagic, Ekholm, Vafa, and the Principal Investigator that knot contact homology has an unexpected and potentially powerful relation to string theory and mirror symmetry: the augmentation polynomial, a knot invariant derived from knot contact homology, is conjectured to be equal to Aganagic and Vafa's Q-deformed A-polynomial, which arises in the context of topological strings. The Principal Investigator will approach this conjecture using Lagrangian fillings and Gromov-Witten potentials. This could have significant ramifications in different directions: in knot theory, it would establish a variant of the AJ conjecture; in mirror symmetry, it would produce a new approach via Symplectic Field Theory to constructing mirror Calabi-Yau 3-folds; and in topological string theory, it would provide a mathematical foundation for recent results. In related work, the Principal Investigator will develop and strengthen the algebraic framework underneath certain aspects of Symplectic Field Theory, including knot contact homology and symplectic homology. New algebraic tools in this context, such as representation theory for differential graded algebras, would enable one to more effectively attack problems in symplectic geometry, in particular by analyzing Weinstein structures on symplectic manifolds and Legendrian and transverse knots in contact manifolds."

Dabkowski, Tobias Hagge, Viswanath Ramakrishna<br/><br/>A conference on Knot Theory and its Applications to Physics and Quantum Computing is to be held at the University of Texas at Dallas in October 2014.  Knot theory is the branch of topology that studies the many ways that a circle can be placed within three-dimensional space - a motivating question is whether an apparently knotted circle is genuinely knotted, or whether it looks more complicated than it really is.  Techniques that are currently used and under development have been shown to be capable of making that distinction between knotted and unknotted circles, and are opening up new challenges in algebra as well as topology.  Connections of knot theory to physics often involve quantum theory, and one of the topics of this conference is quantum computing, the effort to apply the distinctive properties of quantum mechanical systems such as entanglement to obtain computational speedups that greatly exceed the limitations of current hardware.  Speakers at this conference are expected to include some of the leading researchers in topological aspects of quantum computing.<br/><br/>Some of the main topics for the planned conference include: (1) connections between knot theory and quantum computing - such as Temperley-Lieb recoupling, unitary representations of the braid group and entangled states, unitary solutions to the Yang-Baxter equations, GHZ states and extra special 2-groups, fusion algebra of Majorana fermions, (2) invariants of knots and 3-manifolds, including Khovanov homology, skein modules, and related ideas; and (3) applications of knot and link invariants to finding higher order invariants and sharper energy bounds for energy for magnetic and vorticity fields."

Our first foundational objective is to develop equivariant versions of the many known models for homotopical higher categories and to establish equivalences between them.  Our first proposed application is the development of homotopical approaches to equivariant extended topological field theories.  The second application is the development of topological cluster categories arising from surfaces; extending to higher dimensions should allow for the development of new invariants of higher-dimensional manifolds analogous to ones for surfaces.  This second application should also inform the first, with higher-dimensional cluster categories giving new information about topological field theories.  The third application is concerned with connections between Hall algebras and algebraic K-theory.  In one direction, constructions of homotopical Hall algebras are expected to give rise to K-theory spectra which should give new information about Hall algebras, especially those related to quantum groups.  In another, variations of Hall algebra constructions have corresponding variants of algebraic K-theory which are worthy of further investigation.  <br/><br/>Broadly speaking, this proposal is concerned with incorporating algebraic information into categorical and topological structures which are currently being used in a wide range of kinds of mathematics.  We then seek to apply these enhanced structures in mathematical physics, manifold theory, and representation theory.  The educational component of this proposal consists of a series of four summer workshops for mathematics majors who are in the process of transferring to UC Riverside.  The goal is to help twenty participants each year to make the transition to upper-level mathematics via introduction to proof techniques, more theoretical concepts, and a broad overview of the range of topics in higher-level mathematics courses.  Students will be provided with some follow-up mentoring activities, including opportunities for participating in undergraduate research."

The mechanisms to provide such training will include an undergraduate research class during the school year taught by graduate students, a summer undergraduate research program run by graduate students under the guidance of senior faculty, undergraduate mentoring by postdoctoral fellows, a background seminar for graduate students and others, a geometry and topology colloquium, hot topics courses taught by senior faculty, summer graduate workshops taught by postdoctoral fellows, and an exchange program with the Max-Planck-Institute in Bonn. The project will involve approximately three postdoctoral associates, twelve graduate students per year, twelve undergraduates in each of the undergraduate research programs, and thirty participants in each of the summer graduate workshops. The proposed training activities will increase the number of US citizens and permanent residents entering and continuing in mathematics research, both directly and indirectly: directly via the recruiting and support of the trainees in the group, and indirectly via the establishment of models for research training that can be emulated elsewhere."

Algebraic topology associates algebraic objects to topological spaces in order to tell them apart.  Some of the most powerful algebraic tools for doing this are ""cohomology theories"". A certain sequence of cohomology theories called the Morava E-theories have a deep and somewhat understood connection to algebraic geometry and an important conjectural relationship with geometry. The first two Morava E-theories are classical; however, the rest are quite mysterious. The goal of this project is to use the connection to algebraic geometry to play different Morava E-theories off each other in order to expose properties of the conjectural geometry. <br/><br/>The PI plans to study the relationship between the chromatic layers in order to expose the geometry that lurks behind the scenes in chromatic homotopy theory. He will do this by pursuing three interrelated programs. The PI will use the algebraic geometry of p-divisible groups, generalized character theory, and field theories (in the sense of Stolz-Teichner) to attack the problem. In joint work with Schommer-Pries, the PI hopes to give a field theoretic construction of higher chromatic cohomology theories such as Morava E-theory. Also of particular interest are ""transchromatic"" proofs of classical theorems that lead to more general results. For instance, in work with Tomer Schlank, the PI has given a new proof of Strickland's theorem on the Morava E-theory of symmetric groups that naturally leads to a generalization of the theorem to wreath products of finite abelian groups with symmetric groups. One of the main tools in the proof is a character map from E-theory to p-adic K-theory that allows one to reduce certain problems in E-theory to representation theory. This map deserves further study."

Such ""spaces"" of geometric structures are called moduli spaces. The investigator's project is dedicated to a study of moduli spaces of surfaces, a key feature of the work being the interaction of geometry and algebra in the study of moduli. Some of this work will be conducted with the assistance of graduate students. The investigator will develop a graduate topics course in moduli spaces to stimulate interaction between students working in geometry and topology and those working in algebra.

The second project concerns the geometry of surface bundles and their relation to topology and algebra.  In particular, the investigator will study distinctions between a number of geometric properties of subgroups of mapping class groups in analogy with more classical work in Kleinian groups, and will also continue a search for atoroidal surfaces bundles over surfaces.  The third portion of the proposed work is dedicated to a study of the deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  In particular, the investigator will continue study of certain analytic functions between Teichmuller spaces introduced by Thurston in his approach to his Geometrization conjecture, which come to bear on problems related to making Geometrization effective, as well as toward understanding certain pathology in the study of general deformation spaces of 3-manifolds."

Both  invariants associate chain complexes to knots whose chain homotopy types (and consequently, homology groups) are knot invariants. This project has two major research goals. The first goal is to extend various aspects of these homological invariants to stable homotopy types, i.e., construct new knot invariant topological spaces (well-defined up to stable homotopy equivalences) whose homology groups are the existing invariants. This will produce higher structures on the homological invariants which will be useful for studying certain geometric properties of knots, such as their four-ball genus. The second goal of this project is to study the relationship between the homological invariants. The project seeks to find new spectral sequences, and combinatorial reformulations of the existing spectral sequences, from the Khovanov homology invariants to the knot Floer homology invariants. This will lead to a better understanding of why these two invariants coming from very different origins share so many similarities.<br/><br/>Topology is the branch of mathematics that studies shapes of spaces; and low dimensional topology concentrates on spaces up to dimension four. Knot theory is an important sub-field of low dimensional topology where one studies one-dimensional objects inside three-dimensional spaces, for example, knotted pieces of strings inside the (three-dimensional Euclidean) space that we live in. In addition to being an extremely valuable tool in low dimensional topology, knot theory has also proven to be useful in real world applications: from analysing knotting in DNA to studying mixing in liquids, and from estimating energies of orbits inside a magnetic field to creating new data encryption schemes. A fundamental problem in knot theory is the knot isotopy problem: to determine if a given knot can transform into another one without tearing or crossing itself (such a transformation is called a knot isotopy). Knot invariants are mathematical objects, such as numbers or groups, that one associates to knots, and which remain unchanged during such a knot isotopy. Therefore, knot invariants are used extensively in the knot isotopy problem: if one finds some knot invariant that takes different values on the two given knots, then one concludes that the two knots are not isotopic. The current project is based on knot theory, and it seeks to study properties of certain previously known knot invariants, and to extend them to construct new knot invariants. The project will lead to dispersion of mathematical knowledge, particularly in the area of low-dimensional topology, via a variety of means. This project will fund undergraduate students for summer research, week-long workshops on low-dimensional topology, and a wiki-based website on knot theory."

Much of the interesting topological information about a 3- or 4-dimensional space is captured in the types of surfaces that are embedded in that space, and this project aims to obtain restrictions on the types of such surfaces that can be found in various classes of spaces. The PI's primary tools come from Heegaard Floer homology, a package of invariants that has become one of the dominant areas of research in low-dimensional topology since its introduction in the early 2000s by Ozsvth and Szab. These techniques bring together several different fields of mathematics, including representation theory, homological algebra, analysis, and mathematical physics, and the PI hopes to elucidate the connections between these different areas and expand the discourse among researchers in these fields. <br/><br/>The specific goals of the project are (1) to understand the relationship between the Heegaard Floer homology of a 3-manifold and topological properties such as the existence of incompressible surfaces, taut foliations, and left-orderings on the fundamental group; (2) to solve concrete topological problems regarding smoothly embedded surfaces in 4-manifolds, in part by using new computational techniques made possible by bordered Floer homology; and (3) to use the recently-developed spanning tree models for knot Floer homology and Khovanov homology to shed light on the long-conjectured relationship between the two theories."

Because classical physics describes our universe to be a 3-dimensional space, the classification of 3-dimensional spaces is an important mathematical endeavor, since it may have ramifications for the global structure of our universe. One of the most broad and interesting classes of 3-dimensional spaces are ""hyperbolic manifolds"", which are described by discrete groups of two by two complex matrices. These groups can have manifestations as higher-dimensional matrices, which the PI plans to explore. The importance for the study of 3-dimensional spaces may stem from the study of ""bundles"" over the spaces, which attach vector data to each point in the 3-dimensional space. The PI plans to investigate the moduli of such bundles, both in terms of dimension, and number of components (which structures can be deformed to each other). The project plans to take advantage of recent advances in the understanding of 3-dimensional hyperbolic spaces discovered by the PI and others. There may be ramifications for the algorithmic classification of 3-dimensional spaces and their invariants.<br/><br/><br/>This project proposes several avenues of study regarding representations of 3-manifold groups. The PI will investigate the profinite completions of hyperbolic 3-manifold groups. In particular, the PI will explore which information about a 3-manifold may be extracted from the  finite quotients of its fundamental group, including hyperbolic volume and rank. The PI proposes to investigate the dimension of the space of faithful irreducible representations as the dimension of the representations increases. The PI plans to use right-angled Artin groups and embeddings of 3-manifolds into them to investigate this question. A related question is to investigate the growth of the number of volumes of n-dimensional representations of hyperbolic 3-manifold groups as n increases. Finally, the PI will investigate twisted-homology of hyperbolic taut sutured 3-manifolds. In particular, the PI would like to  find criteria for when they are twisted SL(2,C)-homology products, motivated by the problem of determining when twisted SL(2,C) Alexander polynomials detect the Seifert genus (or more generally Thurston norm)."

When one restricts to configurations with a fixed energy, one typically obtains a contact manifold. Understanding the geometry of symplectic manifolds and contact manifolds is thus important to understanding the dynamics of physical systems. The following two geometric questions about such manifolds are of particular interest. First, one would like to understand Reeb orbits on contact manifolds, which correspond to physical behavior which repeats over time. Second, one would like to understand when one symplectic manifold can be symplectically embedded into another, in order to better understand the relations between different symplectic manifolds. Contact homology is a powerful tool, currently under development, which can be applied to both of these questions.<br/><br/>The project will develop the foundations, computation, and applications of various kinds of contact homology. In particular, embedded contact homology (ECH) will be extended to a functor on three-dimensional contact manifolds and four-dimensional strong symplectic cobordisms. The foundations of ECH and other kinds of contact homology will be constructed directly in terms of holomorphic curves when possible, in order to more closely relate them to geometry. ECH capacities (quantitative invariants which obstruct symplectic embeddings in four dimensions) will be computed in more examples and related to geodesic flows and Hamiltonian dynamics. Analogues of ECH capacities for other kinds of contact homology, such as cylindrical contact homology and rational symplectic field theory, will be constructed and studied. These new tools will be used to explore whether the Weinstein conjecture can be extended by increasing the lower bound on the number of Reeb orbits or proving the existence of short Reeb orbits."

Gauge theory, in special cases, is believed to underline the mathematical description of the universe; for example, the standard model for particle physics is a gauge theory in 4 dimensions. Much mathematical research into quantum physics over the last half-century has focussed on the analysis required to make accurate experimental predictions, but what was missed until the last decade or two was that topological (distance-independent) features of the theory are governed by an underlying algebra, which has some novel and unexplored features. The PI will study fundamental questions pertaining to this algebra in low dimension.<br/><br/>The main project aims at a rigid description of topological gauge theory (the so-called A-model) by the tested technique of mirror symmetry, which converts ""soft"" topological questions, defined up to coherent systems of homotopies, into rigid questions of analytic or algebraic geometry. The PI has a proposal for the mirror of pure gauge theory in 3 dimensions, which controls the gauging and 2-dimensional gauge theories such as arise from symplectic manifolds with Hamiltonian group actions. Another component of the research involves gauge theory in 3 dimensions, specifically Chern-Simons theory, which seems to lie half-way between the soft A- and the rigid B-model. Finally, a small project involving representation theory (geometric Langlands duality for algebraic curves) will be undertaken: the construction of a generic Langlands kernel for simply laced groups, which relies on cohomological and algebro-geometric techniques, but the subject is informed and inspired by electric-magnetic duality for gauge theory in 4 dimensions."

Specifically, there will be two valuable instances of such dualizing modules. One will be studied in joint work with Tomer Schlank; it will give a homotopical extension of the arithmetic duality theorems of Tate-Poitou, which state that the cohomology of certain absolute Galois groups has a twisted form of self-duality. The PI and Tomer Schlank will also investigate applications of such duality results to problems of existence of rational points on algebraic varieties. A different example is related to the spectra of topological modular forms with or without level structures. Previous work of the PI suggests that the spectrally derived moduli stack of generalized elliptic curves has a simply describable dualizing sheaf of commutative ring spectra; an objective of the proposed project is to prove that result. Topological modular forms are crucial for understanding v2 periodic homotopy in the sphere spectrum; though somewhat removed from the theme of duality, the PI will collaborate with Mark Behrens, Kyle Ormsby, and Nathaniel Stapleton to compute the cooperations in the homology based on connective topological modular forms. <br/><br/><br/>Duality is a pervasive concept in mathematics; the proposed project will study different types of duality in a unified framework, thereby arriving at novel and otherwise inaccessible information. In particular, the project is motivated by the idea that introducing a homotopical viewpoint can shed new light on our understanding of geometry and arithmetic. One of the objects with such curious self-duality properties, namely topological modular forms, lends itself to vast applications, some already explored and others not, as it mirrors itself in homotopy, algebraic geometry, number theory, and even quantum field theory as the receptacle of the Witten genus."

The aim of this project is to understand aspects of  this relationship, with the prospect of creating new computational tools in homotopy theory.  <br/><br/>This project concerns the theory of power operations in equivariant cohomology theories.

Group theory is an area of mathematics that was developed in the early 1800's. It provides the appropriate language for studying the collection of symmetries of an object, and is central to much of modern day mathematics. The central player in this theory is an algebraic structure called a group. In the early 1980's, the Russian geometer Misha Gromov realized that one could apply geometric techniques to study these algebraic structures. This remarkable insight led to the development of a new field - geometric group theory. This field is extremely active, with a lot of mathematicians both in the US and abroad. The conference is intended to bring together experts in the field to discuss the latest developments in the area. <br/><br/>The conference will feature a large number of plenary talks, both from well-established leaders in the field, as well as from promising young researchers. Some of the topics that will be featured include:(i) groups of finite asymptotic dimension, (ii) amenability of groups,(iii) special cube complexes and applications, (iv)finiteness properties of groups, (v) Thompson's group and analogues, (vi) Coxeter and Artin groups, (vii) L^2-cohomology techniques, (viii) Cannon-Thurston style maps and applications. In addition to the plenary talks, we plan on having shorter (20mn) talks run in parallel sessions, giving younger mathematicians and graduate students the opportunity to broadly disseminate their results.

The main objective is to reveal new and further explore previously known links between the moduli spaces and objects in other fields of mathematics, in particular Representation Theory and Lower Dimensional Topology. The PI will work toward a proof of the mathematical conjecture relating the topological invariants of the Hilbert scheme of points on plane singular curves and the HOMFLY knot homology of the links of the singularities of the curve (Hilb/HOMFLY formula). The conjecture also reveals unexpected symmetries of the homology of torus knots: conjecturally, they form an irreducible representation of the rational Cherednik algebra of type A. The PI will explore the generalized Hilb/HOMFLY conjecture that relates the representation theory of the symplectic reflection algebras and the rational Cherednik algebras of types other than A. Finally, the PI describes the cohomology ring of the compactified Jacobians of quasi-homogeneous singularities. The PI (jointly with Zhiwei Yum) conjectures a relation between the cohomology ring of the compactified Jacobian of the curve and the structure ring of the moduli space of the rational maps to the curve: a local variation of the Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas relation. The educational component of the project offers a new model for the UMass REU program.  <br/><br/>Knot invariants and topological invariants allow us to analyze the global structure of complicated shapes by collecting local information about the shape. Complicated shapes occur naturally in biology (e.g. proteins, DNA), theoretical physics (strings), and other areas of natural science. Thus developing new invariants and computational methods for understanding of the global structure of complex shapes is an important mathematical problem with many potential applications. The PI strives to understand the hidden symmetries of already discovered invariants, develop new invariants, and find unexpected applications of these invariants to other areas of mathematics. The PI will also involve undergraduate students in cutting edge research through a summer research program integrating mentorship by faculty and graduate students. The PI aims to attract more students from underrepresented groups to mathematical research by reserving specific spaces in the summer research program for students from two local women's colleges. The PI will prepare graduate student mentors during the year by teaching related graduate classes and a reading seminar. This new summer research program structure will increase diversity and strengthen vertical integration in academia and improve the communication and flow of ideas between different generations of present and future researchers."

Soon it was noticed that hyperbolic manifolds formed the largest and the least understood class of manifolds. Informally, a hyperbolic 3-manifold is an object modeled locally on 3-dimensional space that has hyperbolic metric. An important subclass of such manifolds are knot and link complements in 3-sphere. Additionally, knots and links are an object of study on their own, and knot theory has a number of applications in pure mathematics, as well as in applied fields of study. A knot is easy to draw as a planar diagram with information about underpasses/overpasses at crossings. However, establishing the connection between the diagram and geometric properties of the corresponding 3-manifold is a hard task. This is the first main goal of the proposal. The other goal is exploring the relation between geometric invariants and invariants that come from other areas of mathematics. The PI is engaged in mentoring student research and developing software that helps to use the geometric perspective, and will continue these activities.<br/><br/>With M. Thistlethwaite, the PI made progress towards the first goal by suggesting a new method for computing the hyperbolic structure directly from a link diagram. With W. Neumann, she generalized this approach to parameterize hyperbolic structure of a cusped 3-manifold. This project blends the new method with various techniques for a systematic study of the intrinsic geometry of hyperbolic links and its connection with a combinatorial picture. Among the open problems considered are questions about the canonical cell decomposition, hyperbolic volume, lengths of various arcs, geometric triangulations, etc. While these questions are interesting a priori, a significant part of the project is concerned with immediate applications of the geometric insight obtained. For example, the PI will explore the relation between geometric and quantum link invariants, investigate the connection between the geometry and arithmetic invariants of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, approach tangle tabulation using geometry and computer calculations, and tackle some other open questions."

Microscopic examples of knotted loops appear abundantly in solid state physics, biology (notably, the DNA molecule) and various models of quantum computing. Macroscopic knotted loops occur in the shapes of galaxies, black holes and plasma physics. The proposed research focuses on the theoretical aspects of knot theory and more precisely on the relation between classical and quantum knot invariants. Quantum topology offers a classification of knots by various measures of complexity, for example by using the Jones polynomial of a knot (and its parallels). Understanding this filtering leads to deep connections between knot theory and hyperbolic geometry, number theory, complex analysis, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. An important aspect of this research is the training of graduate students and the collaboration with senior researchers. The research involves difficult numerical experiments and leads to unexpected discoveries of conjectures and proofs. Aside from mathematics and mathematical physics, quantum knot theory is a powerful and effective tool with the potential to impact topological quantum computation and the study of the shape of long molecules.<br/><br/>Classical knot invariants include the incompressible and normal surface invariants by W. Haken, the character varieties of algebraic geometry and mathematical physics and the hyperbolic geometry approach to 3-dimensional manifolds initiated by W. Thurston. The birth of quantum topology was the Jones polynomial in the mid eighties. The discovery of the Jones polynomial attracted mathematicians and physicists of the highest caliber, including the Fields Medalists V. Jones, E. Witten, V. Drinfeld and M. Kontsevich. There are precise, numerically testable conjectures that relate classical and quantum invariants. Progress on these conjectures (which include the Volume Conjecture of Kashaev, the Slope Conjecture and the AJ Conjecture) is the focus of the proposed research. A combination of numerical experimentation with proofs leads to deep connections between low dimensional topology and hyperbolic geometry, number theory, complex analysis, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. This combination helps to train young researchers, and to make connections with senior researchers in diverse fields."

It is also one of the oldest problems in mathematics. The solutions to the same polynomials over the complex numbers form topological spaces. For example, the complex solutions to the degree n Fermat equation is a torus with (n-1)(n-2)/2 holes.  The fact that the shape of the space of complex solutions influences the solutions over rational numbers  or integers can be viewed as a first instance of the utility of using methods of homotopy theory to study this problem. Homotopy theory gives machinery to replace a procedure by a derived version which frequently gives more control over the problem. For example, consider the procedure of taking a rotating sphere and returning the points which do not move.   This procedure can be derived to produce a space called the homotopy fixed points, which records not only the points which do not move, but also compatible paths between points and where they have traveled. Fixed points and homotopy fixed points are equivalent under some hypotheses. If fixed points and homotopy fixed points are equivalent for a certain analogue of the space of complex solutions of polynomial equations, one can show that the solutions to these polynomials over the rationals are then determined by the loops on the corresponding space of complex solutions, under certain restrictions. This latter prediction is part of Grothendieck's anabelian program, and is unsolved. It produces strong restrictions on the solutions of the corresponding equations.   The focus of this proposal is to study solutions to polynomial equations and Grothendieck's anabelian program from this perspective.   The project also aims to stimulate research in homotopy theory, and make the tools of this theory available to mathematicians in very different areas, and other scientists more generally.<br/><br/>The projects in this proposal share the approach wherein one views a scheme as a space in the sense of Morel-Voevodsky's A1-homotopy theory, and then applies various realization functors, for instance to Z/2-equivariant spaces by taking C-points of a scheme over R, or to pro-spaces with an action of the absolute Galois group of the base field for schemes over more general fields. The Principal Investigator studies the pro-space maps from the tale homotopy type of a field k to the tale homotopy type of the projective line minus three points using lower central series approximations to the latter. Additionally James-Hopf maps in A1-homotopy theory are used to study the same mapping space. Both have applications to Grothendieck's anabelian program.  Running the same methods backwards, produces results on the algebraic topology of schemes starting from information about solutions to polynomial equations. For instance, the Principal Investigator continues a study of the differential graded algebra associated to group cohomology of absolute Galois groups. Information about the unstable category of spaces in the sense of Morel-Voevodsky is sought in conjunction."

The project will concentrate on the study of free-by-cyclic groups. These groups are natural counterparts of the fundamental groups of fibered 3-manifolds, which are important mathematical objects playing key roles in Topology, Differential Geometry, Ergodic Theory, Number Theory, Computational Complexity, and other branches of Mathematics. Compared with the 3-manifold groups, the free-by-cyclic groups are much less well understood, even though they exhibit a considerably wider variety of interesting features and behavior. The project aims to study the geometry and dynamics of free-by-cyclic groups, particularly through exploring new polynomial invariants of these groups. This research should help better understand both the differences and the similarities between the free-by-cyclic groups and their 3-manifold ""cousins"", and lead to new insights about the interactions of algebra and dynamics in group theory.<br/><br/>The project will build on the new work of the proposer, joint with Leininger and Dowdall, studying the properties of free-by-cyclic groups by means of a ""folded mapping torus"", associated to such a group. The folded  mapping torus comes equipped with a natural semi-flow of continuous transformations, and it encodes in a particularly useful and accessible form key algebraic, geometric and dynamical information about the group. Another key object, associated to the folded mapping torus, is the ""McMullen polynomial"", which is a free-by-cyclic analog of the Teichmuller polynomial for fibered 3-manifolds.  The main overall research goal of the project is to understand algebraic, geometric and dynamical features related to the many possible ways in which a free-by-cyclic group G can split as a free-by-cyclic group and as an ascending HNN-extension of a free group, and to gain new knowledge about free group automorphisms. Specific problems to be studied include: understanding the relationship between the ""cone of sections"" of folded mapping torus with the BNS-invariant of the group, uniformizing the stable trees and the Cannon-Thurston maps associated with different splittings of G, studying irreducibility properties of monodromy automorphisms associated to different free-by-cyclic splittings of G, developing an analog of the homological zeta-function for G, and others."

Nonpositively curved manifolds (spaces) has been a subject where there are a lot of rich theorems, and it has been a central object of study not only in geometry, but also in related fields of mathematics, such as geometric group theory and dynamics.  The field, however, seems to have been abandoned in the last two decades although there are a lot of unanswered questions, some of which are within reach. Constructions of smooth, nonpositively curved manifolds are poorly understood in the sense that most examples known are of a very restrictive type, such as hyperbolic manifolds and pinched negatively curved manifolds, which do not illustrate more generic properties of nonpositively curved spaces. One of the aims of the proposed research is to construct more nonpositively curved manifolds, especially with interesting properties that are not seen in hyperbolic or pinched negatively curved manifolds. If a space is known to have a nonpositively curved metric, one can deduce a lot about it. The question whether a space admits a nonpositively curved metric has become of great interest in different areas in topology. The proposed research also aims to find topological properties shared by large classes of nonpositively curved manifolds and topological obstructions to having a nonpositively curved metric. Specifically, the PI will study the topology of ends as obstructions to having nonpositively curved metrics.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>The project aims to study noncompact, complete, finite volume, bounded, nonpositively curved manifolds M. Objects to be studied are the topology of ends, invariants of the fundamental groups of these manifolds (such as the cohomological dimension and the action dimension), and the relation between the topology of the end of such a manifold of the set of non-horospherical limit points. The problem of how to distinguish which locally CAT(0) manifolds have a smooth nonpositively curved Riemannian metric will also be studied. In particular, in the case when M has tame ends, the question which manifold C can occur as the cross section of each end of M will be studied extensively. In low dimension, such as when M has dimension 4, the goal is to show that each cross section of an end of M is aspherical by computing the second homotopy group of the ends of M. Once this has been proven, and with the result of the Geometrization Theorem in three-manifold theory, a classification of all manifolds C that can occur as cross sections may be within reach, or at least progress can be made using recent techniques of Ontaneda's Riemannian hyperbolization procedure. The relation between the topology of the end of such a manifold and the set of non-horospherical limit points will be studied. For the case when M is a locally symmetric space of noncompact type, it will be shown that the set of non-horospherical limit points is the same as the rational Tits building using Saper's tilings. The question whether a similar phenomenon happens in more general nonpositively curved settings will be investigated. This project also aims to construct new examples of locally CAT(0) manifolds that do not admit a smooth nonpositively curved metric. Obstructions that will be used to distinguish these from smooth nonpositively curved manifolds are invariants at infinity that come from embedded flat tori in the manifolds that are locally linked with linking number greater than one."

Such confluences also offer ideal training grounds for graduate students: there are many new, exciting, and unexplored questions on which to work; at the same time, the answers clarify old and established fields of knowledge.<br/><br/>In particular the project centers around a conjecture (due to the PI and collaborators) equating certain algebrao-geometric invariants of plane curve singularities with topological invariants of knots determined by the singularities. Specifically, the former is the local contribution of the singular curve to motivic or categorified Donaldson-Thomas theory, and the latter are the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies. The research project aims at a proof by passing through two other subjects: the theory of Legendrian knots and the non-abelian Hodge correspondence. This intersection of algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and low dimensional topology is the only place in mathematics where the quantum SU(n) invariants and their categorifications have ever been seen as coming from the geometry of a knot in space, as opposed to from its planar projections. In addition, the research touches meaningfully on many subjects of present mathematical interest: enumerative geometry as influenced by string theory, the Hitchin system, Khovanov-Rozansky homology, the Cherednik algebra and its representations, legendrian knots and symplectic field theory, and 3-manifold invariants. It may be expected to advance some of these separately by exploiting their connections. In particular the project aims to make progress on the ""P = W"" conjecture in nonabelian Hodge theory, and on the question in symplectic field theory of whether all representations of the Chekanov-Eliashberg dga come from geometry.<br/><br/>The award is co-funded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Topology programs."

This is true of the foundations of classical mechanics, and even more so for general relativity and quantum physics. For this reason much mathematics has been developed in this framework for the past 150 years. In the 1980s, several breakthroughs have emphasized the role of specific Lie groups in various geometric problems. This includes the surprisingly effective use of non-euclidean hyperbolic geometry to analyze the knotting of curves in space. Other developments, drawing their inspiration from quantum physics, have provided tools to attack the same knotting problems based on certain deformations of Lie groups called quantum groups. The Project investigates several problems involving classical Lie groups and their quantum group deformations, and their applications to the study of knots and 3-dimensional spaces. It draws its motivation and technical tools from several different branches of mathematics, including geometry, topology, algebra and dynamical systems.  <br/><br/><br/> The Project is articulated along two themes that are very different in nature, but united by the fact that hyperbolic geometry can be used as an intellectual guide in each of them. The Project also has a strong educational component, as its  research themes are designed so that they can nurture the doctoral work of several graduate students, and provide a broad postdoctoral training to junior faculty in the research group of the Principal Investigator (PI). <br/> The first theme of the Project is focused on the classical geometry of homomorphisms from the fundamental group of a surface to a Lie group. When the Lie group is split real, for instance for the special linear group SL(n,R), the so-called Hitchin homomorphisms satisfy many important geometric and dynamical properties. A first goal of the proposal is to develop a differential calculus for the spectrum of the images under Hitchin homomorphisms of simple closed curves on the surface. This includes the development of a parametrization of the space of Hitchin homomorphisms that is well-adapted to such a calculus. The Project will also use these methods to investigate the boundary at infinity of the space of Hitchin homomorphisms. Moving to the complex set-up, the PI will investigate the geometry of homomorphisms valued in complex Lie groups but close to real Hitchin homomorphisms. <br/> The second theme of the Project involves quantum group invariants of knots in 3-dimensional manifolds. The PI will continue his investigation of representations of the Kauffman skein algebra on a surface, considered as points of a quantization of the space of homomorphism from the fundamental group of the surface to the Lie group SL(2,C). He will then build on the results and tools developed in this investigation, and on earlier work of Kashaev-Baseilhac-Benedetti,  to build a (2+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theory that mixes quantum topology and hyperbolic geometry. The long term goals of this work is to provide conceptual and technical tools to attack the Volume Conjecture, which predicts a precise relationship between the asymptotic behavior of certain quantum invariants of a knot in 3-space and the hyperbolic volume of its complement. The technology provided by the Kauffman skein algebra is more intrinsic than earlier approaches, and should be particularly useful."

This problem (the basis of the subject of knot theory) has implications in physics (quantum theory), chemistry (molecular knots) and biology (knotting of DNA).  A central tool in classifying knots, and indeed in many topological questions, is to assign an invariant to a knot:  two knots are then different if their invariants are different.  The goal is find robust invariants which can distinguish different knots.  This project explores new types of knot invariants and continues the trend of using tools from algebra to define and investigate knot invariants.  The PI will use techniques from the mathematical fields of algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory. The focus of the project is on the class of knots and links that arise from intersecting an algebraic curve in the plane with a small sphere centered at the singularity of the curve (such knots and links are called algebraic). In this project the PI will study the interaction between the topological invariants of algebraic knots and links and certain algebraic and combinatorial objects associated to the corresponding curve.<br/><br/>Quantum knot invariants have proven to be a powerful tool in low-dimensional topology.  To every knot one can associate a polynomial with integer coefficients in one variable (as in the Alexander polynomial or the Jones polynomial) or in two variables (as in the HOMFLY polynomial).  It has recently been discovered by the PI and his collaborators that for torus knots all coefficients in the HOMFLY polynomial are in fact nonnegative.  To prove this fact, certain representations of the rational Cherednik algebra were studied and it was shown that the dimensions of some graded subspaces match the HOMFLY coefficients.  Khovanov and Rozansky introduced another collection of vector spaces, called HOMFLY homology, such that the HOMFLY coefficients are presented as alternating sums of their dimensions.  The similarity of the two constructions suggests that for a torus knot Khovanov-Rozansky homology may be isomorphic to a representation of the rational Cherednik algebra, equipped with an extra grading (or filtration).  This conjecture has been verified in many examples, but remains open in general.

Higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology is defined through contact and symplectic geometry, which in turn are closely related to mathematical physics and string theory.  These studies in higher dimensions should in turn contribute significantly towards our understanding of low-dimensional (i.e., 3- and 4-dimensional) shapes, from the knotting of DNA at the microscopic level to the shape of the universe at the macroscopic level. <br/><br/>The PI will study contact and symplectic geometry in higher dimensions through a higher-dimensional generalization of Heegaard Floer homology.  Heegaard Floer homology, due to Ozsvth and Szab, is a package of invariants of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces as well as knots and links in 3-space, which is extremely effective at distinguishing these spaces and knots and links from one another.  The main goal of the PI's research program is to develop the theory of Heegaard Floer homology in higher dimensions, i.e., in dimensions greater than 4.  This theory is expected to yield important applications to contact and symplectic geometry in higher dimensions, which in turn are related to algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.  Khovanov homology, another important invariant of knots and links in 3-space, can at least conjecturally be viewed as a special case of higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology."

This insight led to major breakthroughs and to several categories of motives. Noncommutative algebraic geometry, a recent branch of mathematics, is concerned with the study of noncommutative algebraic varieties, i.e., differential graded (=dg) categories. Recently, Kontsevich had also the motivic idea of replacing the different homology theories of noncommutative algebraic varieties (K-theory, cyclic homology, topological Hochschild homology, etc) by the ""universal"" one. Similarly, this led to several categories of noncommutative motives. The main objective of this project is to bridge the gap between the above two motivic ideas. Concretely, the Principal Investigator (PI) will construct appropriate symmetric monoidal functors relating the categories of motives and noncommutative motives. Among the manifold uses of such functors, the PI will exploit them to address the Schur/Kimura finiteness of motives as well as the rationality of motivic zeta functions.<br/><br/>The theory of motives was envisioned by Grothendieck in the sixties and greatly developed since then by Beilinson, Deligne, Voevodsky, and others. In contrast, the theory of noncommutative motives was only recently introduced by Kontsevich. The PI proposes to construct precise bridges between motives and noncommutative motives. These will enable the interchange of results, techniques, ideas, and insights between the commutative and the noncommutative world. In order to make these results accessible to the mathematical community, the PI will lecture graduate courses, disseminate them online, organize working seminars, and write the first book on the subject. Complementing these educational activities, the PI will also mentor undergraduate students through research projects on applications of motives to several areas of mathematics."

Part of the reason for this is that focusing on deformation-invariant properties of mathematical objects makes both classifications and calculations much more tractable. The interaction goes both ways; recently algebraic and geometric methods have found powerful applications in homotopy theory, and much recent research has been concerned with the algebro-geometric and higher-categorical nature of homotopical objects, illuminating many structural aspects and inspiring further interactions between these various mathematical disciplines.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to employ algebro-geometric and higher-categorical techniques in the study of algebraic topology and homotopy theory.

The second aims to classify thick subcategories of certain stable higher categories, especially those which arise in geometry by formation of perfect complexes over various classes of derived schemes. The third involves elliptic cohomology and is concerned with the explicit description of the elliptic cohomology of various orbifolds and is an important example of the not yet fully understood stable homotopy theory of orbifolds, also known as global stable homotopy theory, another subject of much recent attention. The final goal is to understand the units of a derived scheme using the emerging tools of derived algebraic geometry, in particular the Picard and Brauer groups and their higher categorical analogues and possible connections to topological field theories."

The goal of this project is to achieve a better understanding of how symplectic and contact topology sit between geometry and topology, thereby strengthening the foundation for the aforementioned applications.

These objects can be entangled and transition between different types of knots. Sometimes nature needs to eliminate this knotting, such as when enzymes called type II topoisomerases cut and reattach strands of DNA to release interlinking during replication.  These type II topoisomerases are targets for some chemotherapy drugs, as well as the antibiotic Cipro which is used to treat anthrax poisoning.  At other times, knotting is created for a purpose, such as in the folding of some proteins into their functional knotted native state.  While the exact function of the knotting in these proteins is unknown, determining the function could make it possible to manipulate proteins or design new proteins for medical applications. At still other times, changes in knotting are the product of natural deterioration.  For example, as sub-atomic glueball particles decay through their lifetimes, they change between different types of knots.  Indeed, knotting in nature is a dynamic process and the transitions between different types of knots reveal properties of the physical systems.  In this project, the PI, a multi-disciplinary group of collaborators, and undergraduate students study knotting transitions for topoisomerase II, proteins, and glueballs to gain insights into the role of knotting in these systems. This project has broad educational objectives. Several undergraduate students will be supported directly by the grant. They will be trained by the PI and contribute to the projects, gaining both content knowledge and experience in the research process.  The students will participate in professional meetings and disseminate their findings in talks and posters. These research experiences are essential in training the next generation of science and mathematics educators, researchers, and practitioners. To reach a wide-audience, the PI will continue to be active in giving presentations to students, non-specialists, and multi-disciplinary audiences.

This project will establish a firm understanding of open knotted structures, including knotted substructures within open chains and closed loops. This knowledge will be applied to classify the knotting in proteins and the data will be made publicly available. Relationships between knotting, geometric structure, and the amino acid sequence in knotted proteins will be determined to establish the function of the knotting in knotted proteins. Modeling knotting transitions due to the action of type II topoisomerases will lead to a better understanding of their effectiveness in untangling DNA strands. A similar analysis will be used to determine how subatomic glueballs decay through knotting. Together, these projects will reveal fundamental insights into knotting in nature.  More specifically, the main objectives of this grant are to 1) decompose complicated knots into their essential elements, 2) reveal the function of knotting in knotted proteins, 3) determine where type II topoisomerases perform their cutting and reattaching action, and 4) understand the decaying process in glueballs.

This approach has been successful in solving problems in such diverse areas as combinatorial group theory (think of a situation such as Rubik's cube where a discrete set of moves is allowed) and logic. Both projects are focused on a particular group of classical interest called ""the outer automorphism group of a free group"" which is denoted Out(F). Groups arise as sets of symmetries of objects and Out(F) is the set of symmetries of a free group F, an important group from which all others can be constructed. Completion of either project would represent a major advance in the field.<br/><br/>The first project, joint with Mladen Bestvina at the University of Utah, is to continue the study of the geometry of Out(F). In particular, we have a plan to show that Out(F) has finite asymptotic dimension. Part of this work will also be joint with Patrick Reynolds at the University of Utah. The geometry of Out(F) is currently a hot topic with interest spurred in large part by results of Bestvina-Feighn and Handel-Mosher that certain spaces on which Out(F) acts are hyperbolic. The second project, joint with Michael Handel at Lehman College, is to show that Out(F) has a solvable conjugacy problem. The conjugacy problem is a famous decidability question formulated by Max Dehn around 1911 that can be asked about any group. The fact that it remains open for Out(F) reveals a gap in our basic understanding of this group."

Such interactions have been central to the progress of mathematics and more broadly science. <br/><br/>This research project investigates the interplay between geometry, topology, and group theory in three broad, distinct projects. First, complexity functions associated to decision problems on groups. The main purpose is the interplay between the behavior of the complexity functions and the structure of the group. One specific focus for this project is on linear representations as both a tool and a conclusion. There are direct ties to the algorithmic complexity for decision problems on groups that has the potential to connect to areas beyond mathematics. Second, a group theoretic take on some classical work of Thom on representing homology classes. This leads to the study of the possible homological dimensions of fundamental groups of smooth manifolds. Part of this work displays prominently the interaction between geometry, group theory, dynamics, analysis, and topology. The potential results are quite exciting as are these rich connections. Third, the analogy between primitive geodesics on a negatively curved manifold and prime ideals in the ring of integers of a number field. The investigation centers around arithmetic progressions and a weaker version of progressions in the set of primitive geodesic lengths. This project has two main possible results, one that characterizes arithmetic manifolds, another that resolves an old conjecture in spectral rigidity problems. The weak notion of progressions has the potential to have impact in areas beyond geodesic geometry. These projects have the potential to have impact beyond the subjects they directly address. Indeed, part of the motivation for this work is the production of rich connections between distinct mathematical fields."

This includes transforming combinatorial systems that involve natural numbers into higher-order structures built out of vector spaces whose dimensions are those numbers, while vector spaces themselves lift to categories. Integers are consistently lifted to complexes of vector spaces. Link homology theories constitute such a lift of quantum link invariants. The latter boast deep relations to quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, and many areas of mathematics, and categorifying link homology extends these relations and produces new ones at a higher structural level. The proposal will investigate categorification at roots of unity, which should lead to such structural lifting of the Chern-Simons theory and quantum 3-manifold invariants and, eventually, parts of conformal field theory. The project also aims to enhance and unite recent discoveries of cohomological operations on link homologies. These operations rigidify link homology groups and exhibit connections to algebraic topology; in the latter some of most profound result required studying not just homology groups and their extraordinary counterparts, but entire systems of cohomological operations on them.  It is likely that understanding the full algebra of cohomological operations on link homology will significanly advance this subject as well as many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics in its proximity. <br/><br/><br/>The project will investigate categorification and link homology, find cohomological operations that rigidify link homology theories, and advance categorification at roots of unity for quantum groups, their representations, and quantum link and 3-manifold invariants.

Recent work on categorification of quantum groups at roots of unity points to existence of a deep but undeveloped theory, including an analogue of homological algebra where the role of complexes is played by p-complexes. One of the project's goals is to categorify the Jones polynomial and other quantum link invariants at prime roots of unity by further developing categorification of quantum groups and their representations within the framework of p-complexes and hopfological algebra."

When studying three-dimensional shapes, the information from gauge theory is encoded into an algebraic structure called Floer homology. The project aims to study different versions of Floer homology and their applications to topology. In particular, although Floer homology is associated to three-dimensional spaces, by an indirect route it can give insights into the triangulations of spaces of dimension five or higher; classifying these triangulations is a major open problem. A triangulation is a decomposition of the space into polyhedra, and gives a simple combinatorial description of the space. The project also aims at constructing new variants of Floer homology, with inspiration drawn from recent advances in quantum physics. In a different direction, through collaboration with computer scientists, it is proposed to apply topology to the classification of distributed computing models.<br/><br/>The project concerns Floer theory and its applications to the study of both low dimensional and high dimensional manifolds. In particular, the PI will investigate the Seiberg-Witten Floer stable homotopy types of three-manifolds and the associated Pin(2)- equivariant Seiberg-Witten Floer homology. These theories can be used to get information about the homology cobordism group in three dimensions. In turn, homology cobordism gives insight into the classification of triangulations for manifolds of dimension at least five. Similar methods will be used to study the intersection forms of spin four-manifolds.  The PI will also work on constructing Pin(2) versions of Heegaard Floer homology and knot Floer homology, and on the development of new computational techniques for Heegaard Floer homology. Furthermore, in an ongoing collaboration with computer scientists, the PI is exploring applications of topology to distributed computing; there, the solvability of a given task by a system of several computers can be rephrased in terms of a question in homotopy theory."

The integers are an important example of a group that encodes the symmetries of, say, a line of equally spaced cars on a straight highway. Linear groups, a main focus of this proposal, are those groups that, in a sense similar to the integer group example, encode symmetries of real life objects. Not all groups are linear, but when you can determine that a group is linear this opens up a whole new understanding of the group (in particular, you can apply all the tools from the subject of linear algebra). This proposal aims to understand the grey area that separates linear and nonlinear groups by forming numerical invariants and obstructions that stratify this gray area. While this proposal will give insight in the theory of groups, it also has applications to computer science and interfaces algebraic geometry and geometric group theory. Further, the proposed work will impact undergraduate and graduate students at the City College of New York (CCNY) through mentoring on topics related to this proposal. <br/><br/>This proposal's primary focus is on the complexity of constructing homomorphisms from a fixed group to a group of invertible matrices with complex entries. This focus builds on previous research, where the PI explored the interaction of Gromov's word growth and Lubotzky-Segal's subgroup growth by developing the program of quantifying residual finiteness. This program gives a systematic approach for studying the complexity of constructing homomorphisms from a fixed group to any finite group (which is also linear). Further, this program paves way for the discovery of new characterizations of fundamental properties of finitely generated groups including nilpotency, linearity, arithmeticity, and even finite presentability. While continuing the pursuit of quantifying residual finiteness, the PI will augment his current research program by detailing the behavior of homomorphisms from a fixed group into a semisimple linear algebraic group (i.e., a special linear group). In particular, the PI seeks to determine when Borel's theorem on free groups generalizes to other groups. This research direction would influence the understanding of the behavior of arithmetic groups and word maps. Arithmetic groups are central in geometry because they supply explicit examples of manifolds. The study of word maps finds its motivation from the proof of the Hausdorff-Banach-Tarski paradox and is intertwined with the theory of expander graphs (a subject of great interest in theoretical computer science). While the projects proposed are grounded in topology, they feature methods from algebraic geometry, group theory, and number theory."

An important area in geometry is the study of the range of all possible shapes a given type of geometric object can take.  For example, one might study the range of all possible shapes of triangles, circles, or other kinds of geometric objects. Teichmller theory takes as its objects 2-dimensional surfaces, and studies the shapes of these surfaces.  When a shape is symmetric, these symmetries are recorded by an algebraic notion called the ""mapping class group"".  From topology, to geometry, to physics, the interaction of these notions continues to produce new fruitful topics of study.  Indeed Teichmller space (the ""space of shapes"") has its own geometry, and symmetries of the shapes appear as symmetries of Teichmller space.  This conference will seek to introduce new researchers to emerging aspects and connections in this burgeoning field.<br/><br/><br/>The study of mapping class groups and Teichmller theory lies at the intersection of a variety of important mathematical topics, including geometry, topology, geometric group theory, and representation theory. New research threads in these different subject areas have emerged recently, and the time is right to revisit the connections between such topics to assess parallels between their development.  While there are few mathematicians in Israel that work directly in the subject, there is a larger group of mathematicians that work in closely related areas, and great opportunity for enhancing connections between these working groups and those that exist elsewhere. The proposed conference on Mapping Class Groups and Teichmller Theory, in Ramat Hanadiv, Israel, will provide a unique and new opportunity for scholars from a broad range of career stages to meet in Israel and interact with Israeli mathematicians in related areas, and will serve to broaden the geographic and intellectual base of the field.<br/><br/>Conference URL: http://www.math.technion.ac.il/cms/decade_2011-2020/year_2013-2014/mapping/"

Focused international research conferences such as this one play a fundamental role in the development and dissemination of ground-breaking research in mathematics.  This conference will serve as a forum in which researchers can announce major new results and explain their ideas to other experts in the field, long  before such results will appear in refereed journals.    Researchers in topics related to the conference are widely scattered geographically.  This conference will provide the  opportunity for them to work together in the same place.  Participants will be able to meet and learn from others in the field, continue collaborations, and develop new ones.  Funding for participants from U.S. institutions will make it possible for these participants to learn about what is happening at the forefront of topology, and to share their ideas and learn from topologists from Europe and other parts of the world.    This is especially important for early-career mathematicians as they are expanding their research interests, and looking for new collaborations.     <br/><br/>The conference will bring together  experts in manifold topology, K-theory, and homotopy theory to learn about recent advances and promote collaboration among researchers in these fields.

In this project the PI will apply the methods of geometric group theory to the study of hidden symmetries of finite networks known to topologists as ""graphs"". These groups of hidden symmetries are known as ""outer automorphism groups of free groups"". One outcome of this project will be to solve important problems in the large scale geometry of outer automorphism groups of free groups and through these solutions to produce new tools of large scale geometry for broad use by the geometric group theory community. Another outcome will be to build tools for a new study of the dynamical properties of outer automorphism groups of free groups.<br/><br/>Outer automorphism groups of finite rank free groups, denoted Out(F_n), were first examined in the 1930's by Nielsen and Whitehead. Interest in Out(F_n) has expanded rapidly in recent decades with the development of geometric tools such as: the Culler-Vogtmann outer space; and the relative train track maps of Bestvina-Feighn-Handel. More recently Out(F_n) is being studied using quasi-isometric geometry, an effort in which the principal investigator has played a leading role. In this project the PI will study actions of finitely generated subgroups of Out(F_n) on hyperbolic metric spaces, attempting to build for Out(F_n) an analogue of the hierarchy theory for mapping class groups of surfaces that was built in the 1990's by Masur and Minsky. As applications, and as guides to building a useful hierarchy theory, the PI plans to study and resolve various problems in the large scale geometry of Out(F_n) including:  computation of the 2nd bounded cohomology of finitely generated subgroups of Out(F_n); and early investigations into quasi-isometric rigidity for Out(F_n). The PI also plans to carry out early investigations of certain Out(F_n)-invariant dynamical systems that are analogous to the Teichmuller geodesic flow of a surface and its invariant sets."

A dynamical system is a mathematical model of a physical system. There is a huge variety of real life situations that can be considered as dynamical systems in one way or another. Dynamical systems have three components: (a) the phase space, whose points represent all possible physical states of the physical system; (b) the time, which, roughly speaking, can be discrete; continuous; or combined; one-dimensional or having any finite (or even infinite) number of dimensions; etc; (c) the set of physical rules according to which the system that is currently at some state assumes at any given moment another state. In the classical theory of Topological Dynamical Systems the time is represented by the group of real numbers (continuous time) or by the group of whole numbers (discrete time). The group in question is then said to be the acting group and the dynamical system is called a flow. The PI is developing the related theory of semiflows involving semigroups of nonnegative whole numbers. Obtaining unifying statements for various kinds of acting semiflows will advance the area of topological dynamics and have applications to other areas of analysis and topology. It is also important for some areas of mathematical biology and mathematical physics.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to advance the development of a theory of general semiflows. The universal enveloping semigroup of the acting semigroup T (topologically that is the Stone-Cech compactification Beta T of the topological space T) is an important object that is used to capture asymptotics and recurrence of the trajectories of the semiflow. The algebraic structure of Beta T plays a crucial role. The principal investigator plans on giving a detailed construction of Beta T in terms of maximal completely regular ultrafilters on T (assuming that T is a completely regular space), including the definition of an operation on Beta T, and then analyze in detail its algebraic structure using this explicit description. The principal investigator expects that for general semiflows conditions like ""Beta T minus T is a semigroup"", ""Beta T minus T contains an invariant set"", ""Beta T minus T contains an idempotent"", together with the notions of minimal and maximal idempotents and other algebraic notions, will be appearing in the statements about the dynamics of the semiflow. The principal investigator will study various notions of recurrence in general semiflows.  They will be defined in terms of the largeness of the set of their return times to a given neighborhood (infinite, syndetic, replete, etc.) and then characterized in terms of properties of elements of Beta T that fix them. The principal investigator plans also to study the following notions: the proximal pairs of points, distal points, product-recurrent points and their relation with distal points, the structure of the Ellis semigroup (another important enveloping semigroup of the acting semigroup), IP sets, Ramsey type theorems and others. The Principal investigator will also work on generalizing sensitivity and chaos to the case of general semiflows."

The bacterial chromosome is circular and replication invariably results in the formation of interlinked daughter chromosomes. Error-free unlinking is required to ensure proper segregation at cell division and stable plasmid inheritance. Type II topoisomerases unlink replication links. In Escherichia coli, in the absence of topo IV (a type II topoisomerase credited with chromosome unlinking), the site-specific recombination system XerCD mediates sister chromosome unlinking. This reaction is activated at the division septum by a powerful translocase FtsK, which coordinates the last stages of chromosome segregation. The mechanism by which the XerCD-FtsK complex simplifies the topology of DNA remains unclear. The main objective of the proposed studies is to characterize the topological mechanism of DNA unlinking by the XerCD-FtsK system using knot theory, low-dimensional topology, and computer simulations.  There is evidence that after being activated by FtsK, the enzymes XerCD unlink DNA in a stepwise manner. The tangle method will be used to find possible topological pathways of DNA unknotting and unlinking by site-specific recombination on small substrates. A computer model of DNA recombination will be developed, adapted to the Xer-FtsK system, and combined with the analytical results to analyze experimental data obtained from the Sherratt lab. The research is highly interdisciplinary and involves close collaboration with groups in Japan, Canada and the UK. Such collaborations will facilitate state-of-the-art student cross-training. Basic information about DNA topology will be disseminated to the general public, including elementary school children and visitors to the California Academy of Sciences. <br/><br/><br/>DNA replication is the basis for biological inheritance. In bacteria, reproduction starts with replication of the chromosome into two identical daughter molecules, followed by segregation of the newly replicated chromosomes and division of the parent cell into two daughter cells. In circular chromosomes, problems of entanglement during DNA linking complicate the process of chromosome segregation. In Escherichia coli, DNA unlinking is typically mediated by the enzyme topoIV, which is an important drug target for quinolone antimicrobial agents. Understanding DNA unlinking by Xer recombination, in addition to providing a more complete picture of the chromosome segregation process, is highly relevant for drug design. Mathematical and computational tools are very useful for studying the action of enzymes that change the topology of DNA. In this project such tools will be used to characterize all unlinking pathways and to reveal the mechanism of unlinking by Xer. The educational goal is to develop new and effective ways to disseminate knowledge related to DNA topology and its biological significance, as well as to increase public awareness of the critical role of mathematics in understanding biological processes. The proposed plans include the creation of Math Circles for elementary school children in San Francisco and the development of a series of educational materials for public consumption in collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences. This will culminate in the production of an exhibit on DNA topology for the general public in the California Academy of Sciences Museum."
