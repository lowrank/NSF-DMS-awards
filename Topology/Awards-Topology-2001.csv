The central unifying notion <br/>in geometry is that of curvature. Now, through these diverse<br/>geometric and combinatorial theories, curvature is emerging <br/>as a powerful tool and fundamental unifying concept in <br/>combinatorics as well.  This Focused Research Group will <br/>explore some of the specific notions of combinatorial<br/>curvature driving current combinatorial work, and also the <br/>role of curvature as the basis for a coherent geometric <br/>vision of combinatorics itself.<br/><br/>The notion of curvature has been one of the grand unifying <br/>concepts in geometry and physics for well over a century.  <br/>For example, Gauss, the originator of our modern understanding <br/>of curvature, showed that Euclidean geometry was distinguished <br/>from other geometries as being the geometry of a space with <br/>zero curvature. As an application he showed that it is<br/>precisely the curvature of the surface of the Earth which makes <br/>it impossible to draw a map of the Earth's surface (on a flat <br/>piece of paper) that accurately portrays all lengths and angles.<br/>Riemann generalized Gauss's work to smooth spaces of higher <br/>dimensions, and Einstein observed that Riemannian geometry<br/>was precisely the right setting in which to describe his <br/>theory of general relativity (in which the curvature of the <br/>universe is the result of gravitational forces). Partly as a <br/>result of Einstein's work, the last century saw an intensive investigation into the curvature of smooth spaces.<br/>Combinatorics, roughly defined, is the study of objects which <br/>can be described by a finite amount of information.  This is <br/>precisely the mathematics that computers can do.  This type of mathematics seems far removed from the geometric investigations <br/>of Gauss, Riemann and countless others.  However, there is a <br/>growing collection of  combinatorial phenomena which can best <br/>be viewed as being finite analogues of facts about the curvature <br/>of smooth spaces.  The goal of this proposal is to come to a<br/>coherent understanding of curvature as a combinatorial notion. <br/>In addition, bringing together researchers from a variety of mathematical disciplines, we wish to bridge the chasms between geometry, combinatorics, algebra and topology, using curvature <br/>as the unifying theme.<br/>"

Voronov<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to discover and study new algebraic<br/>structures in topology suggested or motivated by mathematical <br/>physics, in particular, quantum field theory and string theory. <br/>More specifically, the project aims at discovering a new algebraic<br/>structure on the homology of an n-sphere space, by which we mean <br/>the space of continuous maps from the n-dimensional sphere to a <br/>given manifold. This part of the project, joint with Dennis <br/>Sullivan, generalizes the work pioneered by Chas and Sullivan <br/>in the case n=1, i.e., that of a usual free loop space. Another <br/>goal is to establish connection between Chas-Sullivan's work and Gromov-Witten invariants, which we believe to be a holomorphic <br/>version of Chas-Sullivan's algebraic structure. Gromov-Witten invariants come from sigma model of quantum field theory, and Chas-Sullivan's work ""String Topology"" may be regarded as a <br/>topological version of the physical construction. This part of <br/>the project is suggested to be completed by developing a fusion intersection theory of semi-infinite cycles in infinite <br/>dimensional manifolds. Finally, part of the project is<br/>dedicated to relating the above to Kontsevich's Conjecture, <br/>which generalizes Deligne's Conjecture and unravels a deep <br/>relation between deformation theory of abstract n-algebras <br/>and the topology of configuration spaces of points in an (n+1)-dimensional Euclidean space.<br/><br/>The main idea of Algebraic Topology is to be able to recognize<br/>topological properties of a geometric object by associating <br/>algebraic data or structure to the geometric object. Sometimes <br/>the geometry is too complicated to allow immediate understanding <br/>and work with the object, while the algebraic information is <br/>usually simpler by its nature. This project suggests some new <br/>algebraic structure for a sphere space, the space of maps from <br/>an n-dimensional sphere to a manifold. Such spaces are quite complicated and the classical work of Chen, Segal, Jones, <br/>Getzler, Burghelea, Fedorowicz, Goodwillie, and others, produced <br/>not only the computation of the homology of loop spaces, which <br/>are the particular case of sphere spaces for n=1, but <br/>also revealed amazing connections with algebra (Hochschild<br/>complex). Also, recent progress in string theory emphasized <br/>the importance of invariants associated to holomorphic maps <br/>from the 2-sphere to a manifold (Gromov-Witten invariants). <br/>In this project we undertake an analogous study of continuous <br/>maps from the n-sphere to a manifold, which for n=1 has already <br/>enabled significant progress in topology.<br/>"

Suciu<br/>  <br/>This project is centered around a topological study<br/>of complex hyperplane arrangements, with a view towards<br/>finding effectively computable invariants of their complements.<br/>The goal is to decide whether a given invariant is<br/>combinatorially determined, and, if it is, to express<br/>it explicitly in terms of the intersection lattice of<br/>the arrangement.  An important role is played by the<br/>jumping loci for cohomology with coefficients in local<br/>systems, and the related resonance varieties.<br/>These varieties have emerged as a central object of study.<br/>They provide deep information about the homotopy theory<br/>of the complement of an arrangement, as well as<br/>a bridge relating various invariants, in often unexpected ways.<br/>Another key role is played by the rational-homotopy<br/>notion of formality, which provides the underlying<br/>explanation for many of the encountered phenomena.<br/>Whenever possible, the study is done in a more general setting,<br/>which includes certain types of subspace arrangements,<br/>both real and complex, as well as certain links in the 3-sphere.<br/>Such a point of view enlarges the range of applicability of the<br/>results, and helps explain what is really peculiar to complex<br/>hyperplane arrangements.<br/><br/>In its simplest manifestation, an arrangement is a<br/>finite collection of lines in the plane.  These lines<br/>cut the plane into components, and understanding the topology<br/>of the complement amounts to counting those components.<br/>In the case of lines in the complex plane (or, for that<br/>matter, hyperplanes in complex n-space), the complement<br/>is connected, and its topology (as reflected, for example,<br/>in its homotopy groups) is much more interesting.<br/>The theory of arrangements is a relatively new branch<br/>of mathematics, started in the 1960's with a study<br/>of the classifying space for the pure braid group.<br/>The theory has developed at the interface between<br/>topology, algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.<br/>Hyperplane arrangements, and the closely related<br/>configuration spaces, are used in numerous areas,<br/>including robotics, multi-dimensional billiards,<br/>graphics, molecular biology, computer vision, and<br/>databases for representing the space of all possible<br/>states of a system characterized by many degrees<br/>of freedom.

We describe three<br/>specific goals and their connections to some of the basic<br/>questions in the field.  The first goal is to develop the tools<br/>and techniques of multi-parameter thin position and sweep-outs so<br/>that they can be used to tackle some of the long-standing<br/>problems in knot theory and 3-manifold theory.  A second is to<br/>extend work of the proposer and M.

We will examine specific<br/>questions about tunnel number one knots, special cases of larger<br/>questions about what genus two manifolds can be obtained by<br/>surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere, which of these manifolds<br/>contain immersed surfaces with injective fundamental groups, and<br/>how information from the Heegaard diagrams of these manifolds<br/>translates into geometric and algebraic information about the<br/>manifold itself.<br/><br/>We live in what is apparently a universe with three spatial<br/>dimensions.  Exploring the possible forms that our universe might<br/>have is not only a deep problem for physicists but also for<br/>mathematicians.

In Teichmuller<br/>theory, the aim of the investigation is to understand the complex<br/>structure on the Teichmuller space by constructing holomorphic<br/>functions arising from flat singular metric uniformization of the<br/>Riemann surface. We have produced many naturally defined complex<br/>valued functions on the Teichmuller space. The goal is to show<br/>that they are holomorphic. This will give us a better<br/>understanding of the complex structure which is of vital<br/>importance to the Teichmuller theory.  In 3-manifold topology, we<br/>propose to show that any non-trivial 3-manifold group has a<br/>non-trivial SL(2,F) representation for some field F. We have<br/>translated the existence problem into a problem concerning how<br/>simple loops propagate in a surface.  With the recent advance of<br/>our knowledge on surfaces, one may eventually solve the problem<br/>using surface topology.  The existence of SL (2,F)<br/>representations will have many important consequences in<br/>3-manifold topology.<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is a space in which every point has a small<br/>surrounding similar to our real world.  It is an important<br/>mathematical problem to classify all 3-manifolds. One of the main<br/>tool developed in recent decades in 3-manifolds theory is to use<br/>geometry. In particular, the geometry of surfaces has been used<br/>very successfully in understanding the 3-dimensional spaces.  The<br/>proposed work addresses the topology of 3-manifolds and the<br/>geometry of surfaces.  We attempt to use the symmetry theory<br/>(SL(2) representation theory) to understand the fundamental group<br/>of 3-manifolds which is a vital invariant of 3-manifolds.  The<br/>SL(2,C) representation theory has been used very successfully in<br/>recent years by many topologists. Our approach seems to be new<br/>and uses simple loops on surfaces.  The second part of the<br/>proposed work addresses the geometry of surfaces. One of the main<br/>problems on surface geometry is the moduli space problem. The<br/>moduli space problem asks for, for instance, what is the shape of<br/>the space of all convex polyhedrons which look like a cube.  Many<br/>geometric problems are best expressed in terms of the topology<br/>and geometry of the moduli space. The corresponding object for<br/>high genus surface is the Teichmuller space. In contrasts to the<br/>topology of the Teichmuller space which is well understood for<br/>about 60 years, the geometry of it is much less understood. Our<br/>proposed work is an attempt to understand explicitly the complex<br/>analytic geometry of the Teichmuller space. The explicit<br/>description of the complex geometry of the Teichmuller space will<br/>have applications not only in mathematics but also in physics,<br/>for instance in string theory.<br/>"

Starting around 1980, Gromov proposed classifying<br/>groups geometrically using the relation of quasi-isometry.  He<br/>demonstrated that the quasi-isometry class of a group G can often<br/>be described explicitly in simple algebraic or geometric terms, a<br/>process now referred to as ``quasi-isometric rigidity'' or<br/>``QI-rigidity'' for the group G. The first part of this project<br/>will be to investigate QI-rigidity problems for graphs of surface<br/>groups and of abelian groups.  An initial focus will be those<br/>graphs of groups with the simplest algebraic structure, namely<br/>semidirect products with free groups, determined by a<br/>homomorphism from a free group into an appropriate automorphism<br/>group such as the mapping class group of a surface.  General<br/>graphs of surface groups are determined by homomorphisms into the<br/>commensurability mapping class group, a much more mysterious<br/>object, and this point of view will be used to investigate<br/>constructions of new and interesting examples.  Also, recent work<br/>on graphs of abelian groups has revealed a lot of rich structure,<br/>suggesting a real possibility of obtaining QI-rigidity in many<br/>new cases.  In the second part of this project, the focus will be<br/>to study geometric properties of free groups, motivated by<br/>analogies between surface groups and free groups.  In particular,<br/>Thurston's ending lamination conjecture, an important goal in the<br/>study of surface groups, has an analogue in the study of free<br/>groups, in terms of classifying certain group actions up to<br/>equivariant quasi-isometry.  Pursuing this issue will require<br/>generalizing many of the standard tools of surface groups, such<br/>as geodesics in Teichmuller space, to the setting of free groups.<br/><br/>Geometric group theory is the study of infinitely symmetric<br/>patterns.  Popular examples called ``surface groups'' are<br/>familiar from wallpaper symmetries and from the symmetries of<br/>Escher's prints.  Scientific examples occur in the symmetry<br/>groups of crystalline arrays, and the symmetry groups of field<br/>theories in particle physics.  The development of topology<br/>starting in the late 19th century, and the concomitant<br/>development of combinatorial group theory, exhibited a direct<br/>link between abstract groups and geometry.  The need for deeper<br/>understanding of this link has been demonstrated again and again<br/>by different threads within 20th century mathematical<br/>developments.  Many of these threads were pulled together around<br/>1980 by Gromov, whose proposed unification of geometric group<br/>theory using the relation of ``quasi-isometry'' has been very<br/>fruitful in the intervening twenty years.  The focus of this<br/>research project will be to investigate quasi-isometric<br/>classification problems for several different types of symmetry<br/>groups.  In particular, by using a constructive technique known<br/>as ``graphs of groups'', new symmetry groups can be constructed<br/>out of familiar examples such as surface groups; these and<br/>closely related constructions will be the subjects of this<br/>research project.<br/>"

The Principal Investigator has defined<br/>a topological structure called a ""hyperpencil"" on an<br/>even-dimensional closed manifold, generalizing a linear system of<br/>curves on a complex algebraic manifold.  He has shown that any<br/>hyperpencil canonically determines a symplectic structure on the<br/>manifold.  In dimensions less than 8, this correspondence maps<br/>the set of hyperpencils onto a dense subset of all symplectic<br/>forms on the manifold (up to isotopy and scale).  A similar<br/>statement seems likely in higher dimensions, and would provide a<br/>complete topological characterization of those manifolds<br/>admitting symplectic structures.  If the fibers of this<br/>correspondence can be topologically specified, the result will be<br/>a purely topological description of a dense subset of all<br/>symplectic structures on all closed manifolds.  In addition to<br/>this investigation, Stein surfaces and their contact 3-manifold<br/>boundaries will be studied by methods such as Legendrian Kirby<br/>calculus.  The topology of exotic R^4's and other smooth<br/>4-manifolds will also be investigated.<br/><br/>An n-manifold is a space that in small regions looks just like<br/>n-dimensional Euclidean space.  Points, curves and surfaces are<br/>manifolds of dimensions 0,1 and 2, respectively.  The space in<br/>which we live is a 3-manifold, and the universe (space-time) is a<br/>4-manifold.  Surprisingly, 3- and 4-manifolds are much less well<br/>understood than their higher-dimensional counterparts, although<br/>major progress has been made in recent years.  Symplectic and<br/>contact structures on manifolds were discovered through classical<br/>physics (Hamiltonian mechanics and optics, respectively), but<br/>they are now seen to be important in such diverse areas as<br/>quantum physics, complex analysis, differential geometry and<br/>topology.  For example, a rigid pendulum swinging in<br/>3-dimensional space determines a symplectic manifold.  The bob<br/>moves on a spherical surface, so its position is specified by 2<br/>variables (latitude and longitude on this sphere).  To completely<br/>specify the state of the system, one must also include the<br/>momentum of the bob.  At any position, its momentum is tangent to<br/>the sphere and thus specified by two more variables.  Hence, the<br/>set of states of the system is a 4-manifold (locally specified by<br/>4 variables).  This 4-manifold has a special symplectic structure<br/>whose role is to link each position variable to the corresponding<br/>momentum variable.  This linkage ultimately results in Hamilton's<br/>equations describing the motion of the pendulum under the<br/>influence of a specified force field.  There are many other<br/>situations in which manifolds and their symplectic and contact<br/>structures arise.  While our understanding of such structures has<br/>advanced enormously in recent years, some of the most basic<br/>questions remain to be answered.  Which manifolds have symplectic<br/>or contact structures, and how many such structures are there on<br/>a given manifold?  How many 4-manifolds (if any) are there<br/>satisfying a given description?  Questions such as these form the<br/>basis of this project.<br/>"

However it<br/>has revealed (through the frameworks of TQFT and Vassiliev <br/>theory) a wealth of very interesting algebraic structures, <br/>which seem to be specifically related to topology in three <br/>dimensions, and so should be thought of as kind of <br/>``new algebraic topology'' in three dimensions.<br/>Roberts intends to try to bridge the gap between this new <br/>topology and classical algebraic topology. There are three <br/>main areas of investigation. The first is K-theory, which <br/>could help to explain the relationship between quantum knot <br/>invariants and Vassiliev invariants (for example, why the <br/>Jones polynomial is a polynomial). The second is Rozansky-Witten theory, a very interesting new example of a TQFT which <br/>provides new hints about intepretation of the invariants, <br/>and could have additional applications in complex or <br/>hyperkaehler geometry.  The third is the hyperbolic volume <br/>conjecture of Kashaev, Murakami and Murakami.

The main <br/>tools of knot theory are ""topological invariants"", numbers <br/>which can be associated to knots and which encode some<br/>information about their structure. During the last sixteen <br/>years, ideas borrowed from the physics of quantum field <br/>theory have led to the discovery of many new and beautiful <br/>invariants called ""quantum invariants"", but because of this <br/>unusual origin, their meaning remains very mysterious, and <br/>their potential unfulfilled.

The main objective is to design algorithms for recognizing (3D) objects from their (2D) camera images, with an emphasis on automated face recognition. The biggest challenge comes from the variability manifested in the images. How do we model it and what efficient procedures can be used to analyze it?  Many current methods seek dominant subspaces (e.g. PCA, ICA, Fisher discriminant) of the observed images to capture and characterize this variability. Although the hardware technology has advanced significantly for both computing and imaging,the current mathematical techniques and algorithms for computer vision remain  limited in their ability to fundamentally handle <br/>the image variability. Recent technological advances, such as 3D imaging, super fast graphics, and high-performance computing, make this project both feasible and timely.<br/><br/>Our approach builds upon the physical considerations that will lead to representations in stochastic geometry.  We highlight the physical factors behind the image variability  and propose methods to model them. A distinct advantage of modeling the physical factors is the ability to incorporate the contextual information in the resulting recognition algorithms.  In particular, we will develop (i) geometric models for facial shape variability, (ii) tools for synthetic illumination and facial rendering, and (iii) algorithms for statistical inference on these models/parameters. We use coordinate and differential geometry to characterize object shapes, pose, motion, reflectance, illumination, and their time variations, and show that these variables take values on the Lie groups and their quotient spaces.  Following the ""analysis by synthesis"" paradigm, where the observed images are statistically compared to the synthesized images, we propose inferences over the nuisance variables to seek the best match, and thus perform recognition.  In a Bayesian framework, the contextual knowledge of these physical representations can be incorporated as a prior model, to add to the observed information. The inference engine is based on the Monte-Carlo methods particularized to these representations. These stated goals require expertise from distant areas of statistics, geometry, computing, and graphics.  Through this FRG collaboration, we will create an atmosphere for synergistic, multi-disciplinary research that will support many future endeavors.<br/><br/>"

However, some of circumstances have changed<br/>since we wrote the proposal, so I thought I should discuss them with you<br/>in case the budget is affected.  Sorry for the delay getting back to you,<br/>I was visiting the University of Chicago this week.<br/>     We asked for summer money to support three graduate students: Karl<br/>Bloch, Diarmuid Crowley,  and Tae-Hee Kim.  Well, I am happy to report<br/>that Diarmuid Crowley has been named a Clay Mathematical Institute<br/>Lift-Off Mathematician <br/><br/>http://www.claymath.org/researchers/index.htm<br/><br/>and will receive some money from them this summer (provided some visa<br/>problems work out.)

However, he could still use<br/>NSF money, for example, he is attending the 3-week School on<br/>high-dimensional manifold topology in at the ICTP in Trieste, Italy,<br/>mostly at his own expense.  Please advise us if it is necessary to<br/>rebudget and return the money allotted to Diarmuid.<br/><br/>     The second change is with regard to my proposed REU student, Matt<br/>Cecil.  Matt Cecil worked with me as an REU student last summer (partially<br/>supported by NSF funds), and continued throughout the academic year.  He<br/>is attending UCSD as a math graduate student in the fall.  However, due to<br/>mathematical reasons and personal reasons, he will not be an REU student<br/>with me this summer.  So the question again is - what to do with the money<br/>allotted to him?  I talked to our chair, Dan Maki, and he said that he<br/>could use the money to help undergraduate research projects connected with<br/>industry.  Dan has many industrial contacts throughout the state of<br/>Indiana and had lead such projects for several years.  The money would<br/>primarily go to student travel expenses.<br/><br/>    So, Chris, please advise on whether we should give some money back to<br/>the NSF and rebudget, or just go with the modifications outlined above.<br/><br/>Jim<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Morgan<br/><br/>The work proposed to be carried out under this grant concerns mathematical formulation and proof of some of the mathematical dualities arising from high energy physics. The first duality <br/>to be studied concerns the F-theory/heterotic string duality. <br/>The mathematical formulation of the duality is that for a <br/>certain range of parameters the moduli spaces of classical <br/>vacua for various compactifications of F-theory and of <br/>heterotic string theory should be isomorphic.  We conjecture <br/>that the appropriate mathematical statement is that the <br/>moduli spaces of heterotic vacua are non-normal infinite-sheeted coverings of the F-theory moduli space associated with  <br/>maximal parabolic subgroups of the fundamental group of <br/>the F-theory moduli space. These maximal parabolic subgroups <br/>are the fundamental groups of neighborhoods of certain <br/>divisors at infinity. This study involves a detailed analysis <br/>of the moduli space of semi-stable principal bundles over <br/>elliptic curves as well as the notions of differential <br/>cohomology. The second duality is the famous quantum field <br/>theory duality between SU(2) Yang-Mills theory and the <br/>abelian Seiberg-Witten theory. These dual descriptions <br/>are simply the high and low energy limits of a twisted <br/>version of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. One part of <br/>a mathematical understanding of this duality involves <br/>giving precise mathematical formulations of the high and <br/>low energy limits of the twisted supersymmetric theory <br/>and showing how certain correlation functions in this <br/>twisted theory  converge in the sense of perturbation <br/>theory to the usual Donaldson polynomial invariants in the <br/>high energy limit and to the Seiberg-Witten invariants in <br/>the low energy limit. This part of the story is surely <br/>amenable to rigorous mathematical formulation. The <br/>more ambitious goal is to find some mathematical <br/>formalism which allows for a mathematically rigorous <br/>interpelation between these two limits -- a mathematical <br/>substitute for the mathematically undefined quantum <br/>field theory -- which would allow one to compare the <br/>high and low energy limits.      <br/><br/>The connection between mathematics and high energy <br/>theoretical physics has always been a close one. In the <br/>last few years it has taken on new aspects. With the <br/>study of global issues in quantum field theory and string <br/>theory has come a new level of interaction between geometry <br/>and topology and these areas of theoretical physics. Belief <br/>in the existence of these (to date non-rigorous) physics <br/>theories leads physicists to make predictions, i.e., <br/>conjectures in mathematics.  In a strange way these <br/>conjectures play the role that physical predictions used <br/>to play. Now the physicists take confirmation that they are <br/>on the right track when these mathematical predictions can <br/>be verified by rigorous mathematics, which, since it is <br/>rigorous, can not make use of the quantum field theory <br/>paradigms that we used to make the prediction in the <br/>first place. The interest in mathematics of this interplay <br/>is that the sorts of mathematical statements that are <br/>predicted in this way have turned out to be quite novel <br/>producing conjectures unlike anything that had been seen <br/>before. Much of the progress the last ten or fifteen years <br/>in large areas of geometry and topology traces back to this <br/>source. One of the most fruitful sources of mathematical <br/>conjectures has been various dualities in physics. These <br/>occur when there is more than one classical mathematical <br/>limit of a quantum field theory or string theory. The <br/>mathematical objects that arise in the description of <br/>the classical limits then are related because they are <br/>limits of a single quantum field theory or string theory. <br/>The mathematical problem is always the same -- define <br/>rigorously what the relationship is and then establish it mathematically. The work proposed here is exactly along <br/>these lines for two such dualities. <br/>"

Concerning the<br/>first question, previous work of the principal<br/>investigator shows that these questions boil down to<br/>computing abelian groups which depend only on the<br/>dimension, the fundamental group and the first two<br/>Stiefel-Whitney classes of the manifold these metrics<br/>live on.  The role these groups play in the <br/>existence/classification problem for positive scalar<br/>curvature metrics is analogous of the role of Wall's<br/>surgery obstruction groups in the existence/classification<br/>problem for smooth structures.  The principal investigator <br/>hopes to  gain an algebraic/functorial  understanding of <br/>these groups by studying various maps that relate these <br/>groups with homology/K-theory/connective K-theory of <br/>classifying spaces of groups, and with the K-theory of the<br/>associated group C*-algebras. Concerning positive Ricci <br/>curvature, the investigator is pursuing a proof of his <br/>conjecture that the existence of a positive Ricci <br/>curvature metric on a spin manifold with vanishing <br/>first Pontryagin class implies the vanishing of its<br/>Witten genus. This invariant arose from considerations <br/>in string theory. Heuristically it is the index of a yet <br/>to be rigorously defined ""Dirac operator"" on the free <br/>loop space of this manifold. Mike Hopkins has described a <br/>homotopy theoretic way to define the Witten genus of a <br/>family of such manifolds which  lives in the elliptic <br/>cohomology of the parameter space. It is a very interesting <br/>challenge to express the elliptic cohomology and the<br/>family Witten genus in terms of the objects that string <br/>theorists are analysing and thus to give a geometric <br/>interpretation of Hopkins construction.<br/><br/><br/>These projects fit in the general framework of trying <br/>to relate the topology of a manifold (qualitative <br/>information about its global shape) and its geometry <br/>(quantitative information about its local shape). For<br/>2-dimensional manifolds (like the surface of a ball or <br/>a tire), a nice classification has been known for a long <br/>time: Two such surfaces have the same topology (that is, <br/>they can be deformed into each other if we think of<br/>them as being made of thin rubber) if and only if they <br/>have the same number of `holes' (the surface of a ball <br/>no holes, the surface of a tire or a cup has one hole, <br/>and a pretzel has two holes).  Moreover, if a surface has<br/>`positive curvature' in the sense that the angle sum in <br/>each triangle whose edges are geodesics (shortest curves) <br/>is larger than 180 degrees, then this surface has the <br/>same topology as the surface of a ball. It is a major <br/>goal of modern day mathematics to generalize these <br/>results to higher dimensional manifolds.  For example, <br/>our universe is a manifold of dimension 3, Einstein's <br/>space-time has dimension 4, and manifolds of dimension 10, respectively, 26 play a crucial role in the theoretical <br/>physics of the attempted unification of the four <br/>fundamental forces.<br/>"

The Euler characteristic of the cohomology <br/>groups is equal to the Jones polynomial.  We would like to <br/>extend this theory to link cobordisms. The invariant of a <br/>cobordism will be a homomorphism between cohomology groups <br/>assigned to the boundaries of the cobordism. Furthermore, <br/>the theory should extend to tangles and tangle cobordisms. <br/>To a tangle we'll associate a functor between triangulated <br/>categories associated to the boundaries of the tangle, and <br/>to a tangle cobordism a natural transformation between functors. <br/>These triangulated categories will be related to highest weight<br/>categories of modules over simple Lie algebras, as well as <br/>categories of modules over certain Frobenius algebras, such <br/>as cyclotomic Hecke algebras. In addition, we will look for <br/>cohomology theories lifts of other quantum invariants of links <br/>and 3-manifolds, including the Alexander and HOMFLY polynomials <br/>and Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.   <br/><br/>An n-dimensional manifold is an object that locally looks <br/>like an n-dimensional space.

A common theme is that these problems all<br/>involve hyperbolic geometry, either as a tool to understand wider<br/>range problems or as a topic of interest in itself. The first<br/>half of the proposal is a natural extension of the research<br/>developed by the Principal Investigator in the past few years. On<br/>the purely hyperbolic side, it proposes to study convex cores of<br/>hyperbolic structures on 3-dimensional manifolds, and to further<br/>develop an approach to hyperbolic structures on surfaces which is<br/>based on the technique of geodesic currents. On the more<br/>topological side, it proposes to take advantage of methods of<br/>hyperbolic geometry to analyze simple closed curves on<br/>surfaces. In particular, one of the objectives of the proposal is<br/>to determine the fractal dimension of the space of simple closed<br/>curves on a surface. The second part of the proposal is based on<br/>exciting new conjectures which would connect two aspects of the<br/>theory of knotted curves in 3--dimensional space which so far<br/>have had very little interaction, namely topological quantum<br/>field theory and hyperbolic geometry on knot complements. The<br/>project proposes to attack these conjectures and, if these are<br/>proved, to further develop the connections so established.<br/><br/>The proposed research is focused on the interplay between<br/>hyperbolic geometry and topology. In low-dimensional topology,<br/>one tries to analyze the possible shapes for spaces of dimensions<br/>2 and 3. In particular, it includes as a subfield knot theory,<br/>where the goal is to understand all possible ways in which a<br/>string can be knotted in space; techniques of knot theory have<br/>successfully been applied to analyze the recombination of DNA and<br/>the knotting of complex molecular structures. Hyperbolic geometry<br/>is apparently very different. It is a non-euclidean geometry<br/>which was introduced in the early nineteenth century, in order to<br/>test the internal consistency of the axioms of the classical<br/>geometry developed by Euclid and other Greek mathematicians. An<br/>unexpected connection was established in the nineteen seventies,<br/>through ground breaking work of Bill Thurston who showed that<br/>hyperbolic geometry could be successfully used to solve problems<br/>in topology. For instance, there is a number associated to each<br/>knotted curve, called its ""hyperbolic volume"" and which can be<br/>computed fairly easily by current software. If two knotted curves<br/>have different hyperbolic volumes, one is guaranteed that it is<br/>impossible to deform one curve to the other. A new picture is now<br/>beginning to emerge, where the hyperbolic volume of a knotted<br/>curve unexpectedly occurs in techniques of mathematical physics<br/>originally designed to predict the behavior of high energy<br/>particles. The main part of the proposal is aimed at clarifying<br/>this picture, with the expectation that the cross-fertilization<br/>between topology, hyperbolic geometry and mathematical physics<br/>will lead to advances in each of these three fields.<br/>"

The goal of this proposal is to come to a<br/>coherent understanding of curvature as a combinatorial notion. <br/>In addition, bringing together researchers from a variety of mathematical disciplines, we wish to bridge the chasms between geometry, combinatorics, algebra and topology, using curvature <br/>as the unifying theme.<br/><br/><br/> <br/>  <br/><br/>"

Kopperman<br/><br/>This award provides partial support for participants at the<br/>Sixteenth Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications, <br/>to take place July 18-21, 2001 at City College in New York, NY.<br/>This Conference series addresses the need of topologists to <br/>share new ideas at a time of year when most are free of academic commitments, a need demonstrated by its continued growth. <br/>This series began in 1984 at the City College of New York with 35 participants and 13 talks. Over the past decade, attendance has averaged about 150, with participants all inhabited continents <br/>and about 100 talks. Today, after much concentration on <br/>problems internal to topology, emphasis in this field is again turning toward applications to other areas. Thus we have <br/>organized the following Special Sessions: Asymmetric Topology and Computer Science, Dynamical Systems, Topological Algebra and <br/>Functional Analysis, Set-theoretic Topology, and Topological <br/>Groups and Semigroups. Further information, including invited speakers, schedule of talks, and housing information, is available <br/>at sumtopo.att.net."
