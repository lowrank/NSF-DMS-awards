The first, joint with<br/>Michael Hopkins and Constantin Teleman, builds on our theorem identifying the<br/>Verlinde ring in the representation theory of loop groups with a certain<br/>twisted equivariant K-theory ring.  The Verlinde ring appears as part of a<br/>3-dimensional topological quantum field theory, Chern-Simons theory, and we<br/>will attempt to make further constructions in this direction using K-theory.<br/>In another direction, the Verlinde ring may be made using correspondence<br/>diagrams and integration in K-theory.  Consistent orientations of moduli<br/>spaces are necessary to carry this out, and the appearance of Madsen-Tillmann<br/>spectra in this regard will be further explored.  Extensions to families of<br/>surfaces and ""open strings"" potentially connect with other mathematics, for<br/>example von Neumann algebras, and may open up new links.  The second main<br/>line of research, joint with a variety of collaborators, concerns topological<br/>ideas in string theory and M-theory.  For example, with Greg Moore and Graeme<br/>Segal we hope to construct completely the quantum theory of a generalized<br/>self-dual field.  This will mix theta functions, Heisenberg groups, quadratic<br/>forms, and the index theorem in a novel manner.  There are also interesting<br/>questions involving various aspects of D-branes and the B-field, some of<br/>which impact current ideas about the landscape of solutions to string theory.<br/>In addition, there are many student projects which relate to these topics as<br/>well as to the geometric theory of Dirac operators.<br/><br/>This research is part of an interaction between algebraic topology and<br/>quantum field theory which began in the mid 1970s.  The flow of ideas is<br/>bidirectional.  Existing mathematics is applied to solve particular problems<br/>in physical theories.  New ideas emerging from the physics inspire<br/>developments and new directions in the mathematics.  In particular, over the<br/>past 15 years a new topological side to quantum field theory has been<br/>developed and has had ramifications not only in topology but other parts of<br/>geometry as well.  Some of our efforts are devoted to using the integration<br/>processes in algebraic topology to shed light on the integration processes in<br/>topological quantum field theory--the former are well-defined whereas the<br/>latter have as yet to be understood mathematically in the necessary<br/>generality.  The grant also supports educational activities, including the<br/>Saturday Morning Math Group, a highly successful outreach program for middle<br/>and high school students.<br/>"

It<br/>relates a very active branch of geometric group theory (automata<br/>groups and groups acting on rooted trees) with symbolic and<br/>holomorphic dynamics.  Before introduction of iterated monodromy<br/>groups, groups generated by finite automata were mainly isolated<br/>exotic (counter) examples. It is clear now that such groups appear<br/>naturally in connection with iterations of self-coverings of<br/>topological spaces (in particular iterations of post-critically<br/>finite rational functions). This opens new perspectives of<br/>application of holomorphic dynamics to group theory. On the other<br/>hand, computational effectiveness of automata groups helps to<br/>study deeper the combinatorics and symbolic dynamics of<br/>self-coverings. For example, if the self-covering is expanding,<br/>then its Julia set is uniquely determined by the iterated<br/>monodromy group. The project suggests further investigation of the<br/>connections between dynamical systems and automata groups. We<br/>hope, in particular, to get new results in the theory of groups<br/>acting on rooted trees, groups generated by automata, theory of<br/>growth of groups, find new applications of geometric group theory<br/>to combinatorics of iterations of rational functions and<br/>polynomials.<br/><br/>{Second abstract.} The project brings together two branches<br/>of Mathematics, which where not so close before: geometric group<br/>theory and holomorphic dynamics. Geometric groups theory is a part<br/>of algebra which studies large-scale properties of groups of<br/>symmetries. Holomorphic dynamics studies iterations of rational<br/>and polynomial functions and is a source of complex and beautiful<br/>fractal structures such as Mandelbrot and Julia sets. Iterated<br/>monodromy groups, introduced by the investigator, are naturally<br/>associated with rational iterations and are groups encoding in a<br/>compact symbolic form all the complex topological behavior of the<br/>iterations and geometry of their Julia sets. The construction of<br/>the iterated monodromy group is very natural, but groups obtained<br/>in this way are very exotic from the point of view of classical<br/>group theory. Difference between classical groups and iterated<br/>monodromy groups resembles in some way the difference between the<br/>``smooth'' geometric shapes of the classical geometry and fractal<br/>``wild'' shapes of holomorphic dynamics. Algebraic properties of<br/>iterated monodromy groups remain to be rather mysterious and a<br/>part of the project is to understand them better. We are also<br/>hoping that this new connection between group theory and dynamical<br/>systems will be fruitful for both parts of mathematics, that we<br/>will be able to use group theory to obtain new results in<br/>holomorphic dynamics and to apply holomorphic dynamics to study<br/>new classes of groups.<br/><br/>"

The conference features emerging areas of  research in topology. Typically our conferences feature a several  senior researchers and a large group of young researchers, mostly  recent Ph.D.'s and some graduate students. This format, with its  attention to emerging areas of research, helps this conference play a significant role in both disseminating the newest research and  preparing graduate students and postdocs for a successful research  career in mathematics. We encourage and fund participation by members  of underrepresented groups. Our participants and organizers have  included many women.<br/><br/>Topology can be viewed as the study of the structure and shape of the  space we live in. As such there are deep relationships between  topology, geometry, and physics.

In particular, the project will explore special bases of invariant tensors, hyperbolic structure as a limit of quantum 3-manifold invariants, quantum algorithms, and notions of quantum metric spaces.  Related spin-off projects include an extension of the probabilistic method in probability using the central limit theorem, and a classification of known relations among complexity classes (both classical and quantum).<br/><br/><br/>The aim of this project is to apply the ideas of quantum physics to both mathematics, in particular to geometry and topology,  and to computer science.  The heart of quantum mechanics is the statistical notion of quantum uncertainty.  This is the idea and the fact that when one physical measurement of an object (such as position) is known precisely, other related values (such as momentum) cannot have definite values, but instead have a statistical range of values.  Quantum uncertainty is always modelled by the mathematical notion of non-commutativity,  which is the idea that AB need not equal BA when A and B are abstract variables. Non-commutativity plays an increasingly important role in low-dimensional geometry and topology.  Quantum uncertainty could also lead to new kinds of computers that can execute special quantum algorithms.  These two currents of research are intellectually similar, and this project will explore them together.<br/><br/>"

The current project develops new connections between the algebraic system of diagrams and other established algebraic systems (Lie algebras and crossed modules) that are closely associated with the standard model in physics.

The conference has  become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The  next series of conferences will have six primary sponsoring  universities: The University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University,  Rice University, the University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and  Texas Christian University.  The conference is designed to enhance both  the educational and the research atmosphere of the active community of  geometers and topologists in Texas and the surrounding states.  The  conference is committed to bring researchers of national and  international stature to discuss their research and to interact with  mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states.  Summaries of talks  with notation of important results have been publicly reported for some  time and will continue similarly in the future.<br/><br/>By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two  high-impact foci.  First, the conference makes it possible for the  community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states  (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular  basis. This both stimulates individual research and generates productive  cooperative efforts between schools.  Second, the conference is  committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base.  In order that there be no barrier to participation, the  conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no  registration fees.  Graduate students, junior faculty, women,  minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support.

A main problem is that these invariants are poorly understood from the point of view of topology and geometry. The goal of this project is to make connections between the quantum invariants and the existing knowledge  of the geometry and topology of 3-manifolds. The main approach will be an  investigation of the large level asymptotic expansion of the quantum  invariants of closed 3-manifolds. The idea of studying these asymptotics  stems from Witten's work on the quantum invariants. From that work and  subsequent work of mathematicians there have emerged some rigorous mathematical conjectures about the geometric content of these asymptotics.  These conjectures indicate that the quantum invariants hide deep topological information. The PI plans to check, in collaboration with others, (some of)  the conjectures via concrete case studies. E.g., he will jointly with  J.E. Andersen continue their project on the surgeries on the figure 8 knot.  All but a finite number of these 3-manifolds are hyperbolic and it is the  hope that this case study can shed some light on the connection between  quantum invariants and hyperbolic geometry. A main question is whether the  quantum invariants can detect the volume of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In addition the PI will try to work from a more general point of view,  namely he will apply T. Yoshida's new approach to the quantum invariants  to try to calculate the asymptotic expansion of the invariants for all  closed 3-manifolds, Yoshida's construction being based on an abelianization  of conformal field theory. In that connection the PI will jointly with Yoshida work on proving that Yoshida's invariants coincide with the more well established Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants thereby making a connection to the other approaches to the quantum invariants.<br/><br/>This project tries to develop new techniques to obtain knowledge about the shape (topology) and geometry of low-dimensional objects such as knots  and 3-dimensional spaces. A main reason that we should study low-dimensional  spaces and their geometry and shape is that nature contains such spaces in  many contexts. Thus large molecules, e.g. DNA, have a ""knotted"" structure  and newer research points in the direction that one can apply knot invariants  to obtain information about such molecules. Certain of their properties  depend on their shape, e.g., how they are ""knotted"". Another example is in  cosmology where a central question is: What is the ""shape"" of our universe? Here one should think of the fact that when we walk around on the earth it just looks like an ordinary plane but in fact the surface of the earth  is like the surface of a very large ball. It is similar with our universe.  Locally everything looks flat, i.e., locally our universe looks like a  standard 3-dimensional Euclidean space (a 3-dimensional pendant to a plane),  but maybe the universe as a whole is something completely different,  like a curved compact space. Mathematicians use so-called invariants to  detect topological and geometric properties of spaces, e.g., if they are  curved like a sphere or not like a plane. The quantum invariants, the theme  for this project, is a relatively new family of invariants dating back to  V. Jones' discovery of the Jones polynomial in the 80ties."

This meeting is devoted to Skein Modules, Khovanov<br/>Homology and its relation to Hochschild Homology. ``Khovanov<br/>homology'' is a new development in quantum topology that emerged<br/>in the last several years. It is a generalization of the Jones<br/>and Homflypt polynomials of links to homologies of certain chain<br/>complexes.  These homologies turn out to be significantly<br/>stronger than the original invariants. Khovanov's ideas were also<br/>applied to the polynomial invariants of graphs, as well as<br/>Kauffman bracket skein module of some 3-manifolds. One of the<br/>most recent developments is Przytycki's observation that Khovanov<br/>homology (or its comultiplication-free variant developed by<br/>Helme-Guizon and Rong) can be interpreted as Hochschild homology<br/>of underlying algebras. This shows how seemingly distant branches<br/>of mathematics can be put together.<br/><br/>Low dimensional topology studies shapes of three and four<br/>dimensional spaces. These dimensions are of particular interest<br/>to us because they are the dimensions of our space and our<br/>space-time. Knot theory is a subfield of low dimensional<br/>topology, which studies the knottedness in our space. One of the<br/>main goals of knot theory is to distinguish knotted objects. This<br/>is often done by means of the so called ""knot invariants,""<br/>functions that replace geometric objects, such as knots, with<br/>those that are easier to compare. Over the past two decades,<br/>there have been a flourish of new invariants in low dimensional<br/>topology, boosted by ideas from gauge theory, quantum algebras,<br/>and mathematical physics. In particular, a new invariant for<br/>knots, developed by Khovanov using ideas from homological<br/>algebra, has sparked a great deal of interest recently. The<br/>purpose of the Knots in Washington Conferences is to bring<br/>together the researchers of the field, including established<br/>mathematicians as well as graduate students and recent PhDs, to<br/>discuss the state of the art of the subject.<br/>"

It can be understood either as a finitely or infinitely generated group, with a standard finite generating set.  The principal investigator proposes to remove the dependence on this generating set by studying metric properties of the group with respect to arbitrary generating sets.  Building on previous work, she will investigate whether this group is automatic, as well as a quasi-isometry classification for the standard generalizations F(p) of F.  The remaining work proposed under this grant concerns twisted conjugacy classes and the Reidemeister number of a group automorphism.  If f is a selfmap of a compact manifold, then the number of twisted conjugacy classes of the induced map on the fundamental group is called the Reidemeister number R(f).  The Reidemeister number provides an upper bound on the Nielsen number N(f) for f, which is difficult to compu<br/>te.  If the Reidemeister number is infinite for any selfmap of the manifold, this eliminates the possibility of a special type of theorem equating N(f) and R(f).  The principal investigator proposes to extend the classes of (fundamental) groups with this property, and build on prior work to see when it is invariant under quasi-isometry.  She will also investigate a geometric interpretation of twisted conjugacy classes, and the relationship of this property to subgroup separability.<br/><br/>The principal investigator proposes several projects in the area<br/>of geometric group theory. This field studies fundamental mathematical objects called groups from a geometric point of view.  Symmetry groups are a typical example of mathematical groups.  The study of symmetry groups was used, for example, to discern that the shape of DNA was a double helix. The principal investigator studies closely one particular group, named Thompson's group after the researcher who first defined it.  Thompson's group can be understood algebraically, geometrically and analytically, allowing one to study it from differing viewpoints. The geometric perspective equates each group element with a pair of ""tree-like"" graphs, an approach which relates this group to questions in theoretical computer science. In this way it provides an interesting interdisciplinary application of abstract mathematics, with direct applications to the problem of transforming data to maximize the efficiency of some computer search algorithms.  The principal investigator proposes sev<br/>eral problems related to understanding the geometry of this group.  The remainder of her proposal concerns several problems at the intersection of geometric group theory and topology.<br/><br/>"

He also intends to show (in a joint work with P. <br/>Lambrechts and I.

These splitting <br/>results generalize to general embedding spaces some major theorems of <br/>knot theory (e.g., the collapse of the Vassiliev spectral sequence). In <br/>longer term, Arone would like to extend this work to the study of <br/>diffeomorphisms of manifolds. Roughly speaking, the first derivative of <br/>the space of diffeomorphisms is given by Waldhausen's A-theory, or <br/>alternatively by topological cyclic homology (TC), and Arone would like <br/>to find the higher analogues of TC, corresponding to the higher <br/>derivatives. The role played by the circle group in the definition of <br/>TC should in higher degrees be played by a category of graphs a fixed <br/>homotopy type, perhaps related to the outer space of graphs that has <br/>been used to study the groups of automorphisms of a free group. In a <br/>different vein, Arone is also interested in developing further the <br/>general theory of calculus of functors. For instance, he is interested <br/>in developing a theory of polynomial functors that would generalize <br/>Goodwillie's theory of homogeneous functor. Arone's understanding of <br/>the subject was given a boost by the work of M. Ching, which made clear <br/>the relevance of operads to this question. Arone is also interested in <br/>applying calculus of functors to mainstream homotopy theory. In a <br/>recent work with K. Lesh, he discovered a new filtration of complex <br/>K-theory and a rather surprising relationship between this filtration <br/>and the calculus of functors. The paper ends with a series of <br/>conjectures about the precise nature of this relationship, and he would <br/>like to pursue these conjectures.<br/><br/><br/>Arone believes that the proposal will shed new light on active areas of <br/>current research in mathematics and will lead to important new <br/>insights. The proposed research should cast an important part of <br/>geometric topology in terms familiar to algebraic topologists, and <br/>conversely bring the power of homotopy theory to geometric topology. <br/>The proposed activity involves an exciting interplay of ideas from <br/>algebraic topology, combinatorics, group cohomology and geometric <br/>topology. The PI hopes that eventually it will impact the thinking of <br/>mathematicians from fields other than topology. It should also generate <br/>exciting new ways to introduce important topics in topology to <br/>students. It is already beginning to generate a number of PhD theses in <br/>mathematics.<br/>"

In the last 15 years there have been several new perspectives on moduli spaces that have not only increased our understanding of these important objects, but have fundamentally affected major research directions of several areas of topology and geometry, including Hyperbolic Geometry and Geometric Group Theory, Algebraic and Symplectic Geometry, and most recently, Algebraic Topology. In the last five years there have been several startling advances in several of these areas. Taken as a whole, these areas have, in the last few years, represented some of the most exciting directions of study in topology and geometry, and they promise to continue to do so in the forseeable future. This proposal is for the funding of a major, three year emphasis program in the topology and geometry of moduli spaces and related topics. Each year a different mathematical perspective of this topic will be emphasized, but all three years will involve participants from a broad range of subfields. The three areas of emphasis will be Hyperbolic Geometry and Geometric Group Theory, The Algebraic Topology of Moduli Spaces and String Topology, and The Algebraic Geometry of Moduli Spaces and Symplectic Geometry.<br/><br/>The study of surfaces has been a major driving force in mathematics since the time of Riemann in the mid 19th century. The space of geometric structures on a given two dimensional surface is known as the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. These moduli spaces have been classically studied in algebraic geometry. With the pioneering work of M. Gromov in the 1970's,  these moduli spaces became instrumental in the study of symplectic geometry as well. They are also central  in the modern view of low dimensional topology and hyperbolic geometry  initiated by Thurston around the same time. With the development of conformal field theory and string theory in the 1980's, these moduli spaces also began to play an important role in theoretical physics. Most recently, techniques of algebraic topology have been brought to bear on the study of these moduli spaces over the last few years with exciting results. Conversely, formalisms from physics and geometry have had a major impact on recent research directions in algebraic topology. The last five years have seen exciting developments in all these geometric and topological areas affecting and affected by moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. As one can imagine, the excitement produced in these areas of study have attracted many graduate students and young mathematicians. To be effective researchers, it is important that these young mathematicians gain an understanding of the various different perspectives on these moduli spaces and related objects. Cross pollination between these areas both in terms of techniques and directions of research, can have a powerful effect on the development of these central topics in topology and geometry. This proposal is for the funding of a major, three year emphasis program in the topology and geometry of moduli spaces and related topics. The program will be organized by the Mathematics Research Center of Stanford University, one of the leading centers of research in geometry and topology, and by the American Institute of Mathematics, which is a major independent research institute. Each year a different mathematical perspective of this topic will be emphasized, but all three years will involve participants from a broad range of subfields. Some of the world's leading senior mathematicians, their junior colleagues, as well as students will participate in these programs, share and compare their different perspectives and areas of expertise, and will  work together  to deepen our understanding of this central area of mathematics, and produce new and exciting methods, techniques, and results.  <br/>"

The main focus of the project is to construct constant curvature metrics on triangulated closed 3-manifolds using a variational approach where the energy functional is the volume. Starting with a triangulation of a closed 3-manifold, the PI introduces the concept of angle structures on 3-simplexes and on triangulations. These are generalizations of the concepts introduced by  Casson and  Rivin  for  compact 3-manifold with non-empty tori boundary. An angle structure on a tetrahedron is an assignment of a dihedral angle to each edge of the tetrahedron so that each vertex triangle becomes a spherical triangle. For instance all spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic tetrahedra are angle structures. An angle structure on a triangulated closed 3-manifold is a realization of each 3-simplex by an angle structure so that the sum of dihedral angles at each edge is 360-degree. The space of all angle structures  on a fixed triangulated manifold is an open bounded convex polytope. The PI has shown that there is a natural notion of volume of angle structures which generalizes the notion of volume of tetrahedra in hyperbolic and spherical. The main focus of the project is on the local maximum point of the volume. The PI has established that the volume can be extended continuously to the compact closure of the space of all angle structures. This, in particular, established a conjecture of John Milnor on the volume of simplexes in classical geometry. It has also been shown that if the volume has a local maximum point in the space of all angle structures, then either the manifold has a constant curvature metric, or the manifold contains a very special 2-sphere or real projective plane. The main focus of the project is to study the maximum point of the volume at the boundary of the space of all angle structures.<br/><br/><br/>The physical universe is 3-dimensional. In mathematics,  3-dimensional spaces are called 3-manifolds. The study of 3-manifolds is one of the most important problems in geometry and topology. Understanding geometric shapes of the 3-dimensional spaces is of vital importance theoretically and practically. In 1978, William Thurston made a revolutionary conjecture which lists the best geometry structure a 3-dimensional space can have, i.e., he conjectured the best shape a 3-dimensional space can take. He also verified the conjecture for a vast class of 3-dimensional spaces. Recent work of R. Hamilton and G. Perelman may have solved conjecture.  However, for a 3-dimensional space, how to find algorithmically the best shape of a 3-dimensional space is still open. The goal of this proposal is to construct the algorithm. The PI has already made progresses in this direction. The successful completion of the proposal will have applications not only in mathematics, but also in computer graphics and computational general relativity.<br/>"

The purpose of the Fields program is to study and develop new applications of homotopy theory in algebraic geometry, mathematical physics and related disciplines. The homotopy theories of simplicial sheaves and presheaves are the foundation for motivic homotopy theory, and as such have contributed to the major calculational successes of the last decade in algebraic K-theory. In recent years, presheaves of spectra on the stack of formal group laws have emerged in the definitions of elliptic cohomology theories and topological modular forms. Simplicial sets and related combinatorial constructions are also the foundation for higher category theory. All of these subjects have both current and intended applications in mathematical physics. Similar ideas are present in new applications of homotopy theory in algebraic combinatorics and computer science, particularly in analysis of hyperplane arrangements or graph colouring, and in models for concurrent behaviour of parallel processing systems, computational geometry, and complexity.<br/><br/>The program will take place at the Fields Institute, which will mount an intensive program on Geometric Applications of Homotopy Theory during the period January-June 2007. NSF funding will allow a significant number of young U.S. researchers (postdocs, junior faculty, and graduate students) to participate in this program, and receive training in this area. Homotopy theory is a core topic within the mathematical subject of topology, but as described above, it impacts on a broad range of fields, including algebraic geometry, logic and computer science, and mathematical physics (eg in topological quantum field theory). Bringing together researchers in homotopy theory with those from the areas of application will stimulate exciting progress in both fields.<br/>"

In particular, our goal is to find the low-volume closed and cusped manifolds and to explain the success of the SnapPea census in determining the low-volume manifolds. Up to the mid 1990's the best lower bounds for volume of closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds appeared to be approximately 1/1000 of the likely lowest volume. Then the paper ""Homotopy Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds Are Hyperbolic"" improved the low-volume bounds by a factor of one hundred. Subsequently, many authors have used this result to achieve further improvements in the lower bound estimate. Now, the PI's believe they have developed a fundamental new tool (the MOM technology) which will not only find the low-volume closed and cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds, but also explain in sharp detail why the Complexity Conjecture is correct. Our method is a satisfying mix of elementary hyperbolic geometry, 3-manifold topology, Morse Theory, and rigorous computer analysis. The implementation of our approach will involve mathematicians with expertise in different core areas of math, and with a sound knowledge of the other areas utilized in our methodology. <br/><br/>180 years ago, W. Bolyai, C. F. Gauss, and N. Lobachevsky started a revolution in scientific thought by creating an alternative geometry to Euclidean geometry.  This non Euclidean geometry, called hyperbolic geometry,  has proven to be a remarkable tool in mathematics.  For example, the work of W. Thurston in the 1970's and 1980's showed that the vast majority of 3-dimensional spaces (3-manifolds) possessed geometric structures modeled on hyperbolic geometry, and that this geometric structure could be used to answer fundamental questions about the underlying 3-dimensional manifold.  In fact, hyperbolic 3-manifolds have been the subject of intense scrutiny these last 40 years with striking results achieved; most recently, the proofs of the Ending Lamination and Tameness Conjectures, by Y. Minsky et al. Despite these advances and the possible spectacular resolution of the Geometrization Conjecture by G. Perelman, one of the most basic elements of the theory remains to be understood. In particular, the most natural tool for analyzing a hyperbolic 3-manifold is to use the geometry to measure its size, i.e., to compute its volume, but the behavior of the volume function remains mysterious:  Thurston proved that there is a least volume hyperbolic 3-manifold, and a next lowest volume, and a next lowest, and so on, but despite 25 years of effort, none of the 3-manifolds possessing these low volumes have been conclusively identified.  This proposal introduces a startling new technique--the MOM Technology--that the PIs plan to develop to find all these low-volume manifolds and to explain what properties low-volume hyperbolic manifolds must have."

The first part of the proposal is concerned with the understanding of the dynamics of flows on translation surfaces.  This subject has its origins in the dynamics of billiards in polygons.  Specifically, the plan is to study conditions on a translation surface which will guarantee that there are directions in which the flow is minimal, but not uniquely ergodic. The objective of the second part of the proposal is to study the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space. Little is known about geodesics in this metric. The principal investigator will use combinatorial and geometric methods to study these geodesics. The third major area of research is the study of Heegaard splittings of a three manifold, via the combinatorics and geometry of the disc complex associated to a handlebody. An initial goal  of this study is to show that the disc complex is a Gromov hyperbolic space. One hopes to use this fact to build model manifolds for Heegard splittings.<br/><br/><br/>The principal investigator works in the  mathematical fields of geometry and dynamical systems on two dimensional surfaces.   The study of surfaces dates back hundreds of years, and is intimately connected with our understanding of the world around us.  Surprisingly, there is still much to be learned about surfaces. Geometry is concerned with their shapes, such as angles and straight lines, while in dynamical systems one studies   how objects can evolve in time.  The subject of dynamical systems dates back thousands of years to the study of the motion of the planets. One of the main goals  of this grant is to  study the dynamical properites of objects moving in straight lines on surfaces. It is expected that the findings of this work will lead to greater understanding of these fundamental objects.  The principal investigator plans to disseminate the knowledge gained by the activities of this grant by publishing the results and giving public lectures.

The context for this work is the on-going unification of the geometric and topological theories of<br/>3-manifolds. The results can be viewed in terms of the theorem, which is a consequence of work of Gromov, Thurston and Jorgensen, that the set of volumes of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds is a well-ordered set of real numbers. The proposed research aims to understand the topological properties of the 3-manifolds with volume less than a given threshold value. Alternatively, the goal is to determine the volume which corresponds to the ordinal at which a given topological property first appears. The techniques used range from very classical topological methods, such as a refined version of the tower construction used in proving the Loop Theorem, to the most recent developments, including the proof of the Marden Tameness conjecture and Perelman's estimates on the change of volume under Ricci flow. Interesting connections with group theory and combinatorial topology are also involved.<br/><br/>The spaces which are being studied in this research project, namely 3-dimensional manifolds, serve as mathematical models of the spatial aspect of a possible physical universe.  New connections between modern physics and the mathematical theory of 3-manifolds are being discovered at a rapidly accelerating pace.  The mathematical theory has traditionally been divided into topology and geometry, where geometry focuses on quantities which can be measured, such as lengths, angles, areas or volumes, and topology focuses on global properties that are preserved even when the geometric features are distorted. However, these two aspects of the subject are closely related, and<br/>there are many examples of results which relate geometric properties and topological properties.  Recent mathematical achievements, beginning with the Mostow Rigidity theorem and continuing up to the recent proofs of Marden's Tameness Conjecture and Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, are leading toward a unification of the geometrical and topological theories of 3-manifolds.  The research supported by this grant concentrates on hyperbolic manifolds, a class which includes the vast majority of 3-manifolds with a homogeneous geometric structure, and aims to understand in a quantitative sense how topological complexity depends on the geometrical volume of the<br/>manifold. <br/>"

Preliminary results show that up to topological isotopy, Stein open subsets are as common as possible. That is, if U satisfies the basic necessary condition (it is homeomorphic to an open handlebody with handles of index at most 2), then it is topologically isotopic (not necessarily smoothly or ambiently) to a Stein open subset. The project is revealing much more detailed structure: a 2-complex topological spine K for U that is smoothly embedded except for one point on each 2-cell, and a neighborhood system of K consisting of homeomorphic Stein surfaces indexed by a Cantor set and frequently realizing uncountably many diffeomorphism types. There is much control over minimal genera of homology classes of the Stein neighborhoods. The project investigates these phenomena using techniques from topological 4-manifold theory (Casson handles and reimbedding), and also applies these methods to study pseudoconvex smooth and topological embeddings of 3-manifolds into complex surfaces. A second thrust of the proposal concerns the topology of closed, symplectic 4-manifolds, such as the recently discovered simply connected 4-manifolds with small Euler characteristics. For example, what range of signature and Euler characteristic is realized for a fixed fundamental group? Which symplectic manifolds decompose completely after connected sum with a single CP^2? Can one find general bounds on the number of CP^2 summands required to decompose symplectic manifolds? These questions can be studied via Kirby calculus and Lefschetz fibrations. One can also drop the symplectic structures and ask the above questions for irreducible smooth 4-manifolds.<br/><br/>The project concerns the classification of 3- and 4-manifolds and their contact, symplectic and Stein structures. An n-manifold is a space locally indistinguishable from Euclidean n-space. For example the space in which we live and the universe (space-time) are 3- and 4-manifolds, respectively. Contact and symplectic structures first arose in classical physics (optics and Hamiltonian mechanics, respectively), but they are also intimately connected with more recent physics such as string theory, as well as various branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, topology and dynamical systems. Stein manifolds are symplectic manifolds endowed with additional structure that is naturally expressed via contact topology. They also have various equivalent definitions in terms of complex analysis - for example, Stein manifolds are essentially the same as complex submanifolds of complex n-space. Complex analysts have recognized Stein manifolds as fundamental objects of study for most of the past century, but much about them remains unknown. The present project investigates which open subsets of a complex manifold are Stein manifolds. This question (like many in topology) is most subtle in the context of 4-manifolds. In this setting, the project has already shown that every subset satisfying the most basic requirements can be deformed into a Stein subset, although the deformation cannot usually be made smooth. Such unsmoothable deformations can only be accessed via esoteric techniques from topological 4-manifold theory. Since these techniques are quite alien to complex analysts, the research is in some sense interdisciplinary, and the results are completely unlike anything obtainable by traditional analytic methods. For example, the resulting Stein manifolds frequently come in uncountably many types, all topologically equivalent but smoothly distinct. In addition to Stein manifolds, the project deals with 4-manifolds and symplectic and contact manifolds. Most of what is known about the classifications of these objects <br/>has been discovered in the past few decades.

Goodwillie and M. Weiss.  Recent results of Volic show that there is a strong connection between the two.  In fact, a certain tower of spaces arising from calculus of functors serves as a classifying object for finite type knot invariants, a fascinating class of invariants which has been found to connect in intricate ways to other areas of topology and geometry, as well as physics.  Other goals of the project concern more general spaces of knots and in particular the collapse of certain spectral sequences associated to these spaces.  This should give new information about homology and homotopy of spaces of knots, as well as new insight into appearance of interesting combinatorics in their study. A recent result due to P. Lambrechts and Volic concerning configuration spaces will serve as the starting point for this part of the project.  Since the construction of the calculus tower modeling the space of knots is quite general, another goal is to extract information about other spaces of embeddings.  In particular, G. Arone and Volic plan to use the interplay of two versions of calculus of the embedding functor, manifold and orthogonal, to show that the spectral sequences arising from these theories collapse.  This should also result in new insight into how these two versions of calculus interact.<br/><br/>Knots are some of the most interesting objects of study in topology both because they are easy to define and visualize and because they are of interest to physicists, chemists, etc. Some fundamental questions about knots, such as their classification, or construction of efficient ways of telling them apart (i.e. finding good knot invariants), still generate a wealth of exciting research.  One of the main objectives of this project is to further the understanding of knot theory by studying it through the new technique of calculus of functors.  It turns out, however, that the methods used are quite general and extend beyond knots to larger classes of topological spaces.  Thus the new connections between topology, geometry, combinatorics, and physics which are expected to arise from this project could have broad implications as well as bring together various schools of thought in topology in unexpected ways.<br/><br/>"

In particular, our goal is to find the low-volume closed and cusped manifolds and to explain the success of the SnapPea census in determining the low-volume manifolds. Up to the mid 1990's the best lower bounds for volume of closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds appeared to be approximately 1/1000 of the likely lowest volume. Then the paper ""Homotopy Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds Are Hyperbolic"" improved the low-volume bounds by a factor of one hundred. Subsequently, many authors have used this result to achieve further improvements in the lower bound estimate. Now, the PI's believe they have developed a fundamental new tool (the MOM technology) which will not only find the low-volume closed and cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds, but also explain in sharp detail why the Complexity Conjecture is correct. Our method is a satisfying mix of elementary hyperbolic geometry, 3-manifold topology, Morse Theory, and rigorous computer analysis. The implementation of our approach will involve mathematicians with expertise in different core areas of math, and with a sound knowledge of the other areas utilized in our methodology. <br/><br/>180 years ago, W. Bolyai, C. F. Gauss, and N. Lobachevsky started a revolution in scientific thought by creating an alternative geometry to Euclidean geometry.  This non Euclidean geometry, called hyperbolic geometry,  has proven to be a remarkable tool in mathematics.  For example, the work of W. Thurston in the 1970's and 1980's showed that the vast majority of 3-dimensional spaces (3-manifolds) possessed geometric structures modeled on hyperbolic geometry, and that this geometric structure could be used to answer fundamental questions about the underlying 3-dimensional manifold.  In fact, hyperbolic 3-manifolds have been the subject of intense scrutiny these last 40 years with striking results achieved; most recently, the proofs of the Ending Lamination and Tameness Conjectures, by Y. Minsky et al. Despite these advances and the possible spectacular resolution of the Geometrization Conjecture by G. Perelman, one of the most basic elements of the theory remains to be understood. In particular, the most natural tool for analyzing a hyperbolic 3-manifold is to use the geometry to measure its size, i.e., to compute its volume, but the behavior of the volume function remains mysterious:  Thurston proved that there is a least volume hyperbolic 3-manifold, and a next lowest volume, and a next lowest, and so on, but despite 25 years of effort, none of the 3-manifolds possessing these low volumes have been conclusively identified.

In particular, our goal is to find the low-volume closed and cusped manifolds and to explain the success of the SnapPea census in determining the low-volume manifolds. Up to the mid 1990's the best lower bounds for volume of closed orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds appeared to be approximately 1/1000 of the likely lowest volume. Then the paper ""Homotopy Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds Are Hyperbolic"" improved the low-volume bounds by a factor of one hundred. Subsequently, many authors have used this result to achieve further improvements in the lower bound estimate. Now, the PI's believe they have developed a fundamental new tool (the MOM technology) which will not only find the low-volume closed and cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds, but also explain in sharp detail why the Complexity Conjecture is correct. Our method is a satisfying mix of elementary hyperbolic geometry, 3-manifold topology, Morse Theory, and rigorous computer analysis. The implementation of our approach will involve mathematicians with expertise in different core areas of math, and with a sound knowledge of the other areas utilized in our methodology. <br/><br/>180 years ago, W. Bolyai, C. F. Gauss, and N. Lobachevsky started a revolution in scientific thought by creating an alternative geometry to Euclidean geometry.  This non Euclidean geometry, called hyperbolic geometry,  has proven to be a remarkable tool in mathematics.  For example, the work of W. Thurston in the 1970's and 1980's showed that the vast majority of 3-dimensional spaces (3-manifolds) possessed geometric structures modeled on hyperbolic geometry, and that this geometric structure could be used to answer fundamental questions about the underlying 3-dimensional manifold.  In fact, hyperbolic 3-manifolds have been the subject of intense scrutiny these last 40 years with striking results achieved; most recently, the proofs of the Ending Lamination and Tameness Conjectures, by Y. Minsky et al. Despite these advances and the possible spectacular resolution of the Geometrization Conjecture by G. Perelman, one of the most basic elements of the theory remains to be understood. In particular, the most natural tool for analyzing a hyperbolic 3-manifold is to use the geometry to measure its size, i.e., to compute its volume, but the behavior of the volume function remains mysterious:  Thurston proved that there is a least volume hyperbolic 3-manifold, and a next lowest volume, and a next lowest, and so on, but despite 25 years of effort, none of the 3-manifolds possessing these low volumes have been conclusively identified.  This proposal introduces a startling new technique--the MOM Technology--that the PIs plan to develop to find all these low-volume manifolds and to explain what properties low-volume hyperbolic manifolds must have."

The first problem is completing our understanding of the deformation space of hyperbolic structures on open 3-manifolds and describing the geometry of such structures. This problem has been the subject of many studies started by Bill Thurston and followed by Bonahon, Canary, Minsky, Brock and others. Their work provided very interesting results especially in the case of incompressible boundary 3-manifolds. However such a nice description does not exist in general for hyperbolic structures on other 3-manifolds and in particular handlebodies. Namazi will focus on deepening our understanding of this general case. The second problem deals with the geometry of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A very fundamental problem in the subject is to describe the geometry of a hyperbolic manifold and find a recipe to construct a very accurate approximation for the hyperbolic metric. These two problems are very closely related to each other and in earlier work Namazi was able to construct models for the geometry of a large class of hyperbolic structures on handlebodies and this was used to construct accurate approximations of the hyperbolic metric on a family of closed 3-manifolds. The hope is to extend this to a broader set of closed 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is an object, which looks like the regular Euclidean 3-dimensional space around every point. The problem of classifying 3-manifolds has been one of the fundamental questions in mathematics, which perhaps started by Poincare's work and conjecture in the early twentieth century. Thurston pushed the subject much further and conjectured that understanding and classifying hyperbolic 3-manifolds results in a classification of all 3-manifolds. The recent development of the subject in the last few years has brought us closer than ever to see a complete proof of Thurston's conjecture. A consequence of this classification is the fact that these fundamental objects have an almost canonical shape. What remains unanswered is a description of this shape and this is the major subject that Namazi will try to address in this project. Similar to his earlier work he also expects that such a description makes it possible to answer many unanswered questions in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>"

The first section deals<br/>with coarse geometry and geometric group theory. The PI (together with<br/>D. Fisher and K. Whyte) has recently developed a new technique,<br/>""coarse differentiation"", which can be viewed as a sort of<br/>differentiability substitute for quasi-isometries. Of course,<br/>conventional derivatives do not make sense for such maps, since they<br/>are not even defined on small scales; instead we must go to larger and<br/>larger scales. Using this technique, we were able to resolve three<br/>longstanding open problems in the field, namely proving the<br/>quasi-isometric rigidity of the three-dimensional solvable group Sol,<br/>exhibiting a transitive graph which is not quasi-isometric to any<br/>Cayley graph, and showing that the two state and the three state<br/>lamplighter groups are not quasi-isometric. We list some other<br/>potential applications of the method, many of which are to problems<br/>which seemed completely out of reach a year ago.<br/><br/>The second section concerns the interrelated analytic study of<br/>billiards in rational polygons, moduli spaces of abelian and quadratic<br/>differentials, and the dynamics of the SL(2,R) action on these moduli<br/>spaces. The PI also proposes to study related questions about the<br/>geometry of these spaces, such as their volumes and their SL(2,R)<br/>invariant submanifolds. In particular, the PI has found by numerical<br/>experiment some polygons which seem to have competely unexpected<br/>properties, and proposes to study them further.<br/><br/>Some of the coarse geometry in the the first part of the proposal has<br/>unexpected connections to computer science, in particular the<br/>existence of efficient algorithms for finding ways to disconnect a<br/>graph by cutting as few edges as possible. In fact, one of our<br/>proposed problems is taken from this field. <br/><br/>The rational billiard, which is the main subject of study in the<br/>second part of the proposal is important in particular for the<br/>following reason: Some natural phenomena are ""chaotic""<br/>(i.e. unpredictable). These are often studied by statistical<br/>methods. Others are ""integrable"" (i.e. predictable and regular). Other<br/>phenomena fit somewhere in between. The polygonal billiard is one of<br/>the simplest known models of intermediate behavior. As such it has<br/>been studied extensively in physics as well, in particular in<br/>connection to ""quantum chaos"".<br/><br/>"

Many of the<br/>connections between topology and contact geometry are mediated by<br/>Legendrian knots (these are knots that are tangent to a contact<br/>structure), thus the first main theme of the proposed research is<br/>Legendrian knots. As part of this proposal the general structure<br/>of Legendrian knots will be studied. The expected outcome will be<br/>various classification results for certainLegendrian knots and contact<br/>structures; and, moreover, a betterunderstanding of Legendrian surgery<br/>(an important surgery construction of contact structures). Legendrian <br/>knots in higher dimensions will also be studied using contact homology.<br/>There is very little known about contactstructures, or Legendrian knots,<br/>in dimensions above three. By investigating  Legendrian knots in these <br/>dimensions the nature of contactstructures should be illuminated, just<br/>as the corresponding study revealed much about three dimensional contact<br/>structures. The final part of the proposed research centers on the <br/>connection between contact structures and hydrodynamics discovered a few<br/>years ago by the Principal Investigator and R. Ghrist. Here work with<br/>Ghrist will continue with the aim of understanding when, and what type of, <br/>closed flow lines occur in fluid flows. We shall also study hydrodynamic<br/>instability from the contact topological perspective. This naturally leads<br/>into the study of energy minimization for fluid flows and relations between<br/>contact and Riemannian geometry.<br/><br/>Contact structures are very natural objects, born over two centuries <br/>ago,in the study of geometric optics and partial differential equations.<br/>Through the centuries contactstructures have touched on many diverse areas<br/>of mathematics and physics,including classical mechanics and thermodynamics.<br/>In everyday life oneencounters contact geometry when ice skating, parallel <br/>parking a car,using a refrigerator, or simply watching the beautiful play <br/>of light ina glass of water. Many great mathematicians have devoted a lot of <br/>their work to this subject  but only in the last decade or two has it moved<br/>into the foreground of mathematics. This renaissance is due to the recent<br/>remarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and<br/>beautiful theory with many applications. The most remarkable feature of<br/>all this recent work is the intimate connections between contact<br/>structures and topology in dimension three. Thus by studying this abstract<br/>notion of a contact structure one can learn many subtle things about the<br/>universe in which we live. For example, the study of contact geometry<br/>has recently lead to some unexpected advances in our understanding of<br/>the flow of idealized fluids. The Principal Investigator will explore<br/>connections between contact structures and topology in all (odd)<br/>dimensions, continue his study of idealized fluid flows (hydrodynamics)<br/>via contact geometry and analyze intriguing new conjectures concerning<br/>string theory and contact geometry. The Principal Investigator will<br/>also engage in several educational endeavors, including the support and<br/>encouragement of graduates students and the creation of introductory<br/>and survey materials to bring the rapidly developing field of contact<br/>geometry to a wider audience.<br/><br/><br/>"

Heegaard Floer invariants were introduced in 2001 by Ozsvath and Szabo and have proved to be a powerful tool, leading to many important advances in our understanding of low-dimensional topology, and solutions to long-standing problems that resisted other methods.  Applications include computation of various measures of complexity of knotted circles in three-dimensional space, such as the genus (which measures how complicated a surface must be which has the knot as its boundary) and the unknotting number (which measures how many times you need to pass the string through itself to untie the knot).

The conference brings together mathematicians<br/>and graduate students working in the two core areas, and covers<br/>most areas of topology and of topological approaches to dynamical<br/>systems.  The conference fosters extensive interactions among<br/>adjacent research areas and their applications.  This contributes<br/>greatly to the advancement of knowledge through communication of<br/>recent results to a broad audience.

The<br/>conference emphasizes participation by graduate students, young<br/>researchers, women and under represented minority groups. We<br/>expect the conference to attract about 200 participants. The<br/>conference activities feature hour plenary talks and half-hour<br/>talks in two parallel sessions given by leading experts, and four<br/>special sessions of contributed talks. The special sessions are<br/>entitled: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General and<br/>Set-Theoretic Topology, and Geometric Topology and Geometric<br/>Group Theory.

Mirror Symmetry,<br/>Quantum Cohomology and Gromov-Witten theory lie at the heart of<br/>the intersection of contemporary geometry and theoretical<br/>physics. Great strides have recently been made in our<br/>understanding of these subjects, including a complete<br/>determination of the Gromov-Witten theory (and Donaldson-Thomas<br/>theory) of local curves, and of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and<br/>new proofs of Witten's conjecture; announced results include the<br/>computation of the quantum cohomology of certain Hilbert schemes<br/>of basic importance, and a construction of the Equivariant<br/>Vertex, determining the Gromov-Witten theory of all toric<br/>threefolds.

The aim is to, on the one hand, expose more internal structure, but on the other hand to make them more relevant to topological questions, such as whether a classical knot can be the boundary of a disk in the four dimensional ball. Somewhat related to this area is the Schneiderman-Teichner theory of intersections of two dimensional spheres in 4-manifolds. Together with Schneiderman and Teichner, the P.I. hopes to fill in a missing step and complete the theory to a complete classification scheme. Another cluster of projects revolves around the algebraic object called ""graph homology,"" which has relevance to the study of invariants of manifolds, the study of the mapping class group of surfaces, the study of the important group Out(F_n), and to the deformation quantization problem. The P.I. proposes to make a deeper study of the general theory of graph homology, on the one hand, while on the other analyzing the specific examples of relevance to topology. More specifically the P.I. will continue a program, joint with Vogtmann, for enlarging the known set of rational homology classes for Out(F_n) from 2 to infinity. Lastly, probing the interface between topology and computer science, the P.I. proposes to take some steps toward  distinguishing P from NP, utilizing ideas of Mike Freedman.<br/><br/>This proposal concerns fundamental research in several core areas of mathematics, including topology, group theory and computer science. The projects in the proposal aim at making significant breakthroughs in our understanding of some of the most rapidly developing subdisciplines.

For example, the P.I. will explore ideas of Mike Freedman to apply topology to the study of how efficiently alogrithms can solve problems.

Schwartz proved a general surgery theorem for many of these groups, along the lines of Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn surgery theorem, and he hopes to use this theorem to analyze some concrete examples.  The second problem has to do with triangular billiards.  Recently Schwartz proved that a triangular shaped billiard table has a periodic billiard path provided that all its angles are less than 100 degrees.  This represents the first substantial progress on the 200-year old triangular billiards problem, which asks if every triangular shaped billiard table has a periodic billiard path.  The third problem has to do with the iteration of simple geometric constructions, such as barycentric subdivision.<br/><br/>The common theme to Schwartz's research is the idea of looking at the consequences of performing a simple operation infinitely often.  In nature one sees great complexity in things like trees and coral reefs, and this complexity is often produced by the same process happening multiple times.  For instance, some kind of basic branching operation produces the shape of a tree.  The problems studied by Schwartz are idealizations of the sort of thing one might see in nature - for instance, a complex hyperbolic discrete group encodes the way light bounces of mirrors in a certain curved 4 dimensional space, and the triangular billiards problem asks what happens if one plays pool on a frictionless pool table with a billiard ball that is the size of a point. The barycentric subdivision problem is somehow an idealization of the idea of chopping up a high dimensional diamond over and over again, and studying the shapes of the facets."

This appears naturally from the Chern-Simons functional on three-manifolds with boundary and leads to a new approach for Floer homology on three-manifolds with boundary. The construction of this new Floer homology moreover is a first step in a program that might lead to a proof of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture. The latter relates the Floer homology of a homology three-sphere to a corresponding Lagrangian Floer homology in a moduli space of flat connections, which arise from a Heegaard splitting of the three-manifold. This conjecture is a longstanding open question and its solution would  be an important step towards understanding the relations between different  invariants of homology three-spheres.<br/>The Atiyah-Floer conjecture has an analogue relating the new Heegaard Floer homology by Ozsvath and Szabo to Seiberg-Witten invariants.

In both subjects Floer introduced in the late eighties  his new approach to infinite dimensional Morse theory.   In Morse theory, properties of a finite dimensional space are understood in terms of the zeros and flow lines of gradient vector fields on this space.<br/>In Floer's context, this space is infinite dimensional but arises from certain objects (like paths) in an underlying finite dimensional manifold with some extra structure. The corresponding Floer theory extracts informations about this underlying manifold and its extra structure from the space of solutions of a partial differential equation associated to it.<br/>The aim of this project is to define a Floer theory, where the underlying manifold has a boundary, and this gives rise to a  boundary condition for the partial differential equation. This is one step in a program to understand the relation between different Floer theories that arise from the same underlying manifolds.<br/><br/>"

For the past 30 years four major conjectures have guided this area: Marden's Tameness Conjecture, Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture, the Bers-Thurston-Sullivan Density Conjecture and Ahlfors' Measure Conjecture; all have been resolved in the last four years.  The solutions of these conjectures have introduced new techniques into the field and opened the door to deeper investigation and the exploration of new directions.  In this Focused Research Group, the principal<br/>investigators propose to use these new techniques to deepen their understanding of the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, both of infinite and of finite volume, to explore further their still mysterious deformation theory, to pioneer new directions for research in the field, and to develop connections with related branches of low-dimensional geometry and topology.<br/><br/>Since the time of Poincare, topologists have pursued the idea that certain spaces called 3-manifolds might be simply described.  In the 1970's, Thurston's geometrization conjecture showed topologists the power of bringing geometry to bear on this problem, and opened the possiblity for broad connections between topological, geometric and dynamical features that arise.  Using technical tools arising from recent breakthroughs, the PIs hope to interconnect further these different perspectives on the field, and expose early career mathematicians and graduate students to the new range of problems emerging from this fertile area.  The Focused Research Group will fund small conferences during its first and final year focused on emerging research areas, with introductory workshops to be run on the day prior to the beginning of the conference.  This project will also support the research of the principal investigators' graduate students and provide travel funding for their interaction across institutions. Each of these efforts will allow young geometers and topologists both to learn about the exciting recent developments in the field and to explore the new directions opened up by these developments.<br/>"

One <br/>direction is the basic problem of classifying homotopically equivalent <br/>manifolds up to homeomorphism. Surgery theory was developed  for this <br/>purpose. But in order to make this theory effective for manifolds with a <br/>given fundamental group, it is necessary to calculate the algebraic L- and <br/>K-groups of its its integral group ring which occur in the surgery exact <br/>sequence. Direct algebraic methods have generally proven<br/>unsuccessful for this. The case of finite fundamental groups being a major <br/>exception. The techniques to be used instead will come from differential <br/>geometry, controlled topology, dynamical systems and Lie group theory. The <br/>results obtained so far using these methods have been quite encouraging. The <br/>second direction of the project is to find applications of these manifold <br/>classification results to geometry. One area that looks promising is to <br/>understand the topology of the space of all negatively curved Riemannian <br/>metrics on a smooth manifold and its quotient moduli space. There is the <br/>related following question. If one smooth structure on a closed manifold <br/>supports a negatively curved Riemannian metric, then does every other smooth <br/>structure support such a metric? And a possible application to affine <br/>geometry is to the problem of whether homeomorphic complete closed affine <br/>flat manifolds are necessarily diffeomorphic.<br/>    Manifolds are geometric objects which locally resemble the space of <br/>Euclidean geometry but are usually quite different globally. For example the <br/>surface of the sphere locally resembles the plane; but is only finite in <br/>extent. Being finite in extent is what is meant by a closed manifold. A <br/>smooth manifold is one without corners or edges. For example the surface of <br/>the sphere is smooth but the surface of a cube, although a manifold, is not <br/>smooth. However these two manifolds are homeomorphic; i.e. it is easy to <br/>construct a continuously varying bijective correspondence between the points <br/>of these two surfaces. When the distance between points on a manifold is also <br/>considered, we are now talking about Riemannian manifolds and distance <br/>preserving correspondences are called isometries. For example the egg and the <br/>ball represent two different positively curved Riemannian metrics on the <br/>surface of the sphere. And these two metrics even represent different points <br/>in the moduli space of such metrics since the ball is uniformly round while <br/>the egg is not. However if only the notion of straight line is being <br/>considered (i.e. geodesic ) we are talking about affine manifolds and affine <br/>equivalences.

However, there is a family of models for certain chaotic attractors that do have a precise mathematical description: inverse limit spaces of unimodal maps.  Understanding the structure of these inverse limit spaces more fully will lead to a better understanding of chaotic attractors.

The sequential order of a space is a natural ordinal invariant<br/>that measures the complexity of a sequential space; the question of<br/>whether there can be a finite or countable bound on this invariant for<br/>compact spaces has only been resolved under CH. We will also study<br/>continuous maps on the remainder of the Stone-Cech compactification of<br/>the integers which are finite-to-one. We will try to determine if such<br/>maps have to be ""somewhere trivial"" and whether the range space will be<br/>homeomorphic to the domain. This question has been fully resolved under<br/>PFA but not, for example, under MA. Two other questions about the<br/>remainder of N under PFA: can it be covered by nowhere dense P-sets and<br/>can there be non-trivial copies of the remainder?<br/><br/><br/>When one formalizes the limiting process of an infinite sequence of<br/>steps one is naturally lead to the notion of topological space. Points<br/>in physical space can be analyzed using the notion of a converging<br/>sequence, but just as mathematics has a need for a much broader<br/>understanding of points (e.g. functions or processes themselves lying in<br/>a space of like processes), so too has the need for a broader<br/>understanding of limit and topological space been developed to handle<br/>convergence in the more general settings. The investigation into the<br/>nature of generalized convergence, connections between conditions that<br/>may imply the existence of (the much easier to understand and apply)<br/>classical convergent sequences,  and the behavior of the convergence<br/>structure under deformations  is on-going and productive. These notions<br/>are very sensitive to the foundational axioms of mathematics and the<br/>questions serve as both a testbed for foundational study and a generator<br/>of new development. One of the most famously indeterminate questions of<br/>mathematics, the continuum hypothesis (the ""size"" of the real number<br/>line) is intimately connected to these questions of convergence. <br/>"
