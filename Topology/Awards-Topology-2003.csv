The resulting work  will shed some light on how the finite type <br/>knot invariants relate to the topology of the knot complement and could<br/>lead to progress on the open  question of whether these invariants<br/>distinguish all knots.

A<br/>3-manifold is an object that locally looks like the ordinary 3-dimensional<br/>space but whose global structure can be complicated. A main goal of<br/>3-dimensional topology is to understand these structures and achieve a<br/>classification of 3-manifolds. An important part of 3-dimensional topology<br/>is also the study of knots (loops embedded in some tangled way in<br/>3-manifolds) and their classification. One of the ways that topologists have<br/>been approaching these problems is through the use of ``invariants"". In the<br/>recent years, ideas originated in physics, lead mathematicians to the<br/>discovery of a variety of invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. The central<br/>theme of the PI's project is to understand the properties of these<br/>invariants, using ideas from traditional 3-dimensional topology and from<br/>physics, and investigate the extent to which they distinguish<br/>knots and 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>"

A symplectic 4-manifold is a smooth manifold<br/>endowed with a closed and non-degenerate (symplectic) 2-form. Symplectic<br/>manifolds arise naturally in various areas of mathematics, and their study has<br/>relevant consequences also in physics and engineering. Kaehler manifolds are<br/>natural examples of such manifolds, and until 30 years ago it was an open <br/>question whether other examples exist. Since then, wealth of other<br/>constructions have appeared, and important results (often arising from<br/>the interaction of physics and mathematics) have started to unveil the<br/>richness of this class of manifolds. This project investigates the properties of<br/>certain natural submanifolds of a symplectic $4$-manifold, namely lagrangian<br/>submanifolds (where the restriction of the symplectic form vanishes) and<br/>symplectic submanifolds (where the restriction of the symplectic form is again<br/>symplectic). The common theme underlying the various parts of the project is the<br/>use of a technique, developed by R.Fintushel and R.Stern, that allows one to<br/>construct symplectic $4$-manifolds and study their submanifolds. The first goal<br/>is to study symplectic representatives of the canonical homology class of a<br/>symplectic manifold; it is known, by a result of C.Taubes, that such<br/>representatives exist, but little is known about their topology. The author wants<br/>to show that there exist manifolds whose canonical class admit several<br/>representatives distinguished by the number of components. This would lead to a<br/>better understanding of how to define invariants of a symplectic manifold starting<br/>from the study of its canonical. The second goal is to analyze the existence of<br/>lagrangian submanifolds that are homologous but not isotopic, i.e. connected by a<br/>sequence of embeddings. Results of this kind have been obtained in the past for<br/>symplectic submanifolds, but little is known in the lagrangian case. The third<br/>goal is to study the relation between certain symplectic invariants (recently<br/>introduced by P.Seidel for a particular class of symplectic manifolds) and the<br/>Seiberg-Witten invariants. Other applications of these techniques to other<br/>problems of symplectic and smooth topology of 4-manifolds are expected.<br/><br/>Symplectic manifolds of dimension 4 lie at the intersection between two areas<br/>of research. Both the first, the topology of low dimensional manifolds, and<br/>the second, symplectic topology, are traditional areas of investigations that in<br/>the last 20 years have experienced a tremendous progress. This progress is due<br/>to new and exciting interaction with theoretical physics, that has served as a <br/>source of models and conjectures, and a renewed relation of topology with other <br/>areas of mathematics that has produced in both directions fruitful applications <br/>and consequences. Topology in dimension 4 attracts great interest from both <br/>mathematics and physics as it investigates the dimension of the space-time; <br/>symplectic topology involves the properties of certain manifolds that appear<br/> naturally in the description of problems arising from physics and<br/>engineering. A growing number of researchers, with original and stimulating<br/>approaches, is increasing in a spectacular way our comprehension on the<br/>subject, verifying or disproving old conjectures, and suggesting new relations<br/>with other areas of mathematics and physics. The investigator wants to continue<br/>his research in this field, using techniques of topology that originate from<br/>classical results in theory of knots, in conjunction with modern tools as the<br/>invariants of 4-manifolds introduced by the physicists Seiberg and Witten.<br/>In particular, the aim of the research is to better understand the submanifolds<br/>of a symplectic 4-manifold.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Quantum computation is at once an important theoretical elaboration of quantum mechanics and a possible future technology.  Topology is the study of knots, links, and abstract geometric spaces.

The investigators develop a software<br/>package of algorithms to study the aforementioned algebraic<br/>invariants of X.  The software is used to generate tables of<br/>arrangements (similar to the tables used in knot theory),<br/>providing an extensive list of examples and invariants.  The<br/>investigators use these tables to search for counterexamples to<br/>open conjectures, and to spot patterns leading to theorems.  The<br/>tables and code are a community resource, available online, and<br/>generate considerable synergy between disparate groups<br/>(algebraists, topologists, combinatorialists) involved in MSRI's<br/>special semester on hyperplane arrangements (Fall 2004).<br/>     There is also a practical benefit: hyperplane arrangements<br/>and configuration spaces are ubiquitous in pure and applied<br/>mathematics, arising in numerous areas including braid groups,<br/>knot theory, robotics, approximation theory, and mathematical<br/>modelling.  For example, in approximation theory one can<br/>approximate a function of several variables, say k of them in a<br/>k-dimensional region, by dividing the region into pieces and on<br/>each piece approximating the function by polynomials; the<br/>resulting piecewise polynomials are called splines.  Technically,<br/>the region is divided into simplices using hyperplanes; the set<br/>of splines on the resulting simplicial complex is an algebraic<br/>object that depends strongly on the geometry of the chosen<br/>hyperplanes.  In robotics, arrangements arise in motion planning<br/>(finding a collision-free motion between two placements of a<br/>given robot among a set of objects).  Configuration spaces show up<br/>in multidimensional billiards (describing the periodic<br/>trajectories of a mass-point in a domain in Euclidean space).<br/>Information about the structure of the cohomology ring translates<br/>into bounds on the complexity of the motion planning problem, or<br/>bounds on the number of periodic trajectories.  Thus, finding fast<br/>algorithms to compute algebraic invariants associated to<br/>arrangements and configuration spaces could have real world<br/>applications.  The problems the investigators study are also well<br/>suited to introducing graduate (and undergraduate!) students to<br/>research and the use of computational tools.

Knot theory<br/>studies the embeddings of curves in three-dimensional space. Equivalently<br/>knot theory studies  the embeddings of curves in a<br/>thickened two dimensional sphere. Virtual knot theory studies the<br/>embeddings of curves in thickened surfaces of arbitrary genus,<br/>up to the addition and removal of empty handles from the surface. From the<br/>point of view of classical knot theory a virtual knot<br/>will appear as the trajectory of a particle that sometimes abruptly<br/>disappears from three dimensional space and reappears later<br/>at another point in space. An example of such a trajectory would be a<br/>superstring moving in three dimensional space, but<br/>occasionally taking a detour into higher dimensions. Virtual knots have a<br/>special  diagrammatic theory that makes handling them<br/>very similar to the handling of classical knot diagrams. With this<br/>approach, one can generalize many structures in classical knot<br/>theory to the virtual domain, and use the virtual knots to test the limits<br/>of classical problems such as  the question whether<br/>the Jones polynomial detects knots and the classical Poincare conjecture.<br/>Counterexamples to these conjectures exist in the<br/>virtual domain, and it is an open problem whether any of these<br/>counterexamples are equivalent (by addition and subtraction of<br/>empty handles) to  classical knots and links. Virtual knot theory is an<br/>important domain to be investigated for its own sake and for a deeper<br/>understanding of classical knot theory.<br/><br/>The principal investigator hopes that the above analog relationship with string theory<br/>will bear fruit. Virtual braids are being used by the principal<br/>investigator to establish relationships among quantum computing, quantum<br/>entanglement and topological entanglement. It is a long-standing goal of<br/>this project to work with knots, physics and<br/>other natural sciences such as molecular biology.<br/>Generalizations such as the virtual knot theory have<br/>potential for use in a wide variety of applications where there is a<br/>combination of topology, and combinatorially modeled physicality.<br/>In such applications, the topology is only part of the picture. One is<br/>dealing with systems that can be modeled in a discrete way so<br/>that certain specified changes are allowed in the forms of the models. The<br/>question that a topologist asks is: What is invariant under the changes?<br/>This question is significant in applications because it corresponds to the<br/>stable properties of molecular structures and to conserved quantities in<br/>the physics. The approaches used in combinatorial topology can be<br/>generalized for use in a wide variety of contexts. A good example of this<br/>is seen in the use of knot theory in molecular biology where the allowed<br/>changes are a combination of what the topologist regards as continuous<br/>deformations coupled with discontinous changes corresponding to enzymatic<br/>action and recombination. This has led to a vigorous interplay between<br/>knot theory and molecular biology.

Some questions are simple to state:<br/>Is the deformation space the closure of its interior? A more detailed<br/>description of the space is the ending lamination conjecture,<br/>which gives invariants that classify every hyperbolic metric on<br/>the manifold. This classification is not a parameterization; the map to<br/>the space of invariants is not continuous. The investigator is<br/>interested in understanding these discontinuities and describing the<br/>topology of the deformation space of metrics.

A major focus will be the<br/>Cabling Conjecture, which asserts that Dehn surgery on a<br/>hyperbolic knot in the 3-sphere always yields a prime<br/>3-manifold. This is part of the program to completely describe<br/>all non-hyperbolic Dehn surgeries on hyperbolic knots.  Recently,<br/>John Luecke and the principal investigator showed that the<br/>hyperbolic knots with non-integral toroidal Dehn surgeries are<br/>precisely those described by Eudave-Munoz, and some of the<br/>techniques developed there may be applicable to the Cabling<br/>Conjecture. Another part of the general program that will be<br/>addressed is the conjecture that any Seifert fiber space surgery<br/>on a hyperbolic knot must be integral. The project will also<br/>consider various geometric group theoretic topics that are<br/>related to the theory of 3-manifolds, such as surface subgroups<br/>of Coxeter and Artin groups, and Gromov's question as to whether<br/>or not a 1-ended word hyperbolic group always has a surface<br/>subgroup.  Another question concerning surfaces and 3-manifolds<br/>that will be investigated is the Simple Loop Conjecture, which<br/>asserts that if a map from a closed orientable surface to a<br/>closed orientable 3-manifold is not injective on fundamental<br/>group, then there is an embedded essential loop in the surface<br/>whose image is null-homotopic in the 3-manifold.<br/><br/>(2) The project is part of the general goal to understand the<br/>structure of 3-dimensional manifolds. These are objects that are<br/>locally like ordinary 3-dimensional space, but whose global<br/>structure may be quite complicated.  Since we live in a<br/>3-manifold, one might say that 3-dimensional topology aims to<br/>describe what the mathematical possibilities are for our spatial<br/>universe. One important aspect of 3-dimensional topology is the<br/>theory of knots - a knot being a closed loop embedded somehow in<br/>space. A wide variety of mathematical methods can be applied to<br/>the study of knots, leading to new information about<br/>3-manifolds. Recently, deep connections between 3-dimensional<br/>topology and quantum physics were discovered in this way. Knot<br/>theory is related to the general theory of 3-manifolds through a<br/>construction known as Dehn surgery, in which a solid tube around<br/>the knot is removed and sewn back in differently. We note that a<br/>theorem about Dehn surgery, the Cyclic Surgery Theorem, has been<br/>used to determine the topological nature of the action of certain<br/>enzymes on strands of DNA.  Many aspects of Dehn surgery are now<br/>quite well understood. One of the main remaining questions, which<br/>is a major focus of the project, is to show that (except in an<br/>obvious degenerate situation) the 3-manifold resulting from a<br/>Dehn surgery on a knot never decomposes as a ""sum"" of two simpler<br/>manifolds. Another important tool in 3-dimensional topology is<br/>the study of (2-dimensional) surfaces in 3-manifolds, and the<br/>project will also address various questions in this<br/>area. Finally, the project will enable the principal investigator<br/>to continue his involvement in the education and training of<br/>graduate students in topology at the University of Texas at<br/>Austin.<br/>"

Since then, attention has<br/>naturally focused on dimensions 3 and 4.  Despite dramatic advances<br/>(Thurston, Freedman, Donaldson, Jones, Witten...), many major problems<br/>in these low dimensions remain unsolved, for example the classical<br/>3-dimensional Poincare Conjecture and its smooth 4-dimensional analog.<br/>The topological classification of 1-connected 4-manifolds was achieved<br/>by Freedman in the early 1980's, but in the smooth case there is not<br/>even a conjectural picture. By contrast, Thurston's Geometrization<br/>Conjecture provides a beautiful and coherent description of all<br/>3-manifolds, but is far from established.  In the mid 1980's, Jones'<br/>discovery of his polynomial link invariant, together with work of<br/>Witten, led to the introduction into 3-dimensional topology of methods<br/>from quantum physics.  The current situation in low-dimensional<br/>topology is that there are many different directions and methods, but<br/>little understanding of the relations between them.  Thus in dimension<br/>3 we have hyperbolic geometry, foliations and laminations, normal<br/>surfaces, combinatorial geometric methods, quantum invariants, finite<br/>type invariants, Floer homology,..., while in dimension 4 there are<br/>the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten theories, symplectic structures,....<br/>The aim of the conference is to address these topics, and the<br/>connections between them, and to provide a forum for interaction and<br/>exchange of ideas between experts in the different areas.<br/><br/>Geometric topology aims to understand n-dimensional manifolds, which<br/>are objects that locally look like ordinary n-dimensional Euclidean<br/>space (whose points are described by n co-ordinates), but whose global<br/>structure might be quite complicated. The cases of dimensions 3 and 4<br/>are particularly interesting, being the dimensions of our spatial and<br/>spatial-temporal universes, and it is a striking fact that it is<br/>precisely these dimensions that are mathematically anomalous.  There<br/>have been many developments and considerable progress in the fields of<br/>3- and 4-dimensional topology over the last twenty-five years, but, in<br/>both dimensions, a complete picture is still lacking.  One of the aims<br/>of the conference is to encourage interaction and collaboration<br/>between experts in the several different aspects and techniques that<br/>are currently being pursued in low-dimensional topology, and in<br/>particular between those people working in dimension 3 and those in<br/>dimension 4, where the methods in the two areas tend to be quite<br/>different, but where there are several hints of connections between<br/>them.  The current disparate state of the subject makes it difficult<br/>for people beginning research in low-dimensional topology to get a<br/>good overview of the area, and so by encouraging the participation of<br/>graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, we intend that the<br/>conference should also provide an opportunity for young researchers to<br/>get a broad perspective of the present state of knowledge, directions<br/>begin pursued, and the main open problems. The invited speakers<br/>include some of the world's leading 3- and 4-dimensional topologists,<br/>whose expertise together covers all the major aspects of the two<br/>fields.<br/>"

These constructions, many planned in conjunction with Mark<br/>Walker, are envisioned to involve a blend of techniques from stable<br/>homotopy theory and recent techniques developed by Voevodsky for motivic<br/>cohomology.  In particular, Friedlander plans to investigate further the<br/>semi-topological K-theory of varieties and its connections with algebraic<br/>and topological K-theory.

Some of the questions considered still seem dauntingly<br/>difficult, but partial progress towards their solutions will lead to<br/>advances in different branches of mathematics and mathematical physics.<br/>A second aspect of this project is the study of formal algebraic objects<br/>which arise as symmetries of familiar structures.

A longer term goal of this project<br/>is to investigate how this theory can help to give a mathematical<br/>framework for analyzing certain specific questions motivated by<br/>open string theory in physics.<br/><br/>Geometric questions have long been motivated by the attempt to<br/>understand physical theories.

During the last 20 years<br/>of the century generalizations of the famous Maxwell's equations<br/>for electricity and magnetism led to new techniques for studying<br/>geometry and topology in dimensions three and four.  String<br/>theory is a relatively new quantum theory of gravity.  Placing it<br/>in firm mathematical foundations is quite challenging, and has<br/>motivated quite a bit of new research in geometry.  For example<br/>the techniques of string theory predicted the answers to some<br/>classical questions in enumerative geometry, many of which were<br/>later verified using a new theory in algebraic geometry due to<br/>the mathematician M.

The 4-week<br/>workshop, including a 1-week conference, will bring together<br/>researchers active on a number of foundational topics in the field:<br/>relationships between the analytic, combinatorial and geometric<br/>structure of hyperbolic 3-manifolds; topology of deformation spaces<br/>and the arrangement of their components; classification of hyperbolic<br/>3-manifolds by asymptotic invariants; complex projective structures;<br/>convex hull boundaries; cone manifolds, orbifolds and knot groups; the<br/>combinatorial structure of Teichmuller spaces, mapping class groups,<br/>and spaces of curves on surfaces.  Recent years have seen substantial<br/>progress on longstanding foundational conjectures such as the<br/>Bers/Sullivan/Thurston Density Conjecture, Ahlfors' Measure<br/>Conjecture, Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture and Marden's<br/>Tameness Conjecture.  The time is therefore ripe for a conference on<br/>these topics.<br/><br/>In the study of low-dimensional geometry, topology and dynamics, there<br/>is a remarkable depth of interconnection between fields of<br/>mathematics. Henri Poincare, who studied both celestial dynamics and<br/>complex analysis (among many other things), observed in the 19th<br/>century that the standard round sphere, the setting of classical<br/>analysis and geometry, functioned also as a ""horizon at infinity"" for<br/>an exotic non-Euclidean geometry that we now call Hyperbolic<br/>Space. Dynamical properties of transformations of the sphere translate<br/>to geometric properties of rigid motions of this space, and give rise<br/>to families of symmetric tilings whose structure we can study by<br/>geometric and topological methods.  The properties of these tilings,<br/>and the way in which they change when the tilings are varied through<br/>families (or ""parameter spaces""), are still linked to some of the<br/>motivating questions about physical systems of which Poincare was<br/>aware a hundred years ago. Issues such as classification of systems,<br/>mapping out regions of stability and instability, deformation and<br/>bifurcation of families of systems, and probabilistic properties such<br/>as ergodicity, all have significance in both pure and applied<br/>mathematics. In the setting of hyperbolic geometry, recent years have<br/>seen significant progress on these issues, with both theoretical<br/>advances and computational approaches playing a role. This conference<br/>will bring together leading researchers in this area and promising<br/>young mathematicians, to disseminate recent advances and continue work<br/>on open problems.<br/><br/> <br/>"

Farrell) has formulated an ""Isomorphism <br/>Conjecture"" for each of these three theories.  For example, the <br/>Isomorphism Conjecture for algebraic K-theory gives a simple recipe <br/>for computing the algebraic K-groups for the integral group ring of <br/>a group G in terms of the algebraic K-groups for the integral group <br/>rings of all the infracyclic subgroups of G.

The ""genetic code"" for a space usually <br/>comes in the form of an algebraic gadget associated to the space; <br/>typically there is a simple recipe for constructing the algebraic gadget <br/>from the space.  The hope is that two spaces having equal or congruent <br/>""genetic codes"" should be equal or congruent as spaces.  One of the first <br/>algebraic gadgets to be associated to a space is called the ""fundamental <br/>group"" of the space.  The French mathematician Henri Poincare introduced <br/>this idea about a 100 years ago. The fundamental group of a space is <br/>certainly an important ingredient in its  ""genetic code"", but there are <br/>examples of many different spaces which have the same fundamental group; <br/>in these cases the fundamental group is not a complete ""genetic code"" for <br/>the space.  About 50 years ago the mathematician Armand Borel (of the <br/>Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.) conjectured that for an <br/>important class of spaces (called ""aspherical spaces"") the fundamental group <br/>does give the complete ""genetic code"" for the space; that is, two aspherical <br/>spaces with the same fundamental group are forced to be the same space.  Jones <br/>has made some progress towards proving Borel's Conjecture, and will continue his <br/>work in that direction.<br/>"

A 3-manifold has the<br/>property that sufficiently small subsets can be parametrized by 3<br/>coordinates.<br/><br/>The problem of characterizing the geometry and topology of surfaces, i.e.,<br/>manifolds of dimension 2, was completely answered nearly a century ago.  It<br/>was determined that the only closed orientable connected surfaces are the<br/>sphere, torus, and the multi-holed tori.    Furthermore, such surfaces can<br/>be given geometries of constant curvature, +1 for the sphere, 0 for the<br/>torus, and -1 for the other surfaces.<br/><br/>Although great progress has been made during the last century, the<br/>situation for dimension-3 is not nearly so well understood.  Nevertheless a<br/>conjectural picture for the structure of 3-manifolds emerged almost 25<br/>years ago (by Thurston) and there has been much theoretical and<br/>experimental evidence supporting his conjecture.   The hyperbolic<br/>3-manifolds, i.e. the manifolds of constant -1 curvature, play a central<br/>role in this picture.

Friedlander and Daniel R. Grayson<br/><br/>This grant will contribute to the support of four research conferences in algebraic K-theory over a 3-year period.  One conference, a 5-day conference, is to take place in Canada at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques on the campus of the Universite de Montreal.  The majority of the funding for that conference is expected to come from Canadian sources.  The other three conferences will be the 10th, 11th, and 12th in the series of annual ""Great Lakes K-theory"" weekend conferences occurring at American universities.  These conferences will focus on exhilarating progress and expected new developments in settling long-open conjectures.  In August, 2002, Voevodsky was awarded the Fields Medal at the ICM in Beijing in recognition for his fundamental contributions, which have yielded important results modulo 2: the Milnor conjecture and the Bloch-Kato conjecture.  The proof of the Milnor conjectures tells us something remarkable and special about fields: that the Galois cohomology ring modulo 2 is presented by explicit generators in degree 1 and explicit relations in degree 2.  Work of Rost and Voevodsky already in hand is expected to lead to the proof of the Bloch-Kato conjecture at odd primes, which by work of Suslin and Voevodsky will imply the Beilinson conjecture relating motivic cohomology to etale cohomology, which in turn is expected to lead to a proof of the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture using work of Grayson, Friedlander, and Suslin or of Bloch, Lichtenbaum, Friedlander, and Suslin, that relates algebraic K-theory for varieties to motivic cohomology.  The Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture has been the driving force for research in K-theory since the early 1970s, and has been the focus of the interplay between related areas of geometry, number theory and topology.  A consequence will be an explicit computation of the K-groups of the ring of integers, covering the p-primary parts for prime numbers p for which the Vandiver conjecture is known.  The Vandiver conjecture is an old conjecture from number theory, has been checked by computations for all prime numbers smaller than 12 million, and recent theoretical progress using algebraic K-theory has been made on it by Kurihara and Soule.  The conferences to be supported by this grant will contribute to the dissemination of dramatic new developments in the subject as well as introduce this important mathematical subject to the next generation of American mathematicians.  Because of K-theory's influence in much of modern mathematics, we expect that these conferences will make a significant contribution to the American mathematical community's efforts to maintain its world leadership in fundamental<br/>mathematics.<br/><br/>K-theory is a relatively new field of mathematics which has grown and prospered in the past 40 years.  One now finds that K-theory plays an important role in mathematical physics (e.g., various conformal field theories), classical actions of groups on vector spaces, number theory, and especially number theory.  K-theory is a way of examining features of systems of polynomial equations by considering the possible ways to associate flat planes (or spaces of any dimension) to each solution. As a concrete example, imagine that the solutions are the points on the surface of the earth, and for each point consider the plane containing that point and the horizon.  In general, these planes or spaces may twist and turn as one moves from one point to another, nearby or far away, so a proper understanding of the possibilities requires the use  of topology, the study of gradual change.  Motivic cohomology is another way to glean information about solutions of equations that uses homotopy theory and topology in a different way.  One examines the possible ways to augment the original system of equations by new ones that have one or more free parameters.  The conferences supported by this grant  will continue a strong tradition of delivering the highest quality research talks to the mathematical community, including graduate students and junior mathematicians in postdoctoral positions.  These conferences should encourage a new generation of younger American mathematicians to participate in various research programs concerning algebraic K-theory. With many issues still unsettled, the field is ripe for further exciting developments.<br/><br/><br/>"

This project focuses on a technology transfer from contemporary ideas in topology, geometry, and dynamics to bear upon application domains which include the following: First, Robotics: tools from configuration space theory, CAT(0)complexes, and computational topology will be directed toward specific problems in reconfigurable robotics, sensor-based navigation of mobile agents, and self-assembly systems. Second, Parabolic coupled systems: a Morse-theoretic homotopy index for braids will be used to solve parabolic variational problems arising in pattern-formation PDE's, discrete Lagrangian mechanics, and coupled oscillators. A Floer-theoretic extension of the braid index will also be developed for infinite dimensional systems. Third, Hydrodynamics: tools from contact geometry and topology will be directed toward solving global problems of the dynamics and stability of Eulerian fluid flows in dimensions higher than two.<br/>In most systems of interest in science and engineering, multiple cooperative tasks must be globally coordinated. A common thread is that whether the tasks involve macro-scale robots, micro-scale devices, coupled oscillators, or fluid particles, there is an abstract space of configurations lurking behind the physical phenomena. Unearthing and examining those properties of physically-motivated configuration spaces which capture the global features, the topology, geometry, and dynamics, holds the promise of providing global tools which transcend the physical instantiation of the system at hand: ostensibly different systems possess similar topological underpinnings. The research component of this project is the development of contemporary topological and global-geometric techniques for analyzing the dynamics and coordination of systems of interest in engineering and computer science. The overall goal is an effective technology transfer from cutting-edge perspectives in topology to bear upon systems in application domains, which include robotics, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. This is combined with a blend of pedagogical service across graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels, featuring a focused research group on topological robotics and a high-school outreach program of expository lectures on the relevance and joy of mathematical research.<br/><br/><br/>This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

There are many connections among these structures, but nevertheless the known connections are sporadic and often only loose, although suggestive of deeper connections remaining to be discovered.  The PI will investigate these various structures and their interrelationships, with an emphasis on analyzing computability, and developing techniques for actually constructing and computing examples.  For example, is there a construction to go from a taut foliation or an essential lamination to a geometric decomposition? And conversely, does every hyperbolic 3-manifold admit a foliation or at least a genuine lamination?<br/><br/>Three-manifolds are the mathematical descriptions of the possible ways for 3-dimensional space to be topologically interconnected. They are important because they arise through geometric models in every corner of mathematics.  A central theme in modern three-manifold topology is the Geometrization conjecture, which is the conjecture that all three-manifolds are made up of locally homogeneous pieces, that is, three-manifolds that have a geometry in which a neighborhood of any one point is completely identical to a neighborhood of any other point, up to some fixed radius.  This conjecture, proposed by the PI about 20 years ago  is now supported by a great deal of theoretical and empirical evidence.  Nonetheless, many basic questions remain unknown, including the famous Poincare conjecture a special case of the Geometrization conjecture which asserts that there is only one possible topology for a three-manifold in which every loop can be contracted to fit inside a small ball.  Besides geometric structures for 3-manifolds, there are a number of other interesting structures that have important implications for topology, but only loose connections among them are understood.  Among these structures are  incompressible surfaces, foliations (a kind of layered structure), laminations (layered structures that only exist on part of the manifold), contact structures (related to Hamiltonian mechanics), and various combinatorial structures from group theory.  The PI will investigate connections among these various structures, with an emphasis on computability and techniques of making actual computations of examples<br/><br/>The project is supported by both the Topology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Numeric, Symbolic, and Geometric Computation Program in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate<br/>"

The classical <br/>stabilization result is ""Markov's Theorem"" which says that any two closed <br/>braid representatives of the same oriented link type in the 3-sphere are <br/>related to each other through a sequence of moves (isotopies): conjugation, <br/>stabilization and destabilization. Unforunately, the Markov Theorem only says<br/>a sequence exists, but understanding exactly what this stabilization sequence<br/>accomplishes has largely remained a big black box until recently.<br/>The first peek inside the stabilization black box is the ""Markov Theorem <br/>Without Stabilization"" (MTWS), a product of a long collaborative effort with <br/>Joan Birman.

When is When is a knot which appears to be tangle in fact <br/>equivalent through motions a simple circle that can be laid flat in a plane?<br/>Motions can be very complex (think of trying to untangle<br/>a mass of fishing line).  The investigator's research has focussed on understanding<br/>and codifying these motions (in collaboration with Joan Birman, ""The Markov Theorem<br/>Without Stabilization"").  Also in trying to understand 3-dimensional spaces we<br/>can study ""essential"" surfaces that occur in them, i.e. surfaces that in the space<br/>can not be crashed down to a point.  Such surfaces can give us a type of  coordinate system<br/>for navigating in the space---astronomers are very interested in  determining if our<br/>universe has any essential surfaces.  If a 3-dimensional space has an essential surface<br/>then it is called ""Haken"".

Working out the<br/>details of this theory turned out to be quite delicate, and has<br/>in turn inspired many remarkable results in mathematics. But also<br/>fundamental results in mathematics have inspired many new<br/>discoveries in physics. It is hoped that this project will<br/>contribute to the increased interaction between mathematics and<br/>high energy physics. In the same time, one of the projects will<br/>involve graduate students.<br/>"

Of particular interest are the relations between quantum topology and, for example, gauge theory, quantum computing, non-commutative algebra, representation theory, and other adjacent areas in geometry and topology. The conference shall both give an overview over the current state of modern algebraic and combinatorial methods in 3-dimensional topology and provide an opportunity for participants to educate themselves along the borderlines of overlapping areas of research. The conference is continuing the annual geometry and topology conference that was held at Ohio State from 1989 to 2000 in a different format. Most of the funding is for the support of doctoral students and recent PhD's, who are at the beginnings of their academic careers. The conference exposes them to a variety of new developments and interrelations in 3-dim topology from which they can develop their future research directions and projects as well as gives them an opportunity to introduce themselves to the topology community with presentations of their own work.<br/><br/><br/>Topology of 3-manifolds is the study of the possible shapes in a 3-dimensional space. In two dimensions such shapes can be discs, spheres or also the surfaces of doughnuts and pretzels. They were of obvious interest and discussion among scientists and philosophers before 1492 when they asked what the shape of (the 2-dim surface of) the earth is. Remarkably, a similar discussion about the possible 3-dimensional shape of our cosmos is taking place right now among modern astronomers and astrophysicists. Yet, 3-dimensional shapes are much harder to describe and to distinguish. Conversely, physics heavily influenced 3-dimensional topology. The models that theoretical physicists use to describe elementary particles turned out to be highly insightful guidelines to develop new theories about the abstract 3-dimensional spaces in topology, from which eventually the areas of ""quantum topology"" and ""gauge theory"" emerged as purely mathematical disciplines. Furthermore, the algebraic tools and methods that are being developed along with the topology prove to be of much more universal interest. They serve, for example, as theoretical models for quantum computers, which - if constructed - would be able to break all known public encryption codes, such as those used, e.g., in the military and in the world of finance. <br/>    <br/><br/>"

Schultens<br/><br/>The proposed research concerns the study of 3-manifolds.  The notion<br/>of a 3-manifold constitutes the 3-dimensional analogue of the<br/>2-dimensional notion of a surface.  The 2-dimensional notion of<br/>surface is to be understood in a rather broad (and rather technical)<br/>way.  It includes the 2-dimensional sphere (that tends to be pictured<br/>as all points in 3-space at distance exactly 1 from the origin), the<br/>torus (often, jokingly, described as ``the icing on a doughnut''), the<br/>Klein bottle, and many others.  The study of 3-manifolds is<br/>considerably more complex than that of surfaces.  Surfaces are<br/>completely classified, 3-manifolds are not.  In fact, it is at present<br/>unknown whether 3-manifolds can be classified (in an algorithmic<br/>sense).  It is known that 4-manifolds cannot be classified.  The<br/>research here endeavors to employ different types of surfaces lying in<br/>3-manifolds and their relation to each other in a structural study of<br/>3-manifolds.<br/><br/>The proposed research grows out of a study of the relation of Heegaard<br/>splittings to Haken decompositions.  It turns out that the lessons<br/>learnt in that investigation have applications to a wider range of<br/>problems in 3-manifold topology ranging from additivity properties of<br/>the generalized bridge numbers of knots and additivity properties of<br/>the width of knots to questions about the genus of a Heegaard<br/>splitting that is a common stabilization of two given Heegaard<br/>splittings.  The methods for this investigation include a counting<br/>technique developed by M. Scharlemann and the P.I along with the<br/>notion of an orbifold Heegaard splitting.  The methods further include<br/>the notion of untelescoping of Heegaard splittings, Cerf theory, thin<br/>position arguments, and the analysis of foliations induced by Morse<br/>functions corresponding to Heegaard splittings or untelescopings of<br/>Heegaard splittings.  The proposed research also includes a strategy<br/>to obtain a more structural theory of surfaces in knot complements.<br/><br/><br/>"

In particular he and Teichner are<br/>pursuing the question of whether Vassiliev invariants detect knottedness.<br/>The principal investigator is also looking for more powerful versions of<br/>the theory of Vassiliev invariants, hopefully giving rise to four<br/>dimensional (concordance) information. Some of this is joint with Jacob<br/>Mostovoy and Ted Stanford. Working jointly with Matt Horak and Karen<br/>Vogtmann, the principal investigator is studying the mapping class group<br/>of surfaces via a tool developed by Harer, Penner, and elucidated by<br/>Kontsevich (graph homology). Graph homology is very similar to the algebra<br/>that appears in the context of Vassiliev invariants. The principal<br/>investigator is also studying the group of outer automorphisms of a free<br/>group via graph homology. Finally, the principal investigator, working<br/>jointly with Ryan Budney, Kevin Scannell, and Dev Sinha, is pursuing a<br/>program for grounding Vassiliev invariants in classical homotopy theory<br/>and differential topology. This program has already borne fruit in terms<br/>of geometric interpretations of the simplest Vassiliev invariant.<br/><br/>The yoga behind the theory of topological invariants is that they provide<br/>useful, computable topological information. When the number of dimensions<br/>is large, complete answers to topological questions can often be found<br/>using algebraic invariants. In low dimensions, such as 3 and 4, the<br/>situation is more complicated. The invariants still exist, but they are<br/>much weaker, and usually do not give complete answers.  On the other hand,<br/>there are lots of invariants in low dimensions which don't have high<br/>dimensional analogues, and which are poorly understood topologically. For<br/>example, there is a polynomial you can associate to any knotted loop (such<br/>as a piece of DNA or a singularity in spacetime) which will not change<br/>even if the loop is pushed and pulled into a new shape. This polynomial,<br/>called the Jones polynomial, has a definition which eludes any topological<br/>interpretation and whose topological applications have been modest. The<br/>principal investigator is working to understand precisely the connection<br/>of this polynomial (and other similar objects) with topology, and this<br/>will lead to more effective methods for answering questions in low<br/>dimensional topology and beyond.<br/>"

Invariant theory, with roots in the 17th century, has<br/>proven to be a robust area of mathematical endeavor.  Over the<br/>course of the last 50 years, it has found new applications in<br/>algebraic topology, representation theory, algebraic geometry, as<br/>well as many traditional areas such as number theory and<br/>commutative algebra.  Professor Lesh is on the scientific<br/>organizing committee for Ingo2003, which is an initiative of<br/>research groups in Aberdeen, Manchester, and Goettingen working<br/>in the areas of algebraic topology, representation theory, and<br/>commutative algebra. These scientists have found that<br/>communication across narrow specialty boundaries can bring great<br/>scientific benefits. A central theme of the conference will be<br/>the many connections of invariant theory to other fields. In the<br/>past, conferences organized around the topic of invariant theory<br/>have tended to be rather specialized, for example, concentrating<br/>on computational aspects, or emphasizing interaction with at most<br/>one other subject area, such as algebraic topology. Ingo2003 is<br/>being organized with a much broader scientific base and will be<br/>interdisciplinary in a global sense, as well as having a specific<br/>focus on younger researchers. Some of the topics represented in<br/>discussions will be modular representation theory, coinvariants<br/>and the ""hit problem,"" algebraic topology, and Hasse-Schmidt<br/>differentials and differential Galois theory.<br/><br/>One aspect of invariant theory is studying the question of what<br/>elements of a changing situation must in fact remain fixed. For<br/>example, the points along the axis of a spinning globe remain in<br/>the same position as the globe turns. The point at the center of<br/>the spindle of a tape player stays fixed while other points on<br/>the spindle turn around it. More surprisingly, rotating a circle<br/>around its center and then flipping the circle over any line<br/>through its center must leave a different line in a fixed<br/>position.  The search for such ""invariant"" or ""fixed"" elements of<br/>a situation can be very subtle, and it arises in a wide variety<br/>of mathematical problems and physical applications. The goal of<br/>the Ingo2003 conference is to allow mathematicians from differing<br/>mathematical disciplines to learn techniques from each other, and<br/>to disseminate sets of mathematical tools developed in one<br/>discipline to other disciplines that might find them useful.<br/>"

The Festival provides a significant<br/>arena for the dissemination and development of important, new<br/>results from a wide array of areas within the realms of<br/>algebraic, differential, and geometric topology, and allied<br/>subjects.  While it is planned to continue the broad,<br/>interdisciplinary flavor and collaboration-friendly format that<br/>have characterized the Festival over the years, it is also<br/>proposed to extend the Festival by a day to accommodate specific<br/>annual areas of emphasis. In this way the Festival can be<br/>responsive to the dominant trends of this era: namely, the<br/>simultaneous flourishing of both subspecializations and<br/>cross-disciplinary activity. An active outreach program, which<br/>includes some travel support, will be initiated to broaden<br/>participation in the Festival. For our initial conference under<br/>this grant (May 1-4, 2003), we will have as area of emphasis the<br/>very active field of geometric group theory.<br/><br/>The Topology Festival was conceived and initiated in the 1960's<br/>both as an annual celebration of the burgeoning field of topology<br/>and as an annual conference/workshop for topologists in the<br/>northeastern United States.  While topology has deep roots in<br/>early European mathematical investigations of space and geometry,<br/>it is in the mid-twentieth century that topology came of age,<br/>with American mathematicians providing a large array of seminal<br/>discoveries. American topology has been a key element in<br/>America's world leadership in mathematics.  Topology is a broad<br/>subject, which overlaps with areas of `discrete' mathematics<br/>(e.g., algebra, combinatorics), as well as with `continuous' or<br/>`smooth' mathematics (e.g., differential geometry, dynamical<br/>systems, mathematical physics).  Indeed, a large part of<br/>contemporary mathematics has been profoundly affected by<br/>topological results and methods. As a foundational subject, the<br/>applications of topology are very widespread. A few examples are:<br/>genetics (the study of knotting of DNA molecules), neuroscience<br/>and robotics (dynamical systems modeling), computer science ( in<br/>geometric modeling and simulation), mathematical economics (in<br/>smooth equilibrium theory), physics (the theory of gauge fields),<br/>and neighboring fields in mathematics (e.g., geometric group<br/>theory).  Although many of the basic questions that powered early<br/>efforts in topology have been answered, new problems are<br/>constantly being generated as science moves forward, and<br/>important classical problems remain.  An example of the latter is<br/>the Poincare Conjecture, which has been the subject of several<br/>notable talks at past Topology Festivals and remains one of the<br/>premier unsolved problems of mathematics today---one of the Clay<br/>Institute's seven `millenium problems'--- and the focus of<br/>intense research. The topologists and geometers at Cornell are<br/>proud of the useful role that the Topology Festival has played<br/>and will continue to play in the contemporary development of this<br/>dynamic area of mathematics.<br/>"

Brock<br/><br/>THE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM FOR HYPERBOLIC 3-MANIFOLDS<br/><br/>The PI, Jeffrey Brock, will synthesize diverse techniques in the<br/>deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds to address classification<br/>problem for hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Brock will undertake joint work<br/>with K. Bromberg that employs the theory of hyperbolic cone-manifolds<br/>to show that each tame hyperbolic 3-manifold M is approximated by<br/>geometrically finite 3-manifolds.  This conjecture, known as the<br/>Density Conjecture has recently been solved by Brock and Bromberg in<br/>certain cases.  Brock will also work toward completing joint work<br/>with R. Canary and Y. Minsky to prove Thurston's ending lamination<br/>conjecture, which predicts that a tame hyperbolic 3-manifold is<br/>determined by its topology and its end invariants: combinatorial<br/>invariants attached to the ``ends'' of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.  In<br/>new joint work with Bromberg, R. Evans, and J. Souto, Brock will study<br/>the question of whether each algebraic limit of a sequence of<br/>geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifolds is itself topologically<br/>tame.  This joint project has implications for a conjecture of Ahlfors<br/>that the limit set of a finitely generated Kleinian group has either<br/>measure zero or full measure in the Riemann sphere.  <br/><br/>Classifying mathematical objects plays much the same scientific role<br/>as classifying biological, chemical, or physical phenomena in the<br/>development of these fields.  For example, with the human genome<br/>""cracked,"" scientists may now isolate specific genetic causes or<br/>predispositions to diseases, greatly furthering the ability of science<br/>to address these problems.  In the proposed research, Brock will<br/>endeavor to solve the classification problem for a ""generic"" class of<br/>3-dimensional spaces, the ""hyperbolic 3-manifolds.""  These<br/>non-Euclidean spaces have geometry locally like our own Euclidean<br/>space, but their large scale geometry is expanding exponentially:<br/>for example, light rays (a metaphor for geodesics) emanating from a<br/>point-source diverge exponentially rather than linearly.  William<br/>P. Thurston's revolutionary and pioneering work in the 1970's and<br/>1980's showed that almost all 3-manifolds are hyperbolic, and went on<br/>to raise as many questions about hyperbolic 3-manifolds as it<br/>answered.  From his contributions, a compelling conjectural picture of<br/>the right classification of hyperbolic 3-manifolds has emerged as a<br/>lasting problem for researchers in the field of geometry and topology.<br/>Recent work of the PI and his collaborators has put the solution of<br/>this problem within reach; the PI will make use his NSF support to<br/>facilitate ongoing collaborations to solve this fundamental problem,<br/>thereby making a ""database"" of hyperbolic 3-manifolds available for<br/>wider use by other mathematicians and physicists alike.<br/><br/>"

Jones<br/>Proposal Number:  DMS-0307231<br/>Institution: University of California, Berkeley<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The main topic of the conference ``Groups--2003'' in Gaeta, Italy is Discrete Groups.  It will concentrate on: groups generated by finite automata, hyperbolic groups in the sense of Gromov, Burnside groups, lattices in Lie groups, groups of intermediate growth, and<br/>discrete groups of Lie type. The questions concerning these groups are related to many areas of mathematics mentioned in the next section. The subjects discussed during the conference will be related to growth of groups, subgroup growth, property (T), expanders and Ramanujan graphs, amenability, non-commutative dynamical systems, random walks on groups, formal languages, branch groups, automata groups, fractal groups and fractal sets, computation of spectra of Hecke operators, L2-invariants, bounded cohomology, and the structure of lattices in Lie groups.  A special emphasis will be put on branch groups, as this conference is dedicated to R. Grigorchuk on the occasion of his 50th anniversary.  The main topic of the conference belongs of course to Group Theory, but it is also closely related to Dynamical Systems, Ergodic Theory, Geometry of Metric Spaces, Low-dimensional Topology, Discrete Mathematics, Harmonic Analysis, Operator Algebras,<br/>Representations of Groups, and L2 Cohomology.<br/><br/>                  Non-Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The planned conference ``Groups--2003'' in Gaeta, Italy intends to be a meeting point for mathematicians with various specialties, with group theory serving as a unifying ground. While centered on abstract algebra, participants with a background from statistics, theoretical physics as well as the broad spectrum of pure mathematics will contribute talks that stress as much as possible the unifying nature of mathematics in general, and group theory in particular. Time will generously be alloted for informal discussion and fruitful exchanges between the participants. These will comprise both internationally<br/>renowned experts and graduate students or young researchers who wish to embark in the rapidly progressing field. Proceedings of the conference will be edited, and assemble contributions from the participants. This conference is fittingly dedicated to Professor Grigorchuk for his 50th  birthday, who by his numerous contributions to various diverse fields of mathematics has illustrated the goals of this conference.<br/><br/>"

In particular he and Teichner are<br/>pursuing the question of whether Vassiliev invariants detect knottedness.<br/>The principal investigator is also looking for more powerful versions of<br/>the theory of Vassiliev invariants, hopefully giving rise to four<br/>dimensional (concordance) information. Some of this is joint with Jacob<br/>Mostovoy and Ted Stanford. Working jointly with Matt Horak and Karen<br/>Vogtmann, the principal investigator is studying the mapping class group<br/>of surfaces via a tool developed by Harer, Penner, and elucidated by<br/>Kontsevich (graph homology). Graph homology is very similar to the algebra<br/>that appears in the context of Vassiliev invariants. The principal<br/>investigator is also studying the group of outer automorphisms of a free<br/>group via graph homology. Finally, the principal investigator, working<br/>jointly with Ryan Budney, Kevin Scannell, and Dev Sinha, is pursuing a<br/>program for grounding Vassiliev invariants in classical homotopy theory<br/>and differential topology. This program has already borne fruit in terms<br/>of geometric interpretations of the simplest Vassiliev invariant.<br/><br/>The yoga behind the theory of topological invariants is that they provide<br/>useful, computable topological information. When the number of dimensions<br/>is large, complete answers to topological questions can often be found<br/>using algebraic invariants. In low dimensions, such as 3 and 4, the<br/>situation is more complicated. The invariants still exist, but they are<br/>much weaker, and usually do not give complete answers.  On the other hand,<br/>there are lots of invariants in low dimensions which don't have high<br/>dimensional analogues, and which are poorly understood topologically. For<br/>example, there is a polynomial you can associate to any knotted loop (such<br/>as a piece of DNA or a singularity in spacetime) which will not change<br/>even if the loop is pushed and pulled into a new shape. This polynomial,<br/>called the Jones polynomial, has a definition which eludes any topological<br/>interpretation and whose topological applications have been modest. The<br/>principal investigator is working to understand precisely the connection<br/>of this polynomial (and other similar objects) with topology, and this<br/>will lead to more effective methods for answering questions in low<br/>dimensional topology and beyond.<br/>"
