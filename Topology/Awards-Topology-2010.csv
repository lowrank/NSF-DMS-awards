More generally, the PI will investigate the Johnson filtration, which is a sequence of subgroups of the mapping class group starting with the Torelli group.  A major open question is whether or not Torelli groups are finitely presented or not.  The Pi would also like to understand how pseudo-Anosov dilatations are distributed among the terms of the Johnson filtration. Finally, the PI aims to find generating sets for terms of the Johnson filtration and related groups.<br/><br/>The mapping class group describes the symmetries of surfaces, or two-dimensional objects which are analogous to the three-dimensional space we live in.  The set of symmetries of an object is often most easily understood by using matrices.  In the case of the mapping class group, there is a natural way to use matrices to understand a large piece of the picture, but there is also a large amount of information that escapes detection by these matrices.  It is this mysterious part of the mapping class groups that the PI is studying.<br/><br/>"

First, the PIs propose to investigate the structure of morphism spaces between real algebraic varieties, especially unstable and stable homotopy types of spaces of ""real algebraic"" morphisms.  Second, the PIs will examine the cohomology of various discrete and arithmetic groups, including algebraic versions of homotopy invariance for cohomology and the related Friedlander-Milnor conjecture.  Third, the PIs propose to investigate invariants of singularities arising from methods involving the cdh-topology, continuing the recent flurry of activity in this subject.  Finally, motivated by comparisons between algebro-geometric and topological invariants, the PIs will investigate semi-topological or morphic invariants of algebraic varieties, which lie partway between the worlds of algebraic geometry and topology.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, one of the oldest branches of mathematics, has at its heart the goal of studying the structure of solutions to systems of polynomial equations; these collections of solutions are called algebraic varieties.  Homotopy theory, sometimes called rubber sheet geometry, attempts to study those aspects of geometric objects that are independent of the way they are pulled or twisted; one way to do this is to attach ""invariants,"" e.g., numbers (or more general algebraic structures), to these objects.  Algebraic varieties arising from equations with real or complex coefficients can be studied by means of homotopy theory, and the invariants that arise are necessarily somewhat restricted.  The goal of this project is to study classical questions in algebraic geometry using invariants of algebraic varieties arising from homotopy theory.  A major aim of this project is to convey some of the enthusiasm, techniques, and mathematical goals of the principal investigators to the next generation of mathematicians represented by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  Methods to recruit and involve early career mathematicians will include the organization of a large international conference, the running of several workshops, the sharing of travel funds, and activities involving visitors from other institutions."

These groups are used as algebraic encoding of combinatorial information about the dynamical system. If the covering is expanding, then all the essential information (for instance the Julia set) can be recovered from the iterated monodromy groups. The project is devoted to the study of iterated monodromy groups and their application to topology, dynamics and group theory. Iterated monodromy groups are naturally defined for more general structures than partial self-covering. This generalized definition can be used to construct simplicial approximations of Julia sets of multi-dimensional dynamical systems. There are very few examples of rational functions of several variables for which there is a satisfactory understanding of the topology of their Julia set. The project will provide a general method of constructing approximations of such Julia sets and will lead to new homological invariants of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>The aim of the project is to study new connections between algebra and geometric group theory on one side and dynamical systems and the associated fractal Julia sets on the other. The iterated monodromy groups provide a bridge between these two branches of mathematics. Geometric group theory studies large-scale properties of groups of symmetries. Dynamical systems study chaotic dynamics of iterations of maps, which are models of chaotic systems in Science. Iterated monodromy groups encode in a computationally effective way combinatorial information about the dynamical systems. In particular, they give a method to construct approximations by polyhedra of complicated fractals associated with the dynamical systems. This approach can be used in the study of multi-dimensional dynamical systems, where usual computer visualization can not be applied. Iterated monodromy groups are also very interesting and exotic examples of groups. This way dynamical systems can be used to reach better understanding of group theory.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Analysis Program."

Since Kolmogorov's initial breakthrough (1958), dynamical entropy has played a major role in the ergodic theory of amenable actions. The principal recently discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all linear groups, thereby providing the first extension of entropy theory to certain nonamenable groups. This new development opens the door to an abundance of problems that could have a great impact in ergodic theory and other fields (e.g., statistical physics, probabilistic combinatorics, operator algebras). In the last decade, there has been an explosion of interest in rigidity theory for nonamenable group actions (see, for example, works of A.Furman, D. Gaboriau, and S. Popa). New results indicate that, under special conditions, measure-conjugacy is equivalent to a priori weaker forms of equivalence of actions, such as orbit equivalence and von Neumann equivalence. It is expected that the principal investigator's new entropy theory can make an important contribution to rigidity theory by determining more precisely when it is an orbit equivalence or von Neumann equivalence invariant. The principal investigator has recently proven the first orbit equivalence flexibility results in the nonamenable setting. It is expected that the techniques developed for the proof will be more broadly applicable and could result in a general orbit equivalence flexibility theory for certain groups and actions. Pointwise ergodic theorems have a long history, beginning with Birkhoff. In collaboration with A. Nevo, the principal investigator is developing general methods for proving pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of discrete, nonamenable groups. Successes so far include new pointwise ergodic averaging sequences for actions of free groups and the first pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of general word-hyperbolic groups with respect to ball and spherical averages. The new techniques remove a fundamental obstacle in that they reduce the problem to the amenable case, which can then be solved by the classical Wiener-Calderon-Folner theory. <br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes yearly workshops at Texas A&M for the purposes of introducing graduate students to the latest research developments and bringing together the diverse groups of researchers working in areas important to the project. The principal investigator plans to mentor undergraduates through his department's honors program and to give popular talks at math club meetings and during his department's summer programs for undergraduates and high school students. The principal investigator also plans to invite an expert expositor as a distinguished lecturer to give a series of inspiring talks on topics of current interest. This project directly provides for the training of a graduate student. It should be easy to attract one because the principal investigator's recent results are accessible and lead to an open field of problems whose solutions could have significant impact in ergodic theory and other areas."

Although the definition of algebraic K-theory is not inherently equivariant, the tools of equivariant stable homotopy theory have proven useful for K-theory computations. In particular, one fruitful approach exploits the equivariant structure of topological Hochschild homology (THH) to compute algebraic K-theory. In the case of certain singular rings, this approach reduces the computation of K-theory to the computation of equivariant stable homotopy groups of THH, graded by the real representation ring of the circle. To compute K-theory one needs to determine which equivariant homotopy groups arise, compute these groups, and then assemble them to recover K-theory. Each of these steps is difficult and understood only in a small number of cases. This project seeks to address these issues for various specific K-theory computations, as well as defining an abstract algebraic object embodying structures that arise in these computations. Other specific goals of the project include developing an approach for the K-theory of filtered rings, and answering several questions about the structure of THH. <br/><br/>Algebraic K-theory is an invariant which can be applied to study basic objects from several fields of mathematics. In particular, algebraic K-theory can be used to study properties of fundamental objects in algebra, called rings. Although higher algebraic K-theory was defined more than 30 years ago, computational progress has been slow. Indeed, even for some very basic rings, the algebraic K-theory is still not known. K-theory computations, however, have important applications to many areas of mathematics: algebraic number theory, classification of manifolds, motivic homotopy theory, special values of L-functions, etc. An approach to these important computations lies in the field of algebraic topology, and more specifically, in the study of equivariant homotopy theory. The goal of this project is to use these tools to not only produce new algebraic K-theory computations, but also to develop the framework and theory to facilitate future computations."

In this direction, a basic question is whether any topological simply connected 4-manifold which admits a smooth structure in fact admits infinitely many. The PI's previous work with R. Stern developed a technique called 'reverse engineering' which can be used to attack this problem. This technique depends on the existence of 'model manifolds' or equivalently the discovery of embedded nullhomologous tori on which surgery can be performed. Until recently, there have been no explicit techniques for finding such tori. However, in the past year, R. Stern and the P.I. have discovered techniques for finding these tori in standard 4-manifolds. This proposal explains how this is done in (2 or more) blowups of CP^2. The embedded nullhomologous tori which are produced can be surgered to create infinite families of homeomorphic but mutually nondiffeomorphic 4-manifolds. The next task is to carry out Floer homology and relative Seiberg-Witten calculations so that our technique can become useful in its most general form.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this proposal will address the relationship  between mathematics and theoretical physics, opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in topology, and career  development of postdoctoral fellows. Four-dimensional geometry and  topology has very close ties to physics. For example, the proposer will study geography problems for symplectic manifolds which have been shown to impact physics via the notion of 'superconformal simple type'. Any general results concerning Seiberg-Witten theory hold the prospect of engendering interaction with the physics community, and this will be a basic concern. The search for exotic 4-manifolds has been embraced by the theoretical physics community, and new results on this front will also serve to enhance this relationship. Another basic goal of this proposal is to address 'pipeline issues' in mathematics. Our approach is to to get students and young mathematicians working on interesting problems. A key aspect of this proposal is the development of problems which are accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students. It presents problems which will be suitable thesis problems for students and  research projects for postdoctoral fellows at Michigan State. It also discusses computational problems which are suitable for advanced undergraduate students."

The PI's proposal follows two principle lines of study.  The first direction is to shed light on the question of quasi-isometrically classifying various families of groups.  The second direction of study, involves applying knowledge gained from analysis of the quasi-isometric structure of a family of groups to illuminate questions of a different nature: for instance to embeddings of 3-dimensional manifold groups or to functional analytic properties of mapping class groups.<br/><br/><br/>Quasi-isometric geometry is a way of considering geometric properties of a space which are unchanged by a ""small"" change of the distance function.  In this proposal the PI considers the geometry of various natural families of groups and studies question such as: to what extent do geometric properties determine algebraic ones.  One family of groups which the PI continues to study with Walter Neumann (Barnard College) are those associated to 3-dimensional manifolds---these spaces are of crucial importance throughout low-dimensional topology and in physics as well."

It allows for systematic stratification of objects in a hierarchical way that reveals invariants that satisfy `polynomial' local-to-global behavior.  Pioneered by Tom Goodwillie and Michael Weiss in the late 80's and early 90's, it is only more recently that the broad power of these methods has been becoming clear. Principal Investigators Arone, Ching, Dwyer, Kuhn, Lesh, and Turchin have all been involved in important discoveries in this area, which range from new results about the periodic homotopy of spheres, to giving new models for spaces of knots.  Operad Theory is another algebraic machine that has been developed to study systems of operations satisfying specified algebraic properties (associativity, commutativity, etc.) up to some sort of controlled deformation. The current work of the PIs has led to the emerging perspective that Functor Calculus has deep connections with the more studied Theory of Operads, and that one might be able to use equivariant homotopy methods to measure how much simpler the latter is than the the former. The range of application is also growing with the placement of Calculus within the broader context of Homotopical Algebra.<br/><br/>In Topology, one is studying geometric objects ranging from manifolds (higher dimensional versions of curves and surfaces) and knots, in the case of Geometric Topology, to spaces of continuous functions and structured rings up to deformation, in the case of Algebraic Topology. One studies such things by means of algebraic invariants.  Such invariants need to be computable, which in practice means that if a `global' object is built out of `local' pieces, there is some process that allows one to attempt to calculate the global invariant from the local invariants.  The purposes of this project are to (a) investigate the Calculus of Functors method of organizing and constructing such invariants, (b) to connect this to Operad Theory, the very important theory of algebraic operations, and (c) to bring these methods to a broad spectrum of mathematicians through workshops and a conference. The methods studied in this project should give new insights into many mathematical topics of ongoing and wide interest, ranging from topological complexity of algorithms to representation theory to topological field theory."

In spite of being quite different, these groups show remarkable similarities. This may be explained by the rigidity properties of associated geometric objects such as locally symmetric spaces, moduli space,... The goal of this project is to study how the rigidity of these associated geometric objects is reflected in the algebraic properties of the groups in question. More concretely, the PI will study the relations between the number of generators of a Kleinian group and geometric observables of the associated hyperbolic 3-manifold, such as the volume or the spectrum of the Laplacian. In order to do so, it will be necessary to develop some so-far unexplored aspects of the deformation theory of Kleinian groups. The PI will also study to what extent the Margulis superrigidity theorem holds for homomorphisms between mapping class groups. This problem will be approached via combinatorial methods and also via the study of harmonic maps between moduli spaces. Tools from dynamics will also be applied to study the rigidity of certain actions of mapping class groups. Finally, the PI will study the existence of minimal spines for locally symmetric spaces and their geometric, homological and algebraic properties. In this case, the main tools are going to be a combination of classical arguments in algebraic topology and in the theory of algebraic groups.<br/><br/><br/>A group is an algebraic object of fundamental interest. Perhaps the most interesting groups appear as symmetries of some geometric structure, such as a crystal, a physical model, an object in space, etc... For instance, Kleinian groups play an important role in the study of fractal objects. Arithmetic groups are groups of matrices and hence have applications in all branches of mathematics. Finally, the mapping class group, the group of symmetries of a surface, plays not only a central role  in mathematics, but is also important in for instance theoretical physics. All three classes of groups are known to have useful rigidity properties but it is unknown how this rigidity is effectively interlocked with the algebraic properties of the groups. It is an integral part of this proposal to obtain effective and, at least in principle, computable rigidity results. Besides advancing the state of knowledge in an important area of mathematics, educating graduate students to do independent research is one of the main goals of this project. This will be greatly facilitated by the broad spectrum of tools and methods that the PI intends to apply. This breadth will also facilitate the disemination of the obtained results among the mathematical community.<br/>"

A geometric structure on a manifold gives a way of measuring distances and angles in a manifold.

The PI will continue his study with an aim of further understanding of smooth structures on small four-manifolds such as CP^2, S^2 x S^2, and CP^2#(-CP^2). The initial work suggests that it would be possible to construct an exotic smooth structure on some of these remaining small four-manifolds.

The famous smooth four-dimensional Poincare conjecture illustrates this phenomenon. The PI recently developed a new and very effective technique that allows to tackle these small four-dimensional manifolds. The PI's approach shows a great promise in understanding the classification of smooth four-dimensional manifolds.

The SL(2,C)-character variety, X(F), of a group F parametrizes conjugacy classes of representations of F into SL(2,C), the isometry group of hyperbolic 3-space. Discrete faithful elements of X(F) correspond to hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the PI will work to understand better the interaction between topological and geometric features of these manifolds, as well as the structure of the discrete-faithful locus itself. In addition, he will pursue a study of X(F) as a whole, considered as a dynamical system under the action of the outer automorphism group of F (particularly when F is a free group). A new dynamical decomposition of X(F) was recently discovered, whose structure seems to be rich and relatively unexplored. In addition the PI will study geometric aspects of Teichmuller spaces, which parametrize hyperbolic structures in two dimensions, and of Mapping Class Groups, their natural automorphism groups.<br/><br/>The interactions between geometry, topology and dynamics play a entral role in mathematics as well as its applications. A geometric space, such as our own universe or the configuration space of some system, may admit dynamical phenomena such as flows, iterations or group actions. The behavior of these phenomena, as well as the geometry of the space, can be strongly influenced by its topological structure, namely the underlying connective tissue on which the geometry is overlaid. Furthermore, we often find that geometry and dynamics persist at higher levels of abstraction: the collection of all geometric structures on a given space can itself be organized into a new ""higher"" space, with its own geometry and its own inherent symmetries which give rise to dynamical structure. The interaction between these phenomena at different levels can enrich our insight about the original systems. The PI's own research focuses on particular instances of this general template, namely the geometry and topology of 2- and 3- dimensional spaces, and the corresponding dynamics for their higher parameter spaces. This low-dimensional setting is particularly amenable to our intuition and is partly motivated by direct visual analogies with our physical world, but it also happens, for a variety of reasons, to be a meeting place for a number of different areas of mathematics as well as physics, so that a fuller understanding in this domain can enrich, by analogy as well as direct mathematical connection, our approaches to other parts of mathematics.

Among many other benefits, it detects the knot genus (the least complicated surface whose boundary is the knot), and in particular, whether a knot is non-trivial.  It is a homology theory, and like many homology theories the Euler characteristic is interesting: for knots, the Euler characteristic is one of the oldest knot invariants, the Alexander polynomial.  Heegaard Floer homology is part of a family of recent homology theories whose Euler characteristic gives other knot polynomials.  But it can be hard to compute, and is defined by ad-hoc rules rather than a concise set of properties.  In this project, we will develop a theory of bordered homology invariants: extend the Heegaard Floer homology and other homology theories to objects (knots or 3-manifolds) with boundary, so that when a knot or manifold is split into pieces the invariant for the whole can be computed from the invariants for the pieces.  Among other benefits, this will make the theory more computable, and give axioms for the theory.<br/><br/>Although knot theory has been studied for many centuries, some of the most elementary questions, such as finding the least complicated surface whose boundary lies on the knot, are still not easy to answer. Heegaard Floer homology is one recent theory that answers this and many other questions in knot theory and topology.  However, it is hard to compute even for relatively small knots.  In this project, I and my collaborators will extend Heegaard Floer homology (and other related theories) so that they can be computed for pieces of a knot and then built up to the complete knot.  This promises to provide a great computational and theoretical tool.  Throughout the project, accessibility will be emphasized, and the project will be integrated with, for instance, an undergraduate research program."

It will be a conference interspersed with<br/> specialized workshops and tutorials.  It will be third<br/> conference in the series of large, very successful international<br/> conferences ``Knots in Poland"".  The conferences will take place<br/> in Warsaw July 18-25 and in Banach Center in Bedlewo July<br/> 25-August 4, 2010. Specifically, we propose to support about 15<br/> graduate students and 10 mathematicians without grant.  As part<br/> of the conference we will have a series of 3 talks by Tom Mrowka<br/> on his proof that Khovanov homology can be understood as a page<br/> in a spectral sequence converging to a version of Instanton<br/> Floer homology.  A consequence of this is that Khovanov homology<br/> detects the unknot.  Knots have fascinated people from the dawn<br/> of the human history.  Much of the early knot theory was<br/> motivated by physics and chemistry (e.g. Kelvin theory of vortex<br/> atoms). The fundamental problem in knot theory is to be able to<br/> distinguish non-equivalent knots. There have been exciting new<br/> developments in the area of Knot Theory in recent years. From<br/> the Jones, Homflypt, and Kauffman polynomials, through quantum<br/> invariants of 3-manifolds, Topological Quantum Field Theories,<br/> to relations with gauge theory type invariants in 4-dimensional<br/> topology (Donaldson, Witten, etc).  More recently, Khovanov<br/> introduced homology theory of links which categorifies the Jones<br/> polynomial (a chain complex is build on the Kauffman model of<br/> the Jones polynomial).  Soon after, Ozsvath and Szabo developed<br/> Heegaard-Floer homology, that lifts the Alexander polynomial.<br/> These two significantly different theories are closely related<br/> and the dependencies are the object of intensive study. One can<br/> mention here Khovanov-Rozansky categorification of Homflypt<br/> polynomial, categorification of the Kauffman bracket skein<br/> module of some 3-dimensional manifolds, and the result of<br/> T.Mrowka that Khovanov homology detects the unknot.<br/><br/>The subject has significant applications and relations with<br/>biology, physics, chemistry and the theory of computation.  We<br/>feel that a conference on this subject is highly appropriate at<br/>this time, and we strive to be in the frontier of new development<br/>in knot theory and its ramifications.  The project has broader<br/>impact in several aspects.  Knots in Poland conference brings<br/>together from all over the word, third-world countries, former<br/>Soviet Union, minorities, women, and provides an opportunity for<br/>researchers and students to share their latest ideas and to<br/>collaborate with each other. The knowledge obtained on this<br/>occasion will be disseminated by participants throughout the<br/>world.  Distinguished researchers (including about 10 woman) will<br/>deliver plenary talks surveying the state of knowledge related to<br/>Knot Theory and its Ramifications.  PhD students and fresh PhD's<br/>will be encouraged to attend.  We expect to publish conference<br/>proceedings (as we did in the past) containing cutting-edge<br/>research papers and lecture notes which will be suitable for<br/>research mathematicians, students and readers with background in<br/>other exact sciences, including biology, chemistry, computer<br/>science, and physics.  <br/><br/>Conference Web Page:<br/>http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~traczyk/knotpol2010/<http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/%7Etraczyk/knotpol2010/>"

The genesis of combinatorial group theory at the end of the nineteenth century was intimately involved with geometric questions, but subsequent developments tended towards algebra and logic. In the 1980's Cannon, Gromov, Thurston and others produced an infusion of geometric ideas which shed a great deal of light on earlier results and led to new research methods known collectively as geometric group theory. The main themes of geometric group theory involve the large scale geometry of cell complexes, asymptotic properties of groups, and connections with theoretical computer science. More recently results on asymptotic properties of groups have been particularly useful in the cryptanalysis of group based cryptosystems which occur in postquantum cryptography as possible alternatives to current public key systems. <br/><br/> Over the past several years dramatic achievements in these areas have led to progress on a number of basic and difficult questions and also to novel connections with other areas of mathematics and with theoretical computer science. We will bring people from various branches of mathematics and computer science together to consider new approaches to open questions in the field. Our major goal is to strengthen the connections group theory has with other branches of mathematics and to highlight new promising perspectives. A cornerstone of activities of the thematic semester will be a collection of workshops covering related themes. These workshops will be organized to benefit students, postdocs, and young researchers."

A geometric way of studying 3-manifolds is to cut a complicated 3-manifold into a collection of simpler 3-dimensional pieces along 2-dimensional surfaces.  For example a Heegaard splitting is such a decomposition.  Using this idea, one can also construct useful new 3-manifolds by doing surgery on well-understood ones.

The purpose of the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop  is to investigate <br/>common themes and techniques among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested in these areas. This years workshop will bring together leading researchers in geometry and topology who have a special interest in problems related to Knots, Surfaces and Three-Manifolds and will  investigate a number of important questions at the forefront of research in these areas.

A surge of new and exciting ideas, in particular  Kahn and Markovic's proof of the surface subgroup conjecture, Wise's work on quasiconvex heirarchies, and Agol's virtual fibering criterion, has provided new avenues to tackle this problem and there is reason to believe that a solution may well be in sight.  The workshop will also concentrate on recent advances in low-dimensional topology made by researchers in Heegaard Floer theory. We will discuss open questions in the field including the Berge conjecture which gives a conjectural list of those knots in the three-sphere which admit a Lens-space surgery.  Another topic will be the recently announced proof by Guilfoyle and Klingenberg of the Caratheodory conjecture, that any closed convex surface in  3-dimensional Euclidean space must have at least 2 umbilic points. <br/>Through sharing new techniques and insights, it is hoped that progress can be made on a  number of these important questions."

The proposal divides into two main parts: the large scale geometry of groups and the actions of groups on compact manifolds.  Both of these can be viewed as broad generalizations of the celebrated rigidity results of Mostow and Margulis for lattices in Lie groups.  A significant amount of research in geometric group theory is devoted to understanding the large scale geometry of lattices in Lie groups.   In this vein, recent results of Eskin, Fisher, and the PI establish rigidity for certain solvable Lie groups.    The techniques involved are only beginning to be understood, and the PI proposes to develop them further.   In particular the PI hopes to apply these techniques to show the invariance of the solvable radical in more general Lie groups and to the quasi-isometric classification of nilpotent Lie groups.   The second focal point of the proposal is the study of  groups can appear as topological symmetries of compact manifolds.  There has been much work on this problem, but the results almost all apply to specific low dimensional manifolds.  Even for the homeomorphisms of the circle there are many unresolved questions.   The PI proposes studying some classes of higher dimensional manifolds which do have large groups of symmetries on the level of homotopy and to determine whether these symmetries can be realized as groups of homeomorphism.<br/><br/><br/>Roughly speaking, large scale (or coarse) geometry is the study of geometric properties of objects ""seen from far away"". From this perspective, any bounded object is indistinguishable from a point, and a line of dots is indistinguishable from a solid line. This sort of geometry has been influential recently in many areas of mathematics, notably group theory, topology, and geometric analysis. This research will extend previous work of the PI exploring the large scale geometry of several classes of mathematical objects, both classical geometric spaces and objects only now being viewed in a geometric manner.  A particular focus of the proposal is the study of the possible coarse geometries of groups of topological symmetries of relative simple objects built out of familiar spaces, like spheres or other surfaces."

This is equivalent to understanding sets of homomorphisms between a pair of discrete groups (the domain representing the equations and the target the group of interest).  The first half of this project is motivated by the theory of S-bundles, where S is a compact orientable surface.  Surface bundles arise throughout pure mathematics.  If B is a manifold (or other reasonable space), then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of isomorphism classes  (oriented) of S-bundles over B and the set of (conjugacy classes of) homomorphisms from the fundamental group of B to the mapping class group of S.  The PI intends to develop a general structure theory for this set when the fundamental group of B is finitely  generated (which will always happen when B is compact, for example).  In the second half of this project (joint work with H, Wilton), we study homomorphisms to free (and more generally torsion-free hyperbolic) groups.  Broadly speaking, this is the class of `negatively-curved' groups.  This study is motivated by the first-order logic of these groups.  It is quite remarkable that the geometry of negative curvature has profound implications for first-order logic.  We intend to study these first-order theories from an algorithmic point of view, and find general decision processes which determine if a logical sentence is true or false.      Groups form a natural language for studying symmetries of mathematical objects.  As such, they arise throughout mathematics, and their study is informed by many branches of mathematics.  There are very few basic properties of a `symmetry', the most important of which is that it doesn't lose any information about the space, so it can be undone.  In this project, we treat the groups as objects of intrinsic interest, although the questions that we ask take their motivation from topology, geometry, logic and computer science as well as from within group theory.  Broadly speaking, we take a collection of equations over a group G, and try to understand the set of all solutions to these equations.  In the first half of the project, the group G is the mapping class group of a surface, which captures much of the symmetry of a surface (a space which looks like the plane in small sets).  Studying equations over the mapping class group is of fundamental interest in geometry and topology, through the study of surface bundles (a space which nearby any point decomposes into a pair of smaller sets, one of which is a surface).  The study of equations over the mapping class group gives a general theory parametrizing surface bundles.  The second half of this project studies equations over groups from the point of view of logic, and looks for general algorithms which decide if logical sentences are true of false.    This project is jointly funded by the Topology Program and the Foundations Program."

Some of the most fundamental questions about hyperbolic 3-manifolds concern the extent to which their properties are inherited in, or, conversely, may develop among covering spaces of finite degree.  The famous virtual Haken and virtual fiberering conjectures answer this description, for example, as do the questions below.  Given a hyperbolic 3-manifold with a special topological property, for instance a knot complement, with how many others that have this same property does it share a finite-degree cover?  Or for a fixed hyperbolic 3-manifold M and a family of finite-degree covers {M_n}, does the rank of the fundamental group of M_n grow linearly with the covering degree?   This relates to the fixed price question in the study of topological dynamics.  The PI intends to continue his attacks on these and other questions, such as the possibility of embedding in right-angled Artin groups.  He will also further describe the topology of hyperbolic manifolds with low volume.<br/><br/><br/>The objects of study here, 3-manifolds, are spaces which look, in a neighborhood of each point, like the familiar three-dimensional space in which we live.  Although their definition allows quite a bit of flexibility, 3-manifolds share with 2-manifolds (surfaces) the property that each admits a unique best metric, a way of measuring the distance between two points in the space.  This property of low-dimensional manifolds, known in dimension 3 as Thurston's geometrization conjecture and proven recently by V. Perelman, has motivated an enormous body of work that uses geometry as a tool for understanding 3-manifolds, and the project follows this broad theme.  The study of 3-manifolds has benefited from its interaction with many different fields of mathematics, and the project additionally draws from questions and techniques in the study of topological dynamics, geometric flows, geometric group theory, and others. <br/>The project will help us better understand the classification of 3-manifolds and the relationships between them.  This in turn has applications in such diverse fields as cosmology (in determining the shape of the universe, for example), biology (in understanding the knotting of DNA), and computer science (through connections with families of graphs that certain families of 3-manifolds coarsely resemble), among others."

A part of the proposal is a program to remedy the discrepancy with mapping class groups, where the geometry is very well understood, thanks to the recent work of Masur, Minsky and others. The first step in this program is hyperbolicity of the free factor complex. Other questions proposed are finite presentability of Torelli groups, finiteness properties of arithmetic groups over function fields and quasi-isometric rigidity of right-angled Artin groups.<br/><br/>The interplay between algebra and geometry is one of the classical themes in mathematics. For example, symmetries of Platonic solids form fundamental examples of groups. In geometric group theory the situation is reversed: one starts with a group of symmetries of an algebraic object (for example, another group) and constructs a geometric object with the same symmetries. The study of the geometry of this object then leads to a greater understanding of the algebraic object one started with. The proposal contains several instances of this approach. Culler-Vogtmann's Outer space is a geometric object whose symmetries are the same as those of a free group (of finite rank). Recent results reveal that this space has negative curvature in some directions, much like the surface of a saddle. Understanding this phenomenon better would lead to a greater understanding of the symmetry group of the free group."

In more<br/>detail: The proposal includes the study of the equivariant Johnson- Wilson spectrum, denoted by ER(n), under the involution symmetry given by complex conjugation acting on the standard Johnson-Wilson spectrum.  <br/>This theory ER(n) belongs to a family that starts with real K-theory.  <br/>These theories have rich structure that has been explored by the PI in previous work. The power of this structure has been demonstrated by the PI and his collaborators in extending previously known results about the immersion dimension of real projective spaces. In his proposal the PI also studies infinite dimensional symmetry groups like Kac-Moody groups and symplectomorphism groups. Kac-Moody groups are infinite dimensional generalizations of compact Lie groups in terms of their structure and representation theory. The PI studies them from the standpoint of topology by studying their classifying spaces and the underlying equivariant K-theory. The PI also studies symplectormorphism groups of certain 4-manifolds. In earlier work, he and his coauthors have demonstrated that one can use homotopical techniques to completely understand these groups for rational ruled surfaces. The techniques used there appear to be applicable in much more generality which the PI plans to explore.<br/><br/>On a general level, the proposal attempts to solve geometric problems by first understanding the apparent symmetries in the problem and then applying algebraic techniques to the framework. For example, complex K- theory is an invariant constructed from families of complex vector spaces parametrized over a general space (a concept known as a complex vector bundle). Complex conjugation demonstrates an apparent symmetry of this structure and one obtains real K-theory by encoding this symmetry. This framework can be formalized into a very strong algebraic invariant the power of which was demonstrated almost 50 years ago to answer a fundamental question like which spheres have a group structure, or which euclidean spaces support the structure of a skew field. The PI studies a family ER(n) that generalizes real K- theory. In addition to this, the PI studies questions with apparent symmetries that are no longer finite, but still have fundamental geometric significance. For example, the infinite dimensional symplectomorphism group is defined as the symmetries of a smooth manifold which preserve a fixed symplectic form. The PI has shown that in some cases, this group is amenable to study using algebraic techniques."

They view a 4-manifold, after blowing it up, as the total space of a broken Lefschetz fibration (BLF).  In the simplest picture available, the blown-up 4-manifold X is the union of two 4-manifolds X_1 and X_2, each bounding a fibered 3-manifold Y, where X_1 is a Lefschetz fibration over a disc, and X_2 is essentially standard. This proposal focuses on computational and qualitative consequences of this  escription. It concerns the Seiberg-Witten theory of broken Lefschetz fibrations and, more particularly, their ""Lagrangian matching invariants"" - gadgets developed by  the P.I. using symplectic geometry associated with BLFs which conjecturally recapture the Seiberg-Witten invariants. The P.I. will use conceptual tools from symplectic topology to compute Floer-theoretic invariants for the two parts of the 4-manifold:  X_1 (combinatorially  complicated but symplectic) and X_2 (simple but non-symplectic). These computations are directed at making inroads into some major open problems in 4-dimensional topology: existence of symplectic structures, Seiberg-Witten simple type, and algorithmic computation of Seiberg-Witten invariants. They aim to shed light on the algebraic structures of 3- and 4-dimensional gauge theory.<br/><br/>Mathematicians regard 4 as the most mysterious dimension - more so than 2, 3, 5 or 1000. It is also the dimension of physical space- time, and equations devised by physicists have led to techniques that probe the topological structure of 4-dimensional spaces and show that they are governed by more complicated rules than anything in higher dimensions.  So far, we have a very limited knowledge of what those rules are, and understanding them better is the focus for this project. Recent developments have shown that we can build all 4- dimensional spaces (technically, smooth, compact 4-dimensional manifolds) from simple but highly structured building blocks. This project will study how the known characteristics (invariants) for 4- dimensional manifolds can be understood in terms of those building blocks by invoking methods from another part of geometry that evolved from physics, symplectic topology.  One aim is to elucidate what geometric information the invariants capture. Another is to seek genuinely new invariants. One can hope to do so by using the known invariants as a template; but that will require a deep understanding of how those invariants arise from the building blocks."

These have long been considered the most likely counterexamples to the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare Conjecture. Recent work by Akbulut, and a simpler, more general approach by the PI, have shown that infinitely many of these are standard. The PI plans to extend his method further, trying to show that all CS-spheres are standard. He will also study other homotopy 4-spheres containing fibered 2-knots, accumulating evidence suggesting that the conjecture is true. The project includes various other avenues of research related to the PI's expertise. He will search for compact domains of holomorphy in complex surfaces, using one of his recent theorems. It now suffices to locate smoothly embedded compact 4-manifolds admitting suitable handle decompositions. He hopes to find (or rule out) examples such as pseudoconvex embeddings of preassigned homology spheres, and a compact domain of holomorphy in C^2 homotopy equivalent to the 2-sphere (violating a conjecture of Forstneric). A related theorem of the PI allows one to construct topological embeddings of 3-manifolds with a generalized pseudoconvexity property; he will investigate these in more detail. Another project is to study what manifolds of dimension 4 and higher can be realized as orbit spaces of vector fields in Euclidean space. Preliminary research shows that such manifolds must be simply connected, but many 4-manifolds with nontrivial 2-homology can arise.<br/>Various other investigations, concerning compact 4-manifolds, symplectic structures and Lefschetz pencils will also be pursued.<br/><br/>The Poincare Conjecture for 3-manifolds has now been proved by Perelman, a full century after it was first proposed. Its generalization to higher dimensions was proved in the 1960's except in dimension 4. That last version was proved around 1981 by Freedman. However, the original conjecture was made for topological manifolds, so that one is allowed to crinkle the manifold in complicated ways. When manifolds are used in practice, in geometry, analysis, physics, economics and so on, one normally wants to be able to apply calculus, so one must disallow crinkling and work entirely with smooth manifolds. The smooth analog of the Poincare Conjecture has been understood in dimensions >4 since the 1960's, and is equivalent to the topological version (hence solved) in dimensions <4. However, the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare Conjecture is still mysterious, and is the last fundamental open question remaining from the initial heyday of manifold topology a half-century ago. There have been many potential counterexamples constructed, homotopy 4-spheres that might not be the standard 4-sphere, but none has been shown to actually be nonstandard. It has also been quite difficult to show that any of these examples are standard, but the PI has been in the forefront of research in this direction. His new methods have dispensed with a large family of potential counterexamples that were constructed in the 1970's. He intends to further investigate this problem, adding evidence that the conjecture may be true after all, in spite of the prevailing belief to the contrary in recent decades. He will also study other problems involving 4-manifolds and other classical mathematical objects."

The basic program is to gather local information and then try to assemble that data into a more global picture. It is in the second step where we can use constructions and information from the emerging field of derived algebraic geometry.  This proposal focuses on three projects, all growing out of this local-to-global mixture. The most computational is an investigation of the homotopy groups of the $K(2)$-local sphere; this is local by nature and we seek a complete calculation.  The other two projects are more global. The first is to investigate the existence and non-existence of derived schemes (or stacks) with level structure; that is, structured versions of the Hopkins-Miller topological modular forms. Of interest here are the bad primes where interesting homotopy theory arises from supersingular curves. The other project here is a look at duality. A form of Serre-Grothendieck duality should hold in the derived setting, but it will be homotopy theoretic in nature, not simply algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This project is in homotopy theory, which is a branch of topology, a modern field that grew naturally out of geometry by studying phenomena that remain invariant under continuous transformations, rather than rigid (e.g., angle-preserving) transformations. Of particular importance in topology are the continuous maps between large dimensional spheres; under a suitable equivalence relation, this is the ring of stable homotopy groups of spheres. This notorious difficult to calculate, or even to make conjectures about; therefore, in the past few decades we have focused on trying to understand large-scale qualitative phenomena. In summary, this is the main thrust of this project as well. It has been very fruitful to detect these phenomena using tools from other fields, especially algebraic geometry. The transition from topology to geometry is done using homology theories, which is a way of linearizing behavior in topology. Simply sticking to one such theory is a radical process, however, and it loses too much data; therefore, we study families of such theories.  The theory of stacks is vital here, as this allows us to study symmetries across continuous families of geometric objects -- especially when the self-symmetries can vary non-continuously throughout the family, as is most certainly the case here."

This new workshop is a follow-up to the 2007 conference: the main point is to revisit the field three years later, to assess what has happened and to to see where we are going. In particular, the field of derived algebraic geometry and its interplay with higher category theory field has grown rapidly since 2007 and is now central to several developing areas of algebraic topology.  It is an ideal moment to explore this interplay.  Researchers who have agreed to participate include Mark Behrens (MIT), D-C.

The focus on polynomials make the geometric objects studied very rigid, in contrast to topology, which is the study of phenomena which remain unchanged under any continuous deformation. Derived algebraic geometry seeks to import techniques from algebraic topology into algebraic geometry in order to capture and calculate some of the finer structure apparently hidden by the inherent rigidity. There have been remarkable recent successes. This grant will be used to fund the attendance of US research mathematicians near the beginning of their careers, in this way promoting the spread of these ideas among the broader research community."

Powerful theorems of Thurston, Perelman, and Mostow imply that almost every knot complement, and more generally almost every 3-manifold, has a unique hyperbolic metric. That is, there is a standard way to measure the space, so that every 2-dimensional cross-section curves like a saddle. At the moment, while we know that this standard hyperbolic metric exists, very little is known about how to relate it to easily computable quantities such as the complexity of a knot diagram. The main goal of this project is to make these relations much more concrete. One important feature of this project is that the geometric problems studied by the PIs are very visual and hands-on, with natural spin-offs into both software applications and projects for students."

Heegaard Floer homology provides various new tools, such as topological invariants and surgery formulas, for low-dimensional mathematical objects.

It is expected that advances in Heegaard Floer homology will lead to  a better understanding of these gauge theoretical invariants as well."

The latter have large volume, Cheeger constant bounded below and have strongly irreducible minimal genus Heegaard splittings.  The PI also plans to study smooth Schoenflies 4-balls. <br/><br/><br/>Three-manifold topology is the study of objects that locally look like the standard three-dimensional space in which we live.  Two-manifold topology is the study of surfaces such as the sphere, torus and the surface of higher genus.  While objects such as surfaces and standard 3-space are very simple, the class of objects that exist in them is incredibly rich and fascinating.  For example, there is knot theory in 3-space and the theory of curves and laminations in surfaces.  These theories in turn are fundamentally connected with many other mathematical structures such as non Euclidean geometry.  This proposal addresses basic mathematical questions in these areas.  A classical fundamental theorem in topology is that any smooth closed curve in the plane, such as the circle, bounds a smooth disc.  In fact such a theorem is true in dimension three and unknown in dimension four.  The PI plans to investigate this very mysterious question at the heart of smooth 4-dimensional topology."

The first project, gauged<br/>mirror symmetry, combines group actions on projective manifolds,<br/>equivariant K-theory and ideas from category theory (open-closed<br/>TQFTs and a conjectural Brauer group of equivariant K-theory).<br/>One application would be the determination of Gromov-Witten<br/>theory of GIT quotients from the gauged Fukaya category of a<br/>symplectic manifold. A concrete description of gauged topological<br/>quantum field theories in two dimensions is proposed, based on<br/>recent progress by Kontsevich, Costello, Hopkins and Lurie on<br/>'extended' topological field theories. The PI has a concrete<br/>proposal for coupling a 2-dimensional TQFT to a compact symmetry<br/>group and quantizing the gauged theory.  This combines ideas from<br/>physics (Landau-Ginzburg super-potentials) with earlier work by<br/>the PI and collaborators on equivariant (twisted) K-theory and<br/>the general index formula on moduli of principal bundles over<br/>Riemann surfaces. The second project explores the 'higher<br/>algebras' introduced by the PI and collaborators as simplified<br/>models of higher categories, and the a toy example of a<br/>homotopical TQFT for finite homotopy types. This is hoped to be a<br/>good working ground for the interaction of exotic homology<br/>theories with ideas from QFT. A third, closely related project is<br/>the construction of Chern-Simons gauge theory as a 0-1-2-3 theory<br/>by topological methods, along the lines already accomplished by<br/>the PI and collaborators for torus groups.<br/><br/>To explain the context of this research, one must recall that the<br/>fundamental interactions governing energy and matter in the<br/>universe are believed to be governed by quantum field theory, a<br/>sophisticated mathematical framework that has evolved from the<br/>beginnings of quantum mechanics over the last century.  Quantum<br/>field theory has never been reconciled with general relativity --<br/>another well-supported physical theory -- and much mathematical<br/>research over the last six decades has centered around<br/>reconciling the two. Topological quantum field theory is a toy<br/>attempt to come to grips with the problem while avoiding the<br/>analytical difficulties: the notions of distance and magnitude<br/>(for instance, mass) are abandoned, and the geometry of<br/>space-time is directly related to the algebraic structure of the<br/>quantum field theory. Substantial progress in understanding the<br/>algebraic structure has been made over the last decade thanks to<br/>work by Kontsevich, Hopkins and Lurie. The PI's projects revolve<br/>around integrating these recent developments with the idea of<br/>symmetry -- in the form of gauge theory -- which is known to be<br/>indispensable in realistic physical theories.

Recent advances of Bourgeois-Ekholm-Eliashberg and the author yield powerful computational tools, which we intend to exploit in order to study non-uniqueness questions for symplectic structures on open manifolds. On the mirror symmetry side, we consider decompositions of symplectic manifolds into pairs-of-pants, in the sense of Mikhalkin. One question under consideration is whether the Fukaya category can be reconstructed by gluing together pieces corresponding to each pair-of-pants. In general, this is not true and has to be modified by instanton contributions. However, there are cases where such contributions should be absent, and this would give a new viewpoint on Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture.<br/><br/>From a broader perspective, a crucial issue in many current investigations in physics and mathematics is the emergence of the classical notion of space from a quantum description. In the situation under study here, the main feature is that the construction of the classical space involves a series of gradual distortions, which can be determined by complicated but explicit formulae. This is a simplified mathematical model of a general class of physical theories, and not realistic as such. However, studying such models shows us where we are facing conceptual difficulties, which is important in order to develop our understanding further."

The goal of this conference is to bring together<br/>mathematicians working on different aspects of negatively curved<br/>spaces. It will bring together three distinct communities of<br/>mathematicians: geometers, topologists, and dynamicists. It will<br/>provide a forum for sharing the most recent developments in the<br/>study of spaces of negative (and more generally, non-positive)<br/>curvature. A selection of topics that will be touched upon in the<br/>conference include: (1) Gromov hyperbolic groups, CAT(0)-groups,<br/>and geometric group theory, (2) spaces of metrics (Teichmuller<br/>space, moduli space, representation varieties), (3) links with<br/>3-dimensional topology (Geometrization conjecture, mapping class<br/>groups), (4) links with high-dimensional topology (Novikov<br/>conjecture, Borel conjecture), (5) analysis on boundaries of<br/>groups and spaces, (6) Anosov flows and dynamics, (7) flows on<br/>homogeneous spaces and applications to number theory. We expect<br/>the conference to provide a ""snapshot"" of the current state of<br/>our knowledge in matters related to nonpositively curved spaces,<br/>as well as to provide a roadmap for future research in this<br/>interdisciplinary field.<br/><br/>Curvature is a fundamental notion in geometry. Zero curvature is<br/>the most physically familiar, and corresponds to an ordinary flat<br/>surface. Positive and negative curvature can be described<br/>relative to the familiar zero curvature setting as follows: one<br/>tries to ""flatten"" the surface near a point, and looks to see if<br/>there is too little or too much fabric to achieve the<br/>flattening. For instance, the surface of a cone or of a cylinder<br/>can be unfolded to lie flat, so these also have zero curvature.<br/>But if one tries to flatten the surface of a sphere (think of the<br/>skin of an orange), there is not enough fabric to do this<br/>(i.e. the skin of the orange splits), which corresponds to<br/>positive curvature. Alternatively, if one tries to flatten a<br/>saddle shaped surface, folds appear. There is too much fabric,<br/>which corresponds to negative curvature. A space of nonpositive<br/>curvature can now be described as one having the property that,<br/>near every point and for every pair of directions, it looks<br/>either flat or like a saddle shaped surface. Surprisingly, such<br/>spaces are much more prevalent than one would initially<br/>guess. Aside from the field of geometry, they naturally appear in<br/>numerous other fields of mathematics: topology, dynamics, number<br/>theory, representation theory, etc. Aspects of nonpositive<br/>curvature have also made an increasing appearance in more applied<br/>fields, wherever there has been an interest in understanding the<br/>""shape"" of objects (special relativity theory, crystalline<br/>structures in organic chemistry, configuration spaces in<br/>robotics, etc). This conference will bring together international<br/>experts working on various aspects of nonpositively curved<br/>spaces.  The conference web site is http://www.icts.res.in/program/gtdnc."

Specifically, the PI will first give a much simplified <br/>description of the p-local finite group model for the homotopy theory of <br/>fusion systems.  This shows that a p-local finite group on a finite <br/>p-group is equivalent to map from the classifying space into a p-complete, <br/>nilpotent space with a stable retract satisfying Frobenius reciprocity up <br/>to homotopy.  In recent work, joint with Radu Stancu, the PI has shown <br/>that saturated fusion systems on a finite p-group are in bijective <br/>correspondence with stable idempotents of the classifying space that <br/>satisfy Frobenius reciprocity.  The PI will extend this result to a <br/>bijection between p-local finite groups and idempotents that satisfy <br/>Frobenius reciprocity up to structured homotopies.  The crucial question <br/>in the field is on the existence and uniqueness of classifying spaces for <br/>saturated fusion systems (in the form of p-local finite groups).  Using <br/>results from this project, the question can be approached by refining the <br/>current construction of classifying spectra from being a construction up <br/>to homotopy to producing structured classifying spectra, and steps will be <br/>taken in this direction.<br/><br/>Groups are fundamental objects in mathematics used to keep track of the <br/>symmetries of an object (e.g. a set or a space).  A group is said to act <br/>on an object if that object exhibits the symmetries encoded by the group. <br/>Among such objects the classifying space of a group is of special <br/>importance, as its homotopical properties contain information about all <br/>possible actions of the group on topological spaces.  A finite group can <br/>be characterized as the fundamental group of its classifying space --the <br/>set of paths in the space beginning and ending in a fixed point where two <br/>paths are identified if one can be continuously deformed into the other. <br/>For a given prime p, the p-local structure of a group can be thought of as <br/>the system of symmetries of the group that can be detected by actions on <br/>sets whose cardinality is a power of p.  This notion is made precise by <br/>fusion systems as introduced by Puig and developed by Broto-Levi-Oliver. <br/>As conjectured by Martino-Priddy, and proved by Oliver, p-localizing the <br/>classifying space mirrors this construction in topology.  More generally <br/>one can consider abstract fusion systems that do not necessarily come from <br/>groups and p-local finite groups are a model for the corresponding <br/>classifying space suggested by Broto-Levi-Oliver.  In this project the PI <br/>will elucidate this correspondence by providing a simpler model for <br/>classifying spaces of abstract fusion systems and take important steps <br/>toward proving the existence of classifying spaces for arbitrary fusion <br/>systems which is a fundamental question in the field."

He will develop and compute Hopf ring structures on cohomology, representation theory and suitable invariants of series of groups.  He will unify integrals from Chern-Simons with the Lie coalgebraic model of homotopy theory to develop complete rational homotopy invariants of maps.  He will generalize the Magnus expansion and use that to model non-simply connected spaces.<br/><br/>Topology is a fundamental study of shape, and thus has its roots in geometry.  As a subject it has roughly split into point-set topology which considers foundational questions, geometric topology which studies particular shapes such as that of our universe, and algebraic topology which ultimately relates shape to numerical data.  It is not typical for researchers to bridge thees communities.  In his previously funded research, the PI applied methods from algebraic topology to knot theory, which is squarely in the geometric realm.  In this proposal, the PI is using insight from the geometric study of configuration spaces (collections of particles) to better understand algebraic structures such as symmetric groups and symmetric functions.  He also plans to connect algebraic topology with Chern-Simons theory from mathematical physics, and to develop a theory of ""linking of letters"" to answer basic questions in group theory."

The first project seeks characterizations of Hodge-theoretic invariants of complex algebraic varieties, with an emphasis on computational aspects. Potential applications include a new explicit solution  to the lattice point counting problem, and  a Novikov-type conjecture in algebraic geometry. In the second project,  the PI proposes a detailed study of certain global analytic invariants of complex hypersurfaces which measure the complexity of singularities. A connection with the Donaldson-Thomas theory of certain Calabi-Yau trifolds is also suggested.  In the third project, the PI aims to develop equivariant characteristic class theories for singular complex algebraic varieties, with primary applications to the computation of characteristic classes of orbifolds. In particular, the results sought in this part of the proposal can be used to compute generating series for characteristic classes of symmetric products of singular varieties, generalizing and unifying many of the existing results in the literature. In a different but related vein, the PI plans to develop suitable characteristic class theories for complex varieties which are defined over the field of real numbers; such invariants encode deep topological and analytical obstructions on the set of real points of a complex variety, i.e., on the existence of real solutions of a system of polynomial equations with real coefficients.<br/><br/>Topology is the branch of mathematics that studies patterns of geometric figures involving position and relative position without regard to size.  From the very beginning, topology has evolved under the influence of questions arising from the attempt to understand properties of ""singular"" (or irregular) spaces. Such spaces occur naturally in various fields of pure mathematics including  geometric topology, algebraic geometry, number theory, and also in more applied fields, such as the study of configuration spaces for robot motion planning. Algebraic varieties, i.e., the spaces of solutions of polynomial equations, are major examples of singular spaces. They are the main objects of study in algebraic geometry, and also provide a convenient testing ground for topological theories.  The proposed research aims to improve our understanding of topological properties of  algebraic varieties, a task which often involves the discovery and study of subtle interactions between the local and global behavior of various invariants."

The project comprises three main parts.  There is a well-known dictionary for translating results for the special linear group over the integers into conjectures for the mapping class group. In the first part of the project the Principal Investigator aims to further this connection by studying homological questions surrounding an important object associated to the mapping class group called the curve complex which is analogous to the Tits building for the special linear group.  An important subgroup of the mapping class group is the Torelli group which one may view as the difference between the mapping class group and arithmetic groups such as the special linear group. The second part of the project aims to reprove Johnson's finite generation of the Torelli group from a geometric perspective.  The Principal Investigator sees this as a step towards a possible finite presentation for the Torelli group. The third part of the project looks at the geometry of various finitely generated normal subgroups of the Torelli group.<br/><br/>Two-dimensional surfaces are fundamental mathematical objects that appear throughout mathematics, physics, and other sciences.  In mathematics surface symmetries are a key ingredient in the construction and understanding of three-dimensional objects.  In string theory, a branch of theoretical physics, surfaces arise as paths of strings in space-time called ""worldsheets."" Surface symmetries have even arisen in the work of Jack Cowan (University of Chicago) on understanding how images are processed by the visual cortex in the human brain.  Symmetries of surfaces have been studied mathematically since at least the time of Euclid's Elements, but their modern study has developed rapidly over the past century.  The Principle Investigator proposes a study of symmetries of surfaces from three points of view. Firstly, the Principal Investigator intends to further a well-known analogy between symmetries of surfaces and symmetries of multidimensional grids (the latter having a well-developed theory of their own).  In the second and third parts of the project the Principal Investigator intends to investigate a particularly mysterious collection of surface symmetries called the Torelli group which one may view as the difference between symmetries of surfaces and symmetries of multidimensional grids."

The second family of projects concerns the Picard groups of finite covers of the moduli space of curves.

These invariants can be extended to functors from the category of tangles to categories of quantum group representations. The invariant of a tangle is a homomorphism of representations. Link homology lifts quantum invariants one dimension up and can be viewed as functors from the category of link cobordisms to the category of multi-graded abelian groups. The invariant of a tangle becomes a functor between triangulated categories assigned to the boundaries of the tangle. Categorification leads to invariants of tangle cobordisms which take values in natural transformations between these functors. The categories that appear in this way categorify tensor products of quantum group representations and appear thoughout representation theory, symplectic topology, and algebraic geometry. The proposal aims to further elucidate the structure of link homology, discover new cohomological operations in them, further tie them up with Hochschild homology, generalize the Rassmussen invariant, and relate link homology with the categorification of quantum groups. Categorification of quantum groups, discovered less that two years ago, realizes them as Grothendieck groups of categories of projective modules over certain diagrammatically defined rings, which also appear throughout representation theory. The PI believes that categorified quantum groups will prove ubiquitous in several areas of mathematics and will continue studying them for the next few years.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mathematicians discovered in the past 30 years deep relations between the theory of knots and 3-manifolds (objects that locally look like our space but have a different global behaviour) and a plethora of sophisticated structures in algebra and geometry. Many of these structures have to do with the elucidation of the notion of symmetry. All symmetries of a given mathematical or physical object constitute what is known as a group - a collection of symmetries that can be composed and reversed. Various developments in the past decades led to a far-fetched generalizations of the notion of a group, including the discovery of quantum groups by Drinfeld and Jimbo. More recent further progress in the direction, in which the PI was involved, resulted in the discovery of so-called categorified quantum groups, which are even more sophisticated objects, from which quantum groups can be recovered by forgetting most of the information. These categorified quantum groups are expected to be intimately related to the topology in four dimensions. Four-dimensional topology studies objects that locally look like our space plus the time direction, but may have complicated global structure. This line of research is expected to further tie together many areas of mathematics, including representation theory, homological algebra, topology and geometry."

The PI and his collaborators will study such representations and extend several results previously only known for SL(2,C). In particular, we will give a concrete formula for the complex volume. The new idea is that a parabolic representation has a fundamental class in Neumann's extended Bloch group. By a result of the PI, the extended Bloch group can be defined over a number field, and is isomorphic to an algebraic K-group. This may shed new light on the role of the complex volume in number theory.<br/><br/><br/>The volume and Chern-Simons invariant are interesting and important invariants that appear in a wide range of areas of mathematics including mathematical physics, hyperbolic geometry and number theory. The proposal introduces new techniques for computing these invariants via an object known as the extended Bloch group.

The relationship with K-theory may lead to an improved understanding of the role of the volume and Chern-Simons invariant in number theory, which has so far been completely mysterious."

These include the behavior of the spectral theory and homology of covering spaces, the structure of commensurators, the arithmetic of trace fields, the deformations and limits of real projective structures, and the role of similarity interval exchange maps in geometrically infinite surface groups. The unifying theme is the tying together of the many disparate aspects of hyperbolic manifolds in both low and higher dimensions.  For while Perelman's work has drawn together the topological and geometric, our understanding of this geometry still has a long way to go.  Progress in the directions proposed in this project would add significantly to this understanding.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A space is called a 3-manifold if it is made of small chunks all of which are ``like'' the ordinary 3-dimensional space that we live in. Mathematicians understand how to interpret ""like"" very precisely and there are two very different notions which are of great importance in this setting: ""topologically-like"" and ""geometrically-like"".  The recent work of Perelmann has verified a long-standing conjecture which emerged in the seventies with the work of Thurston, namely that the topological and geometrical pictures are intimately related.  This is an important piece of global understanding.  Amongst geometrical manifolds, by far the most important are the class called hyperbolic manifolds.  This class is ubiquitous in many areas of mathematics, ranging from low-dimensional topology, to dynamical systems, to number theory.  Indeed, this class is also crucially important in physics.  However, even with Perlemann's work, hyperbolic manifolds themselves are still fairly poorly understood, although their importance have made them a magnet for research for well over thirty years.  This proposal directs itself towards aspects of the structural study of hyperbolic manifolds and many issues related to them. For example, he intends to continue work on a famous old conjecture about which sorts of two-dimensional objects can live inside these 3-dimensional objects."

Shape is crucial to  the design of antiviral drugs, the study of networks, search algorithms, satellite recognition of objects, the medical imaging and modeling of human organs and in the function of cellular DNA. Even though all common objects are 3-dimensional in nature, such shapes can be quite complicated. For example, the shape of a large molecule, such as a protein is quite complex, and mostly unknown, despite the fact that such knowledge is vital to the creation of antiviral drugs. How can an imaging device distinguish a tank from a house given only partial data? How can one usefully quantify the shape of a human brain given that all brains are different? The scientific study of shape requires mathematical ideas that can accurately quantify the complex non-linear behavior of such objects. Noncommutative algebra, such as in matrices where AB is not necessarily equal to BA, is necessary to model simple real-life situations. This project will develop new tools in noncommutative mathematics and apply these to specific problems concerning the shape of 3-dimensional objects."

The focus has been on the behavior of surfaces contained in the 3-manifolds, but with a modern viewpoint:  Add ideas from graph theory to old-fashioned combinatorial arguments on surface intersections; add sutured manifold theory to the classical notion of  hierarchies on 3-manifolds (so parameterizing surfaces and estimates of the Thurston norm help control and understand the topology); and add thin position to the classic tools of Morse theory, so handles of the critical index are added not all at once, but as slowly as possible.  <br/>Recently Scharlemann has applied these and similar new tools towards resolving questions in the topology of 4-manifolds, most prominently the Schoenflies Conjecture, but also long-standing questions about the connection between classical links, their possible slicings in the 4-ball, and how surgery can affect both. For example, recent work with Abby Thompson and Bob Gompf uses sutured manifold and Heegaard theory to search for the easiest possible counterexample to the Generalized Property R Conjecture.  We show that there is a 2-component likely counterexample containing a square knot (or, maybe seen as easier, a genus 1 knot, so far undetermined) as a component.   These and other results may be the first steps towards a useful application of 3-manifold ideas to those intriguing topological questions which are sometimes called 3 + 1-dimensional because they ask how 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds are interrelated. <br/><br/><br/>One of the most basic observations about the world around us is that it has three dimensions.  The broad intent of this proposal is to help us better understand spaces with precisely this property: anyone living in one would see their world as of this sort, namely 3-dimensional.  Beyond modeling the universe around us, these spaces, called ""3-manifolds"", support interesting phenomena such as knotting, in which a simple object like a garden-hose (or a string of DNA, or, more generally, a chemical molecule) can lie in space in a complicated way.  These 3-manifolds also lie on the edge of spaces with additional deep physical significance, those that locally appear to be 4-dimensional spaces (such as physicists often refer to as space-time).  Our emerging understanding of 3-dimensional manifolds can also help us understand long-standing questions about these 4-dimensional manifolds.   The particular emphasis in this proposal is on questions that sit on the edge between 3- and 4-dimensional manifold theory and incorporate knotting phenomena from both.  The dimensions are interesting in part because they model the universe in which we live; knotting within them is a tool to deepen our understanding of how such spaces relate.<br/>"

The motivating examples include the group GL(n,Z) acting on the deformation space of flat n-tori and the group Out(Fn) acting on the deformation space of compact metric graphs with fundamental group Fn. The project has four main components, which take off from these basic examples in various directions. The first component, joint with Martin Bridson, studies rigidity properties of  Out(Fn) which limit the possibilities for maps between Out(Fn) and Out(Fm) and constrain the possible actions of Out(Fn) on spheres, contractible manifolds and CAT(0) spaces. The second component, joint with Ruth Charney, targets automorphism groups of  right-angled Artin groups. In recent work Charney and the PI have shown that many properties shared by Out(Fn) and GL(n,Z) are in fact shared by the outer automorphism groups of all right-angled Artin groups. The tools used have been largely algebraic, but this project will develop new geometric tools using CAT(0) geometry.   The third component, joint with John Smillie, considers deformation spaces of flat surfaces of arbitrary genus. The proposal is to define a bordification of the space of marked translation surfaces with a fixed number of singular points which descends to a compactification of the moduli space of such translation surfaces. This is motivated by analogous bordifications of spaces for SL(n, Z) and Out(Fn) and combines ideas from both, and should be useful in studying cohomological properties of these groups.  The fourth part of the project, joint with Jim Conant and Martin Kassabov,   returns to Out(Fn) and investigates the rational cohomology of Out(Fn) via the connection found by Kontsevich between this cohomology and the cohomology of a certain Lie algebra associated to the Lie operad.<br/><br/>A powerful tool in mathematics is to encode the structure of a geometric object in an algebraic form.  One can then use algebraic ideas to study the geometric object, or geometric ideas to study the algebraic object.   This proposal uses a bootstrap of this idea to the next level:  one can relate the group of {\it transformations}, or {\it automorphisms} of an algebraic object to the space of {\it deformations} of an associated geometric object.   The underlying algebraic objects are quite simple:  they are free groups, free abelian groups and right-angled Artin groups, but their automorphism groups are remarkably complex and still poorly understood.  Similarly, the associated algebraic objects (trees, Euclidean spaces and CAT(0) spaces) are uncomplicated but their deformation spaces exhibit complex  behavior, which has implications in many areas of pure and applied mathematics.   The project will employ   topological and geometric tools to understand these deformation spaces and translate the information obtained into new information about automorphism groups."

Lorenz is one of the organizers of the workshop while Le is one of the principal lecturers. The training school is primarily aimed at graduate students and young researchers. A series of six mini-courses by some of the world's leading experts will cover topics ranging from an introduction to the theory of braid groups to some current research in knot theory, quantum groups, and hyperplane arrangements, three thriving branches of mathematics where braid groups play an essential role. Immediately following the training school, there will be a 3-day workshop for specialists that will be devoted to a discussion of recent advances and <br/>perspectives for future developments.<br/><br/>Braids, originally introduced in the context of low-dimensional topology, have since developed into a theme that permeates large parts of mathematics and mathematical physics, thereby providing a link between many different areas of current research. The Institute of Mathematics at the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology in Hanoi is the center of mathematical research in Vietnam; it has a strong tradition of research in several areas of algebra, geometry, and topology that are closely tied to braid groups. The training school in Hanoi will introduce participating students to some important new developments in a broad range of mathematical subjects, focusing on the unifying role of braid group.  In adopting this approach, the organizers aim to present a panoramic view of current research in mathematics and counteract a trend towards specialization and exclusive focus on one narrow topic. In addition, the organizers expect that the school and its accompanying workshop will boost interdisciplinary research as well as help promoting exchanges and <br/>collaborations between mathematicians in the region of Southeast Asia and <br/>experts from Europe and the United States."

The method of study is to develop an analogue of the hierarchy theory of Masur and Minsky used to study MCG(S), the mapping class group of a surface S. Based on his recent discoveries with Handel of distortion and nondistortion of various natural subgroups of Out(F_n), the PI is currently focussed on using free splittings of the free group F_n as a natural analogue of essential curve systems on surfaces, and on the ""refinement complex"" of a free splitting as a natural analogue (at least in certain cases) for the curve complex of a subsurface. In particular, the PI is studying how to use projection maps defined on the spine of X_n, whose targets are refinement complexes and closely related objects. Using these projection maps, the central focus of the PI's research at the moment is to formulate an appropriate analogue for Out(F_n) of the Masur--Minsky sum, a very useful formula for the word metric in MCG(S).  Potential mathematical applications include an improved understanding of the computational complexity of the conjugacy problem for Out(F_n). The PI also continues to work on a longer term joint project with Handel on subgroup classification theory for Out(F_n). In a separate project (joint with Jason Behrstock of Lehman College, CUNY) the PI works on applying hierarchy theory for MCG(S) to obtain a precise understanding of the computational complexity of the conjugacy problem for MCG(S).<br/><br/>Geometric group theory is the study of symmetry groups of geometric objects. In some cases the geometric object was understood long before its symmetry group, for instance the flat plane was known in antiquity, but its symmetries --- its rigid motions --- were fully understood only in the 19th century. In other cases, the abstract group was known before the discovery of a geometry with that symmetry group.  The Principal Investigator studies an abstract group called the ""outer automorphism group of a free group of rank n"", denoted Out(F_n), which was discovered in the first half of the 20th century. Its associated geometric object, the ""outer space of rank n"" denoted X_n, was discovered only in the 1980's by the mathematicians Marc Culler and Karen Vogtmann. The space X_n, a key object for understanding finite networks, may be regarded as a single package encompassing a complicated array of networks known as ""marked graphs"" that can be obtained by distorting one very simple network, the ""mathematician's rose"", a collection of n loops conjoined at a single point. Following a broad research program for geometric group theory that was laid out in the late 1970's by the mathematician Michael Gromov, the PI's study of Out(F_n) is closely intertwined with a study of the asymptotic behavior of X_n, meaning its behaviour very very far away from a fixed point of view. The PI's asymptotic analysis of Out(F_n) and X_n involves comparing efficient versus inefficient distortions of marked graphs. The central focus of the PI's research at the moment is to discover a general formula for measuring efficient distortion of marked graphs."

The principal investigators Futer and Purcell will study several aspects of this question. The first goal of this project is to use the combinatorial complexes associated a surface to give explicit estimates on the geometry of a fibered hyperbolic 3-manifold. A second, closely related, goal is to use braid presentations of a generic knot or link in order to give explicit, diagrammatic estimates on the volume of its complement. Third, the PIs will continue their joint project with Kalfagianni to relate the geometric topology of knot and link complements to quantum invariants such as the colored Jones polynomials. Finally, the investigators will continue their joint work with Cooper to understand the geometric properties of unknotting tunnels. <br/><br/>A 3-manifold is a space where an object such as a helicopter can move around in three distinct perpendicular directions. The universe that we inhabit is a 3-manifold whose global geometry we do not yet understand. Another rich source of examples comes from the spaces that surround different knots. Powerful theorems of Thurston, Perelman, and Mostow imply that almost every knot complement, and more generally almost every 3-manifold, has a unique hyperbolic metric. That is, there is a standard way to measure the space, so that every 2-dimensional cross-section curves like a saddle. At the moment, while we know that this standard hyperbolic metric exists, very little is known about how to relate it to easily computable quantities such as the complexity of a knot diagram. The main goal of this project is to make these relations much more concrete. One important feature of this project is that the geometric problems studied by the PIs are very visual and hands-on, with natural spin-offs into both software applications and projects for students."

This summer school will focus on the interface between algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, in particular on moduli spaces. We will bring thirty graduate students and early-career mathematicians together for an introduction to an area which is ripe for investigation, and whose techniques will inform and inspire developments throughout topology. Among other topics, students will learn about mapping class groups, stability theorems, operad actions and other loopspace machinery, cobordism spectra, singularity theory, cobordism categories, and topological  field theories. Calculations will be emphasized whenever they are relevant. This summer school will use a unique blend of pedagogical tools, combining elements which have been successful in other settings. Younger researchers will be involved with both organizing and giving talks. Attendees will be encouraged to work problems, fill in background, and do reading together in addition to attending lectures. A full effort will be made to recruit a broad and diverse group of participants.<br/><br/>The west coast topology summer school will significantly strengthen the knowledge base of topologists and others who use topology. In its role as a basic study of shape, topology has significant ramifications in other areas of mathematics, from basic counting problems (combinatorics) to solutions of equations (algebra) to applications and extensions of the calculus (analysis). More broadly, knowledge of topology is essential for example in studying the structure of the early universe, in designing a robot arm with a minimal number of controllers, and in searching large data sets for meaningful groupings as successfully done recently for study of breast cancer. The summer school will be structured to highlight ramifications in geometry and algebra, and thus strengthen the ties between basic areas of theoretical mathematics. Mathematicians from underrepresented backgrounds will be vigorously recruited. Graduate students and post-docs will gain hands-on experience with some of the most important developments of contemporary mathematics, preparing them to be future leaders of the field.  Participants will enlarge their professional networks, which is especially critical given the geographical distances faced by mathematicians in the western half of North America. Organizers and participants will also have the opportunity to reflect upon the array of pedagogical tools employed, and might employ some themselves in training graduate students and undergraduates or reaching out to fellow scientists and the general public."
