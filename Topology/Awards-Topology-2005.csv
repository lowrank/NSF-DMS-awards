Friedman, Peter S. Ozsvath<br/><br/>This is a proposal for a four-day-long, broad conference at<br/>Columbia University on ""Topology, Geometry, and Physics.'' The<br/>conference will focus on the following major themes, and their<br/>interconnections: hyperbolic manifolds and geometrization gauge<br/>theory, three- and four-manifolds, Hodge theory, and interactions<br/>between mathematics and modern physics. Such a conference is<br/>particularly timely, in view of the many breakthroughs in each of<br/>these subjects. In particular, the recent spectacular work of<br/>Perelman on the Poincare conjecture and Thurston's geometrization<br/>conjecture, as well as new developments in hyperbolic geometry,<br/>make this an especially opportune moment to survey the new<br/>landscape of three-manifold theory. At the same time, new<br/>techniques of gauge theory and new combinatorial methods have<br/>deepened the current understanding of three- and four-manifolds<br/>and it is time to take stock of these developments and their<br/>relation to other work in the field. Many of the new results in<br/>geometric topology have been based upon ideas arising in<br/>mathematical physics and geometric analysis, and these kind of<br/>interactions will serve as a unifying theme for the conference.<br/><br/>A fundamental problem in mathematics is to describe all possible<br/>shapes. In the case of surfaces (two dimensional objects),<br/>possible shapes include a sphere (the surface of the earth, for<br/>example), a torus (the surface of a tire) and more complicated<br/>generalizations. A great deal of research has been concerned with<br/>dimension three, the dimension of space, and dimension four, the<br/>dimension of space-time.  Because of its relevance to<br/>understanding our physical world, understanding all possible<br/>shapes in these dimensions is particularly<br/>important. Paradoxically, these cases are much harder to<br/>understand and to classify than higher-dimensional objects (which<br/>in turn are much harder to visualize in any meaningful way). The<br/>study of dimensions three and four has drawn on a rich variety of<br/>mathematical and physical ideas. Recent work of a Russian<br/>mathematician, G.  Perelman, seems to confirm one of the famous<br/>outstanding conjectures of topology, the Poincare conjecture<br/>(which gives a complete characterization of the three dimensional<br/>analogue of a sphere), as well as a profound generalization of<br/>this conjecture, the geometrization conjecture of Thurston, which<br/>gives in principle a scheme whereby one could describe all<br/>possible three-dimensional shapes.

The ideas he is exploring will combine tools from<br/>gauge theory, representation theory, homological algebra, and<br/>three-manifold topology. This entails work on several<br/>problems. With Kania-Bartoszynksa he will define a quantum<br/>invariant of three-manifolds which will be a real analytic<br/>function on the open interval (-1,1). The invariant will be<br/>obtained by heat kernel regularization of the divergent formula<br/>for the Turaev-Viro invariant.

Using ideas<br/>from matrix models he will develop an analogous invariant based<br/>on the SL(2,C)-character variety of the three-manifold.  With his<br/>students he will continue to study the connection between the<br/>A-polynomial and quantum invariants, and explore the knot and<br/>link homology theories of Khovanov and Khovanov-Rozansky. With<br/>Oliver Dasbach and Marta Asaeda he is looking at homology<br/>theories underlying the Alexander polynomial. Finally, given a<br/>three-manifold and a Heegaard splitting there is an algebra which<br/>is the Kauffman bracket skein module of the Heegaard surface and<br/>a bimodule over that algebra built from the skein modules of the<br/>two handle-bodies. With Mike McLendon, he will study whether this<br/>homology is a three-manifold invariant, and if it is, what its<br/>relation to Khovanov homology is.<br/><br/>The rational understanding of the path integrals of Richard<br/>Feynman stand as one of the major unresolved problems of<br/>mathematics. Using his integrals Feynman was able to make<br/>computations in quantum electrodynamics that far exceeded<br/>previous work. The tools he developed allowed the construction of<br/>modern integrated circuits. The rules that physicists use for<br/>computing path integrals have never been made completely<br/>rigorous.  The major thrust of Frohman's work in recent years has<br/>been about these integrals in a simplified setting where things<br/>can actually be computed. Specifically, the Yang-Mills measure in<br/>the Kauffman bracket skein module assigns to a gauge field on the<br/>space of flat connections on a surface a number. The formula for<br/>the measure coincides with an asymptotic expansion that appears<br/>throughout the physical literature. However, in this situation it<br/>is actually a convergent series.  Frohman is using this formula,<br/>and the estimates he used to prove it converged, to pursue the<br/>analytic study of three-manifold invariants that were before only<br/>computable using algebraic and combinatorial methods.

Goodwillie and M. Weiss.  Recent results of Volic show that there is a strong connection between the two.  In fact, a certain tower of spaces arising from calculus of functors serves as a classifying object for finite type knot invariants, a fascinating class of invariants which has been found to connect in intricate ways to other areas of topology and geometry, as well as physics.  Other goals of the project concern more general spaces of knots and in particular the collapse of certain spectral sequences associated to these spaces.  This should give new information about homology and homotopy of spaces of knots, as well as new insight into appearance of interesting combinatorics in their study. A recent result due to P. Lambrechts and Volic concerning configuration spaces will serve as the starting point for this part of the project.  Since the construction of the calculus tower modeling the space of knots is quite general, another goal is to extract information about other spaces of embeddings.  In particular, G. Arone and Volic plan to use the interplay of two versions of calculus of the embedding functor, manifold and orthogonal, to show that the spectral sequences arising from these theories collapse.  This should also result in new insight into how these two versions of calculus interact.<br/><br/>Knots are some of the most interesting objects of study in topology both because they are easy to define and visualize and because they are of interest to physicists, chemists, etc. Some fundamental questions about knots, such as their classification, or construction of efficient ways of telling them apart (i.e. finding good knot invariants), still generate a wealth of exciting research.  One of the main objectives of this project is to further the understanding of knot theory by studying it through the new technique of calculus of functors.  It turns out, however, that the methods used are quite general and extend beyond knots to larger classes of topological spaces.  Thus the new connections between topology, geometry, combinatorics, and physics which are expected to arise from this project could have broad implications as well as bring together various schools of thought in topology in unexpected ways.<br/><br/>"

Some of the specific problems are: <br/>understanding their geometric meanings, studying their behavior under <br/>various cut and paste operations, constructing homology theories for <br/>various other polynomials of knots and graphs, and investigating <br/>relations with other invariants in low dimensional topology.<br/><br/>Low dimensional topology studies the shapes of three and four dimensional <br/>spaces. These dimensions are of particular interests to mankind because <br/>of the dimensions of our space and our space-time.  A specific subfield <br/>in low dimensional topology is knot theory, which studies the knottedness <br/>in our three dimensional space. Knots are worthwhile to study not only <br/>because they are fundamental in 3-dimensional spatial structure, but <br/>also because of its connection to areas outside mathematics. For example, <br/>biochemists have discovered knotted DNA molecule (1980s) and knotted <br/>proteins (2004). It is also intimately related to the study of graph <br/>theory, an area interesting to mathematicians, computer scientists, and <br/>others. Over the past two decades, there have been a flourish of new <br/>invariants in low dimensional topology, boosted by ideas from gauge theory, <br/>quantum algebras, and mathematical physics.  In particular, a new <br/>invariant for knots, developed by Khovanov using ideas in homological <br/>algebra, has sparked a great deal of interest recently.

The subject is rich in examples that demonstrate a wide variety of disparate phenomena. Yet it is precisely this richness which gives us little hope to even  conjecture a classification scheme. The most successful attempts have associated to each 4-dimensional manifold the solution space to complex systems of equations that arise in particle physics: the Yang-Mills equations and the monopole equations of Seiberg and Witten. These solution spaces are useful in distinguishing cunningly constructed 4-dimensional manifolds. This proposal assembles all known techniques in a manner that provides approachable questions that further explore  a potential classification scheme. The first goal is to understand why smooth structures on 4-manifolds are sensitive to local topological change. The second step is to assemble the local topology into new invariants that will distinguish those manifolds with the same Seiberg-Witten invariants already constructed by the principal investigator. The core of this project is to determine a sequence of operations that relate homeomorphic smooth 4-manifolds.<br/><br/>Excitement has been generated by the idea that the puniest of all  forces, gravity, may in fact be a strong as nature's other three fundamental forces: the strong force which binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei; the weak force which governs radioactive decay; and the forces that govern electricity and magnetism. The perceived mismatch between these three forces and gravity creates a theoretical nightmare; it's the principle reason we have yet to find a grand unified theory. However, it has recently been hypothesized that this weakness is a mirage; the force of gravity only appears weak because its force is diluted in our own universe and most of gravity's <br/>force radiates out into extra dimensions. All other forces remain trapped in our 3-dimensional world, while gravity is free to roam other dimensions. With this hypothesis, there could be other worlds that are parallel to our own; they all neatly stack up, each oblivious of the other, with gravity the only force that moves between them.  New mathematics will be generated in this project to further explore these ideas. Much of the relevant mathematics has already exposed the special nature of dimensions three and four. The passage from one universe to another could be explained by a local change known as a logarithmic transform on a null-homologous torus. This operation captures many of the features of worm holes. It is the purpose of  this project to explore the conjecture that any two homeomorphic smooth 4-manifolds are related by a sequence of such transformations. At bottom, the goal of this project is to develop more systematic constructions of smooth 4-dimensional manifolds with the hope that a general picture begins to emerge that will at least suggest a classification scheme."

Moreover, the deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds has been revealed to be more complicated than previously expected. Powerful new techniques have been introduced to the field, including model manifolds, the geometry of the curve complex, drilling theorems, and end reductions. Prof. Canary proposes to use the new techniques to improve our understanding of the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, to further illuminate the still mysterious deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and to explore new directions for research in the field.<br/><br/>Prof. Canary proposes to continue his study of the topology and geometry of 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds.  A 2-dimensional manifold or surface is a space which looks locally like 2-dimensional Euclidean space; examples are given by the surfaces of familiar 3-dimensional objects such as footballs or doughnuts.  Similarly, a 3-manifold is a space that looks locally like 3-dimensional Euclidean space. A Riemannian metric is a way of measuring distances and angles in a manifold.  For example, the universe we live in is a 3-manifold with a Riemannian metric. For this reason, among others, the study of 3-dimensional manifolds and their geometries is natural and important. It is conjectured that 3-dimensional manifolds can be canonically decomposed into pieces of one of 8 geometric types.  The hyperbolic manifolds are the most common and least understood class of such geometric manifolds. In recent years, much progress has been made in understanding such manifolds and Prof. Canary proposes to build on and deepen that understanding.<br/><br/>"

This problem asks whether<br/>the elementary theory of a non-abelian free group is independent of<br/>the free group in question.  Feighn proposes two projects in this<br/>direction, both joint with Mladen Bestvina. The first is a<br/>continuation of a project to simplify Sela's work. In the second,<br/>representing a new direction, a solution to a modified form of<br/>Tarski's problem is proposed. This will lead to new information about<br/>definable sets (objects of primary importance) and will answer<br/>questions of Rips and Sela. A third proposed project is to explore the<br/>extent to which the JSJ-decomposition of a group can be found<br/>algorithmically. The specific class of groups to be examined consists<br/>of graphs of free groups, which are of current interest on a number of<br/>fronts. With Guo-An Diao, the principal investigator has shown that<br/>the Grushko decomposition (a coarser decomposition than the JSJ) of<br/>these groups can be found algorithmically. There are two possible<br/>satisfactory resolutions, namely a construction of an algorithm to<br/>produce the JSJ-decomposition of a group in the class or a proof that<br/>this problem is unsolvable. For this class of groups, which exists on<br/>the boundary of what can be understood algorithmically, either<br/>resolution would be important.<br/><br/>Geometric group theory is a relatively young branch of mathematics<br/>that uses geometric methods to understand groups. The idea to take a<br/>problem in group theory, translate it into a problem in geometry, and<br/>then use geometric methods to solve the translated problem. The<br/>principal investigator proposes to use geometric methods to explore<br/>two general areas. The first is motivated by Zlil Sela's geometric<br/>solution to the Tarski problem which on the face of it is a problem in<br/>the intersection of group theory and logic. Roughly, the problem is to<br/>distinguish groups using the truth of statements formed using only the<br/>usual symbols of logic (""there exists"", ""for all"", variables, etc) and<br/>group operations. For example, you can tell if a group is abelian by<br/>asking whether it is true that, for all elements x and y, xy=yx.  The<br/>first proposed project, joint with Mladen Bestvina, is to simplify and<br/>extend Sela's ideas. This project is ongoing and there has already<br/>been significant progress. The second proposed project follows another<br/>trend in group theory that is encapsulated by the question: How much<br/>group theory can a computer understand? Much as molecules can be<br/>decomposed into simpler pieces (atoms), groups can be often be<br/>decomposed into simpler groups. The project is to understand such<br/>decompositions for a class of groups called ""graphs of free groups"", a<br/>class which has attracted much recent attention. It turns out that<br/>decomposing groups translates into the geometric process of cutting a<br/>space into simpler pieces. The goal is to use this geometric idea to<br/>discover an algorithm that, given a group, finds its decomposition.<br/>The principal investigator, with Guo-An Diao, has already constructed<br/>an algorithm for a related process that can readily be implemented on<br/>a computer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

These advances confirm much about our expected picture of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and their deformation spaces, and place the field in a moment of transition and opportunity.  the techniques introduced in the proofs have much potential for further applications.  Minsky will focus on deepening our understanding of the structure and deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifold, applying in particular the tools that have come out of his contribution to the solution of the Ending Lamination Conjecture. The models and estimates provided by these tools should provide an approach to a number of open questions, notably that of local connectivity of limit sets, geometric description of closed manifolds from the Heegaard decompositions, and uniformity theorems for deformation spaces (some of this work will be in collaboration with Brock, Bromberg and Canary). Another area of applications (jointly with Brock and Masur) involves the structure of geodesics in the Teichmuller space endowed with its Weil-Petersson metric. These have up till now resisted analysis but appear to be quite intimately connected to the geometry of 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>The interactions between geometry, topology and dynamics have been a beautiful and powerful feature of mathematics and physics for more than a hundred years. Dynamics is the study of time-evolution of mathematical or physical systems, whereas geometry and topology involve ""static"" objects such as surfaces or higher-dimensional analogues, often the background for a dynamical process.  Henri Poincare already knew that the standard round sphere, the setting of classical analysis and geometry, functioned also as a ""horizon at infinity"" for an exotic non-Euclidean geometry that we now call Hyperbolic space. Dynamical properties of transformations of the sphere translate to geometric properties of rigid motions of this space, and give rise to families of symmetric tilings whose structure we can study by geometric and topological methods.  The complexity of these systems can constrain them so much that a combinatorial (or topological) description suffices to determine them uniquely, and this is what we call rigidity. This phenomenon occurs in many guises throughout geometry and dynamics, and is relevant to issues such as classification of systems, mapping out regions of stability and instability, deformation and bifurcation of families of systems, and probabilistic properties such as ergodicity, all of which have<br/>significance in both pure and applied mathematics.  The particular aspects studied in this project are typical in some ways and special in others. They focus on the intricate relationships between geometry in two and three dimensions, and also on the ways in which topology, particularly of systems of curves within surfaces, determines geometry. There is also a strong emphasis on studying families of geometric structures  on surfaces and three-dimensional manifolds, which are closely analogous  to other families of dynamical systems."

However, to understand strings in<br/>spacetime, one needs to study not only the points in topological spaces,<br/>but loops in such spaces, which can be thought of as models for strings.<br/>The investigator studies the structures arising from the space of loops in<br/>topological spaces.

First, the study of topological spaces<br/>or structured spectra through algebraic invariants, such as homotopy or<br/>(co-)homology, can be studied from the global perspective on the<br/>algebraic side via a moduli space of structures. A fine invariant for<br/>studying such a moduli space is the cotangent complex associated to the<br/>given algebra. One part of this research, in joint work with Paul Goerss,<br/>will look to extend the study of Hopkins-Miller-Mahowald-Goerss on<br/>topological modular forms from, which realized Lubin-Tate algebras as<br/>E_\infinity ring spectra and calculated their endomorphisms, to more<br/>general Shimura varieties. In a similar vein, this research will<br/>seek to clarify, in joint work with David Blanc and Mark Johnson, how a<br/>variation of this cotangent complex controls the question of <br/>realizing a diagram of<br/>\Pi-algebras as a diagram of spaces, by looking for ways of connecting<br/>cohomological obstructions to things like Toda brackets.  Finally, this<br/>research will seek to extend Grothendieck's program for classifying smooth<br/>schemes to more general schemes in the setting of derived algebraic geometry.<br/>The driving mechanism will be to take the cotangent complex to be the proper<br/>analogue of the Kahler differentials and generalize accordingly. This would<br/>frame the approach of characterizing commutative algebras using the<br/>simplicial resolutions (as ultimately articulated by M. Andre and D. <br/>Quillen) in<br/>an algebraic geometric setting.<br/><br/>Throughout the history of string theory in theoretical physics, <br/>surprising connections<br/>have been made between several areas of pure mathematics - in <br/>particular, number<br/>theory and topology. One such connection has been made between the <br/>arithmetic of<br/>elliptic curves and modular forms, important in A. Wiles resolution <br/>of Fermat's Last<br/>Theorem, and cohomology theories in topology - the connection<br/>being relevant to string theory via the concept of elliptic genera. <br/> From the topologist's<br/>standpoint, some of the relevant properties being sought can be <br/>expressed in terms of<br/>whether the cohomology's associated spectrum possesses a suitable <br/>multiplicative structure.<br/>The question of realizing such structures can lead to questions <br/>regarding ways in which<br/>commutative algebras and homotopical structures in topology interact. <br/>The goal of this<br/>research is to further understand such interactions in two ways. The <br/>first is to collectively<br/>study all possible multiplicative structures on a spectrum with a <br/>prescribed algebraic data<br/>via the concept of a moduli space. The other approach utilizes a <br/>global geometric device,<br/>called a stack, to understand these multiplicative spectra <br/>collectively in the context of a<br/>more homotopical notion of algebraic geometry. The aim of this <br/>research will then focus<br/>on studying other possible multiplicative spectra associated to <br/>cohomology theories which arise<br/>from more general arithmetic forms, such as automorphic forms. <br/>Involved in this project<br/>is also the aim to characterize basic types of objects in this <br/>homotopical algebraic geometry<br/>and drawing connections to recent homological characterizations of algebras.<br/><br/>"

They encompass hyperbolic groups, the fundamental groups of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds, free products and limit groups (also known as `fully residually free groups'), and thus are directly related to combinatorial and geometric group theory, to hyperbolic geometry, to topology and to logic.  The purpose of this project is to examine some of the logical aspects of relatively hyperbolic groups.  The elementary theory of a group consists of those first order sentences which are true in the group.  This is an interesting and powerful invariant of a group, the study of which is still at an early stage.  This project will answer questions about the elementary theory of relatively hyperbolic groups, and also what can be said about a group with the same elementary theory as a relatively hyperbolic group.  This will lead to applications both to logic and also to geometric group theory.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Discrete groups arise as sets of symmetries of many geometric objects in mathematics.  For this reason, the study of discrete groups impacts on, and is impacted by, a wide variety of fields in mathematics.  The groups under consideration in this project are relatively hyperbolic groups, which arise naturally from within topology and hyperbolic geometry, as well as in combinatorial and geometric group theory and also in the study of the logic of groups.  Relatively hyperbolic groups form a bridge between `negatively curved groups' (called hyperbolic groups), which are well understood, and `non-positively curved groups', which have been much studied but in many ways remain a mystery.  The purpose of this project is to study relatively hyperbolic groups from the point of view of logic.  In particular, what can formal logical sentences tell us about a group? To consider only formal logical sentences is quite a restrictive limit to place upon ourselves, and leads to a natural invariant of a group, called the elementary theory of a group.  The elementary theory is the set of formal (first order) logical sentences which are true in a group.  It is a powerful invariant, and yet there are different groups with the same elementary theory.  This project will study the elementary theory of relatively hyperbolic groups and also investigate those groups with the same elementary theory as a relatively hyperbolic group.  The methods come partially from logic but also from geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The first is about questions in<br/>group theory motivated by the first order predicate calculus in<br/>logic. The questions involve e.g. understanding the sets of<br/>homomorphisms of a fixed group into a free group that extend to<br/>another fixed group. The second topic concerns the topology of moduli<br/>space of curves and of the Torelli subgroup of a mapping class<br/>group. The idea is to see if homology can be computed using a suitably<br/>chosen Morse function on the moduli space, and on the quotient of<br/>Teichmuller space by the Torelli group, respectively. The Morse<br/>function is geometrically defined -- it is the systole, i.e. the<br/>length of the shortest curve (or the homological version of this in<br/>the case of Torelli groups). The last topic is on the quasi-isometric<br/>rigidity of right-angled Artin groups. The subject has seen some<br/>great advances in the last 15 years or so, but this particular class<br/>of groups raises many issues not addressed before.<br/><br/>The subject of the proposal is the study of topological and geometric<br/>properties of several objects that naturally appear in<br/>mathematics. For example, consider the collection of all possible<br/>""shapes"" of a surface with a fixed number of holes. This collection<br/>forms a space, called moduli space of curves. The calculation of the<br/>""number of holes"" for this space has been recently completed by a<br/>topological tour de force. A different method for this calculation is<br/>proposed here, one that would also give additional<br/>information. To describe the method, consider the following<br/>analogy. When water is slowly poured into a<br/>normal glass, the surface of water in the glass will always be a<br/>disk. By contrast, if water is poured into a glass with a hollow<br/>handle, the surface of water will consist of two disks once water<br/>reaches the handle. Thus, by examining the shape of the surface of<br/>water we can tell if a glass has a handle or not. Topological spaces,<br/>such as moduli space of curves, can be analyzed similarly. A<br/>particular way of ""pouring water"" is proposed here.<br/><br/><br/>"

The conference will be held at the University of<br/>Michigan at Ann Arbor. The planned dates for the conference are May 6 <br/>to May 9, 2005.<br/>We expect 50 to 80 participants, about one third of whom will  be <br/>graduate students.Some talks will be tailored specifically for graduate students.<br/><br/>Several important recent developments that are likely to influence the<br/>future of 3-dimensional geometry and topology.<br/>1.  The work of Grisha Pereleman on the evolution of a metric on a <br/>3-dimensional manifold under the Ricci flow is still being absorbed and reviewed by the mathematical community. It is clear however that it has the potential to radically <br/>change the directions and techniques used in the study of 3-dimensional topology and related fields. The aim for this conference is not to focus on the details of Pereleman's methods but rather on their implications.  What other problems are amenable to study by Ricci flow techniques?  Which <br/>of the traditional theorems and results of 3-manifold theory become subsumed in <br/>geometrization? What questions become important if Pereleman's geometrization results hold <br/>up. What are the implications to related areas such as geometric group theory and the <br/>differential geometry of surfaces in 3-manifolds? Will the entire field of 3-manifolds <br/>become less important with this major problem solved, or will  go on to have even greater importance?<br/>2. What are the likely future developments in  Geometric Group Theory, and in<br/>Topological  Methods in Group Theory, areas largely based on ideas  from 3-manifold<br/>theory.  Stallings first, and more recently Rips and Sela  have shown that 3-manifolds<br/>are prototypes in many ways for general finitely presented groups.<br/>3. Ozsvath and Szabo have developed a theory of holomorphic curves associated<br/>to Heegaard decompositions of closed 3-manifolds, leading to what they call<br/>""Heegaard Floer homology"". What impact will this have in understanding 3-manifolds<br/>and to other areas? Related to this  is the work of Khovanov  and Rasmussen defining<br/>and applying a Jones polynomial homology.<br/>4.

Thus Kronheimer and Mrowka<br/>give a proof of Property P   (also implied by geometrization). What further<br/>impact on 3-manifold theory are such techniques likely to have?<br/>5. Many invariants of knots and 3-manifolds have been developed over <br/>the last two decades, including knot polynomials, finite type invariants etc. How useful <br/>are these in understanding 3-manifolds? What ties do they have to geometric properties of <br/>manifolds such as hyperbolic volume?<br/>6.

For example, mapping class groups are closely related to arithmetic groups (e.g., SL(n,Z)), automorphism groups of a free group, and Artin groups (e.g., braid groups), making Mod(S) valuable both as a venue for applications of, and as an inspiration for, more general group theoretic results.  Mapping class groups are also prominent in 3- and 4-manifold topology, e.g., via Heegaard splittings and Lefschetz fibrations. Moreover, Mod(S) arises naturally as the fundamental group of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces and is therefore much studied in complex analysis and algebraic geometry. The PI has an ongoing program for studying the algebraic structure of Mod(S) and understanding the relationship between Mod(S), arithmetic groups, and the automorphism group of a free group, by comparing properties such as actions on combinatorial models, automorphism and abstract commensurator groups, generating sets, finiteness properties, subgroups, and possible obstructions to linearity.  In the course of the proposed project, the PI expects to find new generators for two groups which play an important role in the algebraic characterization of 3-manifolds via Heegaard splittings:   the Torelli and Heegaard groups.  The PI also expects to give a new presentation for Mod(S) relating Mod(S) to Coxeter groups, to find a finite presentation for the Hilden group, and to gain insight into the homology of the Torelli group and the Johnson kernel using a map arising from the Rochlin invariant of homology 3-spheres.  Understanding the structure of the Johnson kernel is of particular interest as one can, for example, use this group to construct all homology 3-spheres.<br/><br/><br/>Surfaces are fundamental objects in mathematics, physics and other sciences.  Mathematicians have understood how to classify 2-dimensional surfaces for nearly a century.  However, the natural second step of investigating surface automorphisms (maps of a surface to itself which preserve the essential properties of the surface) has proved to be a much more challenging problem.  The group of surface automorphisms, known as the mapping class group Mod(S) of the surface S, has been extensively studied, but some of the most basic and essential questions about its structure remain unsolved.  In this project, the Principal Investigator will continue an ongoing program to study the algebraic structure of Mod(S).  Though Mod(S) arises naturally in many different fields of mathematics, a particular goal of this project is to look for algebraic structure in Mod(S) which reveals connections between geometry, topology, and algebra. For example, one focus will be on the study of subgroups of Mod(S) which play a large role in the algebraic characterization of various 3-dimensional spaces.  Another focus will be understanding certain sets of generators, or ``building blocks'' of Mod(S), which reveal the relationship between surfaces, which are topological objects, and reflections and other symmetries, which are purely geometric in nature."

I decompose the colored Jones polynomial in the semi-classical <br/>limit into a sum of many simpler invariants, which turn out to be <br/>multi-variable polynomial invariants of links. These invariants are <br/>arranged naturally into a `tower' and the Alexander polynomial lies at <br/>its foundation.  My goal is to study the properties of the other `higher <br/>level' polynomials and establish their relation to the topology of the <br/>knot complement. The second puzzle of the Jones polynomial is its <br/>polynomial structure, which does not follow easily from its <br/>Chern-Simons-Witten path integral presentation. An amazing explanation <br/>for the polynomial nature of the Jones polynomial comes from Khovanov's <br/>categorification program, which interprets the Jones polynomial as a <br/>graded Euler characteristic of a chain complex of graded modules, <br/>associated to a link up to a homotopy. I will study the possible quantum <br/>field theory interpretations of the Khovanov homology. Namely, the <br/>homology of the categorification complex should be a space of states for <br/>a 4-dimensional topological quantum field theory, which has to be <br/>constructed. This construction should help us to extend Khovanov's <br/>results to quantum polynomial invariants of 3-manifolds and to interpret <br/>their relation to 4-dimensional topology.<br/><br/>The problem of knot classification is very old and although its <br/>formulation is simple and transparent, it has not been solved yet <br/>despite concerted efforts of many mathematicians. One of the most <br/>successful approaches to knot classification is the construction of knot <br/>invariants, that is, the numbers, which can be easily computed by <br/>looking at a picture of a knot and which would be the same for all <br/>pictures representing the same knot. This area has undergone significant <br/>developments in the last 30 years starting with the invention of the <br/>Jones polynomial. This polynomial and the other invariants which <br/>followed it, are intimately related to quantum field theory and can be <br/>expressed as so-called path integrals. Thus many of the new ideas in the <br/>theory of knot invariants are inspired by methods and approaches of <br/>quantum physics.

The first part of the project, to be carried out in collaboration with Nikolai Saveliev and Tomasz Mrowka, is to understand the smooth topology of 4-manifolds that homologically resemble a product of a 3-dimensional manifold with a  circle.   The central questions center around the interpretation of the classical Rohlin invariant in terms of gauge theory; an important facet is the analysis of end-periodic Dirac operators. Solutions of the main problems posed will decide the existence of some manifolds predicted by high-dimensional topology (surgery theory) and settle a fundamental question about the homology cobordism group.  This latter question is key in understanding the triangulability of manifolds of dimension 5 or more.  The second part of the project proposes joint work with Saso Strle. We plan to investigate the degree to which invariants of a 3-manifold derived from the Seiberg-Witten equations constrain the topology of those 4-manifolds which it bounds.  The results will be used to investigate a classical problem about group actions on the K3 surface and other algebraic varieties. <br/> <br/>Many of the most difficult problems in topology are concerned with the structure of three and four-dimensional manifolds.   Questions about phenomena in these dimensions have particular interest because those are the dimension of space and time that make up our world.   The research to be carried out under this grant makes use of powerful geometric and analytical techniques that have been introduced into the field over the last twenty years, under the general rubric of gauge theory.   Much of the application of four-dimensional gauge theory has been to manifolds that are simply-connected, in which any loop can be shrunk to a point.  The research proposed will use Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten gauge theories to shed light on manifolds which are not simply-connected, where new phenomena are expected.   By studying the Dirac operator (originally introduced to give a relativistic quantum theory of the electron) on manifolds with a certain type of periodicity, we seek to get restrictions on an invariant of non-simply connected manifolds, called the Rohlin invariant.  This subtle invariant is connected to three-dimensional topology, and its behavior determines whether high-dimensional manifolds may be triangulated. <br/>"

Miller, Michael J. Hopkins<br/><br/>The Talbot program is a series of yearly workshop retreats<br/>bringing together graduate students, recent PhDs, and faculty<br/>mentors for an intense exploration of a topic of active<br/>mathematical research. The Talbot 2004 workshop was devoted to<br/>the Stolz-Teichner model of elliptic cohomology and was mentored<br/>by Stephan Stolz. The Talbot 2005 workshop will focus on the<br/>geometric Langlands program and be mentored by David Ben-Zvi. The<br/>geometric Langlands program is one of the most fertile areas of<br/>mathematics, integrating representation theory, topology, and<br/>algebraic geometry. The original conjectures of Langlands tie<br/>infinite-dimensional representation theory to the structure of<br/>Galois groups, with profound applications to number theory. From<br/>the geometric perspective deriving from the renowned theorem of<br/>Borel-Weil-Bott, one would like to classify such representations<br/>by equivariant sheaves on a parametrizing space. Drinfeld and<br/>Laumon, among others, adapted Langlands' original ideas for<br/>function fields to formulate a far reaching geometric<br/>generalization, now called the geometric Langlands program. Work<br/>in this area over the past twenty years has changed the face of<br/>modern representation theory. Recent advances, such as new<br/>geometric generalizations of the classical Satake isomorphism,<br/>make this an ideal time to gather young mathematicians to study<br/>these results, the techniques used to derive them, and newly<br/>exposed avenues for future research.<br/><br/>The Talbot workshops seek to introduce aspiring mathematicians to<br/>active areas of mathematical research, foster community and<br/>collaboration across subdisciplinary and institutional lines, and<br/>form pedagogical and research ties between established<br/>mathematicians and young researchers. The topic for Talbot 2004<br/>concerns a central problem in mathematics deeply related to<br/>neighboring areas of science. For instance, the crystallographic<br/>study of proteins, quantum states of particles, and the structure<br/>of integer solutions to polynomial equations are all central to<br/>chemistry, physics, and cryptography/number theory; their deeper<br/>study requires probing the algebraic structures that govern<br/>aspects of their nature. Representation theory is precisely the<br/>field of mathematics devoted to this study.  Further, the<br/>geometric Langlands program offers a unifying vision for the<br/>specific algebraic structures suited to each of these areas,<br/>which are called reflection groups, Lie groups, and Galois<br/>groups. This Talbot workshop will bring together graduate<br/>students with different specialties and from many universities to<br/>spend a week focused on this important subject. The participants<br/>and their mentor, David Ben-Zvi, will share a residence as well<br/>as lectures, discussions, and meals. This informal atmosphere,<br/>mixing fellowship and intellectual interest, will promote a<br/>concentrated study of the material and lay the foundation for<br/>future collaboration and research.<br/>"

The Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference (STDC) is one of the longest standing conferences in general topology, having started in 1967 and continuing as an annual conference.  Over the years, the STDC has become broader, encompassing most of the areas of topology and of topological approaches to dynamical systems.  STDC 2005 will have four special sessions running in parallel: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General and Set-Theoretic Topology, and Geometric Topology and Geometric Group Theory.  To promote unity and interaction, there will be 12 invited talks of 25-minutes in two parallel sessions, and 6 plenary talks of 50 minutes.  It is our intention that many of these semi-plenary and plenary talks emphasize interaction of the research agendas of two or more conference areas.  <br/><br/>Topology is the branch of mathematics concerned with those properties of objects that are unaffected by stretching, twisting and bending.  For example, if a point within some object is approximated by a sequence of points converging to it, then twisting and bending the object does not affect the approximation.  Because this notion of approximation lies at the heart of so many areas of mathematics, topology plays an important role across the discipline.  In particular, the area of Dynamical Systems relies heavily on topological ideas.  This branch of mathematics studies the effects of iteratively applying a rule (or rules) to the elements of some set.  For example, rules which model weather conditions and population growth over time have become paradigms in this field.  The most surprising fact regarding systems such as these is that even very simple rules applied to nearly identical elements can produce wildly different and unpredictable outcomes.  Thus, chaos theory falls within the realm of dynamical systems.<br/>"

These reflect the highly non-commutative nature of the fundamental group. In previous work, the PI showed that this type of invariant gives estimates for the Thurston norm of a 3-manifold, obstruct a 3-manifold fibering over the circle, obstruct the existence of a symplectic structure on certain 4-manifolds, give new information about the structure of the link concordance group, and obstruct a group being the fundamental group of a 3-manifold or having positive deficiency.  The PI proposes to find new interesting non-commutative algebraic invariants and to apply these invariants to questions in low-dimensional topology; for example, homology cobordism of 3-manifolds (and link concordance), symplectic structures of 4-manifolds, genera of contact structures of 3-manifolds, Betti numbers of finite covers of 3-manifolds, and depth of foliations of 3-manifolds. The PI also proposes to find a specific relationship between her invariants of a three manifold and the Heegard Floer Homology of a 3-manifold.<br/><br/>Topology is the study of the continuous change of space (by stretching or twisting but not tearing).  In this project, the PI will focus on spaces that are locally modelled on 3-dimensional space (the space that we live in) and 4-dimensional space (3-dimensional space along with a time dimension).  These are called 3 and 4-dimensional manifolds respectively.One of the ways that we can better understand these spaces is via their ""fundamental group.""  The fundamental group isan algebraic object associated to any topological space which measures the number of holes in <br/>a the space.  It is defined as the set of loops starting and ending at a point.  We can formally multiply loops in the fundamental group as follows.  If A is a loop and B is another loop, we define ""A times B"", denoted AB, to be the loop obtained by first traversing A and then traversing B.  The multiplication of loops is non-commutative as in matrix multiplication.  That is, AB is not the same as BA, since traversing A then B is not the same as traversing B then A. Unfortunately,the fundamental group of a space is quite difficult to understand.  In this project, the PI will use noncommutative algebraic techniques to better understand the fundamental group and hence better <br/>understand the 3 and 4-dimensional manifolds themselves.  For example, one of the non-commutative techniques the PI will use involves matrices which are no longer finite but have an infinite number of rows and columns.<br/>"

However, the mystery has deepened with the discovery of anomalies in the CMB. Specifically, the broadest fluctuations (the ell=2 and ell=3 modes) align in the direction of the cosmological dipole. Stranger still, radio and optical astronomers have independently observed unexplained anisotropies pointing in the same direction.  While it would be premature to draw conclusions, dark matter is high on the list of candidates.  Whatever the ultimate explanation, if the broad-scale CMB fluctuations turn out to be weaker than they seem, this will strengthen the case for a finite universe.  The current project continues to develop the mathematics of the eigenmodes of finite universe candidates for better comparison with observations, while simultaneously trying to make sense of the anomalies in the data and to gauge their impact on topological conclusions.  The educational half of the project is developing and expanding a suite of geometry and topology software, spanning the gamut from specialized research software (SnapPea) to widely used topology games for middle school students.<br/><br/>Speculation on the shape of the universe goes back to ancient times, but serious mathematical study of cosmic topology began in 1854 when Riemann proposed the hypersphere as a cosmological model. Topology blossomed in the late 19th century, leading to a variety of possible 3-dimensional spaces. The astronomer Karl Schwarzschild presented these models to the German Astronomical Society in 1900 as candidates for the topology of space, but given the limited observational data available at the time, he could conclude only that the universe must be much larger than our Milky Way galaxy.  Indeed cosmic topology made little headway as an observational science until the 1990's when the COBE and WMAP satellites found hints of a finite universe in the cosmic microwave background radiation. The past decade has been a turbulent one, though, with intense work on hyperbolic models giving way to flat and spherical models to accommodate the 1998 discovery of dark energy.  More recently the plot has taken a new twist, with features of the cosmic microwave background -- as well as some optical and radio anomalies -- all aligning in the direction of Virgo.  This suggests some new physical effect -- perhaps dark matter -- which has not been previously accounted for. The research component of the present project applies geometrical and topological knowledge to the ongoing efforts to understand the shape and nature of our universe, while the educational component makes these breathtakingly beautiful ideas accessible to middle school, high school and college students (www.geometrygames.org).<br/>"

For example, mapping class groups are closely related to arithmetic groups (e.g., SL(n,Z)), automorphism groups of a free group, and Artin groups (e.g., braid groups), making Mod(S) valuable both as a venue for applications of, and as an inspiration for, more general group theoretic results.  Mapping class groups are also prominent in 3- and 4-manifold topology, e.g., via Heegaard splittings and Lefschetz fibrations. Moreover, Mod(S) arises naturally as the fundamental group of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces and is therefore much studied in complex analysis and algebraic geometry. The PI has an ongoing program for studying the algebraic structure of Mod(S) and understanding the relationship between Mod(S), arithmetic groups, and the automorphism group of a free group, by comparing properties such as actions on combinatorial models, automorphism and abstract commensurator groups, generating sets, finiteness properties, subgroups, and possible obstructions to linearity.  In the course of the proposed project, the PI expects to find new generators for two groups which play an important role in the algebraic characterization of 3-manifolds via Heegaard splittings:   the Torelli and Heegaard groups.  The PI also expects to give a new presentation for Mod(S) relating Mod(S) to Coxeter groups, to find a finite presentation for the Hilden group, and to gain insight into the homology of the Torelli group and the Johnson kernel using a map arising from the Rochlin invariant of homology 3-spheres.  Understanding the structure of the Johnson kernel is of particular interest as one can, for example, use this group to construct all homology 3-spheres.<br/><br/><br/>Surfaces are fundamental objects in mathematics, physics and other sciences.  Mathematicians have understood how to classify 2-dimensional surfaces for nearly a century.  However, the natural second step of investigating surface automorphisms (maps of a surface to itself which preserve the essential properties of the surface) has proved to be a much more challenging problem.  The group of surface automorphisms, known as the mapping class group Mod(S) of the surface S, has been extensively studied, but some of the most basic and essential questions about its structure remain unsolved.  In this project, the Principal Investigator will continue an ongoing program to study the algebraic structure of Mod(S).  Though Mod(S) arises naturally in many different fields of mathematics, a particular goal of this project is to look for algebraic structure in Mod(S) which reveals connections between geometry, topology, and algebra. For example, one focus will be on the study of subgroups of Mod(S) which play a large role in the algebraic characterization of various 3-dimensional spaces.  Another focus will be understanding certain sets of generators, or ``building blocks'' of Mod(S), which reveal the relationship between surfaces, which are topological objects, and reflections and other symmetries, which are purely geometric in nature."

The first problem is the study of the Heegaard Floer homology of a three-manifold obtained by gluing two other three-manifolds with torus boundaries. The gluing is determined once a framing on the boundary of each component is fixed. The principal investigator is interested in constructing a relative Heegaard Floer theory for three-manifolds with framed torus boundary, such that the Floer theory of the resulting closed three-manifold may be computed from the relative Floer theories of the two pieces. Potential applications include an understanding of the Floer theory of satellite knots, and some lower bounds on the slice genus of such knots, at least in the case of the Whitehead double. The second problem deals with the construction of integer valued enumerative invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds. In an earlier work, the principal investigator has constructed such an invariant for any given homology class which is either primitive or a prime multiple of a primitive class. It counts embedded pseudo-holomorphic curves of a given genus in the Calabi-Yau threefold, which represent the given homology class. The goal is to overcome the technical difficulties, which force the restriction on the homology class, and extend the construction to all homology classes. The principal investigator is also interested in deriving a generating function formula, which relates these invariants to Gromov-Witten invariants, similar to the work of Gopakumar and Vafa in string theory literature.<br/><br/>Counting holomorphic curves in complex or symplectic manifolds has been the source of great developments in topology, in algebraic geometry and in mathematics of string theory, for the past two decades. These counts reveal, as numerical characteristics of the subject of study, very important geometric and topologic features that have been almost impossible to understand before the introduction of these techniques. Floer homology in general, and Heegaard Floer homology in the study of low dimensional manifolds in particular, give examples of  revolutionary technologies in this category. Gromov-Witten invariants, providing a language for enumerative geometry, form another example. However, the actual computations are generally very hard. The two problems suggested in this proposal are aimed at a reduction of the computations to potentially simpler cases: For a three dimensional manifold obtained from gluing two simpler three-dimensional pieces we would like to reduce the computation of Heegaard Floer homology to a computation for each piece, and for Gromov-Witten invariants, which are generally rational numbers with crazy denominators, we would like to describe them in terms of integer valued enumerations of potentially simpler objects. Once these techniques are developed, the computations will be possible at least in certain interesting classes of examples. We hope for some fantastic applications of the first problem to the study of knots, and a very interesting link between the construction of the second problem and the counts of BPS-states in physics."

The central principle has been the geometrization conjecture, asserting that any 3-manifold has a canonical topological decomposition into pieces that have one of eight possible kinds of locally homogeneous geometric structures. The last two or three years have seen dramatic progress in this program. The most notable progress is Perlman's proof (which has been gaining in acceptance) using Ricci flow to establish geometrization. In addition,<br/>there has also been great progress on understanding the geometry of noncompact hyperbolic manifolds through the proof of the tame end and ending lamination conjectures, and there have been some notable negative results establishing that certain hyperbolic 3-manifolds don't have taut foliations, essential laminations, or quasigeodesic flows. Geometric decompositions of 3-manifolds have given us a firm grip on individual 3-manifolds. With the acceptance of the geometrization conjecture, the subject is entering a new phase of exploration of the rich interconnections among<br/>three-manifolds and various structures on manifolds. One important topic for investigation is to further clarify the relationships among taut foliations,  tight contact structures, flows with varying properties, and hyperbolic structures.  Another interesting area is to investigate is the master three-manifold, a  laminated set whose leaves are all possible hyperbolic 3-manifolds, compact and noncompact. A third important topic is to understand the lattices of finite-sheeted covers of 3-manifolds and in particular, the questions of whether hyperbolic 3-manifolds are virtually Haken, virtually positive betti, and virtually fibered. The final and perhaps most significant topic is to develop a bigger picture to explain geometrization, using structures such as a foliated bundles over three-manifolds to build their geometry.<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is a space which has 3 degrees of freedom, so it can be locally described by three variables. Through the geometrization conjecture, which is now generally accepted, the topology of three-manifolds have a beautiful description in terms of crystallographic groups in 8 flavors of 3-dimensional geometry. In fact most 3-manifolds are the identification spaces of a crystallographic group in non-Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry. Unlike for standard (Euclidean) crystallography, there are infinitely many  crystallographic groups in hyperbolic geometry, and many mysteries remain about their structure, their classification, and their interrelationships. This project will seek to uncover and explain some of these interrelationships.<br/>"

Each year approximately one-third of the talks will be in a particular area of emphasis.  Recent examples are geometric group theory (2003), 3-manifold theory (2004), and symplectic geometry and topology (2005).  Each year's Festival will include two introductory workshops in the area of emphasis, to provide a point of entry for interested non-experts and a sense of involvement for all participants.  It will also include a broad-ranging panel discussion by the invited speakers, to provide a forward-looking perspective on new developments not covered in the talks. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the Festival include (a) a more broadly-trained community of topologists, able to transcend the boundaries of sub-specialties; (b) a more diverse mathematical workforce; (c) a more rapid integration of younger topologists into areas of current research; and (d) the enhancement of collaboration among researchers in different areas of topology.  There is an outreach and support program to encourage the participation of underrepresented groups and young researchers.  The training effects of the Festival will be extended by dissemination of lecture notes from the workshops and a summary of the panel discussion; themain vehicle for this is the Festival web site, which has been maintained continuously since 1997."

In recent years, the hard properties have been uncovered by<br/>using holomorphic curve techniques in the framework of Symplectic Field<br/>Theory. The project proposes to study a part of this theory known as<br/>Legendrian contact homology. This theory has had enormous success for<br/>Legendrian knots of dimension 1. Parallels of the 1-dimensional phenomena<br/>have been shown to exists for higher dimensional Legendrian submanifolds<br/>but the effectiveness of contact homology in higher dimensions has been<br/>limited because computations in the theory are comparatively difficult<br/>since they involve infinite dimensional spaces in an essential way. One of<br/>the main goals of this research project is to prove a conjecture which<br/>reduces the computation of Legendrian contact homology in 1-jet spaces to<br/>a purely finite dimensional problem. This would be important not only for<br/>contact geometry itself: profound recent results in knot theory were<br/>derived using heuristic arguments from higher dimensional contact homology<br/>and a proof of the conjecture would establish the link between knot theory<br/>and higher dimensional contact homology rigorously. The conjecture will<br/>also be applied both to internal questions in contact geometry (e.g. to<br/>estimate the number of double points of exact Lagrangian immersions in<br/>$\C^n$) and to problems in differential topology. The project also intends<br/>to complete earlier results concerning minimal surfaces with small total<br/>boundary curvature as well as expand the range of applications of the<br/>techniques used there, in particular, to problems concerning higher<br/>dimensional minimal varieties. Many of the problems arising in connection<br/>with this study asks for topological constructions with geometrical<br/>control.<br/><br/>In topology one is often concerned with open differential relations and<br/>the class of allowed deformations is very large. This is a reflection of<br/>the fact that spaces studied in topology in a sense are ""soft"" objects. In<br/>geometry, on the other hand, one often faces differential equations and<br/>the class of deformations is considerably smaller. Comparing to the<br/>situation in topology, one could say that objects in geometry are ""hard"".<br/>This project proposes to study problems in the two areas, contact geometry<br/>and minimal varieties, using the interplay between soft and hard.<br/>"

Recent work of Arhangelskii<br/>has begun to shed light on some of these problems, and the project<br/>integrates this together with Eisworth's work on applications of set theory<br/>in topology."
