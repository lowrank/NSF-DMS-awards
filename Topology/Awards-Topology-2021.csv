This basic fact gives a relationship between the topology of one dimensional figures and algebra. Mathematicians have built an elaborate machine based on the original work of Pontryagin and Thom from the middle of the 20th century, extending this correspondence to higher dimensions. This project aims to formulate notions of algebraic structures on the geometric side of this correspondence, with intended applications in the study of topology. The project will also support the training of graduate students in the subject.<br/><br/>The project's new formulations are centered around the notion of a flow category which has become central to modern approaches to symplectic topology, as well as to its interactions with other mathematical fields, such as algebraic geometry, low dimensional topology, and dynamical systems, as well as mathematical physics, because the output of Floer's theory exactly provides such a structure. The PI plans to formulate algebraic structures (algebras, modules, etc.) geometrically at the level of the underlying flow categories. In this way, the PI expects to make substantial advances in three areas: (i) Floer homotopy theory and its applications to symplectic topology, (ii) the study of Fukaya categories and its applications to mirror symmetry, and (iii) the interaction between differential and algebraic topology, via a geometric model of Waldhausen's A-theory, with intended applications to the study of Lagrangians embeddings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gradually, it was realized that the algebraic invariants, called cohomology theories, could themselves be represented by geometric objects known as spectra.  A central triumph of modern homotopy theory has been the construction of categories of ring spectra that are suitable for performing constructions analogous to those of classical algebra.  This has proved fruitful by providing invariants, which shed new light on old questions. In addition, it has raised new questions that have unexpected connections to other areas of mathematics and physics.  This project works in the setting of an invariant called algebraic K-theory and related theories.  The project studies applications of these theories to a broad range of questions in number theory, algebraic geometry, and geometric topology, as well as algebraic topology itself. The award provides support for students who will be engaged in parts of this research.<br/><br/>This grant funds a broad research program aimed at applying recent work of the PIs on algebraic K-theory, trace methods, and equivariant stable homotopy theory to study a wide variety of problems in homotopy theory.  Prior work of the PIs studied the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum and the fiber of the cyclotomic trace for algebraic number rings.  The current project expands the investigation to the fiber of the cyclotomic trace on more general rings over algebraic p-integers in terms of Tate-Poitou duality and a related K-theory question more generally for other kinds of Artin duality.  The project explores a connection between the geometric Soule embedding and the Kummer-Vandiver conjecture discovered in the PIs' prior work.  The PIs' prior work also gives a splitting that is consistent with and gives evidence for the existence of p-adically interpolated Adams operations on the algebraic K-theory at least in the context of regular rings.  The project investigates specific conjectures and approaches to this problem.  The project advances a new approach to the the Hatcher-Waldhausen map that would have implications in geometric, differential, and symplectic topology.  The project proposes a construction of multiplicative norm maps in equivariant stable homotopy theory for positive dimensional compact Lie groups. This requires a new foundation for non-equivariant factorization homology and holds the promise of constructing a genuine equivariant factorization homology theory for positive dimensional compact Lie groups.  The project includes a collaboration of the PIs with Basterra, Hill, and Lawson to study equivariant TAQ as part of a broader program to develop the foundations for equivariant derived algebraic geometry.  If successful, this program will provide an organizing principle for phenomenological data coming from work on topological modular forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, tools from algebra can be used to study objects in topology, and vice versa. One illustration of this deep interaction is through algebraic K-theory. Algebraic K-theory is an invariant of rings, fundamental objects in algebra. There is great interest in algebraic K-theory due to its significant applications in the fields of algebraic geometry, number theory, and topology. While algebraic K-theory is difficult to compute, and many open questions remain, there is a powerful approach using tools from topology. In recent years, exciting advances in algebraic topology have made it possible to study questions in algebraic K-theory which were previously thought to be inaccessible. A goal of this project is to produce new algebraic K-theory computations. A key step in computing algebraic K-theory is studying a related invariant called topological Hochschild homology. Another goal of this project is to further develop the framework and theory around variants of topological Hochschild homology, and study applications to several other areas of mathematics. In addition to the mathematics research goals, the project also includes work in undergraduate and graduate education, undergraduate research, conference organization, and efforts to support the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in mathematics.  <br/><br/><br/>This project uses the tools of equivariant stable homotopy to study algebraic K-theory and topological Hochschild homology. Algebraic K-theory is an invariant of a ring which is generally very difficult to compute. A fruitful approach to the study of algebraic K-theory is the trace method approach, which approximates algebraic K-theory by theories that are more computable, such as topological Hochschild homology and topological cyclic homology. The trace method approach relies on tools from equivariant stable homotopy theory. This project explores the intricate relationship between equivariant homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, and topological Hochschild homology. Specific research goals of the project are organized into three broad objectives: One, use recent developments in trace methods and equivariant stable homotopy theory to compute algebraic K-theory groups which were previously inaccessible. Two, use equivariant homotopy theory to study algebraic and topological Hochschild homologies such as twisted topological Hochschild homology and Real topological Hochschild homology. Three, study applications of topological Hochschild homology theories to questions in geometry and low-dimensional topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on manifolds that are closed in the sense that they have no boundary edges and do not extend to infinity. A closed one-dimensional manifold is equivalent to the circle, while a closed (orientable) two-dimensional manifold is equivalent to the sphere, the surface of a donut, or the surface of a ?donut? with two or more holes. Closed three-dimensional manifolds cannot be so easily visualized, while closed four-dimensional manifolds can have very complicated structures and are not well-understood. Four-dimensional manifolds, with three spatial directions and one temporal direction, are used in general relativity as models for the universe. Four-dimensional manifolds also play a central role in gauge theories developed to unify three of the four known fundamental forces (the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions). The first goal of the project is to complete a mathematical proof of a prediction from supersymmetric quantum field theory, one that relates two different gauge theories used to help understand four-dimensional manifolds. The second goal of the project is to advance understanding of the possible structures of four-dimensional manifolds, a source of fascination and inspiration for mathematicians and physicists for nearly a century. The classification of possible structures of three-dimensional manifolds advanced tremendously in recent decades, but four-dimensional manifolds remain mysterious, despite intense effort by mathematicians to analyze them. The third goal of the project is to develop methods to relate different approaches to understanding the structure of three-dimensional manifolds. The project involves graduate students in the research. To help train the next generation of mathematicians, the principals also will continue their tradition of organizing seminars and conferences, contributing expository articles to help engage a broader audience interested in learning about careers and research in mathematics, mentoring undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and encouraging the interest of high-school students in mathematics through summer programs and outreach activities at the National Museum of Mathematics.<br/><br/>The first goal of the project is to complete a proof of Witten's formula relating the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants of a closed, oriented, smooth four-dimensional manifold with admissible topology and simple type, employing a mathematically rigorous method based on moduli spaces of non-Abelian monopoles. The work will apply a new approach to gluing solutions to non-linear partial differential equations that arise in geometric analysis to establish a proof of an expected gluing theorem for non-Abelian monopoles. The second goal of their project is complete a proof of the conjectured Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality for simply connected four-dimensional manifolds of Seiberg-Witten simple type and having non-zero Seiberg-Witten invariants. The approach uses a new version of Morse theory for singular analytic spaces applied to the singular moduli space of non-Abelian monopoles to prove existence of solutions to another non-linear partial differential equation ? the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equation on a rank-two Hermitian vector bundle with prescribed topology over a four-dimensional manifold.

Surprising results from the 20th century indicate that classification of 4-manifolds is qualitatively much different, and more difficult, than corresponding questions in both higher and lower dimensions.  A fruitful approach to studying 4-manifolds is to cut them into simpler pieces along 3-dimensional manifolds, so that effective tools and techniques available from the comparatively simpler study of 3-manifolds can be brought to bear on the 4-dimensional realm.  This research project aims to deepen understanding of smooth 4-dimensional manifolds using this approach, employing tools called ""Floer homologies,"" which stem from gauge theory and mathematical physics.  The project will address questions that lie at the border of 3- and 4-dimensions.  For instance, it will explore algebraic structures called homology cobordism groups, which allow 3-manifolds to be added and subtracted by considering certain 4-manifolds that interpolate between them like frames of a movie.  The project will address several fundamental questions on these structures and refine them to account for symmetries of the spaces involved.  The project will involve graduate students in the research.<br/><br/>This project studies topological and geometric objects in low dimensions, with the aid of tools from gauge theory and symplectic geometry. Specific goals include the development of techniques for studying smooth equivariant homology cobordism groups, application of these techniques to long-standing questions on knot concordance, and characterization of knots that bound complex curves in Stein domains.  The project will also create resources for students and researchers seeking to learn the tools employed in pursuit of these goals.  Specific objectives in this direction include the completion and dissemination of an informal introductory text on Heegaard Floer homology.

These systems depend on a variety of parameters, and as these parameters change, the corresponding system is affected. Understanding how dynamical systems change with different parameters is a very complicated and delicate question that is not even completely understood in the simplest of mathematical models. However, there is one shining success story in this regard: that is, the parameter space, or ""moduli space"", of complex quadratic polynomials. This space contains the famous Mandelbrot Set, which has been thoroughly studied over the last 40 years. The research outlined in this proposal explores different parameter spaces associated to particular dynamical systems, with a view toward understanding them to the same extent that the mathematical community understands the space where the Mandelbrot set lives. This proposal also contains a significant outreach component to support the Math Corps at U(M), a free math Summer Camp for middle school students and high school mentors.<br/><br/>A major goal in the field of complex dynamics is to understand dynamical moduli spaces. The most successful endeavor in this regard has been the study of the moduli space of quadratic polynomials where the Mandelbrot Set lives, a fundamental object in the subject. Ultimately, we strive to understand the moduli space of rational maps of arbitrary degree to the same extent that we understand the moduli space of quadratic polynomials. Many tools from complex analysis that pave the way for key breakthroughs in the one-dimensional setting do not carry over to higher dimensions. So instead of considering the whole moduli space, PI follows an approach initiated by William Thurston and investigate sub-varieties of moduli space. The most natural sub-varieties to study are those that come from dynamical conditions, like imposing combinatorial constraints on the forward orbits of critical points. One may view Thurston?s Topological Characterization of Rational Maps as a first step.

A fundamental problem in topology is the classification problem of topological spaces and maps among them. Among all spaces, the spheres are of central importance, and we can classify them up to continuous deformation by a single number - the dimension. A one dimensional sphere, which we usually call a circle, is something that we can draw on a piece of paper, and can be described by the solutions of the familiar equation for a circle. A two dimensional sphere is something we can visualize in three dimensional space, such as the surface of a basketball, and can be described by the solutions of a similar equation. In topology, we also study higher dimensional spheres. Although these spaces cannot be visualized in three dimensions, they do exist in higher dimensions, and can also be studied. Somewhat surprisingly, maps between spheres are much harder to classify, even up to continuous deformations. This classification problem of maps between spheres is called the problem of computations of homotopy groups of spheres. This problem has been a major and active research problem since the 1950's. Much progress has been made on this problem, through all kinds of methods that have close connections to many subjects of mathematics. Recently, significant progress has been made using techniques from motivic and equivariant homotopy theory. The goal of this project is to further develop new techniques in motivic and equivariant homotopy theory, and to study this classical problem of computations of homotopy groups of spheres. Graduate students will be involved in this project.<br/><br/>This project concentrates on computations of stable homotopy groups of spheres, in the classical, motivic and equivariant context.

The principal investigator and collaborators will extend the Chow t-structure technique defined over the complex numbers to other base fields, and study motivic stable homotopy groups of spheres over these base fields.

Gradually, it was realized that the algebraic invariants, called cohomology theories, could themselves be represented by geometric objects known as spectra.  A central triumph of modern homotopy theory has been the construction of categories of ring spectra that are suitable for performing constructions analogous to those of classical algebra.  This has proved fruitful by providing invariants, which shed new light on old questions. In addition, it has raised new questions that have unexpected connections to other areas of mathematics and physics.  This project works in the setting of an invariant called algebraic K-theory and related theories.  The project studies applications of these theories to a broad range of questions in number theory, algebraic geometry, and geometric topology, as well as algebraic topology itself.

Prior work of the PIs studied the algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectrum and the fiber of the cyclotomic trace for algebraic number rings.  The current project expands the investigation to the fiber of the cyclotomic trace on more general rings over algebraic p-integers in terms of Tate-Poitou duality and a related K-theory question more generally for other kinds of Artin duality.  The project explores a connection between the geometric Soule embedding and the Kummer-Vandiver conjecture discovered in the PIs' prior work.  The PIs' prior work also gives a splitting that is consistent with and gives evidence for the existence of p-adically interpolated Adams operations on the algebraic K-theory at least in the context of regular rings.  The project investigates specific conjectures and approaches to this problem.  The project advances a new approach to the the Hatcher-Waldhausen map that would have implications in geometric, differential, and symplectic topology.  The project proposes a construction of multiplicative norm maps in equivariant stable homotopy theory for positive dimensional compact Lie groups. This requires a new foundation for non-equivariant factorization homology and holds the promise of constructing a genuine equivariant factorization homology theory for positive dimensional compact Lie groups.  The project includes a collaboration of the PIs with Basterra, Hill, and Lawson to study equivariant TAQ as part of a broader program to develop the foundations for equivariant derived algebraic geometry.

Numerous problems across mathematics and its applications are global in this sense, ranging from data science to economics. The research supported by this grant will develop new topological and geometric methods to tackle problems further afield, primarily discrete, non-continuous problems. This promises new insights at the confluence of combinatorics, geometry, and topology.

Recent research of the PI has suggested that one may effectively circumvent this prime power requirement via a synthesis of topological and combinatorial techniques. This will be further developed. The application of topological methods brings about geometric generalizations of combinatorial problems. To understand the limitations of topological techniques one has to study those types of problems, where geometric results deviate considerably from their combinatorial special cases. A central goal will thus be to delimit rigid combinatorial results from their flexible geometric counterparts. In addition to showing the existence of a solution to some combinatorial problem, one is often interested in quantifying how rich the space of solutions is. General topological methods will be developed that provide lower bounds for the topology of the space of solutions of a given combinatorial problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They often appear as the set of symmetries of a geometric object, for example, of 3-dimensional space, a molecule or a crystal. Oftentimes, the set of symmetries themselves, i.e., the group, has a natural topological structure. That is, one can speak of one symmetry being close to another, as in the case of two rotations of 3-dimensional space being close if they differ by a small angle. These latter groups are called topological transformation groups and are trivially related to geometry via the geometric object of which they are the set of symmetries. However, other topological groups are not so easily viewed as coming from geometry. This is, for example, the case for the systems of solutions to many differential equations which form a group under addition called a Banach space. However, one of the principal ideas of the present project is that all topological groups have natural intrinsic geometric structure which is defined jointly by their topological and algebraic structure. Moreover, this geometric structure can in many cases provide significant insight into the structure of the group by blotting out finer details that obscure the global or large scale properties of the group.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to investigate the coarse geometry of topological and, in particular, Polish groups. In earlier research, the PI has established and investigated a natural coarse structure that every topological group is equipped with and which coincides with that traditionally studied on finitely generated or locally compact groups, Banach spaces or even homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds. Particularly interesting subclasses to be studied are the Polish groups of bounded geometry for which the geometric structure theory is well-advanced. Several interesting questions on the extent of this class of groups remain open, for example, whether every Polish group of bounded geometry is coarsely equivalent to a locally compact group. The research program is by nature interdisciplinary. While its origins lie in descriptive set theory, the main examples of groups to be studied arise in various disciplines of mathematics, including functional analysis, logic, and geometric and differential topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This goal is approached in three distinct ways: first, through understanding all actions of a given group on hyperbolic metric spaces; next, through an in-depth study of two particular actions of big mapping class groups, a class of groups in which there has recently been an explosion of interest; and finally, by seeking to prove a strong stability result for quotients of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, a class of groups which can be completely described by their actions on hyperbolic metric spaces.  Parts of this project involve tools from other areas of mathematics, including descriptive set theory and (often non-commutative) ring theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of algebraic topology is to systematically build a connection between algebraic objects like numbers and geometric objects like spaces. This connection allows a two-way flow of information, with algebraic invariants distinguishing spaces and topological methods informing algebraic problems. Starting from foundational work of Quillen, algebraic and algebraic geometry data like formal groups gives rise to new invariants for spaces with striking properties. This project combines this classical thread with much more recent developments coming from equivariant algebraic topology. ""Equivariant algebraic topology"" remembers a collection of symmetries inherent in a space as part of the data, systematically grouping spaces with the same symmetries, and the numbers and invariants produced must reflect this. This extra structure provides more nuanced computations, giving more information about how the classically described invariants change under symmetries. Equivariant algebraic topology has experienced a renaissance recently due to the solution by the PI, Hopkins, and Ravenel to the Kervaire Invariant One problem, one of the oldest outstanding problems in algebraic topology. The solution introduced a host of new constructions and techniques that have striking ramifications in classical and equivariant algebraic topology, and this project focuses on unpacking some of these new constructions, exploring their ramifications in classically studied computations, and describing what they mean for algebraic topology in general. Many of the projects focus on diversity in STEM. Building on the PI's prior First Year seminar on Women in Math, the PI will create a diversity-driven class, combining mathematical content and pedagogy with discussions of representation and inclusion in mathematics. At the same time, the PI intends to create more opportunities for students who do not see themselves as ""math people"" to connect with algebra and geometry concepts using UCLA's ""Maker Spaces"" to have students design and build concrete models. The PI will continue conference organizing, especially conferences focusing on making space for early career mathematicians and for advanced undergraduates, using these as a way to connect students with the ideas and researchers in stable homotopy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Using newly developed tools in equivariant stable homotopy, the PI will study the slice spectral sequences for certain chromatically meaningful quotients of hyperreal spectra. These are closely connected to the classical approaches to studying K(n)-local phenomena using the Hopkins--Miller higher real K-theory spectra, and at the prime 2, computations here subsume all previously known higher real K-theory computations. The project focuses mainly on concrete computations (both of chromatically meaningful quotients of hyperreal bordism and of more traditional objects like the dual Steenrod algebra), while also studying more abstract questions of what kinds of multiplicative structures we can see. Finally, an application of all of this machinery to the classical questions of orientability of vector bundles is explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These developments largely center around topological invariants: assignments of algebraic objects to topological objects. For example, each link (i.e. knotted curve) in Euclidean 3-space can be assigned a polynomial called its Jones polynomial, as well as a vector space called its Khovanov homology. As another example, each 3-manifold (i.e. 3-dimensional space) can be assigned a vector space called its Heegaard Floer homology. Typically, these invariants are defined by first making an arbitrary choice (e.g. a link diagram representing the chosen link in Euclidean 3-space, or a Heegaard diagram representing the chosen 3-manifold); in order to have a topological invariant, one must then show that the result is independent of this choice. Factorization homology is a tool for defining topological invariants that does not require any arbitrary choices, which brings a number of advantages as discussed below. The present project seeks to further develop the theory of factorization homology, and to apply it to study invariants in low-dimensional topology of physical interest as also discussed below. It furthermore supports the training of early career mathematicians, the organization of ecologically sustainable conferences, and public engagement with the goal of disseminating the joy and excitement of mathematical understanding.<br/><br/><br/>Factorization homology is a categorified form of integration: whereas ordinary integration sums numbers, factorization homology sums vector spaces or chain complexes. More precisely, factorization homology integrates (enriched) n-categories over n-manifolds, giving an invariant of n-manifolds that adheres to the local-to-global principles appearing in TQFT. Given its well-definedness and homotopy-coherent functoriality (including a continuous action of diffeomorphisms), it plays an analogous role for state-sum TQFT as singular homology plays for cellular homology. Moreover, a slight modification is expected to give an invariant of links in 3-manifolds, e.g. the Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariant (valued in the skein module of the 3-manifold). The present project also seeks to apply factorization homology to the study of Khovanov homology and other link homology theories. Beyond making them manifestly well-defined, such a connection would further endow them with extensions to links in arbitrary 3-manifolds and with homotopy-coherent functoriality for cobordisms. The symmetries that would result lead to conjectural relationships with arithmetic objects such as cyclotomic spectra and topological Cartier modules, which the present project also seeks to explore.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A successful family of such invariants, which has lead to numerous applications since it was first developed two decades ago, is called Heegaard Floer homology. The definition of Heegaard Floer homology draws on sophisticated techniques from multiple fields, including topology, geometry, and analysis.

As an example, a teacup and a donut are topologically the same (they both have a single ?hole?), but geometrically different. Non-positive curvature is a geometric property, and roughly means that on small scales the space does not curve back on itself. These spaces have an interesting associated dynamical system: one can try to imagine how a billiard ball in such a space would move over time. This proposal is focused on studying these spaces from all three points of view (geometry, topology, and dynamics), providing a rich melting pot for different approaches and techniques. While the notion of non-positive curvature might seem strange, these spaces are in fact pervasive, both in mathematics and in nature. For this reason, they are a fundamental class of spaces for mathematicians to study and understand. This project will address a series of projects that are loosely centered around the notion of non-positive curvature. This project will provide opportunities for graduate student research and training.

Topology is the study of spatial structures (e.g. the surface of a donut, the large-scale shape of the cosmos, a tangled strand of DNA, a cluster of points in a massive data set), while algebraic geometry studies the mathematics of the ubiquitous polynomial equation. These disciplines have many and diverse points of contact; the principal investigator will study one in particular: families of Riemann surfaces. A surface is a topological object like the two-dimensional surface of a coffee cup, possibly one with lots of extra handles. A Riemann surface gives a special way of describing such an object as the solution to a polynomial equation, much as we learn in high school algebra that some equations describe circles, others ellipses, and others far more complicated shapes. A family of Riemann surfaces arises by varying the equations used to define the Riemann surface - one can imagine ""turning a knob"" to stretch and distort the shapes of the surfaces. Families of Riemann surfaces arise in many parts of mathematics and also play an important role in theoretical physics. The principal investigator will apply tools from topology and the related discipline of geometric group theory in order to better understand some of the most important families of Riemann surfaces that mathematicians today are interested in. Broader impacts include the establishment of a new chapter of the national Directed Reading Project network.<br/><br/>The project has two components. The first will investigate the topology of strata of Abelian differentials (translation surfaces). These families have been intensively studied by dynamicists and geometers, but there are foundational topological questions that still remain. In particular, the (orbifold) fundamental groups of strata are still highly mysterious. This can be effectively probed by way of the monodromy representation, a map into the mapping class group. The principal investigator will continue his work describing these monodromy representations, and will develop new tools to understand the monodromy kernel and so further develop the theory of fundamental groups of strata. Central to this endeavor will be an elucidation of the precise relationship between Artin groups and fundamental groups of strata. The second component of this project concerns families constructed via branched covers. These families have served as an important source of examples in topology, algebraic geometry, and group theory.

Smooth topology uses the tools of calculus to understand and classify these spaces; intriguingly, different dimensions behave very differently when looked at through the lens of calculus. Most surprisingly, foundational problems have been solved in dimensions less than and greater than four, but stubbornly resist attack in the space-time in which we actually live. This project brings together a group of researchers, with a diverse set of skills and experience, to help tackle these fundamental problems in smooth four-dimensional topology, by utilizing a key new idea about how to decompose (trisect) four-dimensional spaces into elementary building blocks. In particular, the study of trisections allows exporting many successful ideas from three-dimensional topology to four-dimensional topology. Along with the study of four-dimensional spaces in their own right, the investigators will also study the ways in which lower-dimensional spaces can be embedded in dimension four, in analogy with the study of knots as embeddings of circles in three-dimensional space. Using these tools and analogies, this focused research group aims to develop new ways to distinguish four-dimensional objects, new four-dimensional constructions, and new applications of four-dimensional results to topology and geometry in other settings and dimensions.<br/><br/>The smooth topology of four-dimensional manifolds remains one of the greatest mysteries in topology, as evidenced by open questions such as the Poincare and Schoenflies conjectures, which have been solved in all dimensions other than four.  This focused research group aims to breathe new life into this important field of study by exploiting a striking new perspective on four-manifolds: Every four-manifold decomposes into three simple pieces, and this trisection is unique up to a natural stabilization. The setup exactly parallels the three-dimensional theory of Heegaard splittings, setting the table for an interesting and valuable exchange of ideas between dimensions three and four.  Many extremely rich theories have been developed over the last few decades in low-dimensional topology, such as contact topology, Heegaard Floer homology, Heegaard splittings and bridge splittings, Khovanov homology, Dehn surgery, curve complexes, and thin position.

These spaces play important roles in the mathematical areas of topology and geometry, as well as in models of important physical systems. Because humans cannot visualize four spatial dimensions, it is necessary to develop mathematical and diagrammatic tools to study these spaces.  Historically, 4-dimensional spaces have displayed unusual phenomena, distinct from spaces of either lower or higher dimensions. A persistent theme in the discovery of such phenomena is the role of symplectic geometry. Although symplectic geometry was initially formulated to encode the equations of Hamiltonian physics, it has grown into an important abstract mathematical topic that is particularly powerful for studying 4-dimensional spaces. This project aims to use cutting-edge tools to make novel advances in 4-dimensional symplectic geometry. Because this is a rapidly growing field, training a well-prepared and diverse next generation is particularly important. To that end, the PI will create a new undergraduate course, run speaking workshops for graduate students, develop a paired graduate-undergraduate reading program, and organize workshops, summer schools, and conferences.<br/><br/>The project will study symplectic 4-manifolds and singular symplectic surfaces. The first primary goal is to create diagrammatic methods to study the subtleties of diffeomorphism classes of symplectic 4-manifolds. The second goal is to produce new symplectic isotopy classifications for smooth and singular symplectic surfaces. The third goal is to perform new calculations of existing symplectic invariants and to define new invariants for symplectic 4-manifolds and their submanifolds. The project will employ four mathematical methods to study symplectic 4-manifolds and surfaces: branched coverings of braided surfaces, trisections, (de)singularization, and Weinstein handlebodies. The fourth goal is to create a pipeline of new mathematicians well trained in the study of manifolds and skilled in scientific communication and research.

The simplified version provides interesting three-dimensional information, but the richer version also sheds light on four-dimensional aspects of the theory. Heegaard Floer homology brings together tools from various mathematical disciplines, including symplectic geometry, analysis, and homological algebra to study problems in knot theory and low-dimensional topology, in a way which was partially inspired by modern physics. As such, it lies at a fertile intellectual crossroads, bringing new perspectives to neighboring subjects. Heegaard Floer homology continues to provide novel methods for attacking old problems.

In collaboration with Szabo, the PI used similar methods to describe the simplified version of knot Floer homology. This project deals with further developing bordered techniques for three-dimensional spaces and also for knots, extending them to the richer versions.

It can be defined abstractly, as a collection of strings of letters, where certain equations describe which two strings correspond to the same symmetry.  Such letters are called generators, and the equations are called relations, and together they form what is called a group presentation.  Geometric group theory studies the connection between the geometry of the object, and the properties of the group of its symmetries. An example of a group is the set of integers, which can be viewed as symmetries of a line, where a positive number moves points on the line to the right, and a negative number to the left.  A subgroup of a group is a smaller collection of symmetries, closed under composition. In the group of integers, an example of a subgroup is the collection of the symmetries moving by an even distance. Understanding the subgroup structure is essential in studying the whole group.  This project will address questions about subgroups with prescribed properties in two families of groups: Artin groups and lattices in products of trees. Groups in both of those families can be described by simple looking presentations, but many questions about them remain unanswered.  The project will also promote the participation of women in mathematics via mentoring and outreach.<br/><br/>The first goal of this project is to examine the actions of Artin groups on CAT(0) cube complexes.  This project will investigate for which Artin groups is every group element is separated by some codimension-1 subgroup, and for which of them this leads to proper actions on CAT(0) cube complexes.  The theory of CAT(0) cube complexes, and special cube complexes in particular, has been a fruitful tool in understanding groups.  Proving that Artin groups act properly on CAT(0) cube complexes would answer many outstanding questions about Artin groups; for example, it could provide a solution to the word problem.  The PI will also continue her work on the residual finiteness of Artin groups in this project.  In the second project, the PI will study cocompact lattices in products of trees and their subgroup structures.  In particular, the PI will determine if all such groups are incoherent.  Showing that all lattices in a product of trees are incoherent would be an indication that coherence is a quasi-isometry invariant.  The project will also determine if any two infinite order elements in a lattice in a product of trees either commute or generate a free subgroup, when raised to high powers.

The homotopy groups of spheres are collections of continuous functions between spheres considered up to certain deformations.  These groups hold fundamental information about maps between topological spaces and have deep connections to number theory, differential topology, and geometric topology.  However, despite their simple definition, the homotopy groups of spheres are extremely difficult to compute.  To better understand these groups, chromatic homotopy theory is a powerful tool that organizes theory and computations by analyzing the algebraic geometry of smooth one-parameter formal groups.  The moduli stack of formal groups has a stratification by height, which corresponds in the stable homotopy category to localizations with respect to the Lubin-Tate theories. The Lubin-Tate theories give rise to higher periodicity in the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and studying them is one of the most important areas of research in chromatic homotopy theory.  Starting from Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel's resolution of the Kervaire invariant problem, the newly developed equivariant machinery offers new methods to attack problems in chromatic homotopy theory that were notoriously difficult to approach via classical methods.  The planned research explores the connections between equivariant homotopy theory and chromatic homotopy theory, and uses cutting-edge equivariant technology to produce state-of-the-art computations in chromatic homotopy theory.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will study periodicity phenomena in the stable homotopy groups of spheres through the lens of equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory. In current and ongoing projects, the PI establishes the first known connection between the obstruction-theoretic actions in chromatic homotopy theory and the geometry of complex conjugations. Using this newly discovered connection, the PI will study Lubin-Tate theories as equivariant spectra and use equivariant machinery developed by Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel to produce higher chromatic height computations at the prime 2.  This project aims to deepen the connection between equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory by proving Periodicity, Gap, and Detection theorems for norms of Real bordism theories and fixed points of Lubin-Tate theories.

The techniques spring from gauge theory, Floer theory, holomorphic curve techniques, and the theorems and conjectures find applications and connections in several fields, such as: smooth manifold topology, hyperbolic geometry, dynamics, complex analysis in several variables, and complex algebraic geometry. Building on his extensive and collaborative research, the PI aims to study many unique questions and conjectures that sit at the intersection of symplectic/contact topology and smooth manifold topology in low dimensions, and complex analysis. The proposed research and its outcomes will greatly impact our current understanding of geometric topology in low dimensions.

The transformation groups such as diffeomorphism groups and homeomorphism groups of a manifold describe all symmetries of the manifold. A manifold is a space that is locally a Euclidean space. The surface of the earth, the surface of a donut and our three or four dimensional universe are all examples of manifolds. The mapping class group is a reduced form of the homeomorphism group of a manifold, in which two transformations are identified if they can be connected by a path of transformations.  These objects have connections with many areas of mathematics, including geometric topology, geometric group theory, dynamics, number theory, quantum field theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. This project studies a number of questions about the structure of symmetries of manifolds.  Broader impacts of these efforts include reading groups for graduate students. <br/><br/>Previously, in a joint work with Kathryn Mann, the principal investigator has proved Ghys' dimension conjecture that given two manifolds M and N, if the homeomorphism group of M has a nontrivial homomorphism to the homeomorphism group of N, then the dimension of M must be less than or equal to the dimension of N. To prove this, an ""Orbit Classification Theorem"" is developed, which says that every orbit of such a homomorphism is homeomorphic to a cover of some configuration space of M. This finding has a potential to give more results about classifying homomorphisms between transformation groups. Since we have figured out all orbits, now the challenge is to understand how to glue those orbits inside the manifold N.  Another line of work studies the projection map from the transformation group to the mapping class group. In particular, we ask which subgroups of the mapping class group have sections under the projection, where the existence of sections implies that the surface bundle that the subgroup determines will admit a flat structure. In previous work on this subgroup question the principal investigator has proved several results using techniques of ""hidden torsion"" and rotation number. More tools will be developed specifically to attack this question. Another direction to explore concerns diffeomorphism groups of high dimensional manifolds, specifically, whether there is an example of an infinite torsion group that acts faithfully on some manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One fruitful approach is to address the question, ?Given the most salient or easily measured features of an object, how can we predict its global shape or long term behavior??  The research in this proposal is directed at addressing this question in the low dimensional setting, focusing on the topology and geometry of three-dimensional spaces with connections to dynamics.  At its core, the investigator will employ two basic techniques.  The first is to model a complex system with its basic building blocks. For example, his work with Landry and Minsky shows how dynamical properties of important three-dimension flows are combinatorially encoded by a triangulation of the underlying space.  The second is to use probabilistic techniques that aim to understand the ?typical? behavior within a complicated dynamical system.  This is the focus of his work with Gekhtman and Tiozzo on properties of random symmetries of negatively curved spaces.  In conjunction with this research, the proposal also seeks to support student involvement in related fields within the Philadelphia area through new local seminars and the continued mentoring of graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>In greater detail, the proposed research projects divide into three themes.  The first is to study the topology and geometry of three-manifolds using a new polynomial invariant of veering triangulations.  The polynomial extends McMullen?s Teichmuller polynomial to more general pseudo-Anosov flows, detects faces of the Thurston norm ball, and packages relative growth rates of the associated flow.  The second set of projects seeks to extend these insights to study automorphisms of surface groups and free groups.  This includes a project, joint with Dowdall, to build a canonical ideal simplicial complex associated to a hyperbolic free-by-cycle group that encodes the various splitting of the group.  The final set of projects concerns dynamics in group theory. First, the investigator will prove general central limit theorems for the distribution of geometric quantities in finitely generated groups when sampling with respect to the word metric. Second, in collaboration with Gupta, the PI plans to solve a conjecture of Handel?Mosher by demonstrating that a typical free group automorphism and its inverse have distinct stretch factors.

The PI's activities in this project, including mentorship and developing virtual mathematics communities, will create new educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, with special focus on increasing diversity in and access to mathematics. <br/><br/>The project will study key questions and structures in low-dimensional topology through a variety of invariants built from Lagrangian submanifolds. This includes using the description of knot Floer and Khovanov tangle invariants in terms of immersed Lagrangians in the four-punctured sphere to study the nugatory crossing conjecture, obtain lower bounds on the rank of knot homology theories in the presence of an essential Conway sphere, and prove detection results for the tangle invariants for certain classes of tangles. The PI will use the immersed Lagrangian invariants from bordered Heegaard Floer homology to give new bounds on the unknotting numbers of satellite knots. The PI will also use Lagrangians in the pillowcase arising from SU(2)-character varieties of knots towards the three-summands conjecture, which predicts that Dehn surgery on a knot in the three-sphere cannot consist of more than two prime summands. The PI will also mentor graduate students to develop new structural properties of symplectic instanton homology and to study the knot Floer homology of tunnel number one knots. In addition to organizing various seminars, the PI will assist in the development of the Floer homology open problem list and continue mentorship and other activities with the aim of promotion of underrepresented groups in mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project thus concentrates on those aspects that are different from purely computational work. Instead, as a robot moves from place to place, it senses its environment, acts within it to achieve some goal, responds to changes in it, and might communicate with others.  The interactions with the external environment are typically achieved via changes to some internal states, so that, for example, a given motion performed on two different occasions (even under identical external conditions) could be the result of different changes to the internal state of the robot. By building abstract topological models of these issues, the PI, in collaboration with M. Farber in the UK, will use algebraic and geometric tools to shed light on some of the tradeoffs (for example of stability of output against flexibility in being able to handle a variety of environments) that necessarily arise when solving such problems.<br/><br/>The first step in this direction, a numerical invariant that measures the amount of instability necessary, no matter the computational resources available, for robotic motion planning, or equivalently the minimum amount of stochasticity necessary is the topological complexity invented almost twenty years ago by Farber, and frequently studied by cohomological tools.  To understand the additional cost of flexibility"", the costs imposed by needing to solve a motion planning problem but in a variety of different environments (say for a Roomba to learn its way around a room after the furniture has been moved), D. Cohen, Farber, and the PI introduced parametrized topological complexity; preliminary calculations show that it does indeed capture some new phenomena that the ordinary complexity does not.  Besides further development of topological and parametrized complexity, this project aims to study the role of hidden states (e.g. moving from one fiber to another of a work map), sensing (e.g. the role of incomplete information about the environment that unfolds over time), the development of a useful technology for genus of non-fibrations, and the use of persistent homology to understand about the role of resources (e.g. the speed, path length, energy usage, sensing costs, etc.) in planning tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project studies the properties of surfaces, which fall into two categories: finite-type and infinite-type. The theory of finite-type surfaces has been historically more developed than that of infinite-type surfaces, partly because there is a simple classification of all finite-type surfaces. The primary goal of the research project is to significantly deepen understanding of infinite-type surfaces, which are ubiquitous in topology, geometry, and dynamics. The first part is aimed at characterizing their geometric symmetries (isometry groups). The second and third parts concern their topological symmetries (mapping class groups), with the long-term goal of completely classifying the different types of topological symmetries.  The educational component of this project consists of three parts. The first part is a research training and professional development graduate student workshop for members of groups underrepresented in algebra, geometry, topology, and number theory. This workshop is aimed at early-career graduate students and intended to serve as a bridge between successful programs like the EDGE summer program and research-focused workshops for advanced graduate students. One of the goals is to support the participants in their transition between coursework and research-based mathematics. The second part of the educational component is the expansion of an existing high school outreach program in Salt Lake City that will serve students from the most diverse districts of the city. The third part is a speaker series featuring prominent individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>The research focus of this project is on infinite-type surfaces and their groups of symmetries. Infinite-type surfaces arise naturally in many contexts, such as in the study of group actions on the plane, and are intimately related to the study of quasiconformal maps. The first part of this project, aimed at characterizing isometry groups of infinite-type surfaces, is inspired by Felix Klein's suggestion from 1872 that groups of geometric symmetries be used to better understand the geometry of Riemann surfaces. The results regarding isometry groups are used in-turn to produce algebraic invariants of the mapping class group. This group can be thought of as the group of topological symmetries of the surface and is the focus of the second and third parts of the project. In particular, the second part is aimed at producing algebraic invariants of the mapping class groups of infinite-type surfaces via subgroup constructions, and the third part focuses on using the actions of mapping class groups on hyperbolic graphs to produce a Nielsen-Thurston type classification for these surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to create new algebraic and geometric tools to formulate ideas and methods of quantum physics in a precise mathematical way.  Specifically, the theory of quantum groups associated with Lie algebras has been widely and productively used in low-dimensional topology, and in particular, with the creation of quantum invariants.  Within this context, the Principal Investigator (PI) and his collaborators have offered new systematic strategies to define re-normalized quantum invariants arising from non-semi-simple categories.  The focus of this grant is to develop a framework for many of the quantum invariants coming from both semi-simple and non-semi-simple categories.  The unique properties of such a framework opens the door to new research avenues in algebra, topology, geometry, mathematical physics, and related areas of mathematics.  The broader impacts of this grant address two main categories: mentoring and outreach.  Throughout the project, the PI will advise graduate students and postdocs on projects related to the main objectives of the grant.  The PI has co-organized many conferences and a workshop and will continue such outreach with the aim of developing communication and collaborative research with other mathematicians, as well as fostering broader applications of the work of this grant.<br/><br/><br/>This grant considers four types of invariants arising from non-semi-simple categories: Hennings, Kuperberg, Reshetikhin-Turaev re-normalized Quantum Invariants (RQIs) and Turaev-Viro RQIs. All of these invariants have unique features and strengths. In particular, Hennings and Kuperberg invariants are defined using the structure of Hopf algebras (and thus have many examples) but have certain vanishings which do not allow extensions to full TQFTs; the RQIs are quite powerful and their definitions are based on representation theory making their existence for some significant examples elusive. This project will generalize and re-normalize both Hennings and Kuperberg invariants and show that the new invariants lead to TQFTs with additional data (overcoming the vanishing obstruction). Furthermore, the PI will construct a general framework which relates the Hennings and Kuperberg type invariants to the previously defined Reshetikhin-Turaev and Turaev-Viro RQIs, allowing a unification of the strengths of all four invariants. The PI will use this framework to advance and draw connections with Chern-Simons theory with complex (super) groups and Levin-Wen models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to robotics and to the analysis of large data sets, and a recent revolution in the foundations of algebraic topology has broadened its applicability to other fields of pure mathematics. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several well-known questions and conjectures in algebraic geometry. Some of these questions will be investigated jointly with students as part of undergraduate research projects in the Mathematical Computing Laboratory at UIC, which the PI founded in 2015 with David Dumas and Jan Verschelde.

A foliation looks locally like a decomposition of the manifold as a union of parallel submanifolds of lower dimensions. Such geometric structures naturally arise in physics and geology. And in mathematics the depth and breadth of foliated objects made mathematicians use tools from many different branches of mathematics including differential geometry, homotopy theory, noncommutative geometry, ergodic theory and dynamical systems. The PI intends to use new tools from homotopy theory to investigate the relation between foliations and diffeomorphism groups.<br/><br/>The existence and classification of foliations and the implication of such structures on the global topology of manifolds have been extensively studied in the past five decades. However, there are still many mysteries, perhaps the most important of which in the homotopy theory of foliation is the Haefliger conjecture. Haefliger asked whether all plane fields on a manifold whose dimensions are roughly less than the half of the dimension of the manifold are integrable up to homotopy. It was shown by Mather and Thurston that the homotopy theory of foliations is naturally related to the homological invariants of the diffeomorphism groups made discrete.  But the group homologies of diffeomorphism groups as discrete groups tend to be very large and are poorly understood. On the other hand diffeomorphism group with the Whitney topology is better understood, in particular, Galatius and Randal-Williams' program developed new tools to study the classifying space of these groups with the Whitney topology. The PI's plan is to combine the new homotopy theoretical methods that stem from the evolving field of the moduli space of manifolds with the classical foliation theory to study homological invariants of diffeomorphism groups made discrete.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manifolds arise naturally in physics (our universe as a 4-dimensional manifold), computer science (graphics), and biology (investigating how the shape and ""knottedness"" of molecules like DNA affect their function). In many ways, this subject is especially interesting for 4-dimensional spaces. Fortunately, a manifold can often be studied using the lower-dimensional manifolds that sit inside of it. Remarkably, several of the most important questions about 4-dimensional manifolds can be reduced to asking if a given knotted circle in 3-space arises as the boundary of a 2-dimensional disk in 4-space. This project aims to develop new techniques to tackle this latter problem and related questions, with a range of applications in 4-dimensional topology. Of particular interest are the disks and surfaces in 4-space that arise as solution sets to equations with two complex variables, known as ""complex plane curves"". Such surfaces exhibit surprising connections to foundational questions about 4-manifolds, as well as connections to other areas of mathematics, such as the mathematical theory of braids. In addition, aspects of the project aim to illuminate the connections between complex plane curves and important topological tools that have deep connections to mathematical physics. These projects include accessible entry points for undergraduate research.<br/><br/>The project is guided by three interrelated questions: (1) When does a knot in 3-space bound a disk (or another low-genus surface) in 4-space? (2) How unique is an embedded surface in a 4-manifold, up to isotopy? (3) Which smooth surfaces in complex manifolds are isotopic to complex curves? For all three questions, the PI aims to blend constructive techniques (such as handle calculus and branched coverings) to enhance the power of obstructive tools like Heegaard Floer homology and Khovanov homology. Further investigation of the cobordism maps in the aforementioned homology theories will help shed light on whether these tools can be used to detect pairs of orientable surfaces in 4-dimensional space that are ""exotically knotted"", i.e., isotopic through ambient homeomorphisms but not diffeomorphisms. In particular, the PI will use these homology theories to investigate uniqueness problems for complex curves. In addition, the PI will continue to develop topological techniques for studying complex curves in 4-space and other 4-manifolds, including novel techniques using singular foliations inspired by the theory of characteristic foliations in contact geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On the one hand, symmetries represent rigid structure of a space-ways in which the space is the same under operations like rotation or reflection. Deformations, on the other hand, purposely elide rigid structures so as to allow us to understand rough features of spaces.  Examples of these features include the number of holes or the number of separate pieces of the space.  These two approaches to understanding spaces combine in equivariant algebraic topology.  Algebraic topology is an area of mathematics that studies complicated and frequently high dimensional spaces via algebraic invariants, and equivariant algebraic topology incorporates the symmetries of the spaces into the invariants in a robust way.  This field has connections to subjects such as mathematical physics and data analysis.  The PI's work advances state-of-the-art knowledge in this area by developing both computational and theoretical tools to analyze the structures of and relationships between the invariants in equivariant algebraic topology.  Particular contexts of interest also include questions related to algebraic and topological K-theory, invariants that are at the heart of modern approaches to topology, algebra and number theory.   Additionally, the funds from this grant will assist the PI in her outreach activities designed to promote women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics, including her work with the newly formed Vanderbilt student chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics and the Vanderbilt Directed Reading Program.  These programs will expand the reach of mathematical thinking and give a wider variety of students the opportunity to be part of the project of mathematics, creating both a broader base for the mathematical community and more mathematically literate members of society.  <br/><br/>Recent developments in homotopy theory have highlighted the importance of equivariance, as well as the many ways in which equivariance remains poorly understood.

The PI's research program will develop new tools for extending these kinds of calculations as well as deepening our overall picture of the surprising ways in which symmetry manifests itself in homotopical considerations.  Her program focuses on the interplay of different groups of symmetries, both at a topological and algebraic level. At the algebraic level, these new developments in this area will allow mathematicians to fully exploit algebraic tools in understanding topological spaces with group actions.  At the topological level, her work will provide a basis for advances relating to duality, chromatic homotopy theory and algebraic K-theory.

For example, the surface of the earth or the surface of a donut are examples of manifolds.  In this case, on the surface there are two directions to move in and hence they are called 2-dimensional manifolds.  This award will be used to study the topology of manifolds in dimensions 3 and 4 as well as how the natural submanifolds in both dimensions interact.  The study of manifolds in dimensions 3 and 4 are of utmost important in science as it uncovers information about the world we live in (3-dimensions) as well as 4-dimensional objects which can be seen as space-time.  The main goal of this project is to better understand which knots and links can be the slice of sphere in 3-dimensional space as it moves through space-time, called slice knots and links.  This is especially important in studying the topology of 4-dimensional manifolds as it relates to one of the most important questions in topology:  the Smooth 4-dimensional Poincare Conjecture.  This conjecture says that if one can compute certain information about a 4-dimensional manifold and one gets the same answer as for the standard 4-dimensional sphere, then it is actually a sphere.  This is the only dimension where it is still unknown. In addition, the PI aims to make progress to the famous Slice-ribbon Conjecture, which says that if a knot is slice then we can deform the 4-sphere in space-time so that is it ""nice"".

It can be defined abstractly, as a collection of strings of letters, where certain equations describe which two strings correspond to the same symmetry.  Such letters are called generators, and the equations are called relations, and together they form what is called a group presentation.  Geometric group theory studies the connection between the geometry of the object, and the properties of the group of its symmetries. An example of a group is the set of integers, which can be viewed as symmetries of a line, where a positive number moves points on the line to the right, and a negative number to the left.  A subgroup of a group is a smaller collection of symmetries, closed under composition. In the group of integers, an example of a subgroup is the collection of the symmetries moving by an even distance. Understanding the subgroup structure is essential in studying the whole group.  This project will address questions about subgroups with prescribed properties in two families of groups: Artin groups and lattices in products of trees. Groups in both of those families can be described by simple looking presentations, but many questions about them remain unanswered.  The project will also promote the participation of women in mathematics via mentoring and outreach.<br/><br/>The first goal of this project is to examine the actions of Artin groups on CAT(0) cube complexes.  This project will investigate for which Artin groups is every group element is separated by some codimension-1 subgroup, and for which of them this leads to proper actions on CAT(0) cube complexes.  The theory of CAT(0) cube complexes, and special cube complexes in particular, has been a fruitful tool in understanding groups.  Proving that Artin groups act properly on CAT(0) cube complexes would answer many outstanding questions about Artin groups; for example, it could provide a solution to the word problem.  The PI will also continue her work on the residual finiteness of Artin groups in this project.  In the second project, the PI will study cocompact lattices in products of trees and their subgroup structures.  In particular, the PI will determine if all such groups are incoherent.  Showing that all lattices in a product of trees are incoherent would be an indication that coherence is a quasi-isometry invariant.  The project will also determine if any two infinite order elements in a lattice in a product of trees either commute or generate a free subgroup, when raised to high powers.  The project also includes training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students with an emphasis on broadening participation of women in mathematics.  The PI is also planning a collaborative educational project with Jankiewicz Studio, a design firm specializing in educational and cultural projects at the intersection of design, art, science and technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A set of constructions known as ""Heegaard Floer homology"" brings together many of these perspectives and forms a key nexus in this web of ideas. As a result, there is much interest in Heegaard Floer homology as a guiding light for understanding this web more broadly and pushing out toward the applications of most mathematical and practical significance. This project aims to exploit the locality inherent in Heegaard Floer homology to understand a long-sought-after algebraic operation based on principles of higher symmetry, and to use this new structure to advance adjacent fields of research. This project will support the professional development of students and other early-career mathematicians through research collaborations, mentoring activities, and outreach, including organization of conferences and seminars.<br/> <br/>In more detail, this project builds on recent work which uncovered a relationship between the lower-dimensional or more-local aspects of Heegaard Floer homology and tensor products for higher representations of categorified quantum groups. Such tensor products have long been recognized as a crucial element needed for further progress in this area, but only in certain cases have they been defined. This project will expand our knowledge of the structure of Heegaard Floer homology using higher tensor products as an organizing principle, while also using insights from the extensive Heegaard Floer literature to understand more about higher tensor products in general and to develop new links with areas ranging from geometric representation theory to amplituhedra in physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
