The primary focus is on the bundle theory and classifying spaces<br/>within each model.  In both of these models, a bundle-theoretic perspective<br/>leads to deep and unexpected new relations between topology and combinatorics:<br/>the primary objective of this research is to expand on these relations.  The<br/>project's goals include both combinatorial applications in topology (for<br/>instance, combinatorial formulas for topological invariants) and topological<br/>results in combinatorics (particularly on the topology of posets of oriented<br/>matroids and polytopes).  The classifying spaces for Gelfand and MacPherson's<br/>theory derive from certain partially ordered sets of oriented matroids, and<br/>have close ties to the real Grassmannian.  Among the objectives of this<br/>research are a closer knowledge of the topology of the combinatorial<br/>Grassmannian and applications of this knowledge both to real vector bundles <br/>and to various combinatorial problems.  Mnev and Mani's theory also appears<br/>to give rise to a classifying space of interest in both topology and<br/>combinatorics, relating PL manifolds and convex polytopes.  The author will<br/>also study a new type of ``non-Euclidean'' pathology in oriented matroids and<br/>its implications for combinatorial differential manifolds.<br/>     Much of the power of these combinatorial models for topology derives<br/>from the elegance with which topological concepts translate into combinatorial <br/>analogs.  One can, for instance, derive combinatorial formulas for topological<br/>invariants by simply translating each element of a topological formula into<br/>its combinatorial equivalent. The translation from combinatorics to topology<br/>has proven equally useful: these models have provided a new framework in which<br/>to view various combinatorial topics.  Both models have revealed a<br/>vector-bundle perspective on various combinatorial problems that originally<br/>appeared to have no connection to real vector bundles, leading to unexpected <br/>topological proofs.  This project will build on recent results in this area<br/>whose depth lies in uniting the combinatorial side of mathematics, rooted in<br/>counting things, to the topological side, rooted in plasticity and spatial<br/>continuity.<br/>***<br/>"

These spaces play an important role in various areas of mathematics,  including topology, algebraic geometry, geometric analysis, and quantum  field theory.  For example, in algebraic geometry these spaces have been  fruitfully explored in solving enumerative problems.  In this project,  the investigator is studying intersection numbers on the moduli spaces of  stable curves and stable maps.  He intends to use this study in order to  understand natural deformations of a certain class of cohomological field  theories.  The investigator is also studying the topology of moduli spaces  of stable maps, which are important in their own right.  Even a particular  case, the case of the moduli spaces of stable curves, has generated a  lot of interesting mathematics.       For the past decade, the interaction between mathematics and physics  has provided many beautiful, and sometimes unexpected, results and  conjectures.  In particular, geometry has incorporated many ideas and  much intuition from string theory in physics.  String theory treats  a particle as a small loop rather than a point.  When a particle moves  in time it traces out a surface.  Therefore understanding geometries on  surfaces, which has always been of interest to mathematicians, has also  become important in physics.  In this project, the investigator is studying  the spaces that incorporate information about all geometries on a given  surface.  He is also studying geometries on surfaces living inside a given  space.  For example, one can count the number of surfaces satisfying  certain constraints inside the given space.  Amazingly, the origin in  physics of this subject is topological gravity.    ***"

They will continue to develop lattice gauge field theory  based on quantum SL(2,C).  This will lead to a general description of  the Kauffman bracket skein module of a 3-manifold as invariant  functions of the quantized flat SL(2,C) connections on a spine of the  three-manifold.  The goal is an intimate understanding of the  relationship between configurations lying in a manifold and the  algebraic structure of the Kauffman bracket skein module.  It should  also lead to a rigorous derivation of Witten's asymptotic expansion of  quantum invariants in terms of the representation theory of the  manifold.  A hyperbolic structure on the complement of a knot induces  a similarity structure on the peripheral torus.  It is their intention  to carry out an analogous construction in the noncommutative  setting.  They will derive a noncommutative analog of the A-polynomial,  which will in turn allow the relationship between the A-polynomial and  the colored Jones polynomial to be explicated.  This work will uncover  that part of the Jones polynomial that is related to the hyperbolic  geometry of the knot complement.  Finally they will see how the  Kauffman bracket skein module of a knot induces a geometry on the  noncommutative torus.       The best way to understand topology is as an extension of  elementary geometry.  Recall that two triangles are congruent if there  is a rigid motion of the plane that takes one to the other.  Rigid means  that the motion preserves all distances and angles.  The geometric  classification of triangles states that two triangles are congruent if  their sides are of the same length.  In topology, a larger collection  of congruence transformations is used, specifically any motion of the  plane that sends near points to near points (although the  transformation may distort distances).  Sometimes topology is refer red  to as rubber sheet geometry, as congruence transformations may stretch  the plane arbitrarily.  Under this notion of geometry, any two  triangles are congruent, and in fact they are all congruent to a  circle.  The topological study of circles embedded in 3-space (knots)  is much more subtle.  A major problem is how to make ``topological''  measurements.  That is, associate numbers to a knot that are unchanged  by topological congruence transformations.  In the 1980's, work of Jones  and Witten heralded a new age of knot theory with the introduction of  quantum invariants.  These invariants are derived from techniques in  operator theory and quantum mechanics.  Frohman and his students will  study these invariants from a viewpoint that allows them to be related  to invariants of knots coming from more classical techniques.  These  investigations will enrich topology, quantum mechanics, and operator  algebras by adding deeper connections between standard constructions  in each field.  ***"

One part of the project is to analyze a certain partial order on conjugacy classes in the mapping class group of a four times punctured disk.  The goal is to find a description of this partial order, in terms of the known combinatorial structure of the mapping class group, that is more transparent and more amenable to computation than the standard dynamical one.  The second part of the project extends the principal investigator's joint work with Mark Feighn on coherence of groups.  The focus is on deciding which one-relator groups are coherent.  The third and final part of the project is a continuation of work with Mladen Bestvina and Mark Feighn on the outer automorphism group of a free group.  The goal of this part of the proposal is to formulate and prove a structure theorem for a class of finitely generated subgroups that contains, for example, all abelian subgroups.      The pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism is one of the most important concepts in the areas of mathematics known as three-dimensional geometry, three-dimensional topology, and two-dimensional dynamical systems.  The study of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms began in the mid-1970's.  During the decade that followed, a great deal of progress was made in analyzing their behavior.  Since then progress has slowed, in part because only the more difficult problems remain.  Chief among these problems is an understanding of the ""forcing partial order,"" which, roughly speaking, describes the way in which simple two dimensional systems change into chaotic ones.  The principal investigator will use extensive computer calculations and techniques from other areas of mathematics, especially that of geometric group theory to investigate this problem.  The application of techniques derived from a variety of mathematical subfields should prove effective in illuminating this problem.  The other parts of the project focus on the algebraic analogs of the p seudo-Anosov homeomorphisms and will use techniques that are common to dynamical systems and geometric group theory."

The tunnel number of a  knot has been shown to behave quite erratically under the operation of  connected sum of knots.  The project entails a more general investigation  into the role of incompressible surfaces as they relate to Heegaard  splittings.  In particular, it should provide information on (1) lower  bounds of the tunnel number of knots relative to their generalized prime  decompositions; (2) bounds on the degeneration of tunnel number under  connected sum of knots; (3) torus decompositions of manifolds; (4) the  Heegaard genus of Haken manifolds; and (5) stabilization problems.       The general philosophy of this project stems from a realization that  3-dimensional manifolds have been studied from several viewpoints.  Two of  these viewpoints involve cutting the 3-manifold along surfaces into basic  building blocks.  The idea of cutting along a surface to understand the  3-manifold in which the surface lies, is a natural extension of the idea  of cutting along circles to understand the surface in which the circles  lie.  In the case of surfaces, the analysis of the circles contained in  the surface suffices to characterize the surface.  A complete classification  has been obtained.  3-manifolds have proven to be far less tractable  objects.  In fact, extending the idea that has been so successful for the  analysis of surfaces has engendered two very different viewpoints in the  study of 3-manifolds.  The investigator endeavors to reconcile these two  viewpoints.  ***"

Validity of the conjecture implies validity for the  Novikov conjecture (homotopy invariance of higher signatures), the  stable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture (necessary and sufficient  conditions for a closed Spin manifold to admit a Riemannian metric of  positive scalar curvature), and the Kadison-Kaplansky conjecture  (non-existence of idempotents in the reduced C*-algebra of a  torsion-free discrete group).  When applied to Lie groups, the  conjecture makes precise the Mackey-Wigner analogy between the  tempered representation theory of a semi-simple Lie group G and the  representation theory of the semi-direct product Lie group that  Mackey and Wigner associate to G.  Thus the conjecture is unusual in  that it cuts across several different areas of mathematics and unifies  a number of problems and issues that previously appeared to be  unrelated.       A theme in nineteenth and twentieth century mathematics has been  that certain features of mathematical systems that at first glance  seem to be analytical (i.e., based on methods of calculus such as  differentiation and integration) in fact are topological (i.e., depend  only on elementary continuous geometry).

Brylinski will continue his work on the geometric structures<br/>occurring in mathematical physics, particularly in gauge theory, loop<br/>spaces, and moduli spaces of vector bundles.  Gauge groups are of<br/>fundamental importance in modern geometry.  The gauge groups on a<br/>circle are loop groups, and gauge groups in dimension 2 are closely<br/>related to conformal field theory.  Brylinski will study certain<br/>cohomology classes he has constructed for gauge groups, which are<br/>natural generalizations of the degree-two cohomology class giving the<br/>central extension of a loop group.  These classes are obtained by a<br/>transgression process from the Chern-Simons classes and the Chern<br/>classes of Beilinson.  The first new example is that of a degree-three<br/>cohomology class in the gauge group of a closed surface.  Brylinski<br/>has shown that these classes obey reciprocity laws that generalize<br/>those of conformal field theory.  He will investigate to what extent<br/>they are related to higher-dimensional field theories.  He will study<br/>the Kaehler geometry of moduli spaces of vector bundles, continuing<br/>his work with P. Foth, and intends to study the geometric quantization<br/>of these moduli spaces.  Brylinski will also continue his work on the<br/>Quillen metric on determinant line bundles, which should lead to<br/>methods to compute it geometrically, as opposed to analytically, in<br/>many situations.  Here he will use both the differential geometry of<br/>gerbes that he developed and a variant of Deligne cohomology he<br/>introduced, which incorporates hermitian metrics.  Brylinski will<br/>continue his investigation of the differential geometry of the space<br/>of knots in a smooth three-manifold, which he previously showed is a<br/>Kaehler manifold, more precisely a union of coadjoint orbits of the<br/>group of unimodular diffeomorphisms.  A particular object of study<br/>will be the structure of various Lie algebras of functionals with<br/>respect to the Poisson bracket.<br/>     The research of J.-L. Brylinski is concerned with the interface<br/>between geometry and mathematical physics.  This interface has been<br/>growing steadily in the recent past and has had profound consequences<br/>for various branches of geometry: algebraic, differential, and symplectic,<br/>among others.  For instance, Edward Witten (School of Natural Sciences,<br/>Institute for Advanced Study) interpreted the Jones polynomial<br/>for knots in terms of field theory in three dimensions connected to<br/>the Chern-Simons class.  Also, Verlinde derived a formula for<br/>Riemann-Roch numbers of a line bundle over a moduli space of bundles<br/>over a Riemann surface, using ideas from conformal field theory.  All<br/>these facts point to the need for new types of geometry that include<br/>generalizations of the concept of a vector bundle or a principal<br/>bundle.  For this purpose, Brylinski has developed a theory of the<br/>differential geometry of groupoids and gerbes, which he is applying to<br/>the study of gauge groups, moduli spaces of vector bundles, Quillen<br/>line bundles, and the space of knots.  Although the basic concepts he<br/>employs are of an abstract nature, they can often lead to concrete<br/>formulas.  For instance, he has obtained a concrete description of<br/>Quillen metrics on some geometric determinant line bundles connected<br/>with line bundles over Riemann surfaces.  This research is expected to<br/>result in a better understanding of the geometric underpinnings of<br/>mathematical physics.<br/>***<br/><br/>"

Recent  results, beginning with the work of Rips and Sela, have shown that the  toral decomposition of 3-manifolds due to Jaco-Shalen and Johannson can  be generalized to the much broader setting of finitely presented groups  (this is called the JSJ decomposition).  This generalization points  towards a hierarchy for groups that terminates with indecomposable groups.  For example, one would begin with a finitely presented group, split it as  an amalgam over a trivial or infinite cyclic group, and then proceed  iteratively on the vertex groups.  One would then want to know if such a  process terminates with groups that are indecomposable as amalgams over  a trivial or cyclic group.  One also wants to know if a quasi-isometry  between groups preserves the JSJ-decomposition.  This quasi-isometric  invariance holds in the hyperbolic setting by deep work of Bowditch, but  it remains a mystery in general.       A 3-manifold is a space that looks locally like the space in which  we live; for instance, one can take a cube and glue opposite faces together  in pairs.  There is a very rich and beautiful decomposition theory for  3-manifolds that tells us that a 3-manifold can be cut up into simpler  pieces.  Recently, some very surprising work has shown that a good part of  this decomposition theory generalizes to a far broader setting, namely to  groups, groups being the mathematically precise way to describe symmetry.  However, the picture of group decompositions is far from complete.  The aim  of this project is to investigate the extent to which groups can be  decomposed into simpler pieces.  ***"

These relations are associated with building one  space out of another by using basic operations like push-outs and  wedges.  The primary goal is to understand the lattice of the  equivalence classes of these relations (the so called Bousfield and  cellular classes).  In particular, the investigator has been looking  into possibilities of extending the Bousfield classification of a  sub-lattice of finite, p-torsion, SUSPENSION complexes to certain  non-suspension spaces.  For this purpose he has been studying homotopy  algebraic structures on spaces that are preserved by Bousfield  localization and Dror Farjoun colocalization functors.  Hurewicz  homomorphisms are an important source of examples of such structures.  Many traditional theorems in homotopy theory are reflections of  properties of the lattice of Bousfield classes.  For example,  classically the Blakers-Massey triad theorem was about connectivity of  certain fibers, i.e., it was shown that these fibers are built from  spheres of some high dimension.  It turns out that allowing other  spaces as building blocks, one can give more accurate Bousfield class  estimations.  Moreover, in this way statements that previously seemed  not to be related can be unified.  This is also a good starting point  for investigating similar relations in other settings, especially in  cases where one does do not have any natural choice of objects  analogous to spheres in the category of spaces.       Over the years it has become evident that homotopy theory methods are  useful in describing many fundamental concepts and capturing their  essential properties.  This has happened in a wide variety of settings  from manifold theory and algebraic geometry to physics.  Homotopy  theory is particularly helpful in studying those properties that are  local, i.e., that can be observed and  analyzed by forgetting the  information that is irrelevant to the problem.  In this way one can  focus on the most essential information and organize data in terms  that are easier to grasp.  Thus in this case the homotopy theory works  as a simplifying tool.  As a result, for example, one can see new  relations between objects that previously seemed not to be related.  Homotopy theory is also fruitfully applied in studying certain  algebraic structures (algebraic structures up to homotopy).  Ignoring  fine structure and using this coarser classification allows one to  cover more ground.  Physics is one of the main sources of examples of  this.  Algebraic structures are used in capturing symmetry of objects.  In this way homotopy theory can work as a distinguishing tool.  An  object with more symmetry must be different from one that is less  symmetric.  Studying the interplay between these two tools is also  profitable.  For example, to understand better the organization  principles of the localization process, it is helpful to know to what  extent it preserves a homotopy algebraic structure, and in order to  apply these tools fully, one still needs to understand the way they  behave in the test case of topological spaces.  ***"

On overlapping patches of M, the coordinates  are related by transformations in the Lie group G.  Following Cartan  and Ehresmann, the coordinate charts globalize to a ""development"" of  the universal covering space U of M into G/H, defining a homomorphism  of the fundamental group F of M (realized as the group of deck  transformations of U).  One forms a moduli space Def(M,G/H) of  geometric structures on M modelled on G/H which classifies structures  up to equivalence.  Def(M,G/H) is itself locally homeomorphic to a  moduli space of equivalence classes of homomorphisms Hom(F,G)/G.  The  prototype of these moduli spaces is the Teichmuller space, classifying  hyperbolic structures (here G/H is the real hyperbolic plane and G =  PSL(2,R)).  Moreover the mapping class group of M acts on both  Def(M,G/H) and Hom(F,G)/G, and the holonomy map from Def(M,G/H) ->  Hom(F,G)/G is equivariant with respect to these actions.  This  investigation mainly concentrates on the case when F is the fundamental  group of a compact surface.  When M is a closed surface, these moduli  spaces carry invariant symplectic structures, and when G is compact the  investigator conjectures that the symplectic measure is ergodic under  the action of the mapping class group.  When G is SL(2,R), this moduli  space is related to Teichmuller space of (possibly singular) hyperbolic  structures, and the investigator has used geometric structures to study  the dynamics on the moduli space.  This dynamical study relates the  action of the discrete mapping class group to certain Hamiltonian flows  on the moduli space.  When G/H is Minkowski 2+1-space, the investigator  (in collaboration with Drumm) is studying the deformation spaces of  complete flat manifolds, using ""crooked planes"" developed in Drumm's  thesis and ideas of Margulis.  When G/H is complex hyperbo lic 2-space,  Xia has classified the connected components of Hom(F,G)/G and the  investigator (in collaboration with Leeb and Kapovich) has found discrete  embeddings in each component.  When G/H is the real projective plane,  the work of the investigator combined with that of Choi gives a complete  description of the deformation space Def(M,G/H).       Such geometric structures represent a way of relating topology and  geometry.  According to Felix Klein's Erlangen program, geometry is  the study of relations between objects in a homogeneous space G/H of a  Lie group G that are invariant under the transformations in G.  They  include ""rigid"" geometric properties such as distance, angle,  parallelism and collinearity.  On the other hand, topology studies the  loose organization of points on a manifold M, where the only relations  derive from continuous mapping.  A geometric structure on M more  rigidly organizes its points through local coordinate charts from open  sets in M to G/H.  Moduli spaces parametrize equivalence classes of  these structures and closely relate to spaces of homomorphisms of the  fundamental group of M into G.  These moduli spaces themselves enjoy  rich geometric structures of their own, and display unusual symmetries  arising from their origin as natural geometric objects.  A better  understanding of such basic objects has time and again repaid the  effort through insights in related fields, typically in theoretical  physics.  ***"

For 2000 years, it was believed that the geometry involved  was Euclidean geometry.  But, at the beginning of the 19th century, C.  F. Gauss and N. Lobachevskii independently speculated that the Universe  might have a non-Euclidean geometric structure (this geometry is  obtained by negating Euclid's fifth postulate, and it is generally called  ""hyperbolic geometry"").  Further, they took measurements to determine if  their speculations were correct.  Gauss's measurements came from surveys  on the earth, while Lobachevskii's measurements were astronomical and  used the parallax for the star Sirius.  Their measurements were  inconclusive, but this year, a variety of astronomical studies have  provided substantial evidence that the Universe has a hyperbolic  geometric structure.  Just as Gauss and Lobachevskii speculated, the  Universe is a hyperbolic 3-dimensional object, technically, a hyperbolic  3-manifold.       There are many, many different types of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Which one of these types is our Universe?  Answering this question is a  daunting task, but there appears to be one significant simplification:  some theoretical and esthetic information indicates that if geometric  measurements could be made, it would turn out---after a re-scaling  related to the expansion of the Universe---that the Universe is ""small""  in size, that is, it is a hyperbolic 3-manifold of low volume.  Thus, we  want to understand all hyperbolic 3-manifolds of low volume.  This is a  hard problem, and for many years progress was slow, but recent research  has provided powerful new tools for attacking the problem.  Some of the  tools involve the use of rigorous computer programs to analyze parameter  spaces and to study configurations of natural geometric objects in  hyperbolic space.  This project will use these tools and develop new  ones to lead us towards the goal of definitively identifying the   low-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Coupling this theoretical  information with data from the planned MAP (microwave anisotropy probe)  space project could lead to the determination of precisely which  hyperbolic 3-manifold the Universe is.  ***"

During the past two decades, remarkable progress  has been made toward a global understanding of stable homotopy theory, showing  that some major features arise chromatically from an interplay of periodic  phenomena arranged in a hierarchy.  This project is part of an effort to  develop a similar understanding in unstable homotopy theory.  The investigator  has introduced a hierarchy of localizations called periodizations, which serve  to resolve a given space into a chromatic tower with monochromatic fibers.  He  will work to understand these periodizations as well as the closely related  localizations with respect to Morava K-theories.  He recently discovered  surprising new functors between the stable and unstable monochromatic layers  of homotopy theory.  Using these functors and other tools, he will explore the  structure of the monochromatic layers.  At the classical K-theoretic level,  this work is leading to solutions of old problems concerning periodic homotopy  groups and the K-theory of spaces.       Topological or geometric spaces arise, for instance, as sets of solutions  to systems of equations, and they play a central role in mathematics.  Beyond  their usual measurements, such spaces have deeper properties that persist even  after drastic deformations.  These properties begin very simply with the  number of separate components and the number of ""holes"" in a low dimensional  space but become tremendously rich and informative in higher dimensions.  The  field of homotopy theory is devoted to their study, using powerful algebraic  and geometric techniques.  In recent years, an exciting chromatic approach  to the subject has emerged, allowing decompositions of complicated homotopical  phenomena into much simpler periodic parts.  However, this chromatic approach  was originally rest ricted to certain stable phenomena.  In the present  project, the investigator is working to extend it to a full range of unstable  homotopy theoretic phenomena.  ***"

More<br/>specifically, what are the hyperbolic knots in the 3-sphere that admit<br/>Dehn surgeries that are small Seifert fibered spaces or contain essential<br/>2-spheres or 2-tori?  The main approach to this problem is to understand<br/>when a surface of small genus, either an essential surface or a Heegaard<br/>surface, can appear in a Dehn surgery on a hyperbolic knot.  The residue<br/>of a surface in the Dehn surgery is seen as a punctured surface in the<br/>knot exterior.

For example,<br/>some physicists now are trying to tie astronomical observations to<br/>structures of 3-dimensional spaces in order to determine the shape of the<br/>3-dimensional universe.  Microbiologists are beginning to use the concepts<br/>of knot theory to describe and understand the knotting of DNA molecules.<br/>Chemists are doing the same to understand the knotting and linking of other<br/>molecules.  The Dehn surgery construction is an operation on a 3-dimensional<br/>space that produces a new 3-dimensional space.  This is done by changing<br/>the space around a knotted circle in the space.  This project studies how<br/>the space changes according to the type of knot along which the change was<br/>made.  The relationship between the resulting space and the knot is a<br/>complex one, and its understanding is a natural goal for 3-dimensional<br/>topology and knot theory.  A good knowledge of this relationship is also a<br/>useful tool for exploring knots and 3-dimensional spaces.  Since its<br/>introduction at the turn of the century, the Dehn surgery construction has<br/>been a standard way of constructing examples of phenomena in 3- and<br/>4-dimensional spaces.

One hopes that this will give new arithmetic applications of<br/>K-theory.<br/>     Work on this project will be directed toward two important<br/>problems.  The first revolves around the study of manifolds, spaces<br/>(such as spheres, tori, etc.) in which every point has a neighborhood<br/>that resembles ordinary Euclidean space.  One notion of equivalence<br/>for such manifolds is homotopy equivalence, a relatively weak<br/>condition.  For instance, a circle and an annulus are homotopy<br/>equivalent, since one direction of the annulus can be compressed to<br/>obtain a circle.  The other notion is homeomorphism, which is a very<br/>strong condition, requiring that there be an explicit way to identify<br/>the points of one manifold with those of the other so that each point<br/>of one corresponds to exactly one in the other.  The latter is<br/>typically very hard to verify, while homotopy equivalence is<br/>relatively easy to verify.  The conjecture of Borel asserts that for a<br/>large class of manifolds (those whose universal cover is ordinary<br/>Euclidean space) homotopy equivalence implies homeomorphism.  The<br/>investigator is approaching this conjecture via algebraic methods,<br/>involving algebraic invariants of the manifolds in question.  The<br/>second problem studies the so-called ``algebraic K-theory'' of fields<br/>(algebraic objects in which one has addition, multiplication, and<br/>division, like the rational or the real numbers).  It proposes a new<br/>conjecture for a description of this K-theory, one which is stronger<br/>than the earlier Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures.  In this project, the<br/>investigator will be developing methods for verifying his conjecture<br/>in many cases.  The hope is that studying this conjecture will give<br/>new applications to arithmetic for this topological invariant.<br/>***<br/><br/>"

The workshops' primary goal is to provide  mathematicians with active research programs but limited support an  opportunity to discuss their work with others in the field.

For example, a manifold containing some  embedded essential surfaces, but no essential spheres, is called a  Haken manifold.  The geometric structure of Haken manifolds is well  understood, but unfortunately many manifolds are not Haken.  One is  thus forced to consider other lower dimensional objects in studying them,  such as laminations and immersed surfaces.  The objective of this project  is to understand the role of immersed essential surfaces in 3-manifolds,  particularly the issue of whether such surfaces will lift to embedded  surfaces in a finite covering.  This would be an important step toward  a clear understanding of the topological and geometric structure of  3-manifolds.       Manifolds appear naturally in physics and other sciences, since a  manifold is an object for which each point is surrounded by a small  neighborhood the same as one in the solid ball in a Euclidean space.  If the Euclidean space in question is of dimension three, we call such  a manifold a 3-manifold.  This being the dimension in which we live,  it is not surprising that 3-manifolds have attracted a great deal of  attention in mathematics and physics.  What is perhaps more surprising  is the extent to which 3-manifolds have shown themselves resistant to   analysis, generally more so than manifolds of dimensions above five,  where our 3-dimensional intuitions flounder but other tools come to the  rescue.  Most of these tools are not available in dimension three, and  that is what is at issue here, finding alternatives that do work in the  critical dimension three.  ***"

They have been incorporated into the renormalization theory of one-dimensional dynamical systems, played a crucial role in the foundations of higher dimensional holomorphic dynamics, enabled advances in long-standing problems in hyperbolic geometry, witnessed the solution of classical problems on analytic differential equations, and led to new concepts in  topology. The conference will bring together people looking at laminations and foliations from different points of view in the hope that it will create fruitful interactions between intimately related but somewhat separated fields.      Laminations and foliations play a fundamental role in the theory of dynamical systems, which is the general study of evolution of systems that change with time. Dynamical systems theory emerged, historically, in celestial mechanics, and has since found numerous further applications everywhere: in statistical mechanics, biology, chemistry, economics, and so on. It has deep implications for any aspect of science involving the time-evolution of complex systems.  The study of foliations is concerned with the way that a large system can be broken up into a family of smaller systems, like layers of dough in a pastry.  For  example, a physical system in which energy is conserved separates into thin layers, one for each energy level. The ability to analyze a system in this way is of crucial importance, and leads to deep connections between the dynamics and phenomena in other important subfields of mathematics, in particular, in geometry and topology. The broadly interdisciplinary nature of the subject was one of the main motivations for this conference.  With this in mind, the conference will be strongly directed towards the interests of graduate students and young researchers, who will have a chance to see a broader perspective of mathematics in its active development.  To support this educational goal, the conference will include , in addition to the customary research lectures, a number of introductory ""mini-courses"" which will provide participants with a more comprehensive outlook on different aspects of the field."

Much of the work done in the field of  geometric group theory has been generalizing results from 3-manifold  theory to the setting of finitely generated groups.  The first result  to generalize was the sphere theorem, which was generalized by Stallings  to the Ends Theorem.  When the most general versions of the annulus and  torus theorem for three-manifolds were proven by Scott in 1980, he  conjectured that there should be a purely algebraic analog to these  theorems.  The first step in that direction was a proof of the algebraic  annulus theorem for word hyperbolic groups by Scott and Swarup in 1995.  The algebraic annulus theorem for finitely generated groups was proven by  Dunwoody and Swenson in 1996.  These two will extend this result to an  n-dimensional algebraic torus theorem for finitely generated groups.  In  addition, Swenson will continue his investigations into the boundaries of  groups.  The study of group boundaries was begun in the theory of Kleinian  and Fuchsian groups.  The first person to apply these ideas to abstract  groups was Gromov.  He defined the visual boundary both of a word-hyperbolic  group, and of a CAT(0) group.  It was shown by Bestvina and Mess that these  boundaries carry considerable cohomological information about the group.  Swenson has two different projects in this area.  First, he wishes to  determine the relationship between the local and global homology in the  visual boundary of a word-hyperbolic group.  Bestvina began the work in  this area, after which Swenson made a contribution.  There are, however,  certain important questions that remain open.  The second project concerns  the existence (or non-existence) of cut points in these boundaries.  It  has been shown by Bowditch and Swarup that the visual boundary of a  word-hyperbolic group cannot contain a cut-point.  Swenson will try to  ""extend"" this result to the nonpositive ly curved or CAT(0) setting.  He  will also look for consequences of boundaries' not having cut-points  (semistability at infinity, for example).       Years ago it was said that infinite group theory consisted entirely  of counter-examples.  Geometric group theory has done much to remedy this  situation.  Thurston's work towards the classification of all 3-manifolds,  spaces which look locally like 3-space, was the origin of geometric group  theory.  Z. He, Cannon, and others noticed the amazing correlation between  the group theoretic properties of the fundamental group of a geometric  3-manifold and the geometric properties of its universal cover.  Much of  the work done in geometric group theory has been to translate techniques  and sometimes even theorems from the setting of 3-manifolds to the  seemingly much more general setting of simply connected 2-complexes,  spaces formed by gluing triangles along their edges (often with more than  two triangles sharing a common edge).  The torus theorem for 3-manifolds  says that any time there is an essential map of a 2-torus (an inner tube)  into a 3-manifold M, either M is very simple and well understood, or there  is an embedded 2-torus along which M can be cut to yield simpler pieces.  Swenson is working with Martin Dunwoody to extend this result to apply  to any essential map of a torus of any dimension into a simply connected  2-complex.  In the second part of the project, Swenson will investigate  non-positively curved 2-complexes, using techniques transferred over from  differential geometry by Gromov and others.  ***"

He proposes to continue his work on applications of definable equivalence relations to indecomposable continua and to continuous actions of Polish groups. Specifically, he will investigate the structure of the equivalence relation induced on an indecomposable continuum by its partition into composants. His earlier work leads him to believe that a complete classification up to Borel isomorphism of these equivalence relations is within reach. If it can be accomplished, it should shed light on an old problem of Kuratowski on determining the size of Borel sets that are unions of families of composants. The second area of research proposed in the project is the study of the relation between topologies on groups and complexity of equivalence relations induced by their actions. The proposer will attempt to establish a characterization of subgroups of Polish groups which themselves carry Polish group topologies stronger than the subgroup topology. This characterization should be in terms of the complexity of the equivalence relation induced by the left translation action. Also he proposes to find a characterization of local compactness of Polish groups in terms of the equivalence relations induced by their continuous actions. <br/><br/>This project has two parts. First, ``indecomposable continua'' will be studied.  Even though indecomposable continua were initially discovered as paradoxical, exceptional examples of curves, their importance for today's research comes from the fact that they occur naturally and commonly in certain mathematical models. For instance, when studying the evolution of a physical or a biological system, one is particularly interested in describing families of states of such a system which have some sort of stability and to which other states evolve. Surprisingly, even for simple, natural systems, such ``attractors'' can have a very intricate geometric structure, in particular, they can be indecomposable continua. In this work, a mathematical discipline called descriptive set theory, which has no obvious connections with indecomposable continua, is being used to uncover certain deeper aspects of their structure. These new methods have already helped to solve some old problems, and it is expected that they will yield still new and exciting results and applications. The motivation for the second part of the project comes from the following considerations. An important part of a mathematician's or a physicist's work is classifying objects he/she is interested in so that objects that differ in an inessential way are not distinguished by the classification. In most situations, two object differ ``in an inessential way'' if one can be transformed into the other by a transformation taken from a suitable family of transformations called a group acting on the family of objects. There is a well-developed theory of classifying objects up to actions of groups that behave as if they were locally finite, the so-called locally compact groups. In many important instances, though, this theory is insufficient. This work will contribute to a larger, rapidly developing field, which investigates actions of non-locally compact groups.<br/><br/>"

The conference took<br/>place one year after the end of a closely related year-long program at<br/>M.S.R.I.  Thus it was natural to review how progress had been<br/>consolidated in this area over the ensuing year, and an added benefit of<br/>the conference was to expose this progress to the wider mathematical<br/>community.  Approximately 150 mathematicians attended the conference,<br/>more than 50 of them graduate students.  Some talks were tailored<br/>specifically for these students.<br/>     Topology addresses those geometric properties that depend only on<br/>continuity, i.e., on the notion of one point being close to another, but<br/>disregards the stock in trade of high school geometry, measurement of<br/>quantities such as distance, angle, area, volume, and so forth.  Topology<br/>of the plane is often referred to in popular scientific literature as<br/>rubber sheet geometry, and this captures the essential spirit of the<br/>discipline without giving so much as a hint of the techniques topologists<br/>might use in their science.  They confront some very basic but elusive<br/>properties, those that remain after rigidity has been exorcised, and the<br/>past century has seen the gradual assembly of a considerable arsenal of<br/>weapons for dealing with these properties.  Low-dimensional topology,<br/>mainly the topology of 3- and 4-dimensional geometric objects, presents<br/>special problems of its own, for while we have the intuition that we<br/>should be able to apprehend these object more readily, living as we do in<br/>3-dimensional space and 4-dimensional space-time, in fact much of the<br/>algebraic machinery that has been developed for topology fails in these<br/>lower dimensions.  Recent years have seen some remarkable advances on this<br/>front too, and this was the central theme of the conference at M.S.R.I. in<br/>May.  It is also noteworthy that low-dimensional topology has become<br/>sufficiently highly developed to be useful, for example, in applications<br/>of knot theory to polymer chemistry and to the study of DNA.  As this field<br/>continues to progress, the immediacy of the objects with which it deals is<br/>likely to lead its further technical advances to find equally natural<br/>applications in the real world.<br/>***<br/><br/>"

Outstanding conjectures have fallen, one after  the other, with the application of hyperbolic techniques.  There has been a  shift in the entire approach to low-dimensional topology, as researchers now  use rigid geometric arguments to prove topological theorems.  The two  principal investigators intend to continue their research, both individually  and jointly, on the theory and computation of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Through a set of projects, many relying heavily on their ability to compute  explicit examples on a computer, the researchers plan to further the  understanding of the connections between hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the  invariants that come out of hyperbolic 3-manifold theory, and the  traditional topological invariants in 3-manifold theory.  They will also  consider applications of 3-manifold theory to cosmological models of the  spatial universe, working in conjunction with cosmologists.  Undergraduates  will be involved in original research projects related to this research.       A 2-dimensional surface may have positive curvature like a sphere, zero  curvature like a flat Euclidean plane, or negative curvature like a saddle.  Almost all surfaces can be given negative curvature, meaning that locally,  they behave like the hyperbolic plane discovered by Lobachevsky, Gauss, and  Bolyai in the last century.  An analogous understanding of finite  3-dimensional spaces eluded researchers for decades, but in the mid-1970's  W. P. Thurston conjectured that 3-manifolds, the analog of 2-dimensional  surfaces one dimension up, can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of  eight geometries.  He proved the conjecture for vast quantities of  3-manifolds.  By far the most commonly occurring geometry for 3-manifolds is  hyperbolic geometry.  The resulting ""hyperbolic structures"" are rich and  have been used to solve a great many topological and geometrical questions.  T he present project continues this work both theoretically and  computationally.  The theoretical advances make the computations possible,  and the explicitly computed examples guide the further development of the  theory.  In the past year the project has found a new and very exciting  application.  The spatial universe within which we live is an example of a  3-manifold.  Data from NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) may, in the  year 2001, reveal the spatial universe to be finite in extent.  If so,  algorithms from the present project will be used to determine the exact  shape of the universe.  The investigators are currently extending their  software to tolerate the high levels of noise that will be present in the  MAP data, and to handle the spherical and Euclidean cases as well as the  hyperbolic one.  Preliminary data suggests the real universe is hyperbolic,  but the other possibilities cannot yet be ruled out.  ***"

The geometric structure is defined  using systems of equations of the above type, and it even allows one   first to remove ""noise"" from the image by applying appropriate filters.  The basic properties of the geometric structure obtained from the  first part will allow it to be used to address several questions in  medical imaging.  ***"

Aleksandrov was  interested primarily in the case of nonnegative curvature and its  applications to convex polyhedral surfaces in Euclidean 3-space.  Interest  in this subject was renewed about ten years ago when Gromov pointed out  that for topological and group theoretic reasons the nonpositively curved  case was much more interesting than the positively curved case, the main  reason being that the universal cover of a nonpositively curved space is  contractible.  Gromov also pointed out that there were many polyhedral  examples of such spaces.  In particular, Tits buildings are such examples.  For the past several years, Professors Charney and Davis have collaborated  in investigating nonpositively curved polyhedra and applications to group  theory.  The groups in which they are primarily interested are Coxeter  groups and Artin groups.  Both types of groups are associated to groups  generated by reflections.  Both Charney and Davis have also accomplished  separate research in these areas.  They  will continue their research on  these areas as well as on closely related topics such as the properties  of Tits buildings and their automorphism groups.       Groups generated by reflections occur in many places in mathematics  and in nature (for example, in crystallogrophy).  The symmetry groups of  regular tilings of the Euclidean plane are such groups.  Escher's drawings  show examples of regular tilings in non-Euclidean plane geometry.  These  are also associated with reflection groups.  Professors Charney and Davis  are interested in such examples in a more abstract setting.  It turns out  that abstract reflection groups (Coxeter groups) can always be realized as  the symmetry groups of a space that is nonpositively curved, much as in the  case of the Euclidean and non-Euclidean planes.   ***"

The motivation for  the project comes from several sources: (i) perturbative Chern-Simons  theory, (ii) generalizing the notion of Vassiliev invariants of knots  in the 3-sphere, (iii) separating the quantum group invariants of knots  and 3-manifolds into elementary pieces and reassembling them.  One of the  goals of the theory of finite type invariants of knots and 3-manifolds  involves understanding the role and the strength of these invariants  in the classification of knots and 3-manifolds.       Thirteen years ago, Vaughan Jones discovered a simple yet remarkably  useful polynomial associated to every knot in 3-dimensional space.  Shortly afterwards, Edward Witten studied a 3-dimensional gauge field  theory that generalized the Jones polynomial to knots in arbitrary  3-dimensional space.  Gauge theories in 3 and 4 dimensions are intimately  related to the high energy description of our physical world (in the  energies and the distances that we currently perceive).  In addition, knots  appear naturally as supercoiled forms of DNA (an important ingredient of  life), as well as being trajectories of some elementary particles at high  energies.  Thus, the current research project has potential applications,  yet to be fully understood, in biology and in high energy physics.  ***"

Professor Hopkins hopes to  show that this object can be used in several ways.  It should receive  a generalized ""Witten genus,"" assigning sophisticated algebraic  invariants to certain geometric manifolds.  On the other hand, it  should account for deep arithmetic congruences satisfied by certain  theta-functions (conjectured earlier by Professor Hopkins and proven  by R. Borcherds).

His  goal is to find numbers computable from the equations defining the sets or  components of the mappings that will describe the geometry of the object  under study.  A first step is to find numbers of this type whose constancy in  a family of objects implies that the geometry of the family is constant in  some well-defined way.  One of the most important conditions that Gaffney  considers is Whitney equisingularity.  This condition implies that the  embedded topology of the family is constant.  The theory of the integral  closure of modules provides a powerful framework for studying this condition.  Working with Kleiman, Gaffney will solve this problem for families of  complete intersections with non-isolated singularities.  This will be done by  transporting, with suitable modifications, the ideas Gaffney used in the case  of hypersurfaces with non-isolated singularities into the framework of  complete intersections developed with Kleiman.  Gaffney will also investigate  the relation between the geometry of hypersurface singularities and the  components appearing in the exceptional divisor associated to these  singularities.  One specific case to be considered will be discriminants of  finitely determined map germs and topologically stable map germs close to the  boundary of the nice dimensions.  This study will be a step toward criteria  for families of such maps to be Whitney equisingular.        This project is part of a centuries old effort to fathom the geometry  of mappings and singular shapes.  (A mapping is a relation between shapes.)  A cone is a simple example of a shape with a singularity, and a picture of a  cone is a simple example of a mapping.  The picture creates a relation  between the points of the cone and the points of a plane, the plane of the  picture in this case.  If we take a picture of even a smooth shape, the image  will have edges, and the edges will also often have singula r points, so the  study of shapes and mappings are related.  Equations describe shapes.  The  goal of this study is to start with equations of a shape and extract numbers  from them that give a description of the geometry of the shape useful for  determining when one member of a family of shapes is different from other  members.  For example, if you lay a piece of string across itself, it forms a  loop.  As you pull the loop tight, it forms a family of curves, and the loop  disappears at some time t.  Our intuition says that the curves in this family  are similar until we get to time t, when the loop disappears.  We can write  down equations for the members of this family.  It is helpful to study this  situation using two scales.  There is the macroscopic level, in which the  individual curves bend to form loops, and there is also an infinitesimal  level at which the tangent vectors to the curves and to the union of the  curves exist.  As you move around a loop, you can follow the tangent vectors  around.  Remarkably, although the loop disappears as time goes to t at the  macroscopic level, the loop leaves a trace at the infinitesimal level.  This  trace shows up in the invariant, called the Milnor number, that we use to  study curves in the plane, and it can be calculated from equations of the  curves.  The theory of integral closure of modules is a powerful framework  for studying sets at this infinitesimal level and for extracting numbers that  detect change at this level in a family of sets.  Because there is a good  connection between algebra and geometry for shapes defined in complex space  by analytic functions, this is the setting for most work to date using this  approach.  d-dimensional subsets of complex n-space defined by n-d equations  are called complete intersections.  Gaffney and Kleiman will combine their  own and others' earlier approaches to more limited situations to treat  families of complete intersections with singular sets of arbitrary dimension.  ***"

He will also  consider the case of dimension 3 in connection with the recent work of  Kollar introducing the Minimal Model Program into the subject.       In Optics, Mechanics and Robotics, most configuration spaces appear  with natural real algebraic structures; e.g., the configuration space  of any mechanical linkage arises as the intersection of quadratic  hypersurfaces.  The visible contours of surfaces appear in computer  vision problems.  ***"

The method is a combination   of several kinds of ""functor calculus.""  One task is to investigate some          interrelationships between these calculi with an eye to strengthening  the general method.  This is expected to involve some foundational work   on Poincare duality complexes.  Another task for the long haul is to  look at what may be called a second-order analogue of algebraic K-theory;  it arises by a kind of quadratic stabilization of manifold phenomena.  For the short haul there is the job of constructing a kind of  second-order analogue of cyclic homology that should be related to the  above as cyclic homology is related to algebraic K-theory.  There is at  least a slight hope that this would yield topologically defined  invariants for four-manifolds that are akin to the well-known  analytically defined Seiberg-Witten invariants.       The word ""calculus"" is used because of an attractive analogy with  the ordinary calculus of functions.  Sometimes, of course, the way to  settle a numerical question is to see the answer as a value of a  function; by means of the powerful apparatus of calculus, properties of  the function can lead to a computation of the number.  Likewise, a fact  about some geometrically defined object is sometimes best proved by  viewing the object as a particular value of a functor and using the  apparatus of some kind of functor calculus. This analogy may show  something of the flavor of the work; the content is harder to describe  to the non-expert, because most of the ""geometric"" objects in question  are connected to everyday reality by rather long chains of abstract ideas.   ***"

The orbifold theorem describes what crystals are possible in  non-Euclidean geometry.  As a result of Einstein's theory of general  relativity, we know that our universe has a non-Euclidean geometry,  but at the comparatively small scale of human existence, this geometry  is very nearly Euclidean.  The orbifold theorem is therefore not of  interest to chemists, but it may one day perhaps help shed light on the  large-scale structure of our particular universe.  ***"

The project  also involves several connected problems on hyperbolic and euclidean cone  manifolds, and on a generalization of curves on a surface called geodesic  laminations.

Such objects are rigorous constructions of nontrivial topological quantum field theories. In the case of the moduli space of curves, the corresponding representations are cohomological field theories (in the sense of Kontsevich and Manin), the most dramatic examples of which arise from Gromov-Witten invariants of a smooth projective variety. The investigator will study properties of canonical families of such structures arising from the geometry of these moduli spaces, using techniques borrowed from homotopy theory (operads), algebraic geometry (moduli spaces), and quantum field theory (Feynman diagrams). Recently, much of the interaction between mathematics and theoretical physics has revolved about topological quantum field theories, quantum field theories whose observables correspond to topological invariants. A rigorous construction of a nontrivial class of such theories is now possible through the study of Gromov-Witten invariants, topological invariants associated to a certain space of maps from Riemann surfaces into a Kahler manifold. The purpose of this project is to study natural families of such theories (and their relatives) that arise from the geometry of these spaces and to understand their properties under natural operations suggested by the geometry. Success should shed light on both the mathematics and the physics involved. ***"
