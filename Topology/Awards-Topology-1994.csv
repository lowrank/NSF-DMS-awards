The investigator intends to concentrate on  the interrelationships between these notions in order to shed new  light on the algebraic structure of the mapping class groups of  surfaces on the one hand, and the global geometry of the  Teichmueller spaces on the other hand.  An important guiding  principle here is a still fairly mysterious analogy between the  mapping class groups and Teichmueller spaces on the one side and  arithmetic groups and symmetric spaces on the other side,  established in earlier works of the principal investigator and  other mathematicians.  In particular, the principal investigator  intends to prove that braid groups of surfaces have only the  obvious automorphisms, and that there are no nontrivial  homomorphisms from the arithmetic groups of rank at least two  into mapping class groups.  The principal investigator intends to  continue his study of the rigidity properties of the mapping  class groups and Teichmueller spaces.  He also intends to give a  general explanation of various phenomena in the topology of  surfaces exhibiting stabilization over the genus, including  presentations of the mapping class groups by generators and  relations and the quantum field theory representations.  Finally,  the investigator will continue his investigation of rigidity and  stability phenomena in the universal Teichmueller spaces.       Mapping class groups and Teichmueller spaces serve as a  meeting ground for several of the main branches of mathematics,  including topology, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry.   Recently they have also proved to be important in some questions  of theoretical physics.  These objects in a subtle way both  resemble and differ from the much more well understood arithmetic  groups and symmetric spaces.  Various approaches to m ade this  analogy (and difference!) precise and explicit form the core of  the project.   While symmetric spaces form a well established  pool of possible spatial images investigated in mathematics (and  arithmetic groups to a big extent control their structure),  Teichmueller spaces gradually emerge as a new, richer and equally  important pattern (and mapping class groups are similarly  expected to control their structure).  The principal investigator  intends to concentate on two of the most interesting and striking  properties of these objects: rigidity and stability.  Because of  rigidity, the structure of these objects is expected to be  completely determined by their shape only.  Stability tells us  that when these objects become more and more complicated with a  natural parameter (genus) growing, their main characteristics  cease to change at a certain point.  The stability phenomena is  expected to be relevant not only to the mathematical but also to  the quantum physics applications of the mapping class groups and  Teichmueller spaces.  ***"

He has found this to be a mine of applications to  topological and algebraic geometric problems.  Algebraic cycles  are seen as a topological group functor from the category of  algebraic varieties to the category of group objects in the  category of CW-complexes.  This functor associates principal  fibrations to closed inclusions, and their homotopy groups  provide a homology theory for algebraic varieties which he wishes  to understood more deeply.  An intersection theory for arbitrary  varieties will be developed, generalizing and simplifying an  existing theory for quasiprojective varieties.  On the purely  topological side, the investigator's research has created  equivariant infinite loop spaces using algebraic cycles, and the  generalized cohomology theories thus obtained have been related  with several other theories.  As an outcome of this interplay  between new and old theories, he has already answered  long-standing conjectures about the total Chern class map and is  presently computing several examples where algebraic geometry,  group representation theory, and homotopy theory come together to  illuminate the coefficient systems involved, the associated  transfer maps, and so forth.       A fundamental aspect and guiding principle in the  investigator's research is its unifying character, under which  diverse areas of mathematics come into play and yield  multifaceted applications of his algebraic techniques.  He thus  obtains a highly desirable economy of thought, in the sense that  a concise and unified approach to various seemingly disparate  questions attains deep results about each in a short period of  time.  He starts by endowing basic objects in algebraic geometry,  the algebraic cycles, with a topology which turns out to have  remarkable properties.  He then realizes that these cycles  provide new invariants not only for alge braic varieties (of  fundamental importance to algebraic geometers), but that they  also deeply relate with ongoing mainstream research in stable  homotopy theory, a major topic in algebraic topology.  Other  natural structures arise in this setting as he explores  constructions involving his algebraic cycles.  The study of  cycles from an equivariant point of view thus also provides  insight into various aspects of the theory of representation of  finite groups and group cohomology, enhancing the usefulness of  his unified approach.  ***"

This has three parts.  The first is to understand the  structure theory of the invariants themselves.  For manifolds of  simple type, this has been accomplished by Kronheimer and Mrowka  and, using completely different techniques, by the investigator  and R. Stern.  The investigator and R. Stern have also proved a  blowup formula for the Donaldson invariant of a general  4-manifold, and one expects that this formula, together with the  techniques used in the simple-type case, will lead to a general  structure theory.  The second part of this project is the  calculation of Donaldson invariants.  The investigator intends to  use his technique of 'rational blowdowns' to provide  calculations.  This involves giving a general formula for the  Donaldson invariant of a rational blowdown, which has essentially  been done by the investigator and R. Stern (some details remain  to be checked) and which leads, e.g., to the calculation of  complete Donaldson invariants for all elliptic surfaces and many  other interesting examples.  The final part of the project is to  produce new examples to which these invariants can be applied in  order to find some order in the classification theory.       Four-dimensional manifolds are spaces which locally have the  structure of 4-dimensional Euclidean space (e.g. 3 'spatial' and  one 'time' dimension).  These manifolds play a central role in  topology, for in 4 dimensions both the powerful techniques of  higher dimensional surgery and the more special and intricate  techniques of lower dimensions break down.  This is, of course,  also the most physically relevant situation, and there is a vast  literature in theoretical physics related to 4-dimensional  topology.  For many years 4-manifolds were studied by applying  techniques from both higher and lower dimensions, and the results  were mostly unsatisfactory.  In 1 984, Simon Donaldson introduced  a powerful technique stemming from the interplay between  4-dimensional geometry and theoretical physics via the Yang-Mills  equation.  Donaldson's techniques have had startling  consequences, and a school of topologists and geometers has  formed in the hope of using these techniques to understand  4-dimensional topology completely.  (That this is not too far  removed from the physics which helped spawn the theory is  evidenced by the many contributions by physicists such as  Witten.)  In the last year, especially, progress has been very  rapid.  The investigator hopes to make further contributions both  to the understanding of the Donaldson invariant and to the  classification of 4-dimensional manifolds.  ***"

The emphasis of this  project is to explore an area at the border between  low-dimensional topology and geometry via the concept of thin  position.  In knot theory, this concept was first introduced by  D. Gabai and used to solve the long-standing property R  conjecture.  The analog to thin position in minimal surface  theory has been studied extensively the H. Rubenstein; in  particular, thin position proved to be the key to the solution to  the recognition problem for the 3-sphere.  The knot theoretic  interpretation of thin position has recently been used to give an  alternate proof of Rubenstein's theorem, confirming close  connections between the two points of view.  Pursuit of such  linkage between two different areas promises to be extremely  fruitful.  The goals of this project are twofold; first, to  acquire a deep understanding of minimal surface theory,  particularly PL-minimal surface theory.  Second, to exploit thin  position, with the intent of using insights from knot theory to  solve interesting questions in minimal surface theory and  vice-versa.  ***"

In Sheafhom the  basic items are finite-dimensional vector spaces, cochain  complexes, regular cell complexes, sheaves, and morphisms among  these objects.   There are functions like kernel, image,  cohomology, and tensor and wedge products.  The system works with  important complexes of sheaves, such as the intersection  cohomology sheaves and other perverse sheaves.  Second, the  project involves bringing Sheafhom to bear on convex polytopes  and the intersection homology of toric varieties.  McMullen's  conjecture characterized the f-vectors of simplicial convex  polytopes.  Stanley's proof of (one direction of) McMullen's  conjecture used the cohomology of the toric variety associated to  a simplicial polytope.  Key facts were that the cohomology,  modulo the Lefschetz class, is a graded ring generated in degree  two.  For an arbitrary rational convex polytope, one can ask  whether the intersection cohomology of its toric variety,  modulo the Lefschetz class, is a ring, and whether it is  generated in degree two.  The project will build on preliminary  results on these questions, and Sheafhom will play a part in  approaching them.       A computer algebra system is a program for algebraic  calculation.  Any program can add numbers, but a computer algebra  system combines whole formulas: the input (2x + 7) + (4x - 3)  automatically becomes 6x + 4.  This capacity is more abstract,  hence more flexible.  Excellent general-purpose systems, like  Maple or Mathematica, are available, but of course they don't  have every function that every mathematician needs.  In recent  years several disciplines have acquired their own special-purpose  systems--Cayley/Magma for algebraists, Pari for number theorists,  and a dozen others.  The investigator intends to develop  Sheafhom, a computer algebra system for algebra ic topology.   Second, he intends to apply Sheafhom to study convex polytopes.   Convex polyhedra are familiar solid bodies like cubes, pyramids,  or hundred-faced diamonds.  A convex polytope is the same kind of  body in the fourth dimension or higher.  Since 1980, algebraic  geometry has become a major tool for studying polytopes.  This is  surprising, since algebraic geometry includes some of the most  abstract mathematics known, while polytopes, like crystals, are  very concrete objects.  Sheafhom will make possible some  difficult computations in algebraic topology and geometry that  will advance our understanding of convex polytopes.  ***"

The stated objectives are to provide frequent contacts  between workers in similar fields, to keep the area abreast of  recent developments by bringing in speakers from outside the  area, to encourage local graduate students and topologists to  hear, consult, and possibly collaborate with the outside  speakers, and to provide an opportunity for local people to  lecture on their own work.

The main  concern of this project is to study the interplay between the  complex geometry and the differential topology of complex  surfaces, by utilizing smooth invariants introduced by Simon  Donaldson and Dieter Kotschick, by investigating stable vector  bundles and their moduli spaces on complex surfaces, and by using  recent work of Jun Li and Robert Friedman.  In particular, the  investigator wishes to study Donaldson invariants for simply  connected algebraic surfaces with trivial geometric genus  (including the complex projective plane).       This project is in the field of gauge theory, which  interacts heavily with other areas of mathematics such as  topology, algebraic geometry, and even mathematical physics.   Progress could take many different forms.  Surprisingly, recent  work in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory by some physicists  (notably Edward Witten) has led to many mathematical insights in  the differential topology of complex surfaces.  Quite possibly, a  deeper understanding of some of the algebraic geometry and  algebraic topology at issue in this project will in turn shed  light on problems of concern to the community of quantum  physicists.  ***"

The investigator  plans to study the behavior of a symplectic reduction when  varying its defining datum (i.e. a symplectic form) and compare  its Gromov invariants with the equivariant Gromov invariants of  the original space.  He also plans to study the behavior of the  Gieseker and Uhlenbeck compactifications of the moduli space of  stable vector bundles on an algebraic surface when varying their  defining data (i.e. ample divisors).  Finally, he intends to  compare the cohomology of a toroidal compactification of an  arithmetic quotient with the intersection cohomology of the  Baily-Borel-Satake compactification.       Algebraic Geometry studies the geometry of the set of  solutions of a polynomial.  Symplectic Geometry is motivated by  Theoretical Physics, which studies the geometry of some  mathematical models originally coming from Physics.  The current  proposal deals with some questions on the structures of certain  important models in Symplectic and Algebraic Geometry.  These  models depend on a choice of parameters (such as numerical data).   It is natural and important to find out how the structure of a  model changes when we change the parameters.  A deep result  toward this will clarify the mysterious relation among the  structures of these models, leading to new insight into some  other important problems in the two fields.  It will have  numerous interesting applications to Physics, because Symplectic  Geometry was developed out of physical models.  ***"

This conjecture is unusual in that it cuts across  several different areas of mathematics and thus reveals an  underlying unity which previously was completely unknown.  The  research pursued here centers on proving this conjecture for  certain classes of examples and then obtaining corollaries.  More  precisely, let G be a topological group which is Hausdorff,  locally compact and second countable.  The main examples are Lie  groups, p-adic groups and discrete groups.  C*G denotes the  reduced C*-algebra of G, and KC*G is its K-theory.  The BC  conjecture, if true, gives an answer to the problem of  calculating KC*G.

In  dimension three, Kuiper's conjecture on the existence of Moebius  structures on a class of circle bundles over surfaces was shown  to be true.  The construction of these Moebius structures is  based on the Moebius groups generated by half-turns about three  circles in S3.  It is expected that more detailed study of these  groups (the geometry of the configuration space of three circles  in S3) will lead to a full generalization of Fenchel-Nielsen's  work on hyperbolic surfaces to Moebius structures on Seifert  3-manifolds.  It is also shown that given any number less than  2-pi, any closed 3-manifold has Moebius cone structure with cone  angle the given number.  It is expected that there is a singular  Riemannian metric of constant scalar curvature in the conformal  class represented by the Moebius structure and that the metric is  unique if the scalar curvature is -1.  The Hausdorff convergence  of the Riemannian metrics will then introduce a topology in the  space of Moebius cone structures.  Many conformally flat  structures on 3-manifolds will be obtained by considering the  limit of these singular Riemannian metrics as the cone angle goes  to 2-pi.  In dimension two, it is shown that the monodromy  representation locally determines the quasi-bounded complex  projective structure on punctured surfaces if there are no  apparent singularities.  As a consequence, the Teichmueller space  Tg,n supports a natural family of symplectic structures for n >  0.  It is expected that these symplectic structures are dual to  the Fenchel-Nielson twist vectors.       The study of three-dimensional spaces, called manifolds, is  a natural pursuit for creatures such as ourselves who inhabit a  three-dimensional universe (neglecting time).  In recent years it  has become clear from work of Thurston and others that   understanding 3-manifolds endowed with a locally non-Euclidean  geometry known as a hyperbolic structure is an important route to  the understanding of 3-manifolds in general.  One should look  into the multiplicity of hyperbolic structures that a manifold  can support and the symmetries thereof.  That is the setting for  this project by Feng Luo, who rings many changes on the approach.   He considers hyperbolic structures on surfaces, for which there  is an extensive classical theory in terms of functions of one  complex variable.  His discovery of an analog of the  two-generator groups of symmetries that arise in the case of  surfaces has been a very fertile source of new results, including  the solution of a conjecture of Kuiper.  It seems likely that  there is still much more to be done along these lines, that the  fruits of this point of view have by no means been exhausted.  ***"

This type of geometric problem  occurs ubiquitously in mathematics and other related areas such  as physics.

At  various times, the particles may return to their original  position.  The algebraic analogue of this geometric property is  known as torsion.

Both of these more `classical' objects have proved  themselves to be very useful in the past (and continue to be so,  today), and essential laminations have recently shown similar  power in attacking many of the fundamental problems in the theory  of 3-manifolds.  The investigator intends to continue his work on  essential laminations, with three main goals in mind: (1) to show  that they behave in many situations much like their far more  manageable cousin, the incompressible surface, (2) to show that  homotopy equivalent 3-manifolds, which contain essential  laminations, are homeomorphic, and (3) to construct essential  laminations in a wide variety of 3-manifolds, using the notion of  Haken normal form for laminations.  In other words, the  investigator intends to show that essential laminations (1)  behave nicely, (2) tell us interesting things about 3-manifolds,  and (3) can be found in `most' 3-manifolds.       It is somehow surprising that, in spite of the fact that we  live in a 3-dimensional world, and therefore have a great deal of  natural intuition about how things `work' in 3 dimensions, our  understanding of 3-dimensional manifolds, objects modelled on our  3-dimensional space, is far from complete.  Many of its basic  problems, such as the celebrated Poincare conjecture, remain  unsolved, even though the analogous problems in higher dimensions  have been settled.  Many new techniques have been developed, and  continue to be developed, to try to unravel this familiar, though  mysterious, dimension.  The investigator intends to continue to  delevop a new technique for studying 3-dimensional manifolds  which uses (well-understood) 2-dimensional objects to study these  (not so well-understood) 3-dimensional ones.  The idea is that by  thinking of a 3-dimensional object as being made up of a  collection of 2-dimensionsal `sheets' , stacked together, we can  sometimes use our (even better!) intuition and understanding  about dimension 2 to `stitch together' a solution to a  3-dimensional problem.  ***"

The program of Friedlander and others holds promise in  that it introduces a new perspective and imports techniques of  algebraic topology.  Several specific avenues of research appear  ripe for further exploration: topological filtrations on  algebraic cycles and homology, duality between Lawson homology  and morphic cohomology, motivic complexes in the guise of  algebraic cycle homology, and Chern classes in the context of  algebraic cycle spaces.  In addition to this study of algebraic  cycles, Friedlander will continue his efforts to study the  geometry implicit in the cohomology of infinitesimal algebraic  groups.  Priddy plans to continue his program to study the  homotopy type of classifying spaces of groups and related  constructions.  Many of the most important questions in homotopy  theory are related to classifying spaces of finite or compact Lie  groups.  Recently there have also developed interesting and  powerful connections between topology and group theory,  especially the cohomology and modular representation  theory of finite groups.  With the solution of the Segal and  Sullivan Conjectures, this area has developed rapidly in recent  years to the point where fundamental questions are being  answered.  Perhaps the most important of these is to determine  the exact relationship between the stable and unstable homotopy  types of a classifying space, completed at a prime p, and the  p-local structure of its underlying group.       Algebraic geometry is the study of solution sets of  polynomial equations (i.e., algebraic varieties) using geometric  techniques.  Partial answers to questions in algebraic geometry  have led to progress in fields ranging from complexity theory of  computer science to geometric topology to number theory.   Friedlander intends to study algebraic varieties, using methods  borrowed from algebraic  topology, as well as modern techniques of  algebraic geometry.  The use of topology involves the study of  continuously varying families of structures, which have  traditionally been considered by other means.  The hope is that  these new techniques will offer insight into deep and  long-standing problems of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic topology  is the study of geometric objects by means of algebraic  techniques.  Exciting new developments have led to advances in  group theory, using algebraic topology, thus reversing the  direction of the usual flow of information.  Groups are the  fundamental symmetries occurring in all sciences, including areas  involving codes, and structures in physics.  Priddy hopes that  this new approach will lead to a better understanding of the  relationship between these fields.  ***"

The focus is on two conformation spaces: polygonal  knots, and harmonic knots, where harmonic knots are those given  by finite Fourier series parametrizations.  Recent theorems  relate the invariants given by these energy functions to  classical invariants such as crossing number.  So this project  should lead to a better understanding of knots realizable with  relatively low degrees of freedom.       Knot theory is the mathematical study of the everyday  objects called knots.  Once thought the purview of theoretical  mathematicians, knot theory has recently found a wide range of  applications, in fields as diverse as molecular biology and  cosmology.  For example, DNA molecules are usually knotted, and  in the replication process must somehow become untangled.  In  this project the investigators apply sophisticated computing  techniques to the study of knots.  In particular, they continue  the development of a new approach to knots: physical knot theory.   The mathematical knot is given physical properties, and knot  types are distinguished by computations involving these  properties.  For example, knot conformations can be assigned an  energy, and then knot types can be distinguished by considering  minimum energy conformations.  The conceptual basis of the  approach is familiar to researchers in biology, chemistry, and  physics as well as mathematics.  The project produces both  theoretical results and software."

In recent  years, McDuff has devoted her energies to developing the tools of  symplectic topology with the main aim of understanding the  topological structure of compact symplectic manifolds.  She  intends to continue working in the same general direction in the  next three years, in an attempt to solve some of the very  interesting problems which still remain.  Lowell Jones: Jones  will continue his collaborative efforts with F. T. Farrell,  investigating rigidity properties of the classical closed  spherical manifolds.  In prior work they have shown that closed  nonpositively curved manifolds and closed double coset manifolds  are topologically rigid, in dimensions > 5.  In work in progress  they show that any closed complete affine flat manifold is  topologically rigid, in dimensions > 5.  They have also  constructed many examples of strictly negatively curved closed  manifolds which are homeomorphic to one another but not  diffeomorphic, thus verifying that the class of nonpositively  curved manifolds does not enjoy smooth rigidity.  Whether or not  the class of closed double coset manifolds, or the class of  closed complete affine flat manifolds, are smoothly rigid remains  an open question which Jones intends to pursue.       Dusa McDuff: A symplectic structure is a very basic kind of  geometric structure which underlies all the equations of  classical and quantum physics.  In the last ten years, new tools  have been developed which allow mathematicians for the first time  to gain some understanding of the global meaning of this kind of  structure.   One focus of McDuff's work is the geometric  explora tion of the concept of energy.  In physics this is the  driving force of movement (of systems ranging from the planetary  system to plasmas).  The new methods of symplectic topology make  it possible in some cases to estimate the minimum energy required  to accomplish a certain movement.  This work is very basic and  should eventually have important implications in the study of  physical systems.  Another focus of her work is the attempt to  understand what a symplectic structure really is by investigating  the geometric properties of the spaces which are symplectic.  The  idea is that these spaces are the embodiment of the abstract idea  of a symplectic structure.  Lowell Jones: In 1829 and 1832 the  mathematicians N. Lobachevsky and J. Bolyai independently solved  a two thousand year old mathematical problem by verifying that  Euclid's fifth axiom for plane geometry is independent from the  first four of Euclid's axioms.  They did this by investigating a  new type of geometry having ""negative curvature.""  Today the  2-dimensional geometries of Lobachevsky and Bolyai are important  special cases of the larger class of geometric structures having  ""non-positive curvature,"" which can occur in all the higher  dimensions, and which have been the focus of a tremendous amount  of research over the last forty years.  An important theme in  this research has been that each such geometric structure has an  associated algebraic structure (called the ""fundamental group"")  which acts as a sort of genetic code for the underlying geometric  structure.  Although it is far from true that the fundamental  group always determines the underlying geometric structure, this  is true in some special cases.  Jones has recently verified that  the fundamental group always does completely determine the  ""topological nature"" of the underlying geometric structure.  To  paraphrase this, Jones has shown that the fundamental group  determines the rough outline of the underlying geometric  structure, even though it does not de termine all the details of  the geometric structure.  ***"

The focus will  be on the now classical problem of Arhangel'skii and Tall:  Are  normal locally compact metacompact spaces paracompact?   Because  of recent progress by the principal investigator, a solution to  this problem may be near.  Another set of problems revolves  around the failure of the Lindelof property in products, and  includes Michael's long-standing question concerning the  existence in ZFC of of a Lindelof space whose product with a  complete separable metric space is not Lindelof.  Yet a third set  of problems involves extensions of the PI's recent solutions to  problems of Watson, and Dow and Porter, on closed partitions of  compact Hausdorff spaces.       Set-theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical  disciplines which have common turn-of-the-century roots.  Set-  theory provides a framework upon which all of mathematics can be  based.  Objects of study in topology include familiar spaces such  as the plane and ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space, and  their subsets, as well as much more abstract spaces.  Pioneering  work of Goedel and Cohen led to the realization that some long-  standing topological questions could not be solved assuming only  the standard axioms of set-theory.  It is illuminating to  determine whether or not topological propositions are independent  of the standard axioms in this sense, and if so, what further  axioms are necessary to settle them.  This project involves just  such questions, concerning basic topological properties and  constructions, including product spaces, partitions, and  refinements of coverings.  Questions to be studied include ones  which date back to the 1960's and have been worked on by many  experts with only partial success so far.  Significant recent  progress by the principal investigator indicates that a complete  solution to some of these may now be at hand.  The new tech niques  involved in their solution are likely to be applicable to a wide  variety of other problems.  ***"

These  issues arise in  the analysis of experimental data in molecular biology and  synthetic  polymer chemistry.  The applications include model building and  theoretical  proofs of the structure and mechanism of enzymes that act on DNA,  the  quantization of topological entanglement of molecules in random  polymer  systems, the development of algorithms for the numerical  computation and  simulation of macromolecular structure, and the implementation of  these  algorithms to create mathematical data that one can compare with  experimental data.  In the topological approach to enzymology,  enzymes  vital in cellular metabolism are reacted with circular DNA  substrate.  A  topological enzyme signature is observed in the family of DNA  knots and  links produced by the reaction.  One long-range goal of this  research is  the development of a complete set of experimentally observable  topological  parameters with which to describe and compute enzyme mechanism  and the  structure of the active enzyme-DNA synaptic intermediate,  allowing  mathematical proof of 3-dimensional enzyme-DNA structure, and the  ability  to predict results of future experiments.  Many recent advances  in  3-dimensional geometry and topology (such as the Cyclic Surgery  Theorem)  are useful in the analysis of data from these topological  enzymology  experiments.       The results of this basic research project have potential  utility in  biotechnology, rational drug design and the design and  manufacture of  synthetic polymers.  Before one can harness the manufacturing  power of  bacterial cells, one must first understand what these cells are  capable of,  and then how to control these processes.  In order to combat  viruses in  human disease, and to exploit the ability of viruses to control  cellular   processes, one must understand at a fundamental level what  viruses are  doing.  An integral part of this understanding process is the  study of the  spatial configuration of large flexible molecules.  For example,  the  3-dimensional shape of cellular DNA, RNA and proteins is  crucially  important to their biological function.  Cellular DNA is highly  twisted and  convoluted, and for information retrieval and cell viability,  some  geometric and topological features must be introduced, and others  quickly  removed.  Some enzymes maintain the proper geometry and topology  of DNA in  the cell by passing one strand of DNA through another via an  enzyme-bridged  transient break in the DNA; this enzyme action plays a crucial  role in cell  metabolism, including segregation of daughter chromosomes at the  termination of replication.  Other enzymes break the DNA apart  and  recombine the ends by exchanging them.  These enzymes regulate  the  expression of specific genes, mediate viral integration into and  excision  from the host genome, mediate transposition and repair of DNA,  and  generate antibody and genetic diversity.  These enzymes perform  incredible  feats of topology at the molecular level; the description and  quantization  of such enzyme action absolutely requires the language and  computational  machinery of topology."

Examples drawn from geometry and low-dimensional  topology are of particular interest in each case.  More  specifically, attacks are planned on the problems of determining  the structure of the (countable) set of functions that arise as  Dehn functions of finitely presented groups, and the structure of  the set of flats in a CAT(0) space.  (This last problem is of  particular interest in the case of 3-manifolds.)       Geometric group theory is a young and highly dynamic area of  research in which techniques from geometry and topology are  adapted, extended, and used to solve problems in algebra.  Conversely, geometric problems are converted into questions in  group theory (encoding the symmetry of the geometric problem in  algebra) with startlingly powerful results.  For example,  questions concerning the area of minimal surfaces (like soap  films) can be converted into questions about how hard it is to  solve equations in finitely presented groups.  In many cases this  leads to a sharp solution of the original geometric problem; this  is the nature of the 'isoperimetric inequalities' and 'Dehn  functions' referred to above.  Remarkably, if one pursues this  line further, then deep and fascinating connections become  apparent between linguistics (formal grammars), computer science  (automata theory), and the geometry of interesting spaces such as  3-manifolds (e.g., the universe).  The goal of this project is to  deepen our understanding of these connections.  ***"

In the past, much of his work has been on  dynamics of area-preserving mappings and autonomous systems in  two degrees of freedom.  More recently, he has extended part of  this work to more degrees of freedom, in his recent paper,  ""Variational Construction of Connecting Orbits.""  However, this  paper is only a beginning in this direction, in the sense that it  should be possible to obtain similar results under much more  general hypotheses.  Proving the existence of connecting orbits  between minimal sets under more general hypotheses will be a  major part of Mather's research.       As an example of what one might do with such results,  consider the restricted three-body problem in the plane, i.e. the  mechanical problem with a Newtonian gravitational potential, two  massive bodies and one body of zero mass, all in the plane.  In  the case that the two massive bodies move about one another in  circular orbits, Moser showed, in the early 60's, that if the  zero mass body moves in an approximately circular orbit a long  distance from the massive bodies, then it does not escape to  infinity.  Thus one has stability.  This is part of KAM theory.   In contrast, if the massive bodies move about one another in  elliptical orbits, no such result is known.  Mather's methods  might lead to a proof that such a result is false.  There are,  however, major hurdles to be overcome before this program can be  carried out.  ***"

Together with Cynthia Curtis, Hsiang is also  interested in work on four-manifolds related to the Poincare'  conjecture.  Curtis and Hsiang recall a theorem of Wall stating  that two h-cobordant four-manifolds may be ""stabilized"" by adding  copies of S^2 x S^2 in such a way that the stabilized manifolds  are diffeomorphic.  They study obstructions to ""destabilization"";  that is, they attempt to determine whether the original manifolds  were themselves diffeomorphic.  Curtis also studies  generalizations of Casson's invariant for three-manifolds and  related invariants.   Meanwhile, Zhuang-dan Guan studies  geometric structures on manifolds.  He is interested in examples  of compact holomorphic symplectic manifolds which are not  Kaehlerian, quasi-Einstein metrics, singularities on rational  curves, and homogeneous spaces.       The investigators will study the properties of objects which  are 3-, 4-, or higher-dimensional.  Specifically, they will  develop means of determining when two objects of the same  dimension are equivalent in some sense.  Curtis and Hsiang are  working together on a certain class of four-dimensional objects.   Their work relates to a conjecture of Poincare' dating from the  turn of the century.  Guan works to determine if two  same-dimensional objects are equivalent in a stricter sense,  taking more geometry into account.  The work of all three  researchers relates in a general sense to new and exciting  developments in physics.  ***"

Their research is an attempt to prove the  conjecture that a word hyperbolic group with visual sphere at  infinity the 2-sphere acts cocompactly, properly discontinuously,  and isometrically on real hyperbolic 3-space.  By a result of  Cannon-Swenson, proving the conjecture is equivalent to proving  that a particular shingling of the visual sphere at infinity is  conformal.  The main emphasis of the project is on determining  when a sequence of shinglings of a surface is conformal.       An important special case is to understand the  intrinsicgeometry of a sequence of tilings given by a finite  subdivision rule.  As an example of a finite subdivision rule,  consider subdividing a rectangle (tile) by dividing it in half  horizontally and into thirds vertically, so as to get six smaller  rectangles (subtiles) of equal size.  If one repeats the process  inductively on the subtiles, one gets new subtiles which are  becoming distorted (tall and narrow).  Understanding whether one  can change the shapes so that the subtiles do not become  arbitrarily distorted is at the heart of an important problem in  topology and group theory.  The investigators are trying to  prove that, in the cases under consideration, there is an  intrinsic geometry in which the subtiles do not become distorted.   In some examples, to achieve this one changes the shapes of the  tiles so that they have fractal boundaries.  ***"

Analogous but more intricate  problems can be studied in the context of one-dimensional formal  groups.  The resulting algebraic objects also arise as  generalized cohomology rings in algebraic topology.  In  particular, the theory of subgroups and isogenies of deformations  of formal groups over a finite field is closely connected with  the Morava K-theory and completed E(n) cohomology of ring spectra  with higher commutativity properties.  Neil Strickland, the  postdoctoral associate, aims to prove a number of conjectures  making this connection more precise.       This research is part of algebraic topology, which  studies certain features of higher dimensional shapes, such as  how many holes they have, how the holes are linked together or  twisted around each other and so on.  These problems are  meaningful even though physical space has only three dimensions.   For example, if one quantity depends on seven others, then one  can imagine drawing a graph of the functional relationship in an  abstract eight-dimensional space.  It is possible and useful to  study the properties of this graph, even though it cannot be  realized physically.  Because it is so hard to visualize such a  space, it is helpful to convert questions about it into algebraic  problems. Broadly speaking, there are two methods of conversion,  appropriate to different types of questions.  In geometry, the  basic algebraic operation is to measure distances and angles.  In  topology, one might say that the basic operation is to count  holes (although it is not so easy to say what precisely is meant  by a three-dimensional hole in a six-dimensional object).   An interesting feature of the subject is that certain  topological questions give rise in an unexpected way to algebraic  problems which have previously been addressed in apparently  unrelated are as of mathematics, such as number theory.  The  current project aims to clarify one quite spectacular example of  this phenomenon, and to extend the relevant algebraic knowledge  so as to cover a wider family of topological situations.  ***"

Building on their past work on allowable sequences and  order types of configurations, as well as on ideas coming out of  their solution of the Vincensini problem for hyperplane  transversals to families of convex bodies and their recent  extension of convexity to Grassmann manifolds, Goodman and  Pollack plan to continue their work on configurations,  arrangements of flats, and geometric transversal theory.       One of the most elegant things that Goodman and Pollack have  done recently is to extend convexity, as noted above, from sets  of points in Euclidean spaces to sets of higher dimensional  flats, for example lines in ordinary three-space.  One obtains in  this way ""convex"" sets of lines such as all the lines through a  particular point, or all the lines in a particular plane, and  there is nothing especially exciting about these.  However, one  also obtains such sets as all the lines which are surrounded by a  particular hyperboloid of one sheet together with one set of  rulings lying on the surface of the hyperboloid.  Since the  suggestive formalism of convexity theory becomes available in  this new and broader context, it leads to some surprising new  geometric conjectures, proofs, and theorems.  ***"

A  major focal point for these investigations is W(p)(A), which is  the homotopy inverse limit of the fixed point spectra of  topological Hochschild homology of a ring A with respect to the  subgroups of the circle having order divisible by the prime p,  where the structure maps are those arising from the restriction  of equivariant maps to their fixed point subspaces.  When A is  commutative, the 0-th homotopy group of W(p)(A) consists of the  p-th Witt vectors of A, and there is a natural map from K(End(A))  to W(p)(A) which on the 0-th homotopy group is the expected map  (from work of Almkvist).  If we use W(p)(A) as a generalization  of the p-th Witt vectors, one is led to consider the homotopy  fixed point spectrum of W(p)(A) (there is a circle action) as a  possible generalization of the p-th DeRham-Witt complex.  The  composite map from K(A) to K(End(A)) (by the identity  endomorphism) to W(p)(A) factors through the homotopy orbit  spectrum of W(p)(A), and it is the investigator's hope that this  is a good modification of Bloch's crystalline chern character.       This project treats some of the algebraic apparatus that has  been developed with huge success over the past several decades  for reducing geometric information to a subject for calculation.   The nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of  the difficulty.  While questions about lengths, areas, angles,  volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to be reduced to  calculations, it is far different with what are known as  topological properties of geometric objects.  These are  properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),  knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study  of such properties, for example, how to tell whet her two  geometric objects really differ in respect to one of these  properties or are only superficially different, or how to  classify the variety of differences that can occur, all these  have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have  been reduced to matters of calculation.  The investigator's work  aims to understand better the relations among some of the  powerful algebraic tools now available for doing this, the  obvious hope being that with better understanding comes the  ability to perfect and sharpen them.  The potential value of  something so basic is hard to quantify, since topological  properties and questions arise in such widely varied mathematical  settings as the differential equations that govern satellite  motions and the conditions for equilibrium of models of the  ecomomy.  ***"

In  particular, he would like to understand the analog of the Chern  character formed by using the map from E(n) to the inverse limit  of the Lin inverse system smashed with E(n)  which gives  a v(n-1)-periodic homotopy theory .  He will also continue  his efforts to understand the result of taking the inverse limit  of the Lin inverse system smashed with the Bousfield localization  of a space with respect to the homology theory E(n).  This latter  inverse system seems to relate vn-periodic and  v(n-1)-periodic homotopy classes via an analog of the Hopf  invariant.       Topology is the study of ""spaces"" where two spaces  are considered the same if one is deformable to the other.   (For present purposes, a space can be thought of as a subset of  some  n-dimensional Euclidean space; i.e. a subset of the plane, or a  subset of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, a subset of  4-dimensional  Euclidean space, etc.  Although the spaces requiring more than 3  dimensions to describe are not familiar from our ordinary  experience, they arise frequently in most branches of  mathematics,  in physics, and in engineering applications.)  Homotopy theory  uses  algebraic techniques to study the number and kind of ""holes""  in these spaces (contrast, for example, the sort of hole in a  circle with the sort of hole in a hollow sphere).  Although this  latter information is rather coarse (it fails to distinguish  between some spaces that are topologically distinct), it still  describes much of the geometry of a space, and suffices for many  applications.  Furthermore, it turns out that the algebraic  information provided by homotopy  theory can be divided up into  what are called ""n-periodic"" types, for each non-negative integer  n.  Examining one n-periodic type of homotopy at a time leads to  some simplifications, and is more tractable than examining all  the homotopy theoretic information about a space at once.  This  project is concerned with understanding the interaction between  different n-periodic homotopy information and (n+1)-periodic  homotopy information.  These appear somewhat unrelated, but the  n-periodic information for a space restricts the possibilities  for the (n+1)-periodic information for the same space.  This is  ultimately a very useful relationship to understand, for the  0-periodic information is quite accessible, and the 1-periodic  information is also quite well understood, so one might hope to  use this relationship to describe much of the n-periodic homotopy  in terms of the k-periodic homotopy for k < n.  ***"

This includes searching for  explicit computations.  One is a blow-up formula that would  express the invariants for the connected sum of M with a complex  projective plane in terms of those for M.  Such a formula should  prove essential for understanding general relations among the  invariants.  Another part of the project, continuing work begun  with Tomasz Mrowka of Cal Tech, studies the invariants of a  4-manifold split into two pieces by a 3-torus.  These invariants  should be related by a generalized product formula to the  invariants of the two pieces.  In a more qualitative vein,  Professor Morgan intends to look for other contexts in which  these invariants may be defined, hoping that other points of view  will illuminate the theory and will explain some of the  surprisingly simple and coherent numerical results now being  obtained.  Professor Birman's project centers on the theory of  knots and links in 3-space.  She is approaching this problem from  two points of view.  The first is joint work with W. Menasco (now  in its 8th year, with much of the preliminary work completed).   Its goal is an algorithmic solution to the link problem, via the  theory of braids.  Her second project is closely related to the  first, and involves Vassiliev-Kontsevich invariants of knots and  links in 3-space.  These numerical invariants include all the  information which is contained in the Jones polynomial and its  generalizations, and possibly more.  A central question is  whether Vassiliev invariants contain more information than Jones  invariants, and, in particular,  whether they detect orientation.  The asymptotics of the dimension of the Vassiliev algebra, as the  order of the invariants goes to infinity, also involves some very  interesting problems in combinatorics, which Professor Birman is  studying.       Professor Morgan's research concerns invariants of four-  dimensional man ifolds, while Professor Birman's centers on  computers and knots.  Each is an effort to tame geometric  complexity by rendering it susceptible to numerical or algebraic  computation.  Consider the latter, for example.  While knots are  among the most familiar of everyday objects (as every fisherman  knows), their classification turns out to be a deep and difficult  problem in 3-manifold topology.  Roughly speaking, given two  knots, one would like to be able to decide (with the help of a  computer) if one can be twisted and deformed, keeping its ends  fixed and without cutting the string) until it looks like the  other.  Precisely describing a method for doing this is an  unsolved problem on which Professor Birman is working (with W.  Menasco, of SUNY Buffalo).  A different aspect of the same  question concerns a vast collection of computable invariants  (discoverd by V. Vassiliev) which give a partial answer to the  knot question.  With regard to the algebraic invariants, the  central question is exactly what information is 'missed' by the  Vassiliev invariants.  While the motivation for this work is a  wish to understand the underlying mathematical structure, one  would expect that answers to questions such as the ones being  asked would have applications wherever knots (or 4-manifolds)  occur, i.e. to biology, chemistry, and physics.  ***"

This class  consists of all the virtually cyclic subgroups of the given  group.  They envision applications of this work to differential  geometry, in particular, to questions of rigidity.       The objective is to classify geometric objects by  numerical invariants.  The geometric objects are Riemannian  manifolds, spaces which locally resemble Euclidean space except  that the notion of distance may be warped, and they arise  naturally and ubiquitously in the mathematical formulation of  physical theories.  Thus, as is familiar from the general theory  of relativity, a space can be curved; e.g., it could be a sphere  or a torus (doughnut surface).        Some basic numerical invariants of such a space are its  fundamental group and its sectional curvatures.  For example, the  curvature of the torus changes continuously from point to point,  varying between positive and negative numbers, whereas the  curvature of the sphere of radius 1 is identically 1.  Farrell  and Jones have shown that two closed negatively curved Riemannian  manifolds with the same fundamental group invariant are  homeomorphic; i.e., there is a continuous one-to-one mapping  between their points.  (The case of 3- and 4-dimensional  manifolds is still open.)  But they gave examples where the  mapping can never be smooth.  A search will be made for  additional numerical invariants guaranteeing a smooth mapping,  which is highly significant for any physical applications.  ***"

From this come trace formulae for Fuller  index-type invariants of non-singular flows, and new  K_1-invariants and ""non-commutative"" zeta functions for  suspension flows.  The extension of the latter to non-suspension  flows is a goal of the present project.  Their ""first order Euler  characteristic"" is a new invariant in topology and group theory  having properties analogous to the classical (""zeroth order"")  Euler characteristic.  They will continue to compute this in  specific cases and develop a full theory.

He seeks a criterion having the same relationship to  duality groups as the manifold property has to Poincare duality  groups.       This project is about the connections between topology,  which is a kind of fundamental geometry, and group theory, which  concerns the formal study of symmetries.  The layperson is not  accustomed to separating the ""group"" of symmetries possessed by  an object from the object itself, but group theory does just  that.  It transfers the symmetries from where they first arose to  new mathematical objects (where they again appear as symmetries  but in a different way), thus revealing subtle new features of  the group.  One aspect of this general philosophy, sometimes  called Geometric Group Theory, reaches into the depths of  Algebraic Topology, with its enormous wealth of methods and  examples, to find new and revealing settings for the group being  studied.  In the present instance, the methods of time-dependent  fixed point theory are particular ly relevant.  The investigator  and his collaborator have developed a new aspect of this part of  topology and are using it to detect new invariants of certain  kinds of groups.  While application outside mathematics is not  the driving force, they have had success in applying their work  to Dynamics, specifically to the behavior of closed orbits of  flows in certain situations, dynamics now being considered  seriously applicable mathematics.  Furthermore, the investigator  has participated in a collaboration with an applied mathematician  and an electrical engineer to use some of his methods in the  theory of electrical circuits.  ***"

In particular, he  will seek to complete the computation of the mapping class group  of an alternating link pair, and he will look into questions  concerning primality of knots and questions concerning  homomorphic images of knot groups or subgroups of knot groups.   He will search for a second proof of the Tait Conjecture and for  possible extensions of this conjecture.  These extensions could  be used to answer conjectures concerning the asymptotic density  of alternating knots.       Thistlethwaite's research treats the topology of knots and  links.  A knot is a simple closed curve, which one may think of  as a closed loop of string, situated somehow in space; a link is  a more general kind of object, consisting of one or more separate  loops.  The mathematical interest lies not so much in the  intrinsic loop, but rather in the way in which it is situated in  3-dimensional space, i.e.  in the way in which it might be  ""knotted.""  Topologists consider that two knots (or links) are  equivalent if it is possible to maneuver one to the other by  bending or stretching; no cutting is allowed.  One of the  fascinating aspects of knot theory is that it contains many  problems which are easy to state and easy for the layman to  understand, yet which persistently resist all attempts at  solution.  One such problem, which William Menasco (SUNY Buffalo)  and Thistlethwaite solved last year, was the hundred-year old  Tait  conjecture on alternating links.  The comprehensive table  of knots up to 16 crossings which Thistlethwaite and Hoste are  currently producin g will be used to test and formulate other  conjectures.  In addition, Thistlethwaite will investigate the  unknotting number of an alternating knot, this being the minimal  number of times it is necessary to pass a knot through itself to  render it trivial.  His search for an alternative proof of the  Tait conjecture will involve ""non-Euclidean"" geometry.  ***"

There are generally many ways of describing or  constructing shift systems which have essentially the same  dynamical behaviour.  Even in the one-dimensional case,  effectively recognizing when two concrete models are equivalent  is a fundamental open problem.  Another natural and related  problem is to understand the different equivalences or symmetries  between two systems.  One approach to the classification and  symmetry group problems for one-dimensional shift systems which  has led to progress on some of the main problems in the field in  recent years involves analogies from algebraic K-theory.  In  turn, the geometry of both discrete-time and continuous-time  dynamical systems and their symmetry groups has very naturally  given rise to a new type of positive algebraic K-theory for  ordered rings, using the usual row and column operations on  matrices, but with certain inequalities imposed.       The main mathematical structures under investigation here,  shift dynamical systems and Markov chains, are useful models for  phenomena in areas ranging from differential equations, to  statistical mechanics, to information and coding theory.   However, their usefulness is impaired by the surprising  difficulty of deciding when two shift systems which arose in  different ways enjoy essentially the same dynamical behaviour.   This is related to understanding the different equivalences or  symmetries between two systems.  (Symmetries of a given system  are often called reversible cellular automata.)  Now the  investigator has shown that a very abstract algebraic theory  known as algebraic K-theory can be invaluable in addressing some  of these problems.  Analogies from algebraic K-theory have led  unexpectedly to exciting progress on some of the main problems in  symbolic dynamics.  Moreover, looking at matters the other way  round has led  to a new type of K-theory, whose problems are of  interest both intrinsically and for the insight they will bring  back to dynamical systems and their symmetries.  ***"

The central model is the quantum Chern-Simons  theory with various generalizations to higher-dimensional and  non-commutative settings.  The method of Feynman diagrams gives  new invariants of knots, manifolds and new cohomology classes of  classifying spaces of diffeomorphism groups.  A non-commutative  version of the Chern-Simons theory produces cohomology classes of  moduli spaces of complex algebraic curves.  It will be applied to  algebraic construction of Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic  manifolds and to mirror symmetry.       The project applies a computational scheme developed  several decades ago in particle physics and thermodynamics  (Feynman diagrams) in various domains of modern mathematics.   Feynman graphs (visualized as spider webs) turn out to be a very  powerful tool which relates many abstract algebraic structures to  geometric and topological objects of different dimensions.  One  of the recent applications was a new series of knot invariants  (i.e. quantities distinguishing closed lines in the space without  self-intersections).  These new invariants are the first ones  which are really computable via fast working algorithms, and  they can be applicable in hydrodynamics and chemistry of long  molecules. In general, the project gives a unified view on  several parts of mathematics.  There are many strong evidences  that it leads to an understanding of so called ""mirror symmetry,""  one of the deepest discoveries of recent years in string theory,  which is a mathematical theory treating gravitation in a quantum  mechanical setting.  ***"

The goal in this area is to find numbers with a  geometric content which will describe the geometry of the object  under study.  A first step is to find numbers of this type whose  constancy in a family of objects implies that the geometry of the  family is constant in some well-defined way.  Specifically,  Gaffney looks for invariants whose constancy is necessary and  sufficient for the Whitney equisingularity of the family of sets  or maps being considered.  This condition implies that the  embedded topology of the family is constant.  For sets, Gaffney  proposes to use invariants associated with the integral closure  of a module of non-finite colength to control the Whitney  equisingularity of the family.  These invariants will play the  role that the multiplicity does for ideals and modules of finite  colength.  Gaffney will also look for similar invariants coming  from the tangent space to the A orbit of a map-germ to describe  the equisingularity of a family of mappings.       Families of sets and families of mappings (which are just  the possible relationships between sets) occur in many different  situations.  Any shape in space which changes with time can be  thought of as a family of sets--one shape for each instant of  time.  Generally speaking, the shapes will seem essentially the  same,  except for exceptional moments when drastic change seems  to occur,   after which the sets will appear to be similar again.   Given the equations that describe a shape, this project will look  for numbers which can be calculated from these equations which  will tell us when the exceptional moments are.  Some possible  applications are to robot navigation, and to the wealth of  physical problems which can be studied by looking at equilibrium  points of families of differential equations.  (In the case of  robotics, the shape consists of the set of inaccessible points to  a robot or one of its members; when the  nature of this shape  changes, the path to a goal may change.)  ***"

Building on their past work on allowable sequences and order types of configurations, as well as on ideas coming out of their solution of the Vincensini problem for hyperplane transversals to families of convex bodies and their recent extension of convexity to Grassmann manifolds, Goodman and Pollack plan to continue their work on configurations, arrangements of flats, and geometric transversal theory. One of the most elegant things that Goodman and Pollack have done recently is to extend convexity, as noted above, from sets of points in Euclidean spaces to sets of higher dimensional flats, for example lines in ordinary three-space. One obtains in this way ""convex"" sets of lines such as all the lines through a particular point, or all the lines in a particular plane, and there is nothing especially exciting about these. However, one also obtains such sets as all the lines which are surrounded by a particular hyperboloid of one sheet together with one set of rulings lying on the surface of the hyperboloid. Since the suggestive formalism of convexity theory becomes available in this new and broader context, it leads to some surprising new geometric conjectures, proofs, and theorems. ***"

The project is organized around instances of the following two general questions: Which results on cardinal functions of compact spaces generalize to countably compact spaces, and under which conditions do the latter properties (at least consistently) already imply compactness of the space? Which results on compact spaces and continuous mappings can be generalized to countably compact spaces if the space is a topological group (and the mapping is also a homomorphism)? The concept of compactness of a topological space lies at the heart of General Topology; it is its most important idea from the point of view of applications. In order to understand the notion of compactness fully, one has also to study weakenings of the compactness property. Perhaps the most important such weakening is a property called countable compactness. The aim of the project is to determine which theorems about compact spaces and continuous functions between compact spaces remain valid if the spaces in question are only assumed to be countably compact instead of compact. A similar investigation will be done for topological groups, that is, for spaces which in addition to the topology also carry the structure of an algebraic group. ***"

Set-theoretic topology has grown explosively in the last two decades as a result of such interaction, stimulating much fruitful research in set theory as well. In the last few years, however, the flow of results has shown signs of abating, and the development of new set-theoretic axioms and techniques will probably be needed to keep this area of topology in good health. The problem areas on which particular stress will be laid are hereditary normality; the structure and products of countably compact spaces; and the theory of nonmetrizable manifolds. Set-theoretic topology is more of a foundational subject than the rest of topology, primarily concerning itself with very abstract spaces and with the impact on topology of the adoption of variants of the axioms of set theory. Secondarily, it has applications not only to set theory and the rest of topology, but also to analysis and algebra, particularly the theory of Boolean algebras. Nyikos's research has emphasized all these aspects. For example, he has done an extensive study of the differential structures (i.e. smoothings) that can be imposed on the long line, and of the associated 2-dimensional manifold of its tangent vectors, providing valuable heuristics for those wishing to understand nontrivial smoothings of more familiar but higher-dimensional manifolds. (This is a subject of major importance today, especially in 4 dimensions, where the interplay with theoretical physics is strong.) Some of the smoothings of the long line required axioms outside the usual axioms of set theory. Nyikos has been a leader in the use of these axioms in set-theoretic topology ever since his involvement over a decade ago in the discovery that a famous unproved conjecture concerning Moore spaces was actually independent of the usual basic axiom s of set theory. Moreover, this conjecture was shown to be inconsistent with the Cantor Continuum Hypothesis, a far more familiar proposition that most working mathematicians would be likely to choose if they had to make a choice. This result suggests the flavor of the best set-theoretic topology. ***"

Specifically, he will study a natural simplicial completion of Teichmueller space, where the associated compactification of moduli space is conjectured to be an orbifold; this compactification should be a useful tool for several enumerative problems in geometry. Various arithmetic aspects of moduli space will be studied: polylogarithm identities should be derived from canonical forms on moduli space; there should be a map from moduli space to Volodin space relating the cohomology of moduli space with algebraic K-theory; number fields associated to fatgraphs a la Grothendieck's dessin d'enfant should be calculated for the investigator's existing database of fatgraphs. This same database should be used to calculate homology groups of various moduli spaces on the computer. There are, moreover, many outstanding analytic and arithmetic questions to be studied about his universal Teichmueller space, which is simply the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle modulo the Moebius group. Several of the projects above are closely related to various developments in physics. A basic object in mathematics, called the ""moduli space of Riemann surfaces,"" has been studied for centuries. Roughly, this moduli space is the collection of all possible geometric shapes on a fixed two-dimensional surface. In the last decade or so, our understanding of moduli space has increased, both because of developments in mathematics, as well as new and exciting interfaces with high-energy physics. Indeed, many idealized but interesting real physics problems amount to questions about the geometry of moduli space itself, and this has provided a remarkable influx of techniques, questions, and ideas, both to mathematics and to physics. In this project, the investigator will continue his ongoing mathematical study of moduli space and furt her study certain of these interfaces with high-energy physics. ***"
