The workshop will bring together 35 early-career mathematicians to facilitate collaborative research and training. The workshop will provide an unparalleled opportunity for young researchers who use the tools of homotopy theory to develop long-lasting and meaningful international collaborations. The award will allow US-based researchers to be involved in this unique opportunity.  The organizers have secured funding for the conference through the ICMS covering most conference costs and this National Science Foundation grant will specifically fund travel to the conference for US-based mathematicians. Participation of US-based mathematicians will be beneficial to the progress of not only homotopy theory research in the US, but also to mathematical progress in many adjacent disciplines.  <br/><br/>Homotopical techniques originated in algebraic topology and homological algebra, but in recent years more broad applications of homotopy theory abound. For example, homotopical tools and ideas play a major work in the influential work of Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze on  integral p-adic Hodge theory; work of Scholze?Clausen on condensed mathematics; work of Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel on the Kervaire invariant one problem; and a resolution of a conjecture of Grothendieck by Carlson?Haine?Wolf. These examples highlight the timeliness and importance of promoting research collaborations amongst young homotopy theorists. With this in mind, the conference will be organized to provide a research collaboration launching pad for participants. The conference will feature thirteen talks by participants, providing an opportunity for participants to share and discuss their work to their peers. Amongst the speakers are the four invited early-career speakers: Robert Burklund (Copenhagen), Peter Haine (Berkeley), Alice Hedenlund (Uppsala), and Lucy Yang (Columbia). <br/><br/>The conference will also include two mini-courses by Clark Barwick and Piotr Pstr?gowski. The mini-course topics will bring participants to the forefront of these active research areas, creating a pathway to engage new scholars. There will be two evening lightning sessions, where participants can give ten- to fifteen-minute talks showcasing their research, and there will be a poster session on Monday. The conference schedule will also allow ample time for informal discussion.

Here, spaces are considered the same if one can be transformed into the other without cutting or gluing. One is often interested in computing algebraic invariants which can distinguish spaces up to this equivalence. One such invariant is homology, which lets one study the shape of spaces using linear algebra. In low dimensions, homology measures very concrete aspects of a space; for instance it detects the number of loops in a graph or the number of holes in a surface. In high dimensions, it measures more complicated features, and is generally more difficult to compute. The PI will study several long-standing conjectures on the topology of aspherical manifolds, as well as recent breakthroughs connecting homology growth to various aspects of fibering. This project will also promote graduate and undergraduate education through the writing of a textbook on L^2-homology and the development of new Vertically Integrated Research courses at Louisiana State University. <br/><br/>The primary goal of the research program is to study the growth of homology (with various coefficients) in a residual tower of finite regular covers of an aspherical manifold. One of the motivating conjectures is that for a large class of closed, aspherical manifolds, sublinear homology growth in all degrees and all field coefficients implies that the manifold has a finite cover which fibers over the circle. This is a key step towards developing a high-dimensional analogue of Agol's Virtual Fibering Theorem ?in dimension 3. In one direction, the PI plans to construct closed, aspherical Gromov hyperbolic manifolds of any odd dimension which have nontrivial F_p-homology growth. The PI will also study fibering  (and various group theoretic analogues) for Gromov-Thurston manifolds and other classical examples. In a related direction, the PI will continue work on Singer conjecture's on vanishing of L^2-homology groups for certain locally CAT(0) cubulated manifolds. In the final part of the project, the PI will investigate Atiyah's conjecture on integrality of L^2-Betti numbers for some classes of Artin groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator will study a knot?s properties defined by its quantum invariants, constructed by summing over weighted ?states? of the knot. The project aims to recover certain quantum invariants of a knot by assigning classical objects to each weight and state. This will, in a way, make precise the idea of quantum mechanical theories and classical theories predicting the same physical phenomena at large scale. In the long-term, the investigator will apply the results toward the goal of developing new theories governing the behavior of knots. For the broader impacts of the project, the investigator will recruit talented undergraduate students at Texas State University to work on summer research that directly contributes to the research program and train them to disseminate their work to the local community. The summer program will culminate in an annual quantum topology conference at Texas State University to support network development for early career mathematicians, that broadly includes graduate students and postdocs working in quantum topology in the United States.<br/><br/>The project will proceed along three main lines of inquiry, where the first component investigates the simplification of a presentation of the Khovanov homology of torus links with the aim of giving a general decomposition of the colored Jones polynomial, the decategorification of colored Khovanov homology. With her collaborators the investigator will apply the formula for the decomposition to study the volume conjecture of a subfamily of highly-twisted alternating links. The second component will generalize Garoufalidis? Jones slope conjecture to include surfaces in 4-dimensions and study the number-theoretical implications via Zeilberger?s machinery.

The first-of-its-kind event will bring together experts in a relatively small subfield of mathematical physics to concentrate efforts on making meaningful progress on open problems while training a new generation of students and early-career mathematicians to work in the area. The workshop activities are designed with the intention of developing a strong network of researchers in equivariant topological quantum field theory across the Americas.<br/><br/>Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) give mathematically rigorous descriptions of systems whose physics is independent of the geometry of spacetime. These theories are playing an increasingly important role in theoretical and mathematical physics, where they model the symmetries of ordinary quantum field theories as well as certain low-energy quantum systems called topological phases of matter which are influential in developing both hardware and software for quantum computers. TQFTs are also an invaluable source of inspiration in pure mathematics, where they provide a bridge between the subjects of algebra and topology. Equivariant TQFTs specifically capture TQFTs with symmetry and thus represent a critical aspect in the study of TQFTs.

TDA has emerged as a powerful framework for capturing the intrinsic shape of data and now informs work in areas such as biology, machine learning, and materials science. Because the field is evolving rapidly across theory, algorithms, and real-world use cases, the program aims to balance cutting-edge theory with demonstrations of practical impact across disciplines.

This is an emerging field that combines ideas from classical algebra and modern homotopy theory. Classical algebra studies systems like the real numbers, with operations such as addition and multiplication that satisfy several rules (such as associative and distributive laws).  Higher algebra studies structures in which these equalities are replaced by coherent witnesses, called homotopies. Over the past several decades, mathematicians have discovered that many important algebraic structures can be refined in this way, leading to many applications to other disciplines, such as mathematical physics and foundations of computer science. The project will study such higher structures in the subfield of stable homotopy theory. Moreover, the project will support the training and development of junior mathematicians in the field. <br/>	 <br/>The project aims to use methods from algebraic K-theory and power operations to study chromatic homotopy theory. Chromatic homotopy theory studies questions in stable homotopy theory (e.g., stable homotopy groups of spheres) via tools arising from the algebraic geometry of formal groups. Recently, categorical and K-theoretic techniques play an increasing role in the subject. The PI and collaborator intend to study the chromatic localizations of K-theory and other invariants of ring spectra, and relate them with recent advances in p-adic geometry such as the new theory of prismatization. <br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the US National Science Foundation and by the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representation theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with the study of symmetry using techniques from linear algebra, such as vectors and matrices. Classical examples of symmetry include rotations of a circle and reflections of a square. Modern research in mathematics naturally encounters more abstract notions of symmetry and requires the development of more advanced techniques for their study. The PI will identify and study concrete instances of these abstract symmetries and apply the results to advance the mathematical understanding of quantum field theory in dimensions two and three. The research will also develop new connections between algebra, representation theory, and low dimensional topology. This project integrates education, research, and career training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Examples include creating a series of videos which will improve the algebra education of Utah's high school mathematics teachers-in-training, and organizing the graduate student focused Moab Topology Conference.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will engage in three related research projects. Each project is motivated by and has direct implications for the long-standing conjecture that Rozansky-Witten theory, a three dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theory, defines a non-semisimple topological field theory. In the first project the PI will further develop and extend the theory of relative modular categories and their associated non-semisimple topological field theories to find new connections with homological blocks of 3-manifolds. In the second project the PI will develop the representation theory of affine L-infinity algebras and unrolled quantum groups and use the results to construct abelian approximations of Rozansky-Witten theory. In the third project the PI will extend his work on twisted equivariant matrix factorizations to construct non-semisimple, possibly unoriented, topological field theories for Landau-Ginzburg theory and explore their interpretation as Rozansky-Witten defects.

Computer proof assistants are likely to become more integral to the working life of mathematicians in the future.  As different proof assistants often implement the rules of different formal systems, mathematicians may even elect to prove certifiably-correct theorems in a non-standard ?synthetic? foundation system. The PI will develop three project clusters that involve computer formalization of higher category theory in parallel with theoretical projects necessary to facilitate this work. The formalization projects each have several student collaborators, who are developing their skills with these tools while making significant scientific contributions.<br/><br/>The first project will introduce (?, 1)-category theory to Lean?s otherwise broad-ranging library Mathlib via the formalism of an ?-cosmos, developed in prior joint work of the PI. This approach will leverage Mathlib?s existing bicategories library and largely sidestep the apparent difficulty in formalizing proofs that directly deploy the quasi-categories model. A second project also aims to formalize theorems about (?, 1)-categories, but in a non-standard foundation system designed to make conceptually-simpler constructions and proofs fully rigorous. There is an experimental computer proof assistant Rzk that verifies proofs written in simplicial homotopy type theory, a formal system developed in prior joint work of the PI, and ongoing work to formalize (?, 1)-category theory in this synthetic framework. This project aims to expand this system, which is insufficiently expressive to encompass the full theory of (?, 1)-categories, without narrowing its semantics, which include (?, 1)-categories defined internally to an arbitrary ?-topos. The final project aspires to develop a prototypical synthetic theory of (?, n)-categories by developing a new type theory for marked shapes to provide a finitary syntactic encoding of (?, n)-categorical data with semantics in the new comical spaces model. These pen-and-paper developments will enable (?, n)-category theory to be formalizable in the future, once a suitable computer proof assistant is built to implement the rules of this new proposed formal system. The medium-term objectives include specific formalization targets that will then be available to other users of Lean?s Mathlib and Rzk?s simplicial homotopy type theory libraries. The long-term objective is to make (?, 1)-category theory and eventually also (?, n)-category theory more accessible to non-experts, who could use the computer formalized proofs as ingredients in their work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research area of K-theory was precisely engineered to achieve this, and for this reason it permeates a wide range of mathematical fields, encoding meaningful information about any setting where there is a reasonable notion of ?splitting?. A K-theory machinery stores this data in a topological space, which is able to record which objects break up into smaller pieces, as well as how these splittings occur. Unpacking the data present in a K-theory space and reinterpreting it in terms of the original structures of interest, is both the main goal and the main challenge of the field of K-theory. In this project, the PI will carry out two independent research lines in this direction that aim to make strides in our understanding of the K-theory spaces of manifolds (smooth shapes with no sharp edges or corners, central to geometry and physics) and of Lawvere theories (a main character in universal algebra and logic), using the newly-introduced framework of combinatorial K-theory. A third research line, and an underlying theme throughout this project, pushes the state of the art of combinatorial K-theory, developing tools and paving the way for new examples and applications to come. Integrated into this project is the mentoring and training of students, as well as the organization of a collaborative workshop, the creation of a new professional development class for graduate students on mathematical communication skills, and the development of new active learning materials for undergraduate education that will be made broadly available to the mathematical community. <br/><br/>The emerging subfield of combinatorial K-theory introduces new techniques to study structures whose splittings have a combinatorial flavor; for instance, by placing a focus on complements, instead of quotients or cofibers. Exciting new developments in the field, such as the introduction of new simplicial models and of robust comparison theorems reminiscent of the best features of classical algebraic and homotopical settings, place combinatorial K-theory in an advantageous spot and make this an ideal time for ambitious explorations. In this project, the PI will exploit these recent developments in order to explore three applications of vastly different mathematical flavors. The PI plans to: (a) Give a first computation of K1 of cut-and-paste K-theory for manifolds; (b) Introduce a K-theory of endomorphisms and a version of the Fundamental theorem of K-theory<br/>in the combinatorial setting, with a particular focus on finite sets; and (c) Explore connections between K-theory and logic by constructing localizations for the K-theory of Lawvere theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The physical universe is modeled on such a space, and indeed many of the tools mathematicians use to study these spaces come from physics. One of these tools, called instanton Floer homology, comes from an area called gauge theory and is related to Maxwell's equations for electricity and magnetism. Another, Heegaard Floer homology, comes from an area called symplectic geometry and is related to classical mechanics. Although these tools come from disparate areas of mathematics and physics, they share striking similarities. One of the PI's central aims is to unify these and other Floer-theoretic tools in ways that explain these similarities, and to use this unification to discover new features of spaces in dimensions three and four.

While the study of the Seiberg-Witten equations has provided fundamental tools to tackle problems in low-dimensional topology, their relation with geometry is still very mysterious. The main goal of the project is to tackle this question using spectral theory (the study of the frequencies at which objects vibrate) as a stepping stone.

In each case, it is natural, and often important, to understand how those curves can move or vary. Over time, curves that move, and perhaps coalesce, sweep surfaces. These surfaces lie not in the familiar 3-dimensional space, but in 4-space, with time as the fourth coordinate. This project develops several tools, all centered around understanding curves in 3-space and surfaces in 4-space. One project studies techniques called Floer homology, that use the global behavior of partial differential equations to study curves. Those tools encode a lot of information, but are hard to compute; the project studies properties that let one extract information from them in a practical way. Another project uses techniques from high-dimensional topology to study a particular class of curves that arise from wave fronts, called Legendrian knots. A third project focuses on the information contained in an algebraic invariant of surfaces, Khovanov homology. Broader impacts of this project include graduate training, seminars, and writing a textbook that would be a resource for students and early researchers in Khovanov homology.<br/> <br/>Heegaard Floer homology, Khovanov homology, and Floer homotopy theory continue to transform the understanding of low-dimensional topology. Their impact has faced certain limits, however. While the Khovanov invariants for surfaces distinguish some surfaces not visible to knot Floer homology, there are few tools for computing these Khovanov invariants, other than brute force and good fortune. There is also a lack of tools for computing the most refined Heegaard Floer invariants (e.g., the concordance invariant Upsilon) in natural settings, like for satellite knots. There is a lack of explicit examples in Floer homotopy theory, particularly of higher structures like the spectral Fukaya category, making it harder to understand, in detail, what structures should be sought and what information they likely contain. This project seeks to address these difficulties, by developing formal properties of the Khovanov invariants of surfaces, an extension of the ""minus"" variant of Heegaard Floer homology to 3-manifolds with boundary, and a stable homotopy refinement of Legendrian contact homology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on 2-dimensional spaces called surfaces, which are fundamental in many areas of mathematics.  Surfaces can be flat, like a piece of paper, or curved, like the outside of a ball, a donut, or a saddle, and the various shapes they take often strongly constrain the shapes of the higher dimensional spaces in which they live.  The educational portion of this project involves a variety of activities aimed at recruiting and supporting marginalized students into mathematics.  The first part continues a series of workshops featuring mini-courses by early career speakers from underrepresented groups on their cutting-edge research aimed at graduate students. The second part establishes a series of undergraduate research and recruitment events connecting undergraduate mathematics researchers in Southern California with graduate recruiters from programs in the region.  The third part is a Topical Pedagogy Seminar which will provide graduate students and postdocs training in incorporating topical material into foundational mathematics courses.<br/><br/>A remarkable and ubiquitous example of this mathematical phenomenon is a surface bundle, which just like a donut, can be sliced so that the cross-sections are surfaces. Unlike a donut, however, as one moves through most surface bundles, the surface cross-sections can twist and deform in complicated ways.  This twisting?which essentially determines the bundle?is encoded in the mapping class group, which, among other things, is the collection of all symmetries of the space of shapes that a surface can take, also known as Teichmüller space.  The first part of the research program aims to develop a powerful fleet of combinatorial techniques for studying the geometry of mapping class groups and Teichmüller spaces, as well as their structure at infinity.  The second part focuses on the geometry of surface bundles arising naturally from dynamics.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project will investigate the coarse geometry of the mapping class group, Teichmüller space, and surface bundles using the tools of geometric group theory.  The first part aims to address a family of results showing that mapping class groups can be coherently locally modeled by CAT(0) cube complexes, allowing for the construction of new metrics with a variety of applications, including about their geometry and topology at infinity.  The second part studies the geometry of surface bundles of Veech surfaces and their combinations, as well as developing a Sullivan-like notion of structural stability for the subgroups associated to a variety of surface bundles with nice curvature properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central objects of study in this project are Legendrian links, which may be visualized as certain loops of string in three-dimensional space tied together at their ends. Legendrian links play a key role in the modern study of symplectic geometry in three and four dimensions. The project seeks to develop and explore new algebraic structures associated to Legendrian links, by combining an established framework, developed over the past few decades, with recent ideas from other areas of mathematics such as combinatorics and algebraic geometry. This research will create new algebraic structures that can be applied to answer some long-unsolved questions in symplectic geometry. The Principal Investigator will also train future mathematicians through his work organizing undergraduate summer research programs at Duke University and other extracurricular activities for students.<br/><br/>The project is built around an algebraic invariant of Legendrian links called Legendrian contact homology, which was originally developed roughly three decades ago and has emerged as one of the premier tools in modern symplectic topology. The Principal Investigator will develop a number of interrelated enhancements of Legendrian contact homology. Some are combinatorial in nature, including a quantization of Legendrian contact homology that has a conjectural relationship to mirror symmetry; others are more geometric, including a topological stable homotopy type that lifts Legendrian contact homology into the realm of Floer homotopy theory. These enhancements, which can be viewed as strengthened versions of existing invariants, are motivated by recently-discovered connections between symplectic geometry and other mathematical areas such as cluster theory in combinatorics. This project will apply the enhanced invariants to study open questions in symplectic topology, notably the question of classifying certain surfaces in four dimensions, called Lagrangian fillings, with prescribed boundary conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology is the study of geometry where you identify one geometric object with another if one can be deformed into the other.  The goal of algebraic topology is to ascribe discrete algebraic invariants to these geometric objects to distinguish their topological types.  Understanding the topological type of geometric objects is a fundamental act of scientific/mathematical inquiry, comparable to the study of prime numbers, or the classification of the fundamental particles that constitute matter and carry forces.  Topological computations have also been applied to solve problems in physics, and the field of topological data analysis applies the tools of algebraic topology to the qualitative study of high-dimensional data-sets.  The focus of the project is on the interaction of localized and unlocalized computations of homotopy groups.  Homotopy groups are the fundamental algebraic invariants which arise from geometric objects but are often very difficult to compute.  These computations are made more accessible through the process of localization (inverting classes), but this process of localization loses information.  The project will enhance our understanding of how to extract information about delocalized homotopy groups from these localizations.  Activities in this project will also contribute to the training of the next generation of mathematicians.<br/>  <br/>The specific research activities center around the recent disproof of the Telescope Conjecture by Burklund-Hahn-Levy-Schlank, which implies that the relationship between K(n)-local homotopy groups and unlocalized homotopy groups is much more subtle than previously imagined.  The PI will complete our understanding of the homotopy groups of the K(2)-local sphere in the last open case of p = 2 using a new elliptic resolution, and the relationship of this resolution to the tmf-resolution will be leveraged to relate the extensive low dimensional computations of Isaksen-Wang-Xu of 2-primary stable stems to the K(2)-local computations.  Generalizations of the effective slice spectral sequence to other groups will be investigated using the techniques of synthetic homotopy theory.

The goal of this research project is to study the relationship of contact topology to quantum physics and to quantum invariants of knots and links and further develop the study of contact structures in higher dimensions, which is still in its infancy despite significant advances in recent years.

One of the goals is to better understand the topological quantum field theory (TQFT) underlying this discovery, relate it to string topology, and define and analyze the 3- and 4-manifold invariants corresponding to this theory.  The second is to continue the systematic study of convex hypersurface theory --- a technique to decompose a contact manifold into easier-to-analyze pieces --- following the works of the Principal Investigator in collaboration with Breen and Huang and to apply them in the analysis of codimension two contact submanifolds and higher homotopy groups of the space of contact structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CIRM is a well-known international mathematics conference center, and the Principal Investigator of this grant, Professor David T. Gay of the University of Georgia, has been selected as CIRM's ""Jean Morlet Chair"" for the period July-December 2025 for the purpose of organizing  a semester's worth of international activities at CIRM related to his research program in topology. This grant will support the travel and accommodation expenses of US-based mathematicians to participate in some of these events. The research topic, in topology, concerns new methods to study the intrinsic large-scale shapes of a wide range of spaces called manifolds: Manifolds are spaces which at the small scale, look just like the ordinary space around us, perhaps with more dimensions, but which can be tangled up with themselves in strange ways on the large scale. Interesting manifolds arise, for example, when thinking about all the possible configurations of a mechanical system, such as a robot or a human limb, when thinking about all the possible states of a large language model under training in an artificial intelligence system, or when understanding how a protein folds. Trisections, and generalizations of these, give universal ways to decompose manifolds into a small number of simple pieces (often that number is 3) that are easy to understand, so that understanding the large-scale topology reduces to understanding the rules for how these small number of simple pieces can fit together to make a single closed manifold. Besides increasing our understanding of fundamental mathematical objects underlying many scientific applications, a key broader impact of this grant will be to provide opportunities for early career US-based mathematicians from a broad range of institutions to interact with the international scientific community, establish new collaborations and engage in a rapidly developing research field. Compared to many fields within mathematics, the subject matter of this semester of activities presents a relatively low bar for entry and a fairly quick access for the beginner to rich, deep and challenging mathematics, and also presents many opportunities for engagement with the broader public through interesting visualization and illustration activities.<br/><br/><br/>Since Gay?s initial work on trisections of smooth 4?manifolds in 2013, there has been an explosion of activity in the field leading to at least 92 published papers on trisections and related topics listed on MathSciNet. Fundamental questions have been answered and extensive generalizations have been developed, connecting the field to many other important areas in topology. Two distinct relative versions of trisections have been developed, trisections of 4?manifolds with boundary, relative to open book decompositions, and trisections of 4?manifolds with embedded surfaces. Connections with algebraic geometry and symplectic geometry have been developed as well as connections with piecewise linear topology and higher-dimensional topology. In work with Abrams and Kirby, Gay used trisections of 4?manifolds to define group trisections and thus show that the study of smooth 4?manifolds could in principal be completely reduced to group theoretic questions. This is just the tip of the iceberg, and the time is right for an international meeting to survey progress in the field, hear about the latest results, and develop a collective plan for future steps. This is the purpose of the main conference in October, which will be preceded by a week-long Research School to help early career researchers get up to speed. The two workshops, one in July and one in November, will bring together smaller groups of researchers for more focused exploration and collaborative research work on some specific topics related to higher-dimensional generalizations and symplectic geometry.

The theory of dynamical systems studies such movements by replacing the three-dimensional space with a finite two-dimensional slice. Though tremendously powerful, this technique has its limits. For instance, there is no finite, two-dimensional space that captures all of the original system?s dynamics. This project explores new ways of understanding low-dimensional dynamical systems that are inspired by the classical approach and seeks to unify major threads in the study of structures on three-dimensional spaces. In terms of broader impacts, the PI will continue to co-organize a regional seminar, mentor graduate students, and volunteer mathematics homework help and tutoring during the afterschool program at a local recreation center.  <br/><br/>The PI?s research divides into three interrelated themes. First, the PI will work on classifying all pseudo-Anosov flows that are transverse to a fixed taut foliation. His approach proceeds by first understanding the universal circles associated to such a foliation and builds on recent advances made in his joint work with Landry and Minsky. Second, the PI will connect the dynamics and topology of these flows and foliations with the hyperbolic geometry of the underlying three-manifold. In particular, the PI and his collaborators recently developed a new method to study endperiodic maps of infinite-type surfaces by producing a ?pseudo-Anosov?like? representative associated to the flow. The PI will exploit this new structure by studying the dynamics of the resulting maps and the hyperbolic geometry of their mapping tori. Third, the PI will extend these new techniques into the dynamical study of free-by-cyclic groups and toward the geometric study of mapping class groups. This includes answering long-standing algorithmic questions in mapping class groups and developing a new fixed-point theory of pseudo-Anosov maps, which itself has consequences for hyperbolic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low-dimensional topology is the study of three- and four-dimensional shapes or spaces, examples of which are the surrounding physical space and space-time respectively. Surprisingly, these dimensions are substantially less understood than higher dimensions. In the past forty years, significant progress on central topological questions relating to three- and four-dimensional spaces has been made using invariants from gauge theory, which deals with solutions to sets of partial differential equations from physics, and Floer theory, which arises from the mathematical generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics. This project uses tools from Floer theory to study certain algebraic structures on the set of three-dimensional spaces, and to address other topological questions, many of which concern mathematical knots, which are closely connected to three-dimensional spaces. A particular focus of the project is on understanding and applying versions of Floer theory which incorporate the information of a symmetry, such as a reflection or a rotation, that a space may exhibit. In addition to the research component, the project includes plans to further the PI's mentoring efforts. These plans include mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, conducting summer research with undergraduate students, running mathematics day camps for middle school students, and supervising student-led K-12 events at Rutgers.<br/> <br/>Building on their prior work, the PI and coauthors will explore the longstanding open question of the existence of torsion in the integer homology cobordism group, as well as give a full equivariant surgery formula for Heegaard Floer homology with respect to extrinsic symmetries of knots and links and use it to study the equivariant homology cobordism group of three-manifolds with orientation-preserving involutions. In another direction, the PI and coauthors will study symplectic Khovanov homology, and in particular show that their recent construction of an annular symplectic Khovanov homology agrees with combinatorial annular Khovanov homology and extend their formulation to a full symplectic APS homology.

Among other things, it can be used to place subtle and surprising restrictions on the dynamics of a broad class of systems (think motions of celestial bodies or the molecules in a gas). Understanding the scope of these restrictions and how to effectively utilize them in naturally arising physical systems is an exciting active area of research. In this project, the PI will develop new tools and paradigms to study the quantitative side of symplectic geometry. The PI will also initiate the study of ""digital symplectic geometry"", which aims to link deep geometric tools with numerical simulations and methods from machine learning. In addition, the PI will also be actively involved in various community-building and mentorship activities, including organizing intensive learning retreats for the wider Southern California geometry and topology community and mentoring undergraduates in research projects at the interface of pure and applied mathematics.<br/><br/>In more detail, a central theme is to develop filtered refinements and higher extensions of powerful emerging tools from pseudoholomorphic curve theory (symplectic field theory, Floer homology, Gromov?Witten invariants, Fukaya categories, ...) in order to systematically investigate rigidity and flexibility properties of Hamiltonian flows. Along the way, this project will explore new types of geometric enumerative problems (e.g. multidirectional tangency constraints) whose solutions uncover intriguing connections with algebra and combinatorics (scattering diagrams, Q-Gorenstein smoothings, cluster algebras, quiver representations, ...). Three major components of this project are: (1) undertaking a novel strategy for tackling higher dimensional symplectic ellipsoid embeddings by exploiting links between symplectic field theory and singular algebraic curves and importing ideas from Gross?Siebert mirror symmetry, (2) exploring new frontier research avenues for real-valued invariants called symplectic capacities, notably by pursuing a quantitative theory of Fukaya categories and by pushing higher symplectic capacities into the world of contact geometry, and (3) building a new computational framework called digital symplectic geometry which aims to analyze Hamiltonian dynamics and nonsqueezing phenomena by performing numerical simulations and incorporating methods from computer optimization and machine learning. The projects in this proposal will develop deep and surprising connections between quantitative symplectic geometry and various other areas, including algebraic curve theory, birational geometry, mirror symmetry, and more. For instance, the PI will construct new interesting families of singular algebraic plane curves which also shed light on scattering diagrams arising from cluster algebras and quiver representations. The PI will also develop and exploit connections between symplectic singular Lagrangian fibrations and algebraic deformations of Fano varieties, and to bridge recent work on Weinstein manifolds and their qualitative Fukaya categories with the quantitative theory of symplectic capacities. Furthermore, the proposed projects in digital symplectic geometry aim to create new mechanisms for generating and testing conjectures in Hamiltonian dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) aims to develop new techniques based on topology and other disciplines in pure mathematics to understand complex data. Research questions are strongly motivated by applications from neuroscience, image recognition, biology, material science, geography, and beyond. The underlying idea is that topology helps recognize patterns within data and, therefore, turn data into compressed, useful knowledge. Besides advancing the progress of science by helping to prepare the next generation of applied topologists, this school is also designed to expand the reach of applied topology.<br/><br/>The topic of the school is the study of general techniques to achieve stability of invariants in TDA that can be applied to different objects, from persistence modules to Reeb graphs. In particular, the focus is on questions about the stability of various TDA tools: 1) Which metrics can be introduced to ensure the stability of traditional topological invariants? 2) Which invariants can be developed to ensure stability with respect to traditional metrics? Through questions like these, TDA enriches the traditional fields of algebraic topology and geometry while at the same time striving for theoretical guarantees for practitioners in data analysis. There will be three lecturers alternating in the mornings, an introductory poster section, problem sessions in the afternoons, and a few short research talks from the participants. Ultimately, the school?s goal is to encourage students to develop their own application-motivated results in TDA by considering well-established principled strategies.

This event is the ninth in a series of conferences, held every eight years since 1961 at the University of Georgia, and will focus on recent developments in geometric topology. Topological spaces are everywhere in mathematics and in fact everywhere in real life. From ordinary 3-dimensional space and the 4-dimensional space-time of relativity to spaces of configurations of complex organic molecules and sets of solutions to systems of many equations, the basic problems of topology are ubiquitous.  Geometric topology, in particular, focuses on problems in which a strong visual component of reasoning and problem solving comes into play and is generally the most accessible part of topology for a broad audience.  At the same time it is the realm of topology in which some of the hardest outstanding problems remain unsolved. Recent developments to be highlighted at this conference include, for example, the remarkable results of Watanabe, which show that the set of all symmetries of the simplest 4-dimensional object, the 4-dimensional ball, is drastically more complicated than had been suspected eight years ago.<br/><br/>This conference focuses on the most significant advancements in geometric topology and related geometry since the last Georgia International Topology Conference in 2017.  The topics will highlight exciting new developments including advances in knot theory, four-manifolds, topology of diffeomorphism and embedding spaces, homotopy theory, contact and symplectic topology and geometry, equivariant Floer homology, Floer homotopy theory, geometric group theory, hyperbolic manifolds and dynamical systems. The conference has historically generated tremendous interest among graduate students and recent PhD?s.

The workshop aims to create a dynamic platform where both established and emerging researchers, specializing in infinite-type surfaces and related fields, can come together. This event's goal is twofold: first, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of recent breakthroughs in the field, and second, to explore various avenues for future research and encourage future collaboration. Furthermore, enabling US-based scientists to attend this international meeting has two additional benefits: (1) Allowing for future long term collaborations with researchers outside of the US, and (2) Providing a means to disseminate research and results to the global mathematical community. <br/><br/>Infinite-type surfaces serve as a common thread connecting various areas of mathematics. An infinite-type surface is a two dimensional manifold with ""infinitely much topology,'' e.g. the sphere with a Cantor set of points removed or a surface of infinite genus. They appear in the study of polygonal billiards, topological dynamics, as generic leaves of foliations on compact spaces, in the study of Thompson groups, or in 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. More recently, there has been a significant surge in the study of mapping class groups associated with infinite-type surfaces, also known as big mapping class groups. These are topological groups exhibiting rich phenomenology. As automorphism groups of countable structures, often endowed with well-defined large-scale geometry, they also inhabit the intersection of geometric group theory, model theory, and descriptive set theory. While infinite-type surfaces possess this interdisciplinary nature, historically, only two workshops (in 2013 and 2019) have brought together experts from diverse fields sharing this common theme. Thus, the primary scientific objective of this workshop is to convene a diverse group of mathematicians to facilitate cross-pollination among the different areas converging on infinite-type surfaces.

Arithmetic Geometry is the study of spaces from the point of view of number theory and is largely concerned with the solutions of polynomial equations, especially over the integers. Algebraic K-Theory and Algebraic Cycles are certain special techniques that can understand the geometric nature of a problem, one that is again defined in terms of polynomial equations.

The powerful techniques introduced for the solution of the above conjectures have stimulated work on several outstanding remaining problems in the area, which are often arithmetic in nature, but use sophisticated tools from Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic cycles. The goal of the program is to focus on several of the outstanding problems in the area, surveying the progress made and planning strategies for further advancement.

Scissors congruence originated in Hilbert's 3rd Problem, which asks when two polyhedra in three-dimensional space are ""scissors congruent,"" meaning one can be obtained from the other by cutting it into smaller polyhedra and reassembling in a different way.  This question, together with its solution by Dehn, initiated an extensive program of research. Over the past 120 years these ideas have grown and now connect to almost every branch of geometry. Ground-breaking recent work provides a fundamental link between this program and algebraic K-theory, which is itself a deep and rapidly developing area of research.  Algebraic K-theory intertwines three major fields of mathematics: topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory. Developing the connection between scissors congruence and algebraic K-theory will significantly advance research in both.  This work also provides the platform for striking new research avenues that will bring to bear the tools and techniques of modern algebraic K-theory research on a wide range of geometric questions.  This project additionally includes a number of efforts to support students and new researchers in the field, expanding and broadening access to these innovative ideas.<br/><br/><br/>This broad new program of research develops the foundations of combinatorial, or ""cut-and-paste,"" algebraic K-theory, applies these new tools to resolve outstanding geometric questions, and expands the scope of combinatorial K-theory to new applications.  It brings modern techniques in algebraic K-theory to the emerging K-theoretic approach to cut-and-paste invariants, and applies this approach to a variety of problems in algebraic topology, differential topology, and algebraic geometry. Algebraic K-theory has seen a stunning revolution in the last thirty years due to the invention of trace methods, but these tools have not yet been developed for combinatorial K-theory, a deficiency that this project hopes to remedy. This requires developing the foundations of this new theory and exploiting connections to equivariant homotopy theory.  New computational and analytic tools for combinatorial K-theory will lead to progress on a wide variety of geometric problems, including applications to manifolds and invertible TQFTs, varieties and motivic measures, and fixed point theory.  Many questions in these fields have natural interpretations in terms of cut-and-paste invariants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, the grant also provides funds for the 51st and 52nd editions of the conference which are planned for March or April of 2026 and 2027.   The ANYSRGMC is the longest running graduate mathematics conference in the country and is organized primarily by graduate students.  The conference presents an opportunity for graduate students in New York State and surrounding regions to come together, share current research, and interact with other graduate students in a similar phase of their academic career. Opportunities to speak at conferences are an essential part of training future mathematicians. Unlike other graduate student mathematics conferences in the region, at the ANYSRGMC graduate students in all areas of mathematics have an opportunity to present their research. In many cases this is the first time a graduate student will speak at a conference, giving them a valuable opportunity to learn how to structure and deliver a talk. In addition, given the broad range of topics covered, graduate students are exposed to areas of mathematics that they are less familiar with, potentially broadening their research horizons. NSF funding increases access to this conference, giving graduate students with fewer financial resources an opportunity to travel to the conference.<br/><br/>The majority of the ANYSRGMC consists of 30-minute graduate student talks given in parallel sessions. There are also two invited guest speakers who give keynote addresses. The two speakers are typically prominent mathematicians in two distinct areas of mathematics who can speak to the diverse interests of the graduate student participants. In addition to hearing interesting mathematics, students can meet and learn from successful mathematicians outside of their home universities. Breaks between the talks give graduate students a chance to interact with each other, potentially leading to new collaborations.

The purpose of this international conference series is to expose early-career researchers to cutting-edge research, provide them with opportunities to share their work, and to facilitate new collaborations. The conference includes mini-courses by established experts, plenary talks by early-career researchers, lighting talks and a poster session for participants, and group discussions. The conference will give an opportunity for early-career geometric group theorists to publicize their research and strengthen their position in the field. The activities will also foster community and enable networking and interactions at all levels. Geometric group theory is a fairly young and very active field, and the selection of mini-course lectures and speakers at this conference will reflect a variety of subtopics within geometric group theory as well as a diversity of identity, background, and geographical location. <br/><br/>There will be four mini-courses on the topics of free and free-by-cyclic groups by Radhika Gupta, Helly graphs and non-positive curvature by Thomas Haettel, L2-invariants of groups by Clara Loh, and finiteness properties of groups by Brita Nucinkis. These lectures will present a panoramic overview of some of the important developments in geometric group theory. The plenary presentations will aim to focus on other recent research and directions to broaden the scope of the workshop, and to encourage the participants to explore the boundaries of the subject.

Topology is an area of mathematics that emerged from analysis and geometry as its own discipline in the late 19th century. It has since become a foundational discipline of mathematics, underlying many other areas of mathematics as well as the application of mathematics to the sciences, including logic, computer science, data science, life sciences, game theory, and category theory. As the thirty-ninth event in its series, SUMTOPO 2025 will be an important international event, held in the EPSCoR state of Alabama, that reflects the ever-expanding world of topology and its applications, with sessions dedicated to low-dimensional topology, dynamics and continuum theory, topological graph theory, set-theoretic topology, and interactions with computing. Participants will comprise a diverse group of established researchers, junior researchers, and graduate students, with special emphasis on recruiting speakers and participants from populations underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>SUMPTOPO 2025's session on Low-Dimensional Topology will feature talks related to knot theory and low-dimensional topology, which have seen recent invigoration through the interaction of different techniques from algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory, where breakthroughs have often resulted from exchanging tools between fields to resolve outstanding problems. A session on Topological Dynamics and Continuum Theory will feature the study of continua (a topological space that is connected, compact and Hausdorff, and often metric as well) and the continuous mappings between them, as well as dynamical systems, including the study of iterates of a continuous map from a topological space to itself. In recent years there has been increasing interaction between mathematicians working in continuum theory and dynamical systems; in particular, continua arise naturally in the study of the topology and dynamics of one-dimensional and planar systems. In Topological Graph Theory, participants will explore how graphs can be embedded in the 3-dimensional space and on surfaces. This area features several important topics, including the Hadwiger Conjecture, the Colin de Verdière mu invariant, outerplanarity, planarity, and linkless embeddability. The Set-Theoretic Topology session will focus on the study of techniques from set theory that are used to investigate topics in general topology. Such topics include topological games, homogeneity, hyperspaces, topological algebra, compactifications, and much more. Problems about topological topics or properties often require extra axioms of set theory to answer; advances in set theory, conversely, have applications in general topology. Finally, a special session on Topology and Computing will be featured at SUMTOPO 2025 to showcase and disseminate the growing applications of computing for topology, as well as applications of topology on computing, broadly construed. Any research related to both topology and computing will be welcome, including but not limited to, topological data analysis, formalization of topology, applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning on topology, and more.

Introductory workshop for Equivariant Homotopy Theory in Context, January 13-17, 2025<br/>2. Operads and calculus, April 7-11, 2025<br/>3.

Beyond the telescope conjecture, June 16-20, 2025<br/>Priority for funding will be given to those who do not have funds from other sources . The direct impact of NSF funding will be the training and career development of up to 30 researchers, by means of the opportunity to participate in a major program in Europe and at the Newton Institute, in particular, which is a major international nexus in mathematics. A secondary impact is to further develop collaboration between emerging research groups in algebraic topology and derived algebraic geometry in the US and Europe, in particular the United Kingdom. Holding this program as well as the workshops at the Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences makes particular sense, because this is an international field, with leaders in many countries.<br/><br/>The last decade has seen an explosion of exciting results in homotopy theory and related areas of algebraic geometry, algebra, and the algebraic topology of manifolds. Crucial here are new equivariant techniques, the study of symmetries and group actions in algebraic topology.  Historically, advances in differential topology depended on the solution of basic homotopy theoretic questions and, in the same way, the advent of equivariant homotopy theory was guided by the study of manifolds with group actions. It quickly became much more than that and the interplay between equivariant homotopy theory and its applications in algebraic K-theory, chromatic homotopy theory, functor calculus, and other fields drove a self-reinforcing narrative that is only expanding now. This semester-long program and workshops are building on this momentum and creating an environment for further exchange of ideas.
