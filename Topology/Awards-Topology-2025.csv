The workshop will bring together 35 early-career mathematicians to facilitate collaborative research and training. The workshop will provide an unparalleled opportunity for young researchers who use the tools of homotopy theory to develop long-lasting and meaningful international collaborations. The award will allow US-based researchers to be involved in this unique opportunity.  The organizers have secured funding for the conference through the ICMS covering most conference costs and this National Science Foundation grant will specifically fund travel to the conference for US-based mathematicians. Participation of US-based mathematicians will be beneficial to the progress of not only homotopy theory research in the US, but also to mathematical progress in many adjacent disciplines.  <br/><br/>Homotopical techniques originated in algebraic topology and homological algebra, but in recent years more broad applications of homotopy theory abound. For example, homotopical tools and ideas play a major work in the influential work of Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze on  integral p-adic Hodge theory; work of Scholze?Clausen on condensed mathematics; work of Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel on the Kervaire invariant one problem; and a resolution of a conjecture of Grothendieck by Carlson?Haine?Wolf. These examples highlight the timeliness and importance of promoting research collaborations amongst young homotopy theorists. With this in mind, the conference will be organized to provide a research collaboration launching pad for participants. The conference will feature thirteen talks by participants, providing an opportunity for participants to share and discuss their work to their peers. Amongst the speakers are the four invited early-career speakers: Robert Burklund (Copenhagen), Peter Haine (Berkeley), Alice Hedenlund (Uppsala), and Lucy Yang (Columbia). <br/><br/>The conference will also include two mini-courses by Clark Barwick and Piotr Pstr?gowski. The mini-course topics will bring participants to the forefront of these active research areas, creating a pathway to engage new scholars. There will be two evening lightning sessions, where participants can give ten- to fifteen-minute talks showcasing their research, and there will be a poster session on Monday. The conference schedule will also allow ample time for informal discussion.

The investigator will study a knot?s properties defined by its quantum invariants, constructed by summing over weighted ?states? of the knot. The project aims to recover certain quantum invariants of a knot by assigning classical objects to each weight and state. This will, in a way, make precise the idea of quantum mechanical theories and classical theories predicting the same physical phenomena at large scale. In the long-term, the investigator will apply the results toward the goal of developing new theories governing the behavior of knots. For the broader impacts of the project, the investigator will recruit talented undergraduate students at Texas State University to work on summer research that directly contributes to the research program and train them to disseminate their work to the local community. The summer program will culminate in an annual quantum topology conference at Texas State University to support network development for early career mathematicians, that broadly includes graduate students and postdocs working in quantum topology in the United States.<br/><br/>The project will proceed along three main lines of inquiry, where the first component investigates the simplification of a presentation of the Khovanov homology of torus links with the aim of giving a general decomposition of the colored Jones polynomial, the decategorification of colored Khovanov homology. With her collaborators the investigator will apply the formula for the decomposition to study the volume conjecture of a subfamily of highly-twisted alternating links. The second component will generalize Garoufalidis? Jones slope conjecture to include surfaces in 4-dimensions and study the number-theoretical implications via Zeilberger?s machinery.

This project will investigate two forms of symmetry in mathematics: reflectional symmetry (e.g., flipping a circle across a diameter) and rotational symmetry (e.g., rotating a circle around its center). The PI will use modern techniques from algebraic topology to classify the rotational symmetries of certain high-dimensional geometric objects and understand their behavior under reflectional symmetries. In another direction, the PI will study how certain algebraic and geometric objects with reflectional symmetry appear in different areas of mathematics. The PI will also develop and study the effects of community-engaged pedagogy in undergraduate math courses, with an emphasis on K-12 education and outreach, continue co-organizing the Electronic Computational Homotopy Theory Online Research Community, and organize two regional workshops and a regional conference in the Mid-Atlantic. <br/><br/>Specific research projects include the study of the stable homotopy groups of spheres using topological modular forms and applications of these results to problems in geometric topology and Riemannian geometry; namely, the classification of exotic spheres, the detection of their rotational symmetries, and the study of lower curvature bounds on their Ricci curvature. In another direction, the PI will continue developing the theory of homological stability for sequences of topological spaces equipped with group actions, with the aim of developing a general framework for passing results from the non-equivariant to the equivariant setting.

This project focuses on 2-dimensional spaces called surfaces, which are fundamental in many areas of mathematics.  Surfaces can be flat, like a piece of paper, or curved, like the outside of a ball, a donut, or a saddle, and the various shapes they take often strongly constrain the shapes of the higher dimensional spaces in which they live.  The educational portion of this project involves a variety of activities aimed at recruiting and supporting marginalized students into mathematics.  The first part continues a series of workshops featuring mini-courses by early career speakers from underrepresented groups on their cutting-edge research aimed at graduate students. The second part establishes a series of undergraduate research and recruitment events connecting undergraduate mathematics researchers in Southern California with graduate recruiters from programs in the region.  The third part is a Topical Pedagogy Seminar which will provide graduate students and postdocs training in incorporating topical material into foundational mathematics courses.<br/><br/>A remarkable and ubiquitous example of this mathematical phenomenon is a surface bundle, which just like a donut, can be sliced so that the cross-sections are surfaces. Unlike a donut, however, as one moves through most surface bundles, the surface cross-sections can twist and deform in complicated ways.  This twisting?which essentially determines the bundle?is encoded in the mapping class group, which, among other things, is the collection of all symmetries of the space of shapes that a surface can take, also known as Teichmüller space.  The first part of the research program aims to develop a powerful fleet of combinatorial techniques for studying the geometry of mapping class groups and Teichmüller spaces, as well as their structure at infinity.  The second part focuses on the geometry of surface bundles arising naturally from dynamics.<br/><br/>In more detail, this project will investigate the coarse geometry of the mapping class group, Teichmüller space, and surface bundles using the tools of geometric group theory.  The first part aims to address a family of results showing that mapping class groups can be coherently locally modeled by CAT(0) cube complexes, allowing for the construction of new metrics with a variety of applications, including about their geometry and topology at infinity.  The second part studies the geometry of surface bundles of Veech surfaces and their combinations, as well as developing a Sullivan-like notion of structural stability for the subgroups associated to a variety of surface bundles with nice curvature properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central objects of study in this project are Legendrian links, which may be visualized as certain loops of string in three-dimensional space tied together at their ends. Legendrian links play a key role in the modern study of symplectic geometry in three and four dimensions. The project seeks to develop and explore new algebraic structures associated to Legendrian links, by combining an established framework, developed over the past few decades, with recent ideas from other areas of mathematics such as combinatorics and algebraic geometry. This research will create new algebraic structures that can be applied to answer some long-unsolved questions in symplectic geometry. The Principal Investigator will also train future mathematicians through his work organizing undergraduate summer research programs at Duke University and other extracurricular activities for students.<br/><br/>The project is built around an algebraic invariant of Legendrian links called Legendrian contact homology, which was originally developed roughly three decades ago and has emerged as one of the premier tools in modern symplectic topology. The Principal Investigator will develop a number of interrelated enhancements of Legendrian contact homology. Some are combinatorial in nature, including a quantization of Legendrian contact homology that has a conjectural relationship to mirror symmetry; others are more geometric, including a topological stable homotopy type that lifts Legendrian contact homology into the realm of Floer homotopy theory. These enhancements, which can be viewed as strengthened versions of existing invariants, are motivated by recently-discovered connections between symplectic geometry and other mathematical areas such as cluster theory in combinatorics. This project will apply the enhanced invariants to study open questions in symplectic topology, notably the question of classifying certain surfaces in four dimensions, called Lagrangian fillings, with prescribed boundary conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to develop a framework that makes it possible to take Morse's insight as a starting point for formulating a new framework in which to study algebraic structures. The broader impacts of this proposal include the training of future leaders of the field, as well as developing resources for understanding the relevance of topological notions beyond pure mathematics.<br/><br/>The key technical notion in the proposal is that of a flow category. The PI plans to formulate algebraic structures geometrically at the level of the underlying flow categories in order to extend our ability to develop applications.

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) aims to develop new techniques based on topology and other disciplines in pure mathematics to understand complex data. Research questions are strongly motivated by applications from neuroscience, image recognition, biology, material science, geography, and beyond. The underlying idea is that topology helps recognize patterns within data and, therefore, turn data into compressed, useful knowledge. Besides advancing the progress of science by helping to prepare the next generation of applied topologists, this school is also designed to expand the reach of applied topology.<br/><br/>The topic of the school is the study of general techniques to achieve stability of invariants in TDA that can be applied to different objects, from persistence modules to Reeb graphs. In particular, the focus is on questions about the stability of various TDA tools: 1) Which metrics can be introduced to ensure the stability of traditional topological invariants? 2) Which invariants can be developed to ensure stability with respect to traditional metrics? Through questions like these, TDA enriches the traditional fields of algebraic topology and geometry while at the same time striving for theoretical guarantees for practitioners in data analysis. There will be three lecturers alternating in the mornings, an introductory poster section, problem sessions in the afternoons, and a few short research talks from the participants. Ultimately, the school?s goal is to encourage students to develop their own application-motivated results in TDA by considering well-established principled strategies.

This event is the ninth in a series of conferences, held every eight years since 1961 at the University of Georgia, and will focus on recent developments in geometric topology. Topological spaces are everywhere in mathematics and in fact everywhere in real life. From ordinary 3-dimensional space and the 4-dimensional space-time of relativity to spaces of configurations of complex organic molecules and sets of solutions to systems of many equations, the basic problems of topology are ubiquitous.  Geometric topology, in particular, focuses on problems in which a strong visual component of reasoning and problem solving comes into play and is generally the most accessible part of topology for a broad audience.  At the same time it is the realm of topology in which some of the hardest outstanding problems remain unsolved. Recent developments to be highlighted at this conference include, for example, the remarkable results of Watanabe, which show that the set of all symmetries of the simplest 4-dimensional object, the 4-dimensional ball, is drastically more complicated than had been suspected eight years ago.<br/><br/>This conference focuses on the most significant advancements in geometric topology and related geometry since the last Georgia International Topology Conference in 2017.  The topics will highlight exciting new developments including advances in knot theory, four-manifolds, topology of diffeomorphism and embedding spaces, homotopy theory, contact and symplectic topology and geometry, equivariant Floer homology, Floer homotopy theory, geometric group theory, hyperbolic manifolds and dynamical systems. The conference has historically generated tremendous interest among graduate students and recent PhD?s. The speakers at various career stages and the range of topics to be presented will offer students and new PhD?s a valuable taste of what the mathematical research community has to offer.

The workshop aims to create a dynamic platform where both established and emerging researchers, specializing in infinite-type surfaces and related fields, can come together. This event's goal is twofold: first, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of recent breakthroughs in the field, and second, to explore various avenues for future research and encourage future collaboration. Furthermore, enabling US-based scientists to attend this international meeting has two additional benefits: (1) Allowing for future long term collaborations with researchers outside of the US, and (2) Providing a means to disseminate research and results to the global mathematical community. <br/><br/>Infinite-type surfaces serve as a common thread connecting various areas of mathematics. An infinite-type surface is a two dimensional manifold with ""infinitely much topology,'' e.g. the sphere with a Cantor set of points removed or a surface of infinite genus. They appear in the study of polygonal billiards, topological dynamics, as generic leaves of foliations on compact spaces, in the study of Thompson groups, or in 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle. More recently, there has been a significant surge in the study of mapping class groups associated with infinite-type surfaces, also known as big mapping class groups. These are topological groups exhibiting rich phenomenology. As automorphism groups of countable structures, often endowed with well-defined large-scale geometry, they also inhabit the intersection of geometric group theory, model theory, and descriptive set theory. While infinite-type surfaces possess this interdisciplinary nature, historically, only two workshops (in 2013 and 2019) have brought together experts from diverse fields sharing this common theme. Thus, the primary scientific objective of this workshop is to convene a diverse group of mathematicians to facilitate cross-pollination among the different areas converging on infinite-type surfaces.

In recent years, there have been several major advances in the field of Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Cycles. Arithmetic Geometry is the study of spaces from the point of view of number theory and is largely concerned with the solutions of polynomial equations, especially over the integers. Algebraic K-Theory and Algebraic Cycles are certain special techniques that can understand the geometric nature of a problem, one that is again defined in terms of polynomial equations. In recent years there have been a number of important developments in this area and the purpose of the week-long workshop and conference is to bring together established experts in these areas along with early-career researchers with the goal of stimulating further progress.<br/><br/>In more detail, in recent years there have been major developments in Arithmetic Geometry, Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic Cycles, leading up to the solution of the Milnor, Bloch-Kato and Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures, as well as the conjectures of Thomason and Morel concerned with equivariant phenomena for actions of linear algebraic groups. The powerful techniques introduced for the solution of the above conjectures have stimulated work on several outstanding remaining problems in the area, which are often arithmetic in nature, but use sophisticated tools from Algebraic K-theory and Algebraic cycles. The goal of the program is to focus on several of the outstanding problems in the area, surveying the progress made and planning strategies for further advancement.

Scissors congruence originated in Hilbert's 3rd Problem, which asks when two polyhedra in three-dimensional space are ""scissors congruent,"" meaning one can be obtained from the other by cutting it into smaller polyhedra and reassembling in a different way.  This question, together with its solution by Dehn, initiated an extensive program of research. Over the past 120 years these ideas have grown and now connect to almost every branch of geometry. Ground-breaking recent work provides a fundamental link between this program and algebraic K-theory, which is itself a deep and rapidly developing area of research.  Algebraic K-theory intertwines three major fields of mathematics: topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory. Developing the connection between scissors congruence and algebraic K-theory will significantly advance research in both.  This work also provides the platform for striking new research avenues that will bring to bear the tools and techniques of modern algebraic K-theory research on a wide range of geometric questions.  This project additionally includes a number of efforts to support students and new researchers in the field, expanding and broadening access to these innovative ideas.<br/><br/><br/>This broad new program of research develops the foundations of combinatorial, or ""cut-and-paste,"" algebraic K-theory, applies these new tools to resolve outstanding geometric questions, and expands the scope of combinatorial K-theory to new applications.  It brings modern techniques in algebraic K-theory to the emerging K-theoretic approach to cut-and-paste invariants, and applies this approach to a variety of problems in algebraic topology, differential topology, and algebraic geometry. Algebraic K-theory has seen a stunning revolution in the last thirty years due to the invention of trace methods, but these tools have not yet been developed for combinatorial K-theory, a deficiency that this project hopes to remedy. This requires developing the foundations of this new theory and exploiting connections to equivariant homotopy theory.  New computational and analytic tools for combinatorial K-theory will lead to progress on a wide variety of geometric problems, including applications to manifolds and invertible TQFTs, varieties and motivic measures, and fixed point theory.  Many questions in these fields have natural interpretations in terms of cut-and-paste invariants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, the grant also provides funds for the 51st and 52nd editions of the conference which are planned for March or April of 2026 and 2027.   The ANYSRGMC is the longest running graduate mathematics conference in the country and is organized primarily by graduate students.  The conference presents an opportunity for graduate students in New York State and surrounding regions to come together, share current research, and interact with other graduate students in a similar phase of their academic career. Opportunities to speak at conferences are an essential part of training future mathematicians. Unlike other graduate student mathematics conferences in the region, at the ANYSRGMC graduate students in all areas of mathematics have an opportunity to present their research. In many cases this is the first time a graduate student will speak at a conference, giving them a valuable opportunity to learn how to structure and deliver a talk. In addition, given the broad range of topics covered, graduate students are exposed to areas of mathematics that they are less familiar with, potentially broadening their research horizons. NSF funding increases access to this conference, giving graduate students with fewer financial resources an opportunity to travel to the conference.<br/><br/>The majority of the ANYSRGMC consists of 30-minute graduate student talks given in parallel sessions. There are also two invited guest speakers who give keynote addresses. The two speakers are typically prominent mathematicians in two distinct areas of mathematics who can speak to the diverse interests of the graduate student participants. In addition to hearing interesting mathematics, students can meet and learn from successful mathematicians outside of their home universities. Breaks between the talks give graduate students a chance to interact with each other, potentially leading to new collaborations.

Topology is an area of mathematics that emerged from analysis and geometry as its own discipline in the late 19th century. It has since become a foundational discipline of mathematics, underlying many other areas of mathematics as well as the application of mathematics to the sciences, including logic, computer science, data science, life sciences, game theory, and category theory. As the thirty-ninth event in its series, SUMTOPO 2025 will be an important international event, held in the EPSCoR state of Alabama, that reflects the ever-expanding world of topology and its applications, with sessions dedicated to low-dimensional topology, dynamics and continuum theory, topological graph theory, set-theoretic topology, and interactions with computing. Participants will comprise a diverse group of established researchers, junior researchers, and graduate students, with special emphasis on recruiting speakers and participants from populations underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>SUMPTOPO 2025's session on Low-Dimensional Topology will feature talks related to knot theory and low-dimensional topology, which have seen recent invigoration through the interaction of different techniques from algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory, where breakthroughs have often resulted from exchanging tools between fields to resolve outstanding problems. A session on Topological Dynamics and Continuum Theory will feature the study of continua (a topological space that is connected, compact and Hausdorff, and often metric as well) and the continuous mappings between them, as well as dynamical systems, including the study of iterates of a continuous map from a topological space to itself. In recent years there has been increasing interaction between mathematicians working in continuum theory and dynamical systems; in particular, continua arise naturally in the study of the topology and dynamics of one-dimensional and planar systems. In Topological Graph Theory, participants will explore how graphs can be embedded in the 3-dimensional space and on surfaces. This area features several important topics, including the Hadwiger Conjecture, the Colin de Verdière mu invariant, outerplanarity, planarity, and linkless embeddability. The Set-Theoretic Topology session will focus on the study of techniques from set theory that are used to investigate topics in general topology. Such topics include topological games, homogeneity, hyperspaces, topological algebra, compactifications, and much more. Problems about topological topics or properties often require extra axioms of set theory to answer; advances in set theory, conversely, have applications in general topology. Finally, a special session on Topology and Computing will be featured at SUMTOPO 2025 to showcase and disseminate the growing applications of computing for topology, as well as applications of topology on computing, broadly construed. Any research related to both topology and computing will be welcome, including but not limited to, topological data analysis, formalization of topology, applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning on topology, and more.

This meeting is planned as the fourth installment of the Upstate New York Topology Seminar (UNYTS) series, which was started in Fall 2017. The goal of the meeting is to continue to build connections, both within the New York state region and with nearby regions, by gathering the numerous topologists, including the many geometric and algebraic topologists and geometric group theorists in the area, for a weekend of talks. NSF funding will provide partial lodging and travel support, to encourage participation by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows working in the area.<br/><br/>The conference will cover various flavors of topology, including algebraic topology, geometric topology, and geometric group theory, promoting the exchange of ideas between these areas. Four invited speakers will deliver the main lectures, and several parallel sessions of shorter talks will give early-career participants the opportunity to share their research in focused groups. The conference will also facilitate in-person interactions between participants at different career stages. To facilitate this exchange, the organizers will run a thematic lunch activity, during which participants will be able to talk about a chosen aspect of the mathematical profession.<br/><br/>More information can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/unytsbinghamton/home.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Introductory workshop for Equivariant Homotopy Theory in Context, January 13-17, 2025<br/>2. Operads and calculus, April 7-11, 2025<br/>3. New horizons for equivariance in homotopy theory, May 12-16, 2025<br/>4. Beyond the telescope conjecture, June 16-20, 2025<br/>Priority for funding will be given to those who do not have funds from other sources . The direct impact of NSF funding will be the training and career development of up to 30 researchers, by means of the opportunity to participate in a major program in Europe and at the Newton Institute, in particular, which is a major international nexus in mathematics. A secondary impact is to further develop collaboration between emerging research groups in algebraic topology and derived algebraic geometry in the US and Europe, in particular the United Kingdom. Holding this program as well as the workshops at the Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences makes particular sense, because this is an international field, with leaders in many countries.<br/><br/>The last decade has seen an explosion of exciting results in homotopy theory and related areas of algebraic geometry, algebra, and the algebraic topology of manifolds. Crucial here are new equivariant techniques, the study of symmetries and group actions in algebraic topology.  Historically, advances in differential topology depended on the solution of basic homotopy theoretic questions and, in the same way, the advent of equivariant homotopy theory was guided by the study of manifolds with group actions. It quickly became much more than that and the interplay between equivariant homotopy theory and its applications in algebraic K-theory, chromatic homotopy theory, functor calculus, and other fields drove a self-reinforcing narrative that is only expanding now. This semester-long program and workshops are building on this momentum and creating an environment for further exchange of ideas.
