The subgroup of algebraic cycles                     within the homology figures prominently in this work, and                       surprisingly, this year, they have shown that certain                           obstructions vanish if one allows singular varieties.  A second                 direction for the investigator's research involves gauge theory                 and its role in the study of 4-manifolds.  A final direction                    concerns the question of Nash:  do all closed smooth manifolds                  have rational structure?"

These cohomological invariants include cyclic                    homology, equivariant cohomology, equivariant K-theory, and the                 delocalized theory of P. Baum, R.

The central example will be the free loop space of               a smooth manifold, on which the group D of orientation-preserving               diffeomorphisms of the circle acts by reparametrizing loops.  The               investigator will develop differential-geometric tools for loop                 spaces, in relation with cyclic homology and elliptic cohomology.

Several basic problems in geometry, algebra and                    differential topology hinge on a better understanding of this                   connection.  These include the isomorphism conjecture of P. Baum                and A. Connes and those that it implies (e.g., the Novikov and                  Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjectures), the Bass conjecture on the                image of the Hattori-Stallings trace map for group rings, and the               Milnor-Friedlander conjecture concerning the K-theory of a Banach               algebra with coefficients in a finite abelian group.  The free                  loop space also plays an important role in understanding the                    homotopy-type of the space of stable pseudo-isotopies of a                      manifold, and variants seem to be closely related to the integral               relative K-theory of nilpotent ideals.  The planned work builds                 on progress in these areas; in particular, the investigator's                   solution of the KABI and Karoubi conjectures (with Weibel), new                 information on the integral relative K-theory of spaces, and a                  formulation of the operator algebra K-theory of spaces (with P.

The essence of this project is to                establish relations among these K-theories and between them and                 some other algebraic theories for dealing with topology."

E.                      Stong (University of Virginia) and other colleagues.  A new                     family of periodic cohomology theories was shown to exist in                    1986, in joint work with Stong and D. C. Ravenel; their                         coefficient rings are rings of modular functions of level 2.                    The main problem, now widely recognized, is to determine the                    intrinsic geometric nature of these cohomology theories.                        Recently, F. Hirzebruch has defined level N elliptic genera (N                  at least 2), which for N = 2 become the elliptic genera leading                 to elliptic cohomology; it is intended to study these genera in                 detail.

He proposes to                   explore the topological applications of these symmetries, and                   to study refined rigidity properties implied by them.  He                       approaches these problems via representation theory of affine                   Lie algebras.                                                                        Both investigators are bringing highly sophisticated                       algebraic theories to bear upon problems in the geometry of                     manifolds.  Applications include the theory of strings, which                   has been offered as a promising approach to quantum physics of                  systems of interacting particles."

W. Thurston's work indicates that the most interesting                 3-manifolds are hyperbolic, i.e. ones that admit a Riemannian                   metric of constant negative curvature.  By letting a sequence                   of such structures degenerate, a tree is obtained.  The first                   problem is to understand the space of actions of a group on                     trees.  The motivating question here is whether or not the                      space of simplicial actions is dense in the space of all                        actions.                                                                             The second problem is to bound the complexity of                           3-orbifolds in terms of their fundamental groups.  A main                       question here is whether there is a bound (in terms of the                      number of generators needed for the group) for the number of                    conjugacy classes of maximal finite subgroups.                                       There is a generalization, due to M. Gromov, to arbitrary                  groups of the notion of hyperbolicity of the fundamental group                  of a closed manifold.  The final problem is to show that the                    fundamental group of a mapping cylinder of an irreducible                       automorphism of a free group is hyperbolic in this sense.                            All the problems have in common that they heavily mix                      topology and some other branch of mathematics, geometry or                      algebra, or both.  This is a perennial phenomenom in                            mathematics, but it waxes and wanes.  At the moment projects                    which form bridges between neighboring fields are                               proliferating.  The trend to blur boundaries, as in this                        project, is particularly pronounced."

Finally with J. Milgram, J.                       Maginnis and J. Martino, he plans to study the cohomology of                    sporadic groups.                                                                     These are all topics in the mainstream of current                          topological research.  The hallmark of R. Lee's approach is to                  choose very concrete problems and bring to bear techniques from                 an impressively large and high-powered arsenal.  Some problems                  yield to algebraic geometry, some to complex analysis, some to                  group theory , and so forth.  The result is another clear                       demonstration of the unity of mathematics."

In                         particular, the project concentrates on the investigation of                    state models for knot polynomials.  State models were first                     introduced by the principal investigator for the                                Alexander-Conway polynomial, and for the Jones polynomial.  The                 project investigates these models and related models                            (Yang-Baxter models) involving statistical mechanics and                        quantum groups, and their relations with more general state                     models for the skein polynomial (Homfly and Kauffman) that are                  combinatorial in nature.

Simple                    though the idea is, important applications exist to the coiling                 and possible knotting of the genetic material DNA, as well as                   to problems in statistical mechanics."

The particular aspects which it                    involves can be described as follows:  (1) Incorporate the                      study of certain discrete groups, such as arithmetic groups and                 mapping class groups, to an existing program based on applying                  methods from modular representation theory to group actions.                    (2) Determine general properties of the cohomology of finite                    groups, and how, using equivariant cohomology, this influences                  the role they play as transformation groups.  (3) Obtain                        necessary and sufficeint conditions for a finite group to act                   freely on a product of spheres, and analyze the restrictions                    this imposes on the homology representations when they are of                   the same dimension.  This work is aimed at approaching a global                 conjecture on the free rank of symmetry of a finite complex.                    (4) Use theory of infinite loop spaces and invariant theory to                  obtain precise cohomological information on the symmetric                       groups, with several applications in mind.  They include                        describing the cohomology of certain double covers of the                       symmetric groups which serve as finite models for a space which                 detects important characteristic classes.  Other applications                   to stable homotopy and group cohomology are also planned.  The                  invariant theory used is seen as an interesting and important                   algebraic problem in its own right, encoding most of the                        cohomological structure of the symmetric groups.

Algebraic tools for                 making calculations about symmetry will be perfected, and these                 tools will then be applied to answer natural questions."

Stasheff's own research is concerned with                         application of those techniques he had earlier developed in                     relation to his study of classifying spaces and rational                        homotopy theory.  Currently he is particularly concerned with                   two classes of problems:  I) the homological aspects of                         reduction of constrained Hamiltonian systems, both classical                    and quantum, as embodied in the BRST formalism and the                          Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky complex and its generalizations, and                 II) homotopy associative differential graded algebras as they                   occur in string field theories and spin n-algebras.                                  Henneaux and Stasheff have generalized the BFV complex to                  handle reducible constraints of first class and now intend to                   apply the construct to physically interesting examples.                              Analogs of associating homotopies have appeared in string                  field theory and have led Stasheff to define a homotopy                         associative convolution algebra and tensor calculus.  With the                  Italian physicist, Cotta-Ramusino, he plans to investigate the                  physical significance of this homotopy and possible higher                      order structures as in his previous work.  Such higher order                    terms are definitely present in spin-n algebras for n bigger                    than 2.  He intends to investigate these higher order                           structures by translating them into the BRST formulism.                              Many of the techniques used in these applications come                     from Homological Perturbation Theory.  This project includes                    further development of that machinery at the theoretical level                  in addition to the applications in theoretical physics."

The methods to be employed                       include techniques from topology, set theory and mathematical                   logic.  The main problem asks:  Is every product of                             sequentially compact spaces countably compact?  It is one of                    the few remaining, long-standing, unsolved problems concerning                  ultrafilters on the natural numbers.  This simple-sounding                      problem remains unsolved after more than 20 years of work.  A                   related problem, just as old, asks:  Is the product of two                      countably compact topological groups always countably compact?

Now, in some cases (for instance, when K                  is a triangle), we can define a ""non-spherical"" condition (if K                 is a triangle, this is simply the condition that the sum of the                 three group-theoretic angles is at most pi); and we can then                    prove that there is a big group H containing all the label                      groups of the 2-complex, and that this group has a K(H,1)                       complex which is constructed in a natural way.  This is proved                  by a topological construction, but there are more rigidly                       geometrical things underlying the situation, which lead to a                    more detailed understanding of the group H.  This work is very                  recent.  The project is to continue in this vein, to generalize                 to more complicated 2-complexes, to try to classify groups                      acting on ""piecewise-Euclidean 2-complexes of non-positive                      curvature,"" to generalize to higher-dimensional complexes in                    the spirit of Gromov's hyperbolic groups, to relate this to                     classical problems in combinatorical group theory, and to see                   where this theory leads.                                                             Groups are algebraic systems with a multiplication which                   satisfies a few natural rules.  (These rules are abstracted                     from groups of symmetries.)  The concept is ubiquitous in                       mathematics and theoretical physics, and any substantial                        advances in group theory are likely to be followed by a large                   audience and to have wide repercussions."
