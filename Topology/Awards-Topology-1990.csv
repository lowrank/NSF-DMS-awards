In                the 1960's Daniel Quillen showed how to define homology and                     cohomology in many categories.  These included simplicial sets,                 where he obtained the ordinary cohomology of topological spaces,                but the categories of simplicial algebras over a field and                      simplicial unstable algebras over the mod-p Steenrod algebra both               support an idea of cohomology that is relevant in homotopy                      theory.  Cohomology of simplicial unstable algebras, for example,               is the correct context for studying the E2 term of the Bousfield-               Kan spectral sequence, an unstable Adams-type spectral sequence                 which has gained prominence due to the work of Haynes Miller,                   Jean Lannes and others.                                                              Under prior NSF grants, the principal investigator has made                a successful study of the Quillen-type cohomology in various                    categories of algebras.  The purpose of this project is to take                 these results and to extend and apply them.  In particular, he                  should now be able to make an in-depth study of Barratt's                       desuspension spectral sequence and his ""Lie ring analyzer"" - both               a source of conjecture and speculation for 30 years.  Other                     projects include combining the Quillen-type cohomology techniques               with the methods of Chris Stover to approach the homotopy groups                of a wedge of two spaces, the study of a spectral sequence for                  computing the homotopy groups of a space of sections, and an                    exploration of the homology of function complexes using tools of                Jean Lannes and A.K. Bousfield."

Landweber (Rutgers University).  A                  new family of periodic cohomology theories has been shown to                    exist, whose coefficient rings are rings of modular functions for               the well-known theta group.  The main problem is to determine the               intrinsic geometric nature of these cohomology theories; this                   appears to be very difficult, and at present a number of leads                  that appear promising are being explored.  A prominent role in                  this study is played by the formal groups of Jacobi quartics and                the Legendre polynomials which enter as coefficients of the                     invariant differential.  Theoretical physics will probably be the               first area outside the mathematical sciences to benefit from the                study of these rich structures."

A recent construction                 due to Gabai shows that a 3-manifold supports many interesting                  dynamical systems, namely pseudo-Anosov flows.                                       The first two parts of this project aim towards showing that               dynamical systems on a 3-manifold can be used to give complete                  information about an important topological invariant, the                       Thurston norm on homology.  The main work of the first part will                be to show that Gabai's flows are well-behaved enough to                        determine completely the Thurston norm.  The second part will                   focus on explicitly constructing these flows, so as to have an                  efficient algorithm for computing the norm.  A bonus will be a                  method for efficient computation of complete homeomorphism                      invariants of 3-manifolds which fiber over the circle.                               The third and final part of this project addresses a long                  range goal, to investigate the conjecture that every 3-manifold                 which is irreducible and contains a non-separating surface has a                finite cover which fibers over the circle.  Dynamical systems are               potentially useful for this investigation, due to work of Fried.                Mosher will attempt to prove the conjecture for some simple                     examples which are ""as close as possible"" to fibering without                   actually fibering.  If successful, this may yield suggestions for               an attack on the conjecture in general."

The subject of smooth transformation                    groups has been strongly influenced by the following two central                problems:  LINEARITY PROBLEM.  Which groups act nonlinearly on                  affine space of some dimension?  (An action is linear if it is                  conjugate to an action defined by a representation of the group.)               FIXED POINT PROBLEM.  Which groups act without fixed points on                  affine space of some dimension?  The tools used to settle these                 problems and the further problems they generated have been                      important themes in the field of smooth transformation groups.                  During the last few years researchers from algebraic                            transformation groups as well as those from smooth transformation               groups have recognized the importance of these two questions in                 the algebraic category, and in that case the groups dealt with                  should be reductive (which includes as a special case the finite                groups).

Such                    topologies give rise to topologies on convex functions, with a                  function identified with its epigraph, the set of points on or                  above its graph.  In the last two years, Professor Beer                         introduced a topology compatible with Mosco convergence of                      sequences of convex sets, showing that it is stable with respect                to duality if and only if the underlying space is reflexive.                    Several characterizations of the topology were obtained, and                    continuity properties of a variety of operators and functionals                 on convex sets were studied.  In response to the unsuitability of               this Mosco topology in the nonreflexive case, and in view of some               prior promising results regarding the norm convergence of linear                functionals and their level sets, Professor Beer studied the                    topology of uniform convergence of distance functionals on                      bounded sets.  Not only is this topology stable with respect to                 duality without restriction, but it is also the right convergence               notion in terms of the stability of solutions of convex                         optimization problems.

He also hopes to become involved in                applications of set convergence in evolving research in the                     foundations of nonsmooth analysis, e.g., to certain optimization                problems."

First, there                 are notions of size and distance on the smooth part of an                       algebraic variety, inherited from its imbedding in space.  Using                this, one defines square-summable functions and, more generally,                differential forms on the smooth part of the variety.  The first                problem to be studied is to what extent the periods of these                    functions or forms are determined by the topological properties                 of the variety, in particular, by a topological invariant called                ""the intersection homology group.""

These have minimal length.  One                 investigator will use the emerging theory of calibrations to                    understand assorted integrals on area-minimizing surfaces.  The                 second investigator will study the geometry of three-dimensional                surfaces, or manifolds."

The                 first part is a continuation of Lin's work wherein he defined a                 knot invariant in terms of an intersection number of subvarieties               and related this knot invariant to a classical one.  To                         generalize this work, one can define other intersection numbers                 and he is interested in relating these intersection numbers with                classical link invariants.  In the second part, he suggests a way               of constructing a 2-variable polynomial for a knot in S3,                       generalizing the definition of the Alexander polynomial via                     Seifert forms.  This construction is intimately related to                      representation varieties.  In particular, it suggests a possible                connection between the Jones polynomial and Casson's invariant of               homology 3-spheres.  Lin's hope is that this research will shed                 some light on some important questions, such as how to generalize               the Jones polynomial from S3 to arbitrary 3-manifolds and how to                interpret the Jones polynomial in terms of the topology of the                  knot complement.                                                                     Knots in three-dimensional space are natural objects to                    study.  The polynomials Lin describes reduce the problem of                     distinguishing truly inequivalent knots from different                          presentations of the same knot to questions about polynomials,                  i.e. to fairly simple algebraic problems.  (This transition from                geometry to algebra turns out to be related to other mathematics                of no immediately apparent connection.)"

(1)                The polynomial map Q has a non-isolated singularity at the                      origin.  Let F be its Milnor fiber.  Compute the cohomology of F                for a generic arrangement.  (2)  It has been conjectured that if                A is free, then the restriction of A to a subspace in its lattice               is again free.  Investigate this conjecture for Coxeter                         arrangements.  (3)  Known results on Hessians and discriminants                 of Shephard groups will be combined with ideas of Saito to give a               case-free proof of the existence of flat basic invariants for                   Shephard groups, and to explain why the complements of their                    reflection arrangements are K(G,1)-spaces.  (4)  Let S be the                   algebra of polynomial functions on V and let J be the Jacobian                  ideal generated by the partial derivatives of Q.  If A is                       generic, then the homological dimension of S/J is equal to dimV.                Study the homological dimension of S/J for all arrangements.  (5)               Given H in A let B denote the restriction of A to H.  There is a                natural restriction of the derivations tangent to A to the                      derivations tangent to B.  This map is surjective in some cases                 and not surjective in others.  Find precise conditions for                      surjectivity.  (6)  Subspace arrangements will be studied with                  respect to the question of additivity of the Poincare polynomial                under deletion and restriction.  The use of computers, to furnish               experimental material, is implicit in the work.                                      These six problems show that in high dimensions the ways in                which a finite number of linear spaces can be imbedded in a                     linear space of one greater dimension exhibits a surprisingly                   rich structure.  Standard tools of topology are well adapted to                 elucidating this structure and will be further exploited."

The particular aspects which it                    involves can be described as follows:  (1) Incorporate the study                of certain discrete groups, such as arithmetic groups and mapping               class groups, to an existing program based on applying methods                  from modular representation theory to group actions.  (2)                       Determine general properties of the cohomology of finite groups,                and how, using equivariant cohomology, this influences the role                 they play as transformation groups.  (3) Obtain necessary and                   sufficient conditions for a finite group to act freely on a                     product of spheres, and analyze the restrictions this imposes on                the homology representations when they are of the same dimension.               This work is aimed at approaching a global conjecture on the free               rank of symmetry of a finite complex.  (4) Use theory of infinite               loop spaces and invariant theory to obtain precise cohomological                information on the symmetric groups, with several applications in               mind.  They include describing the cohomology of certain double                 covers of the symmetric groups which serve as finite models for a               space which detects important characteristic classes.  Other                    applications to stable homotopy and group cohomology are also                   planned.  The invariant theory used is seen as an interesting and               important algebraic problem in its own right, encoding most of                  the cohomological structure of the symmetric groups.                                 In other words, the various parts of this project all                      concern the symmetry of geometric objects.  Algebraic tools for                 making calculations about symmetry will be perfected, and these                 tools will then be applied to answer natural questions."

In mathematics, symmetry has many different                but related manifestations.  A finite group G of symmetries of a                space X induces symmetries on algebraic invariants of X.  In this               way, transformation groups and representation theory become                     intimately related.  In this project, the investigator will look                systematically at the interaction between the geometry of the                   symmetry (e.g., fixed points, stability subgroups, etc.) and the                algebraic invariants of such representations.  In particular,                   symmetries of Moore spaces (the Steenrod Problem posed in early                 1960's) and algebraic curves and surfaces arising in algebraic                  geometry and number theory (besides topology) provide concrete                  problems to which the following general theory will apply.  A                   significant feature of this project is its interdisciplinary                    nature, which requires tools and ideas from several branches of                 mathematics.  This provides a natural setting for interaction of                these areas, including new applications of algebraic geometry to                transformation groups and modular representation theory.  Other                 applications include (algorithmic and inductive) construction of                important classes of modular representations, number theoretic                  properties of algebraic function fields, and a deeper                           understanding of symmetries of algebraic surfaces versus 4-                     dimensional manifolds.  A long term objective is solution of the                long-standing Steenrod Problem and its application to the problem               of existence of symmetry for manifolds."

The research of this project focuses on three methods to extend the toolkit of mathematics in a way that allows elimination of certain irregular objects: - the Axiom of Determinacy, which says that there are no irregular (i.e., undetermined) games of sorts, - the Open Coloring Axiom, which says that certain irregular partitions do not exist, - assumptions that mathematics takes place in certain ""harmless forcing extensions"" of the constructible universe.

Such is the case for Vaught's conjecture, which was proved by Shelah for omega-stable theories. The next step is to consider all superstable theories, but this has proved too difficult for the methods used in the omega-stable case.
