Although this project is highly algebraic, one motivation lies             in its potential for reducing geometric information to a subject                for calculation by perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools              used for this purpose.  The nature of the geometric information                 involved is the crux of the difficulty.  While questions about                  lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to              be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known             as topological properties of geometric objects.  These are                      properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),                      knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.

These invariants were first described using ideas                  from quantum physics by the mathematical physicist E. Witten and                later established by Reshethikin and Turaev, using the                          combinatorics of representations of quantum groups.  A purely                   combinatorial approach was pioneered by Lickorish in the case of                the classical one-variable Jones polynomial, evaluated at roots                 of unity of the parameter.  This approach was recently extended                 by Blanchet-Habegger-Masbaum-Vogel to half-integer roots.                       They have also given a proof that the combinatorial theory                      satisfies the axioms for a topological quantum field theory                     first enunciated by Atiyah and Segal.  The proof of the axioms                  is purely combinatorial using only the algebra and combinatorics                of the Kauffman (skein) module of three-manifolds.  The                         investigation of the axiomatics/combinatorics of the other                      Jones-Witten invariants may possibly be achieved using more                     general skein modules.  Further, the rich supply of invariants                  should provide a basis for new approaches to old problems, such                 as link and three-manifold classification.  Finally, the                        combinatorial approach will likely lead to effective methods of                 computation.                                                                         Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose                        really interesting properties are topological.  By this we mean                 that two geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if                 one of them can be transformed to look just like the other                      without cutting or untying it, just by pushing its string about                 to rearrange the crossings.  Topologists say that they are                      two different geometric realizations of the same topological                    knot. Nevertheless, it is not a trivial matter to recognize when                one complicated geometric knot is topologically different from                  another, rather than just a different geometric realization.                    This problem can be addressed by computing certain numbers                      or polynomials which are called ""topological invariants,"" meaning               that they always have the same value for different geometric                    realizations of the same topological knot.  The problem would                   be reduced to pure algebra if there were one invariant which                    also always has different values for geometric realizations                     of different topological knots, but life is not so simple--no                   single invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the known                    invariants taken together.  It is therefore valuable to                         investigate new invariants, some of the most useful being those                 inspired in recent years by ideas from quantum physics.  In                     particular, applications of knot theory to the biology of long                  strands of DNA have drawn upon knowledge of these newer                         invariants."

They hope to prove a                          classification theorem for subgroups of polynomial growth                       automorphisms and thereby complete the proof of the Tits                        Alternative for Out(Fn).  Secondly, the investigator hopes to prove             that there are no minimal homeomorphisms of the once punctured                  plane, which would answer a question of Besicovitch and of Herman.              Finally, the investigator, in collaboration with Bruce Kitchens                 (I.B.M.), will explore the relationship between two natural                     definitions of topological entropy for homeomorphisms of non-                   compact spaces.                                                                      The topology of surfaces is a highly developed subject,                    addressing properties which remain invariant when a surface is                  stretched or twisted without tearing it, so-called rubber sheet                 geometry.  The theory of dynamical systems is another highly                    developed subject, addressing questions about transformations of a              space into itself, such simple things as rotations of spheres, but              also far more complicated transformations.  For transformations of              surfaces, the topology is intimately involved and says a great deal             about what kinds of transformations are possible.  Extracting this              information by combining the topology of surfaces with the theory               of dynamical systems is a sophisticated endeavor which forms a                  large part of this project."

Another consists of                using these same tools to study state-of-the-art questions in                   algebraic K-theory.

The                   first, joint with Avner Ash (Ohio State), deals with arithmetic                 subgroups G of SL(3,Z).  A cuspidal cohomology class for G which is             a Hecke eigenclass generates an automorphic representation which                should be attached to a family of Galois representations.  They                 will study these Galois representations in two special cases.  The              second project involves a general approach to understanding the                 cohomology of G(N) in SL(3,Z) for prime N.  The third project is                joint with Robert MacPherson (M.I.T.).  For any torsion-free                    finite-index G in Sp(4,Z), they have built a G-equivariant                      deformation retract (a ""spine"") inside the symmetric space for                  Sp(4,R); it has properties like those of the well-rounded retract               for SL(n).  They intend to attempt to extend their construction to              non-torsion-free G, and to build a similar object for Sp(6) and                 higher-rank groups.                                                                  The intricate computations envisioned here are intended to                 shed light on structures which arise in important ways in several               different mathematical areas.  The so-called arithmetic locally                 symmetric spaces interest number theorists as well as geometers,                while some of the questions about them have been transformed by the             investigator into pure topology.  No transformation removes their               difficulty, but when looked at in the right way, some difficulties              can be seen to have been addressed by earlier generations of                    geometers.  Seventeenth and nineteenth century geometers studied a              beautiful class of objects known as projective configurations, and              bearing out the mathematical dictum that beautiful objects repay                study because they recur again and again in different guises,                   properties of these configurations have turned out to bear on the               cohomology of certain arithmetic groups, normally considered a                  purely twentieth century invention."

He will also pursue a computer study of ends of hyperbolic 3-                   manifolds.  In still another separate project, Oertel will                      continue research into a class of 3-manifolds called laminated                  manifolds.  The first goal is to extend methods and theorems from               the well-known class of Haken manifolds to the larger class of                  laminated manifolds.  The second goal is to show that, in some                  sense, ""most"" 3-manifolds are laminated.                                             It is a surprising fact that, although we live in a three                  dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed                   with a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end               this does not carry us as far as we might have expected, for                    questions which have been settled by algebraic calculations for                 higher dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-                    dimensional case.  The most famous of these is the celebrated                   conjecture of Poincare from around the turn of the century                      concerning 3-dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-               dimensional case is the only one still open.  The investigators                 are pursuing a variety of questions about 3-dimensional                         manifolds, some with slightly strange notions of distance on                    them, so-called hyperbolic metrics, but time and time again these               questions have been shown to have clear relevance to the case of                manifolds with a more familiar notion of distance."

A new family of periodic cohomology                   theories was found in 1986 in joint work with Douglas Ravenel and               Robert Stong; it is the intention to study the central problem of               determining the intrinsic geometric nature of these cohomology                  theories, in light of the recent work on constructing elliptic                  homology by M. Kreck, S. Stolz, and M. Hovey.  Further problems                 dealing with variants of the usual level-2 elliptic genus, yielding             level-1 modular forms related to the Thom spectrum MO<8>, and level             N (N > 1) modular forms related to Jacobi polynomials, will be                  studied.  In addition, it is hoped that connections can be                      established linking knot invariants and quantum groups to elliptic              cohomology.                                                                          This project is concerned with reducing geometric information              to a subject for calculation.  The nature of the geometric                      information involved is the crux of the problem.  While questions               about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry               out to be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what                are known as topological properties of geometric objects.  These                are properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),                  knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study               of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric              objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are              only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of                 differences that can occur, all these have only truly been                      comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of             calculation.  Modern algebra furnishes many of the tools and the                attitudes toward the tools that are needed, and the interplay                   between the algebra and the topology remains a fascinating subject.             Elliptic cohomology, invented by the investigator and several co-               workers, bids fair to be one of the important tools in the arsenal              available to algebraic topologists."

The investigator will continue               his work with Sylvain Cappell and E. Y. Miller on the theory of                 generalized Casson flows, on Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants,              on spectral flow invariants of 3-manifolds, and on the application              of symplectic geometry techniques in Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index                 theory.  Jointly with Dariusz Wilczynski, he intends to investigate             representing homology classes of 4-manifolds by surfaces of minimal             genus.  A related topic is the joint work of I. Hambleton and the               investigator on the theory of smooth transformation groups on 4-                manifolds, equivariant moduli spaces of instantons, and the                     equivariant Donaldson invariant.  Together with Steven Weintraub,               he plans to continue their work on the cohomology of arithmetic                 subgroups of Sp4 and also on an invariant of ramified covering                  spaces originating from the work of J.-P. Serre.  Finally, with                 Alan Brownstein, the investigator plans to study the motion group               of n-strings in 3-space, its cohomology, and related moduli spaces.                  Traditionally, differential topology has provided a means of               analyzing certain questions about the world we live in, its                     geometry and its physics, but in recent years the situation has                 become much more fluid, with physics often providing useful                     geometric notions as much as vice versa.  The latest such foreign               imports so to speak have been the Donaldson invariant of 4-                     manifolds and related invariants discovered since but along the                 same lines.  There is, of course, a long history of mathematicians              involving themselves in the problems of physics, often to the                   mutual enrichment of both subjects.  Tools are developed to solve               physical problems, and these tools then turn out to have much                   greater generality and become widely used in mathematics.  The                  story of the new quantum invariants of 3-manifolds is a variation               on this theme.  Mathematicians interesting themselves in problems               of quantum field theory were led to a certain geometric                         construction.  The construction led in turn to an invariant that                depended only on the topological character and not the full                     geometric character of the underlying manifold.  There are now                  modifications of the original construction and numerous resulting               quantum invariants.  Their origin is sufficiently different from                that of other previously known invariants that they can be expected             to detect things the traditional invariants cannot.  It now                     behooves topologists to demonstrate this as well as to sort out the             different quantum invariants and their relationships to more                    traditional invariants.  Work along these lines will be among the               projects undertaken by the investigator with some of his legion of              collaborators."

These geometries are intimately interrelated, yet each               displays its own characteristic personality.  Direct constructions              of discrete groups by fundamental polyhedra (in the spirit of                   Poincare) in geometries in which totally geodesic hypersurfaces                 either do not exist or are not sufficiently flexible to build                   fundamental polyhedra, have led to alternate notions of half-spaces             and hypersurfaces.  The investigator has analyzed how such                      hypersurfaces intersect and the possible combinatorial types for                polyhedra built from these objects.  He applies this theory to the              geometry and topology of moduli spaces of geometric structures on               a manifold, these spaces being closely related to the better known              moduli space of representations of a manifold's fundamental group,              a structure profitably studied using gauge-theoretic techniques.                The prototype of such moduli spaces is Teichmueller space, and one              objective of this project is to see how the geometry of                         Teichmueller space extends to these more general moduli spaces.                      Despite the fact that we live in a 3-dimensional manifold, our             intuition quickly fails us as a guide to the truth or falsity of                fairly simple questions about their general geometric and                       topological properties.  Nor is it terribly helpful in telling us               where to look for answers.  An elaborate theory has been developed              which is growing by leaps and bounds and has been far more                      successful than raw intuition, one of the most surprising features              of the theory being the prominent role that a non-Euclidean                     geometry, so-called hyperbolic geometry, occupies in this theory.               Other special geometric structures also have been exploited in                  similar ways, somewhat as a scaffolding is used in constructing a               building:  One asks a topological question about a manifold,                    something intrinsically independent of geometry.  One then imposes              a geometric structure, deduces properties that seem to depend upon              this geometric structure (and some of which, as intermediate steps,             actually do depend upon it), and finally in a sense kicks away the              scaffolding to reveal the desired answer to the original question.              By this I mean that one observes that one has deduced a result that             does not mention the geometric structure explicitly, and that one               then succeeds in showing that any other choice for the geometric                structure would have led to the same final result.  This is only                one intriguing aspect of such research, for it is true that the                 geometric structures involved have now attracted a considerable                 amount of interest in their own right."

Along               with knot theory, the project is integrally involved with related               problems in combinatorics, generalized spin networks, quantum                   groups, statistical mechanics, and invariants of 3-manifolds.  In               particular, it addresses a tangle-theoretic recoupling theory for               the Temperley-Lieb algebra and its relationship with invariants of              graph embeddings, the SL(2) quantum group, and the Turaev-Viro                  invariant of 3-manifolds.  This recoupling theory gives a                       completely tangle-theoretic version of quantum 6j coefficients at               roots of unity, and it permits the construction of the Turaev-Viro              invariant on a purely knot-theoretic basis.  These topics will be               explored in the context of the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants             of 3-manifolds.  Other problems about link polynomials will be                  considered, such as the properties of statistical mechanical models             for the Alexander-Conway polynomial and relations with four-                    dimensional topology.                                                                Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose really                 interesting properties are topological.  By this we mean that two               geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if one of them              can be transformed to look just like the other without cutting or               untying it, just by pushing its string about to rearrange the                   crossings.  Topologists say that they are two different geometric               realizations of the same topological knot.  Nevertheless, it is not             a trivial matter to recognize when one complicated geometric knot               is topologically different from another, rather than just a                     different geometric realization.  This problem can be addressed by              computing certain numbers or polynomials which are called                       ""topological invariants,"" meaning that they always have the same                value for different geometric realizations of the same topological              knot.  The problem would be reduced to pure algebra if there were               one invariant which also always had different values for geometric              realizations of different topological knots, but life is not so                 simple -- no single invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the             known invariants taken together.  It is therefore valuable to                   investigate new invariants, some of the most useful being those                 inspired in recent years by ideas from quantum physics. In                      particular, applications of knot theory to the biology of long                  strands of DNA have drawn upon knowledge of these newer invariants."

The                        investigator will look into the nature of group actions on the 2-               sphere and their extensions into the 3-ball.  The main questions                he plans to consider are the following.  (1) If M is irreducible,               N is laminated, and M and N are homotopy equivalent, are they                   homeomorphic?  (2) If M is laminated, then are homotopic                        homeomorphisms isotopic?  (3) What manifolds have essential                     laminations?  (4) If G is a 2-sphere convergence group which                    extends to a properly discontinuous action on the 3-ball, is that               extension unique up to conjugation?                                                  The study of 3-dimensional manifolds is aided by the fact                  that our experience of living in such a space endows us with a                  strong intuition for what can and cannot take place.  Studying                  the topology of higher dimensional manifolds is necessarily                     dependent upon the algebraic machinery available to assist in it,               but in 3 dimensions we also have at our disposal a direct avenue                of perception.  It is therefore surprising to learn that some                   questions that have natural generalizations to higher dimensions                have been answered already for these higher cases, while the 3-                 dimensional case that inspired them remains obdurately                          unassailable.  There is a classical conjecture of Poincare about                spheres that is the most notorious example of this phenomenon.                  What appears to be at work in thus violating our natural over-                  estimate of the advantage that geometric intuition should confer                in 3 dimensions?  It is at least partly a naive faith in                        intuition and mistrust of computation, but it is also the fact                  that the known methods of computation perform best with the                     luxury of excess dimensions in which to maneuver.  They are                     somehow cramped in the presence of only three dimensions.  In                   this setting one can see that the investigator's exploitation of                laminations as a tool particularly adapted to the 3-dimensional                 environment and our intuition about it constitutes a welcome and                enormously promising development."

Tools are developed to solve physical             problems and then turn out to have much greater generality and                  become widely used in mathematics.  The story of the new quantum                invariants of 4-manifolds which figure in this project fits this                pattern.  Mathematicians interesting themselves in problems of                  quantum field theory were led to a certain geometric construction.              The construction led in turn to an invariant that depended only on              the topological character and not the full geometric character of               the underlying manifold.  There are now variations on the original              construction and numerous resulting quantum invariants.  Their                  origin is sufficiently different from that of other previously                  known invariants that they can be expected to detect things the                 traditional invariants cannot, but it behooves topologists to                   demonstrate this explicitly, as well as to sort out the different               quantum invariants and their relationships to more traditional                  invariants."

Both of these                 more classical objects have proved remarkably useful in obtaining               geometric/topological information about 3-manifolds from                        homotopy-theoretic data, and the essential lamination has already               begun to show itself to be a worthy successor to both of its                    `parents.'  The investigator intends to use essential laminations               to study the extent to which the fundamental group of a 3-manifold              determines the manifold up to homeomorphism, and also to study the              question of whether or not the manifold admits a hyperbolic                     structure.  He further intends to use the existence of normal forms             for essential laminations to study the question of whether or not               a 3-manifold (principally a hyperbolic 3-manifold) contains an                  essential lamination.                                                                It is a surprising fact that although we live in a three                   dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed with              a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end this               does not carry us as far as we might have expected, for questions               which have been settled by algebraic calculations for higher                    dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-dimensional                case.  The most famous of these is the celebrated conjecture of                 Poincare from around the turn of the century concerning 3-                      dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-dimensional                 case is the only one still open.  The investigator is pursuing a                variety of questions about 3-dimensional manifolds, some with                   slightly strange notions of distance on them, so-called hyperbolic              metrics, but time and time again these questions have been shown to             have clear relevance to the case of manifolds with a more familiar              notion of distance."

Increasingly, however, it has begun             to repay its debt.  The point is that it is often more important to             know of the solution of an equation whether it is a closed loop or              whether it is knotted, for example, than to know precisely and                  numerically what are the coordinates of all of its points.

There is a long tradition of mathematicians involving                      themselves in the problems of physics, often to the mutual                      enrichment of both subjects.  Tools are developed to solve physical             problems and then turn out to have much greater generality and                  become widely used in mathematics.  The story of the new quantum                invariants of 3-manifolds is similar.  Mathematicians interesting               themselves in problems of quantum field theory were led to a                    certain geometric construction.  The construction led in turn to an             invariant that depended only on the topological character and not               the full geometric character of the underlying manifold.  There are             now variations on the original construction and numerous resulting              quantum invariants.  Their origin is sufficiently different from                that of other previously known invariants that they can be expected             to detect things the traditional invariants cannot.  It now                     behooves topologists to demonstrate this as well as to sort out the             different quantum invariants and their relationships to more                    traditional invariants."

Geometric group             theory seeks to tie together combinatorial and geometric properties             of geometric isometry groups.  The theory is burgeoning at the                  hands of Gromov, Epstein, Thurston, Holt, Bestvina, Feighn, Mess,               Paterson, Gersten, Short, Shapiro, Parry, Floyd, Baumslag, Casson,              Brick, Stallings, a whole school of continental mathematicians,                 Cannon, and others.  The theory has produced the notions of                     automatic group, negatively curved group, complex of groups, almost             convex groups, combable groups, isoperimetric and isodiametric                  inequalities for groups.  Amid these many topics, Cannon, his                   students, and coworkers are currently concentrating on a cluster of             projects related to the existence of hyperbolic structures on 3-                manifolds.  Is the generic finitely presented group negatively                  curved, as claimed without explicit proof by Gromov?  Does every                negatively curved closed 3-manifold admit a Riemannian metric of                constant negative curvature?  Can negative curvature be recognized              algorithmically?  Can the space at infinity be recognized                       algorithmically?  Can potential constant curvature be recognized                algorithmically?  Cannon is using as the basis for these studies                his combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem developed during the                  previous projects, the related work by Parry, and the computer                  Programs of Epstein and his collaborators.                                           Groups are the appropriate algebraic structures for describing             the notion of symmetry with precision.  For this reason they play               an extensive role in geometry (and topology).  While the more usual             interaction between group theory and geometry is the use of                     algebraic computations involving groups to prove theorems about                 geometric objects possessing symmetry, there is a very significant              mathematical subdiscipline in which the roles are reversed and our              intuition about geometric objects assists us in conjecturing and                proving theorems about associated groups.  A fascinating recent                 development is the influence of the computer in all this.  Not only             is it the ubiquitous timesaver that everyone knows, enabling one to             undertake computations that would otherwise be too formidable, but              it has actually influenced the questions in geometric group theory              in a more fundamental way.  Certain classes of groups have been                 defined in terms of the types of hypothetical machines that would               be able to perform certain computations about them.  Real hardware              is not involved in this, and the same definitions could have been               conceived long ago, but they were not, for the existence of                     computing machines has influenced the way we look at the world, the             types of questions we ask about it, the kinds of properties that we             find interesting."

James F.                  Davis' main emphasis is the use of surgery theory to study rational             information in manifold theory.  Surgery theory is the main tool                for classification of manifolds of dimension greater than 3,                    although complexities in homotopy and integral representation                   theory make it efficacious only in special cases.  However, if one              works over the rational numbers, complete results are available for             manifolds with finite fundamental group.  Davis will attempt                    extensions of these results to manifolds with infinite fundamental              group, and to spaces more general than manifolds, but which still               possess some form of duality.  A second and quite different                     direction of Davis' research is knot theory.  He will study the                 homology of covers of the 3-sphere branched over a knot, the set of             periods of a knot, and their relationship with algebraic number                 theory.  In related work, Kent E. Orr will continue to study                    linking and knotting phenomena in codimension two, as well as                   investigate the implications of the recent Cochran-Orr work to                  Casson-Gordon invariants and four-dimensional surgery.  Among other             things, he hopes to answer the following two questions about the                link slice problem:  Are all even-dimensional links slice?  Do the              presently known homotopy theoretic linking invariants of links in               the 3-sphere (such as the transfinite invariants of Levine and Orr              and the Le Dimet invariant) reduce to classically defined                       invariants such as Milnor's invariants and Massy products?                           The details of these parts vary, but all are concerned with                reducing geometric information to a subject for calculation or to               perfecting the algebraic machinery used for the calculations.  The              nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of the                 difficulty.  While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes,             and so forth virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is             far different with what are known as topological properties of                  geometric objects.  These are properties such as connectedness                  (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so                  forth.  All systematic study of such properties, for example, how               to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to               one of these properties or are only superficially different, or how             to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all these                have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have been              reduced to matters of calculation, and two of the principal tools               for this are homotopy theory and surgery theory."

In the area of control one                considers right invariant vector fields on a Lie group and seeks                to understand various attainability questions as controllability                and maximality with respect to Lie saturation.  In casuality, the               tangent objects in the Lie theory of semigroups, the Lie wedges,                give rise in a natural way to homogeneous casual manifolds.  One                seeks a better understanding of when the resulting manifolds have               such desirable physical properties as being strongly casual or                  globally hyperbolic (as useful property for solving partial                     differential equations on the manifold).  Another line of                       proposed research centers on the development of a semigroup                     approach to topological dynamics via the Ellis semigroup.                            The Lie theory of groups is a highly developed theory.  It                 brings modern analysis and modern algebra to bear upon geometric                objects which arise in mathematical physics and in the theory of                differential equations.  This theory has been very successful in                answering difficult and important questions, and equally, in                    suggesting promising lines of inquiry.  Semigroups are algebraic                systems related to groups but without so much structure.  They                  have a role to play in mathematics and some applications, but                   they do not have the central importance that groups have come to                enjoy.  Their Lie theory has not been so thoroughly investigated,               partly for this reason, partly because of difficulties in seeing                how to proceed.  Professor Lawson has overcome some of these                    difficulties and has made impressive progress in putting the Lie                theory of semigroups on a firm footing.  He will continue to                    pursue this line  of inquiry and its ramifications in related                   areas of geometry, control theory, and mathematical physics."

It             is particularly directed to four classes of problems:  (1) homotopy             associative differential graded algebras and Lie analogs,                       especially as they occur in string field theories and spin n-                   algebras;  (2) quasi-Hopf algebras and deformations of bialgebras;              (3) Zamolodcdhikov's tetrahedral equation and generalized                       classifying spaces;  (4) the homological aspects of reduction of                constrained Hamiltonian systems, both classical and quantum, as                 embodied in the BRST formalism and the Batalia-Fradkin-Vilkovisky               complex and its generalizations.

This              project is devoted to a special case of that observation, namely,               the unreasonable effectiveness of algebraic topology.  It begins                with the discovery that a paper the investigator published almost               thirty year ago as an algebraic topologist was slated for a key                 role in conformal string theory and related matters.  The ""higher               order associativity"" of H-spaces that he developed there has gone               through a sequence of developments at the hands of MacLane;                     Brustein, Ne'eman, and Sternberg; Joyal and Street; and finally                 Drinfeld, who, in 1989, gave deep and ingenious applications to                 both physics and low dimensional topology.  Stasheff has become an              enthusiastic participant in the ensuing explosion of interest in                this and related areas."

The first part is a program to study perverse               sheaves from the micro-local point of view.  This includes an                   extension of the category of perverse sheaves to arbitrary                      homogeneous symplectic manifolds as well as the study of the mixed              and irregular versions of the theory.

Topology arose originally as an approach to the study of                   differential equations.  Over the intervening century it has                    evolved prodigiously, often seeming to have a life entirely its own             and independent of its source.  Increasingly, however, it has begun             to repay its debt.  The point is that it is often more important to             know of the solution of an equation whether it is a closed loop or              whether it is knotted, for example, than to know precisely and                  numerically what are the coordinates of all of its points.                      Furthermore, although the former qualitative information is                     implicitly contained in the latter complete description, it is not              at all obvious how to extract it.  The sophisticated machinery that             has been developed by topologists, such things as the                           investigations in homotopy theory outlined for this project, has                now been developed to a degree that often permits these natural                 problems to be handled in a natural way."

Part of                this research will be conducted by the investigators separately and             part will be conducted jointly.  A main line of research for                    Jackson continues the development of the structural theory for the              model L(R) assuming determinacy.  This includes pushing the current             theory further, as well as refining the theory at the projective                levels.  Jackson will also work on problems in other areas of set               theory.  The investigators will work jointly on problems in                     descriptive set theory, the theory of equivalence relations, and                problems both set-theoretic and topological in nature.  Some                    examples include the determinacy transfer problem at the odd                    levels, questions about metrizable continua with sigma-finite                   linear Hausdorff measure, and the existence of natural norms on                 K(X), the n-dimensional kernel of a complex metric space.  Mauldin              will also investigate some problems in the theory of random                     homeomorphisms, for example:  for one natural method for producing              circle homeomorphisms, do almost all homeomorphisms of the unit                 circle have periodic orbits?  Are there natural methods which                   produce homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers?                             Considering that the real numbers can be thought of as the                 ordinary number line of grade school arithmetic, it is surprising               how much structure can be imposed upon them and how intricate the               questions that can be asked about this structure.  Descriptive set              theory is the theory that addresses these questions with all the                machinery of modern mathematical logic.  For example, a standard                construct of this theory is the Borel hierarchy of sets, consisting             of two infinite sequences of families of sets, the Pi sets and the              Sigma sets, defined inductively, and hence of increasing                        complexity.  One of the obvious applications of the theory is to                locate precisely in this hierarchy a particular set which arises in             analysis, say the set of points at which a function is                          differentiable.  In fact, it is a typical and classical theorem of              descriptive set theory (due to Mazurkiewicz) that any such set of               differentiability belongs to the family Pi-one-one in the Borel                 hierarchy.  A central concern of the investigators are questions of             this character, i.e. questions which make logic relevant to the                 wider world of mathematics."

While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes,             and so forth virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is             far different with what are known as topological properties of                  geometric objects.  These are properties such as connectedness                  (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so                  forth.  All systematic study of such properties, for example, how               to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to               one of these properties or are only superficially different, or how             to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all these                have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have been              reduced to matters of calculation."

They have shown                that every open surface can occur as a leaf of some foliation and               ask what quasi-isometry types of surfaces can occur as leaves.                  Markov-exceptional local minimal sets are well-behaved, and the                 question arises whether every exceptional minimal set is in some                sense essentially a Markov one or, if not, at least has many of the             properties of a Markov one.  In a remarkable series of papers,                  Gabai has studied foliations of knot-complements, but much remains              to be done in this area.  For example, the principal investigator               intends to construct foliations of knot-complements that are easier             to visualize and then to use the Thurston ball of a certain second              homology group to describe all taut foliations of certain knot-                 complements.                                                                         A foliation of a manifold is a way of filling the manifold                 with lower dimensional pieces.  In the case of a codimension-one                foliation, these pieces are of dimension one less than that of the              given manifold.  Think of an onion or an artichoke.  The topology               of a manifold is strongly related to the kind of foliation which it             will support, and in skillful hands this relation has been forged               into a powerful tool for investigating the topology of manifolds.               It is an unintuitive fact that the major algebraic tools for                    investigating the topology of manifolds work best in the case of                high dimensional manifolds.  The geometric tool afforded by                     foliations is thus particularly welcome in the case of low                      dimensional manifolds.  A major instance of this is the                         investigation of the complement of a knot in the three-dimensional              sphere, which turns out to be an important way to gain information              about the knot itself."

By this we mean that two               geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if one of them              can be transformed to look just like the other without cutting or               untying it, just by pushing its string about to rearrange the                   crossings.  Topologists say that they are two different geometric               realizations of the same topological knot.  Nevertheless, it is not             a trivial matter to recognize when one complicated geometric knot               is topologically different from another, rather than just a                     different geometric realization.  This problem can be addressed by              computing certain numbers or polynomials which are called                       ""topological invariants,"" meaning that they always have the same                value for different geometric realizations of the same topological              knot.  The problem would be reduced to pure algebra if there were               one invariant which also always had different values for geometric              realizations of different topological knots, but life is not so                 simple -- no single invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the             known invariants taken together.  It is therefore valuable to                   investigate new invariants, some of the most useful being those                 inspired in recent years by ideas from quantum physics. In                      particular, applications of knot theory to the biology of long                  strands of DNA have drawn upon knowledge of these newer invariants."

The main objectives are as follows:                                     1) Extend an ongoing project to calculate and interpret the mod-2               cohomology of certain key finite groups.  The hope is to find a                 set of useful examples which will lead to further theoretical                   developments in the field, as has happened in the past.                         2) Analyze the cohomology and K-theory of certain discrete groups               such as arithmetic groups and mapping class groups, using                       methods from modular representation theory as well as a recent                   splitting result in K-theory.                                                  3) Apply methods from equivariant K-theory to certain G-complexes               associated to a finite group G.  This is motivated by a conjecture              in modular representation theory involving the isotopy groups of                the complex.                                                                         Groups are the abstract mathematical embodiment of symmetry.               They are ubiquitous in mathematics and in many mathematical                     applications to the other sciences, being well nigh indispensable               in quantum mechanics.  As such, one cannot underestimate the                    importance of efforts to understand their properties even better                than we do now - there is no telling where such understanding will              pay off, but mathematical physics is a plausible assumption.  This              project is in a sense a bootstrap project, for cohomology is                    already a theory based on groups, the various cohomology groups.                The investigator has been very successful in applying the                       cohomology groups in studying the structure and properties of other             groups, particularly certain of the so-called finite sporadic                   groups which had defeated the efforts of others.

In this way, transformation group theory (the                study of the symmetries of continuous objects, such as spaces) and              representation theory (the study of symmetries of discrete or                   algebraic objects) become intimately related.  The goal of this                 project is to investigate systematically the interactions between               the geometry of symmetries (such as fixed points) and their                     algebraic manifestations.  In particular, the problem of existence              of symmetries of Moore spaces with prescribed algebraic                         representations (the Steenrod Problem, posed in the early 1960's),              algebraic surfaces, and certain 4-dimensional spaces all provide                concrete problems to which a general theory should apply.                       Techniques from topology, algebraic geometry, and representation                theory should interact fruitfully in this endeavor.                                  Symmetry plays an absolutely fundamental role in science (in               fact, in art and music as well), and we attempt to understand this              role through qualitative and certain quantitative measurements and              comparisons.  In mathematics, symmetry plays a fundamental role                 also, and it has many different but related manifestations.  To                 have a precise and logical understanding of symmetries of a                     mathematical structure, such as a space, we need to discover and                quantify its so-called invariants and other important features.  A              wide variety of sophisticated tools of this trade, chiefly                      algebraic ones, have been developed over the years in different                 research projects, and this investigator is adept at and plans to               draw upon a surprising number of them in his current work."

Increasingly, however, it has               begun to repay its debt.  The point is that it is often more                    important to know of the solution of an equation whether it is a                closed loop or whether it is knotted, for example, than to know                 precisely and numerically what are the coordinates of all its                   points.

Menasco of SUNY-Buffalo have               recently proved an enhanced version of the venerable Tait                       conjecture for alternating knots, as well as the cabling conjecture             for alternating knots.  They will broaden their investigations into             geometric questions concerning specific families of links.  They                will seek to characterize knots of unknotting number one within                 certain classes, for instance the classes of alternating knots,                 Montesinos knots, and arborescent knots.  They hope to establish an             effective procedure for determining the unknotting number of knots              within these classes.  They will also seek information on the                   unknotting number of a cabled knot and will investigate the old                 conjecture that unknotting number is additive with respect to                   connected sum.  They will seek to prove that alternating knots have             property P, that all boundary slopes of alternating knots are even              integers, and that alternating links are determined by their                    complements.  They will endeavor to develop techniques for                      constructing essential laminations in alternating knot exteriors,               and in the case where the boundary slope is rational, they will                 examine the completions of these laminations in the closed manifold             obtained by appropriate Dehn filling.

Specifically, it studies Heegaard surfaces of 3-                    manifolds, essential maps between Haken 3-manifolds, and the outer              automorphism group of Haken 3-manifold groups.  Part of the work                involves development of practical algorithms, e.g., for                         constructing surfaces of specified types in 3-manifolds.                             The study of 3-dimensional manifolds is aided by the fact that             our experience of living in such a space endows us with a strong                intuition for what can and cannot take place.  Studying the                     topology of higher dimensional manifolds is necessarily dependent               upon the algebraic machinery available to assist in it, but in                  dimension 3 we also have at our disposal a direct avenue of                     perception.  It is therefore surprising to learn that some                      questions that have natural generalizations to higher dimensions                have been answered already for these higher cases, while the 3-                 dimensional case that inspired them remains obdurately                          unassailable.  There is a classical conjecture of Poincare about                spheres that is the most notorious example of this phenomenon.                  What appears to be at work in thus violating our natural over-                  estimate of the advantage that geometric intuition should confer in             dimension 3?  It is at least partly a naive faith in intuition and              mistrust of computation, but it is also the fact that the known                 methods of computation perform best with the luxury of excess                   dimensions in which to maneuver.  They are somehow cramped in the               presence of only three dimensions.  Bearing this in mind, one can               see that the investigator's nitty-gritty combinatorial                          constructions and algorithmic computations may just possibly be the             brute force that is essential to progress in dimension 3."

The second is a program for understanding                  the K-theory of group rings in terms of cyclic subgroups.

The nature of the geometric                       information involved is the crux of the difficulty.  While                      questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth                   virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is far                      different with what are known as topological properties of                      geometric objects.  These are properties such as connectedness                  (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so                  forth.  All systematic study of such properties, for example, how               to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to               one of these properties or are only superficially different, or                 how to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all                  these have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they                  have been reduced to matters of calculation.  Algebraic K-theory                has been developed into a major tool for this purpose, and the                  interplay between the algebra and the topology involved remains a               fascinating subject."

Three                 ongoing collaborative projects and one individual one are involved,             concerning (1) links represented by closed braids, with Joan S.                 Birman of Columbia University, (2) planar surfaces and the cabling              conjecture, with Abigail A. Thompson of the University of                       California, Davis, (3) embeddings and immersions in highly                      alternating link exteriors, with Morwen B. Thistlethwaite of the                University of Tennessee, and (4) the Milnor-Bennequin conjecture                and unknotting number.  (1) seeks better ways of calculating about              such links, possibly leading to a more efficient effective                      algorithm than Haken's for distinguishing oriented links.  (3)                  builds upon a recent joint triumph in settling the hundred-year-old             Tait flyping conjecture.                                                             Knots and their generalization, links, are rather elementary               geometric objects whose really interesting properties are                       topological.  By this we mean that two geometric knots do not                   differ in an interesting way if one of them can be transformed to               look just like the other without cutting or untying it, just by                 pushing its string about to rearrange the crossings.  Topologists               say that they are two different geometric realizations of the same              topological knot.  Nevertheless, it is not a trivial matter to                  recognize when one complicated geometric knot is topologically                  different from another, rather than just a different geometric                  realization.  This problem can be addressed by computing certain                numbers or polynomials which are called ""topological invariants,""               meaning that they always have the same value for different                      geometric realizations of the same topological knot.  The problem               would be reduced to pure algebra if there were one invariant which              also always had different values for geometric realizations of                  different topological knots, but life is not so simple -- no single             invariant achieves this ideal, nor even all the known invariants                taken together.  It is therefore valuable to investigate new                    invariants, some of the most useful being those inspired in recent              years by ideas from quantum physics.  The investigator has been in              the thick of this activity and has been particularly successful in              applying some new polynomial invariants to settle old questions                 about alternating knots.  He will continue to exploit these                     techniques as well as some more geometric ones."

The investigator will study the asymptotic behavior of                  leaves of F' and how fast they approach their limit sets.  He will              also analyze to what extent the topological structure of F                      determines the geometry of the manifold.  Finally, a non-singular               flow is Anosov if it induces hyperbolic behavior transversally to               the flow direction, so that in dimension 3 it determines two                    transverse codimension-one foliations.  The investigator plans to               examine the structure of the induced foliations in the universal                cover.  This is strongly related to homotopic properties of closed              orbits of the flow.  He also plans to study metric properties of                flow lines, for example, whether all flow lines can be                          quasigeodesic.

The topology               of a manifold is strongly related to the kind of foliation which it             will support, and in skillful hands this relation has been forged               into a powerful tool for investigating the topology of manifolds.               Foliations are also intimately related to the types of flows                    possible on a manifold.  Particularly in low dimensions, where the              standard algebraic techniques of topology work less well, using                 foliations to investigate manifolds and the possible flows on them              is a very welcome addition to the arsenal."

It grows directly out of their               theory of levels (1978), which has influenced not only their own                work, but that of the French and Japanese schools as well.  The                 main direction will be to explore the deep relations between the                topology of knot complements and taut, finite depth foliations.  A              major tool in this investigation will be the ""generalized Poincare-             Bendixson"" theory developed by the investigator and Cantwell as                 part of the theory of levels.  The lowest level of complexity is                that of a fibered knot, here called a ""depth-zero knot.""  These                 knots are relatively rare, have been studied classically, and are               relatively well understood.  The next level of complexity is                    exhibited by the depth-one knots, which are very numerous (as shown             in David Gabai's thesis) and present many interesting questions.                Depth-one knots are currently the focus of this project, and                    results already obtained confirm their interest.  Other questions               to be studied relate the degree of smoothability of taut foliations             to topology.  Although smoothness questions have not particularly               concerned 3-manifold topologists, a strong case can be made that                their relevance to topology is deep.  In a rather different                     direction, the proposer remains interested in the ergodic theory of             foliations, especially of exceptional minimal sets, and the related             question of whether the Godbillon-Vey invariant detects such                    minimal sets (almost certainly not).                                                 A foliation of a manifold is a way of filling the manifold                 with lower dimensional pieces.  In the case of a codimension-one                foliation, these pieces are of dimension one less than that of the              given manifold.  Think of an onion or an artichoke.  The topology               of a manifold is strongly related to the kind of foliation which it             will support, and in skillful hands this relation has been forged               into a powerful tool for investigating the topology of manifolds.               It is an unintuitive fact that the major algebraic tools for                    investigating the topology of manifolds work best in the case of                high dimensional manifolds.  The geometric tool afforded by                     foliations is thus particularly welcome in the case of low                      dimensional manifolds.  A major instance of this is the                         investigation of the complement of a knot in the three-dimensional              sphere, which turns out to be an important way to gain information              about the knot itself."

The recent solution of the Seifert Fiber              Space Conjecture has reduced this to the case of irreducible 3-                 manifolds whose fundamental groups contain no free Abelian                      subgroups of rank two.  Casson will concentrate on such manifolds               which have infinite fundamental group; according to the                         ""Geometrization Conjecture,"" these manifolds should all admit                   hyperbolic structures.  He will seek simplified proofs of                       Thurston's now classical results establishing this conjecture for               manifolds with non-trivial boundary, in the hope of developing                  methods which apply to the still unsolved case of manifolds without             boundary.  Robion Kirby will continue to search for topological                 interpretations of Witten's 3-manifold invariants for Sl(2,Z), and              particularly for the case of finite coverings.                                       It is a surprising fact that although we live in a three                   dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed with              a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end this               does not carry us as far as we might have expected, for questions               which have been settled by algebraic calculations for higher                    dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-dimensional                case.  The most famous of these is the celebrated conjecture of                 Poincare from around the turn of the century concerning 3-                      dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-dimensional                 case is the only one still open.  The investigators are pursuing a              variety of questions about 3-dimensional manifolds with slightly                strange notions of distance on them, so-called hyperbolic metrics,              but time and time again these questions have been shown to have                 clear relevance to the case of manifolds with a more familiar                   notion of distance."

This graph has                      topological and geometric properties which are often related to                 properties of the group G and independent of the set of generators.             Gromov's notion of ""negatively curved"" group, for example, can be               stated in terms of the Cayley graph as saying that there is a fixed             number c such that in each triangle of shortest paths in the Cayley             graph, each edge of the triangle is within the c-neighborhood of                the union of the other two edges.  There are various other                      properties which can be described in similar terms, although the                definitions are not quite so simple, usually.  One of the most                  interesting is a property invented by Stephen G. Brick which he                 calls ""qsf""; given a group-presentation, one constructs the 2-                  complex which is described, having the given group as fundamental               group; one asks whether arbitrarily large neighborhoods of the                  identity in the universal cover can be faithfully represented (in               a certain technical sense) by finite, 1-connected complexes mapping             into the universal cover; if so, the group is said to be ""quasi-                simply-filtrated"" or qsf.  There are generalizations of some                    results of Poenaru and Casson, so that one has a theorem to the                 effect that if an aspherical, P2-irreducible, closed 3-manifold has             fundamental group which is qsf, then its universal cover is                     homeomorphic to R3.                                                                  These and related notions have produced a revolution in the                theory of infinite groups within the last few years.  The basic                 pattern seems to be that one finds some facts in differential                   geometry and topology of 3-manifolds; one abstracts to the                      fundamental group level, and then one finds group-theoretic                     theorems which sometimes have a reverse application to topology.                In addition, the subject tends to have a connection with the                    computability of the Cayley graph itself; the Todd-Coxeter                      algorithm for finite groups thus extends to various kinds of                    computability questions about finite Cayley graphs.  The theory of              ""automatic groups"" involves finite-state automata and regular                   languages; this theory, however, does not apply to certain easily               understood groups such as nilpotent groups and matrix groups over               the integers; in order to understand these, one needs to extend the             notion of a finite-state machine in certain very restricted ways                which are not yet obvious.  Perhaps this will have implications in              formal language theory and other aspects of mathematics usually                 considered to be ""computer science."""

(i) Scharlemann intends to apply the new             research tools of ""thin position,"" combinatorics of surface                     intersections, and sutured manifold theory to several problems in               the theory of knots and graphs in 3-space and of Heegaard                       splittings of 3-manifolds.  Of particular interest are methods for              determining and characterizing knotting of graphs in 3-manifolds,               for applying these tools to the graphs which arise naturally in                 Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds, and, in the relatively simple               case in which the graphs consist of simple closed curves,                       understanding how the topology changes under a process called Dehn              surgery.  (ii) Long plans to examine several interrelated questions             in the theory of low-dimensional manifolds, braid groups, and                   representation varieties.  The specifics concern representations of             the fundamental groups of 3-manifolds and applications of these to              boundary slopes and Property P, as well as the braid groups and                 their representations.  (iii) Cooper intends to study ties of low-              dimensional topology to hyperbolic geometry.  The connection                    between incompressible surfaces in knot complements and the Newton              polygons of the SL2(C) knot polynomial provides a method of getting             at deep information about the topology of knot complements.  The                hyperbolic gluing equations for a knot complement provide another               means to approach the same problem.  Hodgson's formula for the                  hyperbolic volume form provides a closed 1-form on any curve given              by a polynomial in the longitude and meridian eigenvalues.  The                 exactness of this volume form on a curve arising from a knot puts               strong conditions on which polynomials arise this way.  Following               these leads, Cooper expects to find mutant knots with distinct                  SL2(C) polynomials, even without being able to calculate these                  polynomials explicitly.                                                              Knots are rather elementary geometric objects whose really                 interesting properties are topological.  By this we mean that two               geometric knots do not differ in an interesting way if one of them              can be transformed to look just like the other without cutting or               untying it, just by pushing its string about to rearrange the                   crossings.  Nevertheless, it is not a trivial matter to recognize               when one complicated geometric knot is topologically different from             another, rather than just a different geometric realization.  This              problem can be addressed by computing certain numbers or                        polynomials which are called ""topological invariants,"" meaning that             they always have the same value for different geometric                         realizations of the same topological knot.  The problem would be                reduced to pure algebra if there were one invariant which also                  always had different values for geometric realizations of different             topological knots, but life is not so simple -- no single invariant             achieves this ideal, nor even all the known invariants taken                    together.  It is therefore valuable to investigate new invariants,              some of the most useful being those inspired in recent years by                 ideas from quantum physics. In particular, applications of knot                 theory to the biology of long strands of DNA have drawn upon                    knowledge of these newer invariants."

These two problems involve understanding the geometry of              geometrically infinite ends of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  The                     approach which he plans to use is based on the technique of pleated             surfaces in hyperbolic manifolds.  He intends to develop a calculus             for pleated surfaces which will enable him to obtain estimates on               their geometry and the speed at which they converge to infinity in              the 3-manifold.

The most famous of these is the celebrated conjecture of                 Poincare from around the turn of the century concerning 3-                      dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-dimensional                 case is the only one still open.  The investigator is pursuing a                variety of questions about 3-dimensional manifolds with slightly                strange notions of distance on them, so-called hyperbolic metrics,              but time and time again these questions have been shown to have                 clear relevance to the case of manifolds with a more familiar                   notion of distance."

Y. Shimizu and the investigator found a                solution to this problem (over the rational numbers), based on                  the idea that affine connections on elliptic curves (which do not               generalize to higher genus) should be interpreted as special                    cases of the projective connections (which exist for all Riemann                surfaces).  This allowed them to associate in a natural way to                  any chiral conformal field theory  (in the sense of Segal),                     the topological genus defined by the projective connection (or                  stress-energy tensor) of the field theory.  They were able                      to identify this genus in the case of the charge-one fermion and                to show that it reduced (in the case of the elliptic curve) to                  the elliptic genus.  A corollary of this construction is that the               complex cobordism ring supports a canonical quadratic                           differential, closely related in some way to a quadratic                        differential supported by the fundamental bosonic                               representation of the Virasoro algebra.  The relation between                   these two quadratic differentials seems to be of fundamental                    importance and will be a major emphasis of the current project.                 In recent years mathematical constructions inspired by theories                 used to make sense of subatomic particles have found repeated                   application to purely geometric problems.  To their mutual profit               physicists and mathematicians are interacting more than ever in                 exploring these connections, and the investigator is a major                    player in this game."

In particular, he will continue to study the existence and concordance classification of positive scalar curvature metrics. He has recently shown that if a closed manifold M admits a positive scalar curvature metric, then the concordance classes of such metrics are in bijective correspondence to a certain bordism group which depends only on the fundamental group and the first two Stiefel- Whitney classes of M. Also, M admits a positive scalar curvature metric if and only if M represents zero in this bordism group. If the universal cover of M is spin, this bordism group maps to the real K-theory of the 'twisted' group C*-algebra of the fundamental group of M, the twist being determined by the first two Stiefel- Whitney classes of M. An optimistic hope is that this is in fact an isomorphism. The investigator intends to continue his study of the relations between positive Ricci curvature, elliptic genera and elliptic homology; in particular, to pursue his conjecture that the Witten genus of a positive Ricci curvature manifold M vanishes provided M is spin and its first Pontrjagin class is zero. In a different direction, he hopes to show that all the possible multiplicities of a Dupin hypersurface with four distinct eigenvalues are realized by the known examples, i.e. the homogeneous examples and the Clifford examples. Topology treats those properties of geometric objects which are not dependent upon distances or angles, which are so fundamental that they persist after stretching and bending an object short of tearing it. In a topological sense, a phonograph record and a wedding ring are the same, for no topological properties distinguish one from the other. In fact, each is topologically the same as a coffee cup. Their shapes are wildly different, and yet there are some geometric properties that all will have in common as a result of their common topology. The famous Gauss-Bonnet theorem, well-known in electromagnetic theory as well as differential geometry, requires that the total (Gaussian) curvature of any of their surfaces will be zero. Now curvature is a very non-topological property, and locally it can have any value whatsoever on one of these surfaces, but the values cannot be totally unrelated as one moves from point to point, for the theorem says they will all sum to zero if one weights them by elements of area. Prominent among the results this project seeks are modern variants of this wonderful theorem for manifolds of other dimensions and for other kinds of curvature."

Building on their past work on allowable sequences and order types of configurations, as well as on ideas coming out of their recent proof of the Grunbaum conjecture on the extendibility of finite arrangements of topological lines to continuous spreads, Goodman and Pollack plan to continue their work on configurations, arrangements of topological flats, and geometric transversal theory, examining (among other problems) (1) the problem of generalizing the proof of the Grunbaum conjecture to intermediate- dimensional flats, (2) the problem of finding a compact representation for configurations and polytopes, as well as a classification of arrangements of intermediate-dimensional flats which reflects their geometric properties, and (3) the problem of determining the relative frequency of order types (the classical Sylvester problem, generalized) via the identification of the set of simple n-point configurations in real d-dimensional space with an open dense subset of a suitable Grassmann manifold. The advent of high-speed computing has brought new life to many of these questions over the past few decades, since it has become possible to investigate non-trivial examples relatively painlessly. The size of interesting finite geometric sets tends to increase exponentially with the dimension. Consider, for the simplest example, the number of vertices of, in turn, a line segment, a square, a cube, a tesseract (4-dimensional), and so forth. The corresponding numbers are 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., and the regularity here is so pronounced that the numbers are computable and the properties of n-dimensional cubes, as they are called, remain manageable even for large n. However, less regular sets with rapidly increasing size become much more difficult to handle without a machine's assistance for computation. This is one aspect of the relation of this kind of mathematics to computing, but there is another reciprocal relation. Just as computing facilitates plausible conjecture and hence proof, so too do some of the proofs lead to improved algorithms for computing. We have here a very useful symbiosis that is bound to flourish even more in the years to come."

Cohen, and by deep studies in the structure of inner models of set theory and large cardinals. At the same time, there has been striking progress in the theory of compact Hausdorff spaces, and it is not always easy to see in advance whether extra set-theoretic assumptions are required. The investigator intends to continue his research on compact Hausdorff spaces, including the application of special set-theoretic tools. Other classes of spaces receiving attention will be the related classes of countably compact and sequentially compact spaces, Moore spaces, non-metrizable manifolds, Frechet-Urysohn topological groups and topological vector spaces, countably metacompact spaces, and weak and weak* compact subsets of Banach spaces. Finite group actions on normal spaces will also receive some attention. General topology is more of a foundational subject than the rest of topology, concerning itself with very abstract spaces and with the impact on topology of the adoption of variants of the axioms of set theory. Although analogies to familiar objects of geometry are valuable heuristics, the plastic, intuitive kind of geometry involving low-dimensional manifolds is a far cry from the study of subsets of a Banach space, the latter being more closely related to classical analysis than to geometry, in spite of the geometric terminology employed. One major result of general topology in which Nyikos was involved a decade ago was the discovery that a famous unproved conjecture concerning Moore spaces was actually independent of the usual basic axioms of set theory. Moreover, it was shown to be inconsistent with the Cantor Continuum Hypothesis, a far more familiar proposition that most working mathematicians would be likely to choose if they had to make a choice. This result suggests the flavor of the best general topology."

The global geometry and topology of properly embedded minimal surfaces: existence theorems, topological obstructions, total curvature theorems, conformal structure, topological uniqueness, computation of the index of examples, extension of isometries, uniqueness of minimal graphs of logarithmic growth over noncompact domains, area growth estimates for ends. 2. Global geometry of constant mean curvature in R3 and hyperbolic 3-space. 3. Computation relevant to problems in the subject. 4. Geometry of isotopy surfaces in R3. A classical topic in geometry is the nature of surfaces of minimal area having a specified boundary, the so-called soap film problem, which can be illustrated by dipping a wire frame into a soap solution and examining the film formed when it is withdrawn. Ignoring gravity, such films are known to have Gaussian curvature zero everywhere. A slightly more general physical situation calls for surfaces with constant but not necessarily zero curvature. Problems about such surfaces abound, and while natural and often simple to state, they are surprisingly difficult and have inspired the creation of powerful methods drawing on diverse areas of mathematics. Such problems and methods are the heart of this project."

The nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of the difficulty.

These are properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so forth. All systematic study of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all these have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of calculation."
