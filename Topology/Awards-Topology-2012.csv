Freed, Dan F. Knopf, Alan W. Reid<br/><br/>The University of Texas Geometry/Topology Research Training Grant (RTG) is a vertically integrated program to enhance the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates at the University of Texas and, through publication on the web, beyond.  The thirteen faculty members will build on the success of our previous RTG grants and also initiate new activities.  The latter include a Directed Reading Program pairing undergraduate students and graduate mentors; a new Journal Seminar for all graduate students in geometry and topology; a new series of First Cut Lectures on a variety of core topics, to be disseminated on the web; a new yearly Undergraduate Mathematics Conference; and a new series of Graduate Winter Schools for graduate students and postdocs.  All RTG activities are designed around a unified perspective on geometry and topology.  They include a healthy mix of ideas from low dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, global linear and nonlinear analysis, geometric group theory, geometric representation theory, and homotopy theory; often concepts and inspiration from theoretical physics play an important role as well.  The RTG training activities are designed to promote this unified view of geometry and topology and, more broadly, of mathematics and science to young mathematicians.<br/><br/>Mathematics, the study of Number and Space, lies at the foundation of science and technology.  Geometry, the study of Space, has long had connections with and applications to the real world.  Topology investigates, very roughly, global geometric properties of spaces which do not rely on local structure. There is great interplay between Geometry and Topology-there is not a sharp boundary between them.  In the ancient world measurement was introduced to facilitate commerce; more advanced concepts, such as trigonometry, were introduced to understand the stars.  In our modern world advanced ideas in Geometry underlie abstract theories in physics and also have more immediate practical implications, for example in navigation, computer graphics, etc. The large scale structures studied in topology appear in biological and physical science; there are new applications to data analysis and signal processing as well.  Effective training of the next generation of Geometers and Topologists is vital for the continued development of these ideas, both within mathematics and for external applications.  The University of Texas Geometry/Topology Research Training Grant promotes a unified view of the field.  An open attitude towards ideas from all directions is essential for success with the challenges facing mathematics and science today.  Through local activities in Austin, and via dissemination on the web, the RTG will enhance training at all levels."

Hill<br/><br/>This project seeks to broaden our knowledge of equivariant computations and, by universality of certain maps, of the homotopy groups of spheres. Equivariant homotopy calculations are notoriously difficult, hybridizing representation theory and classical stable homotopy theory in beautiful, and sometimes mysterious, ways. The recent solution by the principal investigator, Hopkins, and Ravenel to the Kervaire Invariant One problem introduced several new tools and techniques to equivariant homotopy, rigidifying earlier homotopical work and generalizing naturally occurring filtrations. In this project, the PI intends to use these new, exciting tools to continue making computational inroads in equivariant homotopy. There are two main approaches: computing equivariant homotopy groups of the families of spectra introduced by the PI, Hopkins, and Ravenel, and reconceptualizing parts of the cyclotomic trace approaches to algebraic K-theory. The former uses slice filtration techniques to tackle spectra like the Hopkins-Miller spectra, allowing a direct attack on the stable homotopy groups of spheres from a non-traditional approach. The latter builds on the norm machinery to rewrite the classical constructions in the equivariant approaches to algebraic K-theory, recasting them in computationally more amenable forms.<br/><br/>The project addresses directly the heart of algebraic topology: computing numbers and invariants to understand spaces. The goal of algebraic topology is to systematically build a connection between algebraic objects like numbers and geometric objects like spaces. Equivariant algebraic topology remembers a collection of symmetries inherent in a space as part of the data, systematically grouping spaces with the same symmetries, and the numbers and invariants produced must reflect this. Remembering the extra structure makes richer, but more complicated, computations, and it allows us to tease apart otherwise interconnected problems. For example, using equivariant methods, the principal investigator, Hopkins, and Ravenel solved the Kervaire Invariant One problem, the oldest outstanding problem in algebraic topology with roots dating back to the 1930s. This in turn gave information about how we can build spaces out of simpler ones like spheres. This project aims to build on the techniques developed in the solution, tackling other computational problems in algebra and topology."

This new conference in geometry and topology has an emphasis on highlighting and enhancing research being done in the Southeast US. We will have seven speakers, in the areas of contact topology, Heegaard-Floer theory, 4 manifold topology, and knot theory; and we will have participants from across the southeast as well as the rest of the country. Over the past few years, there has been an incredible amount of cross-fertilization between the fields of surface topology, contact topology, knot theory, and 4 manifold theory. At this conference, we will have specialists in each of these areas, whose work lies at the interface of two more more of these areas. As such, the conference will be a fertile ground for new ideas in geometry and topology.<br/><br/>The main goals of the conference are (1) To provide a high-profile geometry-topology conference to the Southeast that brings leaders of the field to the area as well as showcases the high quality mathematics being done in the Southeast, and (2) To provide a convenient meeting place for Southeastern researchers and students to gather, discuss, research, and interact with leading mathematicians from across the country. This conference will be a valuable learning environment for graduate students and junior faculty in the Southeast, and will help raise the profile of the region. We will provide ample time for the participants to meet, formally and informally, for example during long breaks between talks and organized discussion sessions. We plan to post notes from all the talks on the conference web site. More information can be found on the conference web site: http://ttc.gatech.edu."

Freed<br/><br/>The research in this proposal fits into the broad interaction between geometry and high energy theoretical physics, with a focus on algebraic topology.  There are both purely mathematical projects influenced by the physics and projects which apply topology to concrete current problems in quantum field theory, string theory, and condensed matter theory.  On the mathematics side we seek a categorification of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.  This requires us to develop generalized differential cohomology theory further.  We will also investigate several problems in topological field theory, particularly concerning invertible theories, which have implications for algebra and low-dimensional topology.  On the physics side we begin to study aspects of the maximal superconformal field theory in six dimensions, which is playing an increasingly central role in applications to mathematics.  We also continue our work on topological questions in Type II superstring theory.  The PI will use his experience in this area to attack topological questions in condensed matter physics, a new area for his research.  There are also graduate student projects in various directions in geometry and topology.<br/><br/>The research supported by this grant develops modern ideas in geometry which are closely connected with current work in theoretical physics.  Quantum field theory was developed in the last century to explain elementary particle physics, and it has had spectacular implications for mathematics as well. String theory is more speculative from the physics point of view, even more mysterious in mathematics, yet it too provides profound geometric insights. Many of the projects to be pursued here lie at the interface between geometry and these physical theories.  They are part of a much broader community effort to bring new ideas from physics into mathematics.  Some projects investigate mathematical structures and problems suggested by the physics. In others the PI collaborates with physicists to apply modern techniques in geometry and topology directly to problems in physics.  The longterm value of such basic research for society, above and beyond its intrinsic intellectual value, can be only be measured now by understanding how fundamentally our current technology and economy rely on basic research of past decades and centuries.  This grant also supports a longstanding outreach program in Austin which engages middle and high school students in mathematics."

Now a family of six-dimensional quantum field theories is emerging as an object of acute mathematical interest.  This Focused Research Group brings together researchers working in diverse parts of mathematics and physics to study these theories.  They originally arose as limits of string theories and are usually called 'superconformal (2,0)-theories' to call attention to their symmetries.  The simpler appellation 'Theory X' emphasizes how little is known.  The projects undertaken here have two overall goals.  First, we will make inroads on the structure of Theory X by applying the detailed and profound mathematical understanding of topological and conformal quantum field theories obtained over the past 25 years.  Second, we will use expected properties of Theory X and its compactifications to lower dimensions to deduce new conjectures and new organizing principles in geometric representation theory.  The rapidly developing web of interactions between the six-dimensional quantum Theory X and a host of central topics in twenty-first century geometry, topology, and geometric representation theory indicates that we are seeing the beginnings of a new revolution, one in which Theory X plays the dominant physical role. Progress towards unraveling its structure and its consequences will have broad ramifications.<br/><br/>Physics has long fueled developments in mathematics, and the past 30 years have been a particularly fruitful period.  The depth of mathematics which enters fundamental physical theories has steadily intensified, and at the same time the structure and predictions of these theories have had increasingly profound impacts on mathematics.  This project is one of many efforts to mine this intellectually fertile mix of ideas.  Our pursuit of Theory X will inevitably illuminate a much broader circle of ideas and contribute to the mathematical understanding of contemporary physics.  The work of past generations at the mathematics-physics interface fuels the modern world: our computers, GPS systems, transportation, sophisticated medical tools, and much more owe their existence to basic research in this area which stretches back well over a century.  While we cannot predict how current basic research will impact the future, we can say with certainty that the effect will be far-reaching."

The P.I. proposes to consider generic stable maps to 2-manifolds (Morse 2-functions), Lefschetz fibrations, open book decompositions and toric and locally toric fibrations, and proposes several problems that suggest how to unify the study of these different types of functions. The study of Morse 2-functions, in collaboration with Robion Kirby, should lead to new invariants of smooth manifolds, especially of interest in dimension 4. The study of Lefschetz fibrations and open book decompositions, in collaboration with Thomas Mark, centers around symplectic convexity and 4-dimensional symplectic surgeries and is thus aimed at new constructions of symplectic 4-manifolds. Toric geometry plays a role in the P.I.'s collaboration with Olguta Buse, which looks at 3-dimensional contact analogs of symplectic embedding and packing problems. Finally, all three threads are tied together by the P.I.?s program to develop a general theory of smooth 4-manifolds with locally toric fibrations over integral affine 2-complexes (as in tropical geometry); such a picture is implicit in certain aspects of the P.I.?s work with Symington, Stipsicz and Mark and will be developed properly in this program.<br/><br/>Smooth manifolds are spaces like the one we live in, the universe. Normally we think of it as a 3-dimensional space, but if we include time it is really 4-dimensional. The dimension is just the number of numbers you need to give to specify your location (latitude, longitude and elevation, for example). Statistical social scientists work in many dimensions, for example, when they record many numbers for each individual in a survey. Understanding the overall structure (the topology) of spaces of various dimensions is important in applications ranging from robotics to statistics to biology and is also appealing for its own beauty. Here the P.I. and collaborators will work to understand this structure by casting shadows of these spaces on 2-dimensional surfaces, in much the same way that we understand the 3-dimensional world around us through images projected onto our 2-dimensional retinas. To reach out to a broader audience and encourage budding enthusiasm for mathematics, the P.I. will work with Euclid Lab to run a mathematics research program for high school students utilizing a virtual learning environment, studying questions pertaining to the main research program of this project."

Specific goals include a classification of knots in the 3-dimensional sphere which produce  simple manifolds under surgery, topological characterization of knots which bound complex curves inside  complex   surfaces, and a deeper understanding of the structure of cobordism groups of knots and 3-manifolds.  Primary tools for this study arise in symplectic geometry, gauge theory, and quantum algebra. Many of these tools come in the form of  algebraic invariants e.g. Floer homology theories or combinatorial knot invariants such as Khovanov homology. The project also seeks to further our understanding of the invariants themselves,  and a central theme is to determine the extent  to which they faithfully represent the topological objects which they shadow.   The specific mathematical goals of the project are complemented by concrete initiatives targeted at graduate and undergraduate education, together with  activities aimed at an international community of topologists and geometers.  For instance, a new graduate course will be designed and implemented whose dual focus is on the development of topological breadth and communication skills in a variety of scenarios.  A summer school  for undergraduates and a broad-interest conference on topology will be organized.  <br/><br/><br/>Topology and geometry are mathematical fields which study  shapes and spaces, and low-dimensional topology focuses on those shapes which are within or just out of reach of our vision.   This project makes fundamental contributions to low-dimensional topology.   One of the key problems that the project attacks is the mathematical theory of ""knotting"", an area which attempts to understand and quantify the method by which ideal strings become tangled and knotted in space.  In addition to a fundamental role which knotting plays in low-dimensional topology, its theory has deep interactions with many seemingly unconnected areas of mathematics and physics, and even to areas such as polymer science.    One of the central aims of the project is to understand how knots evolve over time.  Imagine a movie in which a piece of string freely moves in space, becoming more or less tangled over time.  Further imagine that  at some frames in the movie more drastic phenomena occur such as the appearance or disappearance of a new loop of string or the gluing of two segments of the string together.  Such a movie is called a ""concordance"", and using this idea one can treat knotted pieces of string in much the same way that we treat numbers; namely, one can add and subtract knots in an algebraic way.    Understanding the arithmetic of knots turns out to have deep implications for the study of 4-dimensional space, one of the most difficult and least understood areas of modern mathematics.    In addition to its specific mathematical aims, the project will also contribute in a significant way to graduate and undergraduate education and to a global  research community through design and organization of innovative courses, workshops, and conferences."

Although the definition of algebraic K-theory is not inherently equivariant, the tools of equivariant stable homotopy theory have proven useful for K-theory computations. In particular, one fruitful approach exploits the equivariant structure of topological Hochschild homology (THH) to compute algebraic K-theory. In some cases K-theory computations can be reduced to the computation of equivariant stable homotopy groups of THH, graded by the real representation ring of the circle. Determining which groups need to be computed, computing them, and assembling the groups to recover algebraic K-theory are all important components of this approach. Goals of this project include completing these steps for various specific K-theory computations, as well as defining abstract algebraic objects embodying equivariant structures arising in such computations.  Other goals of this research program include describing the structure of higher topological Hochschild homology, and developing and exploring applications of a new equivariant model for THH.<br/><br/>Algebraic K-theory is an invariant which can be applied to study basic objects from several fields of mathematics. In particular, algebraic K-theory can be used to study properties of fundamental objects in algebra, called rings. Although higher algebraic K-theory was defined more than 30 years ago, computational progress has been slow. Indeed, even for some very basic rings, the algebraic K-theory is still not known. K-theory computations, however, have important applications to many areas of mathematics. Algebraic K-theory lies in the intersection of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory, with applications to motivic homotopy theory, classification of manifolds, special values of L-functions, etc. A goal of this project is to use tools from algebraic topology to not only produce new algebraic K-theory computations, but also to develop the framework and theory to facilitate future computations. This project also includes several educational and mentoring programs centered around the recruitment and retention of women and other underrepresented groups in mathematics. Programs aimed at undergraduate students include the development of a Women in Mathematics course, the creation of a Careers in Science lecture series, and undergraduate research opportunities aimed at early-career undergraduates. For graduate students, career mentoring seminars will be developed both for students at Michigan State University, and more broadly for students and post-docs in the international Algebraic Topology community through a retreat at an upcoming semester-long program. Also included are opportunities for K-12 students from underrepresented groups, as well as a program for female faculty members in science, mathematics, and engineering. Additionally, Gerhardt proposes a research project addressing the question of why many successful female mathematicians choose to leave academic math."

Heegaard Floer homology is part of a family of recent homology theories whose Euler characteristic gives other knot polynomials.  But it can be hard to compute, and is defined by ad-hoc rules rather than a concise set of properties.  In this project, we will develop a theory of bordered homology invariants: extend the Heegaard Floer homology and other homology theories to objects (knots or 3-manifolds) with boundary, so that when a knot or manifold is split into pieces the invariant for the whole can be computed from the invariants for the pieces.  Among other benefits, this will make the theory more computable, and give axioms for the theory.<br/><br/>Although knot theory has been studied for many centuries, some of the most elementary questions, such as finding the least complicated surface whose boundary lies on the knot, are still not easy to answer.

In this project, I and my collaborators will extend Heegaard Floer homology (and other related theories) so that they can be computed for pieces of a knot and then built up to the complete knot.  This promises to provide a great computational and theoretical tool.

It is primarily focused on the quantitative geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, specifically on estimating such quantitative invariants as volume, Margulis number and diameter in terms of topological data. This is an area in which connections with topology and several other branches of mathematics are playing unexpected roles.  Classical techniques in 3-manifold topology, some of which go back to Papakyriakopoulos's work in the 1950s, become particularly powerful when applied in the context of hyperbolic geometry. These topological ideas interact with more geometric and analytic methods, such as the log(2k-1) Theorem of Anderson, Canary, Culler and Shalen; the isoperimetric inequality for hyperbolic space; the theory of algebraic and geometric convergence of Kleinian groups; the work of Kojima and Miyamoto on hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundary; and the work of Agol, Dunfield, Storm and Thurston which applies properties of the Ricci flow with surgeries to the study of Haken manifolds and Dehn filling. Furthermore, surprising interactions are emerging, via topology, between quantitative geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and their number-theoretic aspects, specifically their trace fields; this has allowed applications of deep results in number theory to the subject.<br/><br/>Non-Euclidean geometry is a classical topic in pure mathematics which has seen remarkable developments in recent decades. The subject had its origin in the attempt, begun in ancient times, to prove that Euclid's fifth axiom could be deduced from his other axioms. It was shown in the course of the 19th century that this cannot be done: there is a mathematical structure called the hyperbolic plane (in two dimensions) or hyperbolic space (in three or more dimensions) which satisfies all of Euclid's axioms except the fifth, and in which the sum of the angles of a triangle is always less than 180 degrees. Remarkably, hyperbolic geometry turns out to be much richer than Euclidean geometry. This accounts for the astonishingly varied interactions that have developed since the 1960's between hyperbolic geometry and other branches of mathematics and science.  Most of these interactions involve the study of hyperbolic manifolds, which are geometric objects that have the small-scale geometry of hyperbolic space but have a more complicated structure in the large. For example, a straight line in hyperbolic space, as in Euclidean space, always extends to infinity; but in a hyperbolic manifold, a path that is locally a straight line (called a geodesic) may exhibit globally ""periodic"" behavior like a circle. Some of the principal investigators' earliest work on hyperbolic manifolds produced a result about knots that has been applied to study the structure of recombinant DNA. They are at present investigating a variety of aspects of the geometry of hyperbolic manifolds and connections with some of the other topics mentioned above."

One model for an order can be found in 2-dimensions; surfaces, orientable or not, with or without boundary, come in a neat package, which is well-understood. Thanks to Thurston and Perelman one now knows inexpressibly more than before about the geometry of all 3-manifolds, yet one still seeks an elegant framework in which to place them all. This quest leads to some long-standing problems, as well as introducing some new ones. This proposal describes problems in this general area which can be considered long-standing, although from a new point of view. For example, the PI will build on the fundamental work on the stabilization problem for Heegaard splittings which was completed during the previous grant, working with J. Hass and W. Thurston, and proposes to complete the second half of this conjecture. The PI introduces a new knot invariant, related to earlier joint research with Scharlemann, and suggests methods to answer some very basic questions regarding it. In addition the PI includes a problem closely related to the long-standing slice-ribbon conjecture. The PI also discuss her extensive outreach activities, which are intimately entwined with her research.<br/><br/>A 3-dimensional manifold is an object that looks, to a local observer, like 3-dimensional Euclidean space. That is, it looks like the room in which you are likely to be sitting. But just as several thousand years ago mankind knew only the local, not the global, shape of the earth, at present we know only about the local, not the global, shape of the 3-dimensional universe in which we live. So 3-dimensional spaces are in many respects important objects of study. Tremendous progress in this field has been made in recent years, and there is now a hope of understanding the full sweep of 3-dimensional spaces. The problems in this proposal address some of the longstanding structural questions in the field, with the aim of uncovering at least part of what is sure to be, when it is ultimately discovered, the elegant framework which underlies it."

The Principal Investigator will continue studying the subgroup structure of these groups, their asymptotic invariants (e.g., rank gradient and subgroup growth) and certain aspects of their representation theory (primarily properties (T) and (tau)). Special attention will be devoted to Golod-Shafarevich groups of number-theoretic origin, e.g. Galois groups of pro-p extensions of number fields with restricted ramification, and Kac-Moody pro-p groups over finite fields.

In particular, it is based on the novel proposition of using persistence diagrams, a relatively new concept in applied algebraic topology, as the fundamental modeling tool for DGM. The core tasks include the following. (1) Develop an efficient computational framework for working with persistence diagram data arising from spatiotemporal systems. (2) Using discrete element simulations (DEM) and experiments, carry out precise, well-defined, and complete characterizations of forces and stresses in DGM, including spatial and temporal variability of a given system and quantification of the differences between simulations and experiments.  (3) Formulation of an optimum combination of experiments and simulations to be used to analyze a given system, leading to reliable predictions for the nature and evolution of macroscopic quantities describing a system including stresses and bulk and shear moduli. (4) Use of persistence diagrams to characterize spatial and temporal fluctuations, including the dependence on system size, on the physical dimensions (e.g. 2D versus 3D), and particle properties such as shape or friction. (5) Study the topology of the space of persistence diagrams.

These materials appear in a broad spectrum of practical settings from heavy industry to pharmaceuticals. As such, they are of intense interest to the engineering world. The way in which grains pack and in which forces are carried in DGM presents a significant puzzle for the soft condensed matter and statistical physics communities.  Associated with force and packing complexity are challenging mathematical issues related to the analysis of complex high dimensional multiscale spatiotemporal data.  DGM are inherently high dimensional systems in which geometry plays a fundamental role. However because of their granular nature they cannot be usefully approximated by analytic continuum models and thus a clear method of reduction to a tractable problem is  lacking.  Our goal is to demonstrate that new ideas associated with computational topology provide an efficient, faithful and coherent approach to providing tractable models for the temporal evolution of spatial structures in DGM. The abstract nature of the topological methods being developed imply that the tools developed in this context will be applicable to a wide range of systems demonstrating complex spatiotemporal structures."

The objects of such categories consist of a sequence of algebras together with face and degeneracy maps between adjacent levels, satisfying certain relations. The associated homotopy theory of simplicial algebras provides a setting for modeling the homological algebra associated to the original algebra type (and, thus, providing a basis for the study of derived algebras). Thus this category provides a natural place to study such algebras utilizing standard homological devices such as higher torsion, higher extensions, and the tangent complex. The PI continues his research on simplicial algebras in relation to the problem of realizing algebras as the homotopy or cohomology of spaces and in relation to the conjectural rigidity properties of the tangent complex. To that end, the PI will aim to further elaborate the general internal structure of Andre-Quillen cohomology of algebras. In a continuing collaboration with D. Blanc and M. Johnson, the PI will use this structure to determine and study the algebraic properties of higher homotopy operations as they are represented in the Andre-Quillen cohomology of (a variation of) Lie algebras. This in turn will be used to elucidate the obstruction theory for topologically realizing a given Lie algebra via homotopy groups and seek to make these obstructions computable. The PI will also continue studying the divide between locally complete intersection algebras and locally Gorenstein algebras through the possible rigidity properties possessed by Andre-Quillen cohomology. This will involve elaborating further the structure of derived commutative algebras as modeled by simplicial commutative rings. Again the internal structure of Andre-Quillen cohomology will serve to help elucidate the properties of those derived algebras that possibly fall within this divide and use these properties to characterize and classify their types. Finally, the PI will begin carrying further this particular investigation within the context of derived algebraic geometry.<br/><br/><br/>Derived algebras appear in various contexts in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and commutative algebra. Recent concepts flowing into algebraic topology and algebraic geometry from theoretical physics (such as topological modular forms, elliptic objects and chiral algebras) can be studied from within the context of algebraic geometry based on certain types of derived algebras. This project will enhance our understanding of how the theory of derived algebra and derived algebraic geometry can provide a setting for studying such complex geometric structures through sophisticated homological devices. The PI works with undergraduates and opportunities are provided for them to engage in research during the summers. The PI invites mathematicians from around the country to speak at a colloquium held on campus.  Talks at the colloquium give students a chance to be introduced to researchers from various universities and be exposed to the type of mathematics being pursued at the graduate level."

The subject of Gromov-Witten theory was born twenty years ago  during a period of intensive interaction between mathematics and physics.  Since then Gromov-Witten theory has established itself as a central area in both geometry and physics.  At the same time, it has expanded greatly in its scope to many diverse areas of mathematics, ranging from the classical topic of Hurwitz theory to the modern area of Donaldson-Thomas invariants (the sheaf-theoretic counterpart of Gromov-Witten theory). Despite its success, many central problems remain unsolved. Two notable examples are the computation of higer genus Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and the precise relation between Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The resolution of these problems is of great importance for geometry and physics. In this proposal, a team of the best experts in the world is assembled to attack these central problems. In addition, the PIs propose to develop technology to study a variety of questions relating Gromov-Witten theory to enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and mathematical physics.

Its quantization, giving rise to the so-called quantum Teichmuller space, finds its origin in mathematical physics, more specifically in the study of 2+1 quantum gravity. Two approaches will be developed in understanding this connection more deeply. The first approach will consist in studying the possibility of constructing a finite dimensional modular functor associated to the representation theory of the quantum Teichmuller space. If this approach is successful, it would lead to the construction of a family of representations of the mapping class groups of punctured surfaces and ultimately to the construction of a topological quantum field theory. The second approach will consist in studying the relationship between the quantum Teichmuller space and the skein algebra of arcs and links developed recently by the PI and a collaborator. The possible connections between the two points of view is expected to be similar to the relationship between the geometrical and the combinatorial approach to SU(2)-TQFT.<br/><br/><br/>The study of three-manifolds is in essence the study of the possible shapes of the universe and as such sits naturally at the intersection of mathematics and theoretical physics.

In recent years, numerous results and conjectures have aimed at reconciling the two points of view.

The PI would like to turn this relationship around by using results from algebraic geometry to discover new information about classical homotopy theory.  For example, the PI has used motivic homotopy theory over C to completely reconstruct the classical 2-complete Adams-Novikov spectral sequence in a large range.  Similarly, motivic computations over R have revealed new information about equivariant stable homotopy theory. Specifically, the PI is interested in the motivic version of the Adams spectral sequence, with base field R or C, where thorough computations are possible.<br/><br/>Homotopy theory is a technique for studying geometric objects up to certain kinds of deformations.  Homotopical approaches often allow for concrete calculations that are otherwise inaccessible.  Computations of stable homotopy groups have been a major topic of research in topology since the middle of the 20th century.  Although tremendous progress has been made, much remains unknown.  In the 1990's, Fabien Morel and Vladimir Voevodsky developed motivic homotopy theory.  In analogy to classical homotopy theory, motivic homotopy theory allows us to study algebraic objects up to certain kinds of deformations.  Their goal was to import the techniques of homotopy theory into the realm of algebra.  The PI's goal is the reverse: to use algebraic results to obtain new information about classical homotopy theory."

Another is to use new methods to study singularities of complex surfaces. In particular, the important role of bilipschitz geometry in revealing fine invariants has become clear through work of the PI, Birbrair, and Pichon. The PI will extend their recent bilipschitz classification of inner metric of complex surface germs to the outer metric, and apply this to such long-standing problems as the relationship between Lipschitz and Zariski equisingularity and the conjectured dualities between intersection homology and analytically based cohomology theories.  A start will be also be made on extending the approach also to higher dimensions and sets in o-minimal structures.  The PI will also continue studies related to the Casson invariant conjecture, a concrete formulation of a looser question originally asked by Sir Michael Atiyah, postulating links, motivated out of physics, between topological invariants related to topological quantum field theories and analytical invariants in algebraic geometry.  At the other end of the spectrum, for hyperbolic manifolds there are also postulated connections between geometric, arithmetic, representation-theoretic and quantum based invariants of manifolds, which the PI and his students have made progress on and on which the PI will continue to work.<br/><br/>Quasi-isometric and bilipschitz geometry, which allows a limited amount of deformation, provides a framework in which geometries which would otherwise depend on choices become unique. This framework is useful both in the large, e.g., for the geometric study of universal covers of compact manifolds, where it connects geometry/topology with geometric group theory, and in the small, where it is the natural framework for the study of the local geometry of algebraic sets.  In both situations three-dimensional manifolds play an important role. Moreover, through invariants of manifolds one has interactions of low dimensional topology with algebra, number theory, and theoretical physics. Using these approaches the project addresses long-term open theoretical questions that span different areas of mathematics. Links between disparate areas provide much of the power of mathematics, and strengthening these links increases the power."

Such groups are accessible to a direct geometric description and understanding which are not always clear for groups defined algebraically or arithmetically. While these reflection groups are relatively well understood in the constant curvature setting (they are then ""Coxeter groups"" in Euclidean, spherical or real hyperbolic n-space), very little is known about their complex hyperbolic counterparts.<br/><br/>A ""tessellation"" or crystal structure is a way of filling space with non-overlapping tiles in a pattern that repeats infinitely often.

Real and complex hyperbolic spaces are spaces of negative curvature modelled on the real or complex numbers. Negative curvature means loosely that non-intersecting ""straight"" lines tend to diverge from each other in both directions.

The symmetries of an object are often the first properties we look for when we encounter something for the first time and try to understand it. A group is a mathematician?s way of defining and thinking about symmetry. Just as a thorough investigation of the integers is important to understand the rational numbers because every rational number is the quotient of two integers, a thorough investigation of free groups is important to understand groups because every group is the quotient of two free groups.  Symmetries of free groups are the focus of this international conference and the of advanced courses.

Equations give a universal language to describe scientific problems in all their variety. Over the years (centuries, in fact) equations and their solutions became very complex, so to understand their hidden structure one has to use very elaborate techniques from algebra and geometry. In particular, groups are used to describe symmetries of  mathematical objects, they play a fundamental role in studying solutions of equations.  Nowadays, when mathematics gets ever more complex, equations alone cannot describe subtleties of scientific phenomena; new problems require much more powerful means and more powerful languages.  Most of the essential properties of objects that occur in everyday mathematical practice can be described in a very particular but universal language, so called first-order logic.  In this project we study  properties of groups, in all their entirety, that can be described in the first-order logic.

In each of these projects, Heegaard Floer homology provides important information and sets up a challenging combinatorial problem, which in turn requires modern methods to solve.<br/><br/>Low-dimensional topology is concerned with the properties of curves, surfaces, and 3- and 4-dimensional spaces -- objects that we can visualize, though sometimes with a bit of effort.

On the other hand, it has a distinctly visual nature that is reflected in the arts: for example, through Celtic knots, motifs in ancient architecture, and Escher's prints.  The goal of the PI's proposal is to study some attractive and simply-stated problems in low-dimensional topology.  In fact, many of these problems focus on the mathematical properties of Celtic (a.k.a. alternating) knots.

The main motivation for this is a potential explicit categorification of the Kauffman polynomial using certain additional structures on the Khovanov-Rozansky homology. The second theme is twistings in link diagrams and the Khovanov-Rozansky homology. Krasner simplified the Khovanov-Rozansky chain complex of a two-strand twisting, which has led to new topological and structural results about the Khovanov-Rozansky homology. The PI will further study applications of this simplified chain complex. The final theme of this project is the spanning tree model. The PI will study potential applications of the explicit spanning tree model for the odd Khovanov homology of knots recently discovered by Roberts, Jaeger and Manion.<br/><br/>In the late 1990s, Khovanov pointed to a new direction in the quantum invariant approach to low-dimensional topology. His work showed that, instead of working inside a linear space or a module, one should work inside a category. This way, the construction will lead to homological invariants which retain more topological information than the polynomial invariants. Such homological invariants are called categorifications of the corresponding polynomial invariants. Khovanov categorified the Jones polynomial and, with Rozansky, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial. Experts have used these categorifications to prove topological theorems that were only accessible by geometric analysis before. Among these, the best known is Rasmussen's combinatorial proof Milnor's Conjecture. The goal of this project is to further expand the scope of the categorification approach to knot theory by better understanding existing categorifications, constructing new categorifications and finding new applications of these categorifications."

Specific aims include finding obstructions to a contact structure having support genus one, determining whether Legendrian surgery preserves tightness, understanding the relationship between fractional Dehn twist coefficient and fillability, and developing a combinatorial spanning tree model for knot Floer homology. The PI plans to use the latter to find an axiomatic description of knot Floer homology, in part to show that it agrees with the monopole and instanton knot homologies defined by Kronheimer and Mrowka using gauge theory.<br/><br/>The proposed project involves studying geometric structures on 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds.

Thurston made a number of conjectures that have been a driving force in the field, not only due to their intrinsic interest but because the study of these conjectures has produced new mathematics that has had wide ranging impact in many fields of mathematics. In the previous decade many of Thurston's original conjectures have been solved, introducing both new techniques and new problems into the field. The principal investigator will use these new tools  to answer further questions about hyperbolic 3-manifolds and in particular will study the topology of spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds attempting to answer questions such as if these spaces are locally connected and if not where locally connectivity fails. One area where the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds has had great influence is in the study of  mapping class groups. This is perhaps the simplest example of a naturally occurring group that is not a lattice in a Lie group and has been much studied by geometric group theorists. The PI will apply many of the tools developed in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, such as the curve complex, to study problems about the mapping class group.<br/><br/>Three-manifolds are a central object of mathematical study for several reasons. The most obvious is that the space we live in is a 3-manifold and one basic goal of mathematics is to gain a better understanding of the real world. On a more abstract level, 3-manifolds have a deep and intricate structure that connects to many other areas of mathematics. This project will focus on hyperbolic 3-manifolds. When looking at the simplest examples it first appears that hyperbolic 3-manifolds are quite rare. However, a deeper analysis shows that, in a natural sense, hyperbolic 3-manifolds are the most prevalent type of 3-manifolds. While 3-manifolds themselves are topological objects to understand hyperbolic 3-manifolds them one is quickly led to algebra, geometry and analysis. By studying hyperbolic 3-manifolds we learn more about mathematics as a whole."

It has long been known that in some sense algebraic K-theory is an invariant of the homotopy theory of the category of modules; this idea can be made precise in terms of a motivic perspective, which views the geometry of rings and schemes as encoded in their categories of modules, making such module categories the central object of study.  The PI will develop this perspective to establish conjectures old and new, dramatically advancing our understanding of algebraic K-theory and its deep role in topology, geometry, and arithmetic.  The work relies in part on new technology in homotopy theory: the emerging theory of infinity categories and tools arising from the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel solution of the Kervaire invariant one conjecture.  The PI also proposes to develop a program to identify undergraduates interested in mathematics and encourage them to pursue graduate work in the mathematical sciences.  The program will expose participants to a novel curriculum emphasizing learning by discovery.  The proposed curriculum, incorporating pedagogical techniques from ""inquiry-based learning"", is based on a software environment supporting an innovative treatment of elementary linear algebra and algebraic topology via guided exploration.<br/><br/>The proposed research will advance our current understanding of the bridge between algebra and high-dimensional geometry.  Some aspects of the proposed research will have impact on mathematical physics, particularly the study of topological field theories and string theory.

Since Kolmogorov's initial breakthrough (1958), dynamical entropy has played a major role in the ergodic theory of amenable actions. The principal recently discovered a generalization of Kolmogorov's entropy to actions by sofic groups. This class of groups contains many familiar and interesting groups, including all linear groups, thereby providing the first extension of entropy theory to certain nonamenable groups. This new development opens the door to an abundance of problems that could have a great impact in ergodic theory and other fields (e.g., statistical physics, probabilistic combinatorics, operator algebras). In the last decade, there has been an explosion of interest in rigidity theory for nonamenable group actions (see, for example, works of A.Furman, D. Gaboriau, and S. Popa). New results indicate that, under special conditions, measure-conjugacy is equivalent to a priori weaker forms of equivalence of actions, such as orbit equivalence and von Neumann equivalence. It is expected that the principal investigator's new entropy theory can make an important contribution to rigidity theory by determining more precisely when it is an orbit equivalence or von Neumann equivalence invariant. The principal investigator has recently proven the first orbit equivalence flexibility results in the nonamenable setting. It is expected that the techniques developed for the proof will be more broadly applicable and could result in a general orbit equivalence flexibility theory for certain groups and actions. Pointwise ergodic theorems have a long history, beginning with Birkhoff. In collaboration with A. Nevo, the principal investigator is developing general methods for proving pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of discrete, nonamenable groups. Successes so far include new pointwise ergodic averaging sequences for actions of free groups and the first pointwise ergodic theorems for actions of general word-hyperbolic groups with respect to ball and spherical averages. The new techniques remove a fundamental obstacle in that they reduce the problem to the amenable case, which can then be solved by the classical Wiener-Calderon-Folner theory. <br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes yearly workshops at Texas A&M for the purposes of introducing graduate students to the latest research developments and bringing together the diverse groups of researchers working in areas important to the project. The principal investigator plans to mentor undergraduates through his department's honors program and to give popular talks at math club meetings and during his department's summer programs for undergraduates and high school students. The principal investigator also plans to invite an expert expositor as a distinguished lecturer to give a series of inspiring talks on topics of current interest. This project directly provides for the training of a graduate student. It should be easy to attract one because the principal investigator's recent results are accessible and lead to an open field of problems whose solutions could have significant impact in ergodic theory and other areas."

This project aims to  further develop this relatively new theory, to both bring new techniques to  bear on previously studied invariants and to find new manifold invariants. A  particular focus is 3-manifold topology, where one goal is to express quantum  knot and 3-manifold invariants, such as Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants,  Vassiliev knot invariants, and Chern-Simons invariants, in a uniform way in  terms of factorization homology, and a second goal is to construct new knot  homology theories via factorization homology. Another focus is the relation of  factorization homology to the surgery classification of higher-dimensional  topological manifolds.<br/><br/>This project lies in topology, which studies abstract notions of space, motivated by mathematical physics - an intersection which had led to a great  deal of work and cross-pollination. The problems are concerned with what  possible global geometry may exist in a theoretical model for physical space  or space-time and how this global geometry can be detected. It is interesting problem to try to describe the global geometry of such a  candidate model for space-time by local observations. This project is one  approach to this problem. Namely, if one were allowed to make local  observations of some kind at different points throughout space-time, then  compare them, how could one then reconstruct the global geometry from these  compatible collections of observations? Factorization homology, the focus of  this project, provides one avenue toward addressing this question."

Using grid diagrams, the principal investigator will work to find a refinement of knot Floer homology which hopefully reflects the non-commutative structure of the fundamental group of the knot exterior.  From this refinement, the principal investigator hopes to garner further concordance invariants and apply them to study topologically slice knots.  This refinement of knot Floer homology is expected to capture some of the information in the higher-order Alexander modules.  The final goal of the project is to develop computational techniques for these modules.<br/><br/>The principal investigator hopes to shed light on the structure of knotted curves in space.  Knots appear many places in nature.  For example, the strands of DNA in cells are knotted, and these knots can affect the replication process.

During the last twenty years, there has been a great deal of activity devoted to building a so-called string-theoretic model of the universe, which incorporates some of the most sophisticated mathematics. The subject of Gromov-Witten theory was born twenty years ago  during a period of intensive interaction between mathematics and physics.  Since then Gromov-Witten theory has established itself as a central area in both geometry and physics.  At the same time, it has expanded greatly in its scope to many diverse areas of mathematics, ranging from the classical topic of Hurwitz theory to the modern area of Donaldson-Thomas invariants (the sheaf-theoretic counterpart of Gromov-Witten theory). Despite its success, many central problems remain unsolved. Two notable examples are the computation of higer genus Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and the precise relation between Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The resolution of these problems is of great importance for geometry and physics. In this proposal, a team of the best experts in the world is assembled to attack these central problems. In addition, the PIs propose to develop technology to study a variety of questions relating Gromov-Witten theory to enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and mathematical physics.

This Focused Research Group brings together researchers working in diverse parts of mathematics and physics to study these theories.  They originally arose as limits of string theories and are usually called 'superconformal (2,0)-theories' to call attention to their symmetries.

Second, we will use expected properties of Theory X and its compactifications to lower dimensions to deduce new conjectures and new organizing principles in geometric representation theory.  The rapidly developing web of interactions between the six-dimensional quantum Theory X and a host of central topics in twenty-first century geometry, topology, and geometric representation theory indicates that we are seeing the beginnings of a new revolution, one in which Theory X plays the dominant physical role.

Our pursuit of Theory X will inevitably illuminate a much broader circle of ideas and contribute to the mathematical understanding of contemporary physics.  The work of past generations at the mathematics-physics interface fuels the modern world: our computers, GPS systems, transportation, sophisticated medical tools, and much more owe their existence to basic research in this area which stretches back well over a century.

The proposed research includes  large scale geometry of solvable groups, metric structure on the boundary of relatively hyperbolic groups, and quasiisometric rigidity of Hadamard manifolds.  The proposed research  on solvable groups  involves the study of quasiconformal analysis on  nilpotent Lie groups. Although the metrics on the nilpotent Lie groups are not Riemannian, they are left invariant and admit a one-parameter family of dilations.   They include Carnot metrics and also many other metrics.    Stated in the language of quasiconformal analysis, some of the goals are:  to classify  these nilpotent Lie groups up to quasiconformal equivalence; to show that (in most cases) every quasiconformal map is biLipschitz.  In terms of large scale geometry, the goal is to show that  quasiisometries between (most) negatively curved solvable Lie groups preserve distance up to an additive constant  and sometimes are    even  at a finite distance from isometries.   If  successful, this  research will lead to progress on the large scale geometry  of   finitely generated solvable groups. The proposed research on relatively hyperbolic groups will try to determine if there is a canonical quasiconformal structure on the boundary of relatively hyperbolic groups.   % and   the limit sets of geometrically finite groups. It would have applications to rigidity questions about these groups.  The proposed research about Hadamard manifolds concerns the question whether every quasiisometry between Hadamard manifolds is at a finite distance from a biLipschitz homeomorphism. The proposed projects on negatively curved solvable Lie groups and Hadamard manifolds  are  continuation of the PI's previous work on these topics. A common theme of these proposed   projects is the interplay  between geometry of negatively curved spaces  and  analysis  on the ideal boundary of these spaces.<br/><br/>The proposed research lies in geometric group theory and geometric analysis.  The questions in geometric group theory often concern the large scale properties of the spaces or maps, while in analysis the main focus is often the local properties. Surprisingly, these are related for spaces with negative curvature: a negatively curved space has an ideal boundary, and the large scale properties of the spaces are  encoded in the local structure of the ideal boundary. The PI proposes to study  the large scale properties of negatively curved spaces by  investigating the ideal boundary using  geometric analysis."

This viewpoint is forced on us if we want to study infinite finitely-generated groups without specifying a generating set, since the graphs that record each group's geometry are only mutually related by QIs.  In this project, the PI proposes to study group statistics that are large-scale but not invariant under quasi-isometry, and so may depend nontrivially on a choice of generating set.  This point of view facilitates the study of randomness and asymptotic density in groups.  The PI has studied free abelian groups and the discrete Heisenberg group in this way, opening up several avenues for current and future research.  Another object of particular interest is Teichmueller space, the parameter space for many kinds of geometric structures on surfaces.  The proposal contains descriptions of ongoing and planned work developing ideas for measuring ""typical'' geometric properties in Teichmueller space, the mapping class group, and the complex of curves using data that is destroyed by quasi-isometry.  For instance, one can show in this way that even though Teichmueller space is not a hyperbolic space, certain characteristics of hyperbolicity hold on average, or up to measure.  The techniques developed to study this space, which has many features of negative curvature but does not satisfy any of the usual curvature conditions, are promising for applicability in other settings, such as relatively hyperbolic groups.  A third main component of the proposal returns to the world of quasi-isometry invariants, developing new families of filling functions that appear to make finer geometric distinctions than some of their predecessors in the literature.<br/><br/>This project belongs to a world of ideas that has a growing number of practical applications.

In mathematics these are called expanders; the first families of examples came from Cayley graphs of groups, and later it was realized that randomization over regular graphs also produces good expanders with high probability.  Expansion constants, like a host of other geometric statistics, are ""fine"" and not QI invariant.  Generally, the question of understanding the nature of an object by randomly sampling its points appears across many areas of applied mathematics, and the topics in this proposal are clustered around this theme."

The Simons Center has programs at the cutting edge of research in geometry, in theoretical physics, and in areas of overlap between the two fields. These programs bring together senior researchers, mid-career experts, and postdocs with a common interest around a topic in geometry or physics. The purpose of this project is to expose these fields to graduate students and give them access to the expertise of the assembled workers in the field. The project calls for workshops aimed specifically at graduate students with approximately 40 students being invited to each workshop. The graduate students are invited to the Center and supported during their stay, which will be either one week or two weeks. They will listen to introductory talks in the chosen area by experts in the field, and then later in the workshop by more specialized talks by other graduate students.<br/><br/>The programs at the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics bring together experts on various topics in geometry and physics to exchange ideas and to learn of the results of other workers in the field. This is one of the best ways for various workers in the field to become aware on all the latest trends and ideas in their subject. The project extends the scope of these programs by providing activities within the overall scientific framework aimed specifically at graduate students, who are not otherwise usually included in the activities. A week or two is dedicated to a workshop aimed at graduate students and approximately 40 students are invited to the Center and supported during their stay. During the workshop experts in the field give talks suitable for graduate students; also there are more specialized talks by the graduate students. This exposes the students to the field, to many of the leading researchers in the field, and to other graduate students with similar interests. This will ease their integration into the field and assist them as they launch their own research careers.<br/><br/>The URL for the first of these workshops is: http://scgp.stonybrook.edu/archives/3978"

The principal investigator proposes to use techniques such as calculus of functors, cosimplicial spaces, operads, and configuration space integrals to prove results about homology and homotopy of knots, links, homotopy links, and braids in Euclidean spaces of various dimensions.  In particular, these proposed projects include a program to describe the rational homotopy type of these spaces; to combine configuration space integrals with the theory of Milnor invariants; and to better understand, if not complete resolve, of the issue of the separation of knots and links by finite type invariants. Moreover, the principal investigator plans to unify the various ways in which operads appear in the applications of calculus of functors in knot theory and further the understanding and uses of configuration space integrals.  Some of his long-term projects will attempt to connect calculus of functors point of view in embedding theory to Khovanov homology as well as to the study of embeddings of surfaces and the mapping class group.<br/><br/>Knot and link spaces represent some of the most interesting objects of study in topology because they are easy to define and visualize and because they are of interest to physicists and chemists. Some fundamental questions about knots, such as their classification, or construction of efficient ways of telling them apart, still generate a wealth of exciting research.  The principal investigator's proposed work intends to bring us closer to answering these questions.  Furthermore, the techniques he plans to use are quite general and point to new connections between topology, geometry, combinatorics, and physics.  These connections will potentially help answer several important conjectures about the structure of knot and link spaces and introduce new points of view in algebraic topology in general."

This will be the second topology conference held in Moab, Utah.  The focus of the conference will be on geometric and quantum topology.  In recent years, these two areas have experienced increasing overlap, and topological quantum field theory predicts that many invariants in quantum topology are closely related to geometric counterparts.  For example, the volume conjecture of R. Kashaev, H. Murakami, and J. Murakami asserts that the volume of a hyperbolic knot is determined by asymptotics of colored Jones polynomials.<br/><br/>This conference will further advance the development of these subjects, as follows.  First, it will provide opportunities for those conducting cutting-edge research in both fields to present their results.  Second, to provide background and training, excellent expositors in the two areas will offer introductory talks.  And third, the conference will provide a venue for discussion and collaboration among established researchers and junior mathematicians in both fields.  Participants will include many graduate students and early career mathematicians, as well as mathematicians from underrepresented groups.

The project will focus on six areas.  The first is to give a systematic approach to topological equivariant rigidity, using tools from surgery theory, algebraic K-and L-theory, and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture.  The second is to study characteristics classes of matroid bundles (defined by Anderson and Davis) and to apply them to combinatorial incidence geometry.  The third area is to investigate a rigidity conjecture involving self-homotopy equivalences of 3-manifolds and its connections with high-dimensional topology.  The fourth area is to give the the classification, up to homeomorphism, of manifolds having the homotopy type of the total space of certain torus bundles over lens spaces. This is an application of the Farrell-Jones Conjecture.  The fifth area is to compute the L-groups of a free product of groups, and thereby solve the connected sum problem - when is a manifold which is homotopy equivalent to a connected sum itself a connected sum.  The last area is to study the algebraic and point-set topology of actions of p-groups on the torus from the point of view of homotopical group actions and Smith theory.<br/><br/>Geometric topology is the study of manifolds.  An n-dimensional manifold is a set of points locally modeled on n-dimensional Euclidean space.   For instance, a 2-manifold is a surface and looks like a plane near each point. Many physical phenomenon are represented by manifolds, and as such, understanding the global structure of a manifold, and what possible manifolds exist, is fundamental to the sciences, as well as to mathematics. Manifold theory connects with most areas of mathematics, as well as with physical phenomena such as cosmology, string theory, and classical and quantum mechanics.  To understand and classify manifold one uses a variety of tools including algebraic topology, bundle theory, and differential geometry."

This should generalize the known results of the PI with N. Reshetikhin, O. Viro, and A. Virelizier. The project will specifically address  the following problems:(1) produce a state sum construction of 3-dimensional HQFTs from spherical G-fusion G-categories; (2) introduce an appropriate notion of a G-modular G-category and give a surgery construction of a 3-dimensional HQFT  from such a category. Solutions to these problems will include   definitions of the required classes of G-categories and of the corresponding HQFTs. Finally, the PI will establish a fundamental relation   between the constructions (1) and (2) via a G-version of the Drinfeld-Joyal-Street center of categories: the HQFT obtained by construction (1) from a spherical G-fusion G-category C is equivalent to the HQFT obtained by construction (2) from the appropriately defined G-center of C.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The project develops  new   techniques in geometry arising from ideas of quantum physics.

Topological   Field Theory allows topologists to analyze the shape of geometric objects from the  microscopic viewpoint decomposing them into   small  elementary pieces.  Mathematical formulation of Topological   Field Theory given by the PI and  co-authors has   successfully led to creating   bridges between  previously unrelated areas of pure mathematics like the geometric theory of knotted strings in space on one hand, and the algebraic theory of  representations and categories on the other hand. The project  considerably enlarges the class of geometric objects   which can be analyzed using  Topological   Field Theory. We   include in consideration not only the objects themselves but also relations between them known in mathematics as maps or mappings. The principal aim of the project is to analyze the maps from the above mentioned  microscopic viewpoint and to derive corresponding notions in algebra and theory of categories. The project will introduce and develop two different solutions to this problem and   establish a subtle theorem relating  these two solutions. This project will lead to  a better understanding of geometric objects and their maps. It will  also produce new  powerful algebraic notions and techniques.

A fundamental tool in all of these problems is the momentum map, which relates the geometry and topology of a Hamiltonian system to the discrete geometry of the momentum polytope.  The PI will use this tool to create a general framework for  Lam, Schilling and Shimozono's combinatorial K-theory calculations of the affine Grassmannian.  Holm and collaborator S. Tolman will use the momentum map to enhance our understanding of the integral cohomology rings of symplectic quotients.  Together with A. Bertiger and K. Taiplae, Holm will investigate quantum invariants of symplectic quotients, with applications to combinatorics and algebraic geometry.  There are many examples of spaces endowed with group actions that are not Hamiltonian systems, but enjoy many of their topological properties.  Together with M. Harada, N. Ray and G. Williams, Holm will study invariants of orbifolds in the context of toric topology.  Holm and A. Pires will investigate the topology of toric origami manifolds.  These are classified by origami templates, whose combinatorics should provide insight into the topological invariants of the original manifolds.  Finally, Holm and Y. Karshon are writing a research monograph that will disseminate the powerful methods from equivariant symplectic geometry that have applications across mathematics to a wide audience of research mathematicians.<br/><br/>Symplectic geometry is the mathematical framework for describing phenomena in mathematical physics, from classical mechanics to string theory.

This gives rise to the study of properties of groups which are invariant up to quasi-isometry.  The primary focus of this project is to study various quasi-isometry invariants which come from ``fillings'' in geometric spaces modeling the group.  These include Dehn functions, which capture the difficulty  of filling loops with disks or other surfaces, and divergence functions, which measure the rate at which geodesics emerging from a point move away from each other.  One aspect of the project is to study these invariants and their higher dimensional analogs in a variety of classes of groups, such as non-positively curved groups, Coxeter groups and mapping class groups.  Another is to understand the relationships between different filling functions in a given group. <br/><br/>Groups are fundamental objects of study in mathematics.  A good example of a group is the collection of symmetries of an object.  The result of composing symmetries (i.e. performing them one after another) is again a symmetry.  Many groups can be specified by giving a finite presentation: a finite list of generators, and relations which indicate when two orders of composing elements give the same answer.  Naturally, it is important to understand when two presentations define the same, or similar groups, but this is not always evident by examining the presentations.  One of the themes in geometric group theory is to use geometric tools to address the question of determining whether the groups given by two presentations have the same large-scale features.  The goal of this project is to conduct a detailed study of a class of such tools called filling functions.  These investigations give us better insight into the structure of finitely presented groups."

Famous examples are calculus via Newtonian mechanics and differential geometry via Einstein's theory of general relativity. During the last twenty years, there has been a great deal of activity devoted to building a so-called string-theoretic model of the universe, which incorporates some of the most sophisticated mathematics. The subject of Gromov-Witten theory was born twenty years ago  during a period of intensive interaction between mathematics and physics.  Since then Gromov-Witten theory has established itself as a central area in both geometry and physics.  At the same time, it has expanded greatly in its scope to many diverse areas of mathematics, ranging from the classical topic of Hurwitz theory to the modern area of Donaldson-Thomas invariants (the sheaf-theoretic counterpart of Gromov-Witten theory). Despite its success, many central problems remain unsolved. Two notable examples are the computation of higer genus Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and the precise relation between Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The resolution of these problems is of great importance for geometry and physics. In this proposal, a team of the best experts in the world is assembled to attack these central problems. In addition, the PIs propose to develop technology to study a variety of questions relating Gromov-Witten theory to enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and mathematical physics.  The PIs hope to make important and substantial contributions to these areas of mathematics, and their interrelations.<br/><br/>This project is interdisciplinary in nature, in that both physical and mathematical ideas play central roles.  In this sense it adds to the current trend of interaction between mathematics and physics. This project emphasizes teamwork and collaboration.

The study of surfaces is intrinsically interesting, but is also responsible for the creation of entire fields of mathematics, shaping the way people solve problems. Three-dimensional topology - the study of three-dimensional spaces like our physical universe - has been profoundly impacted by developments in the study of surfaces. This may not seem surprising since a surface is a two-dimensional space, and one might expect a three-dimensional space to enjoy some of the same properties.   While it is true that direct analogies in the situations have produced some interesting results, it is the use of surfaces as building blocks for understanding three-manifolds (the three-dimensional spaces) which has most significantly shaped the field.  One important aspect of this project is the strategy of ""reversing the flow of information"" by (1) applying new technology developed to study three-manifolds into the theory of surfaces, rather than vice-versa, and (2) exploring the subtle effects the geometry of three-manifolds imposes on the geometry of the surfaces used to construct them."

The title refers to the intersection between string theory, number theory, and homotopy theory which began with the study of elliptic cohomology in the 1980s.  In the last ten years the areas of significant progress have broadened considerably, involving many new research topics.  For example, Behrens and Lawson have introduced generalizations of topological modular forms, using the Shimura varieties which play an important role in the Langlands conjecture. For another, the spectacular progress in higher category has led to a much better understanding of quantum field theory and the String 2-group, which are intimately but still mysteriously related to the geometry of elliptic cohomology. The conference will bring together researchers and graduate students working in these areas, to facilitate the sharing of results, the establishment of new collaborations, and the training of the next generation of researchers in this area.   <br/><br/>The roots of the fields which this conference brings together--String theory, number theory, and algebraic topology--are far apart, and their interaction via elliptic cohomology has, in the best tradition of interdisciplinary research, led to spectacular advances in algebraic topology in the last twenty-five years.  One of the appealing features of the subject is that it consistently attracts excellent new researchers from different areas of mathematics and physics, and those new researchers bring exciting new points of view. In the last five years, some of the exciting emerging research teams are based in Europe.  The conference will bring together current leaders and new researchers, enabling interaction and cross-fertilization of ideas among a broad group of mathematicians.

The main theme present in the PI's research is how analysis on a suitably defined boundary at infinity can be used to answer questions about the large scale geometry of certain groups. While the PI plans to study traditional boundaries of hyperbolic groups the main focus of this proposal is on boundaries of solvable groups. One of the main tool used by the PI is recent work of Eskin-Fisher-Whyte and Peng on the structure of quasi-isometries of certain solvable groups. By studying boundaries of these groups the PI has contributed to and hopes to expand the understanding of quasi-isometries between solvable groups as well as lattice envelopes of these groups. More importantly the PI has been able to contribute to basic questions raised by the Gromov program. In particular, the PI has providing counter examples to demonstrate the distinction between quasi-isometric and bilipschitz equivalence. This is a little understood distinction that the PI plans to explore.<br/><br/>Quasi-isometries provide a notion of similarity between mathematical spaces when viewed from a far away distance. A useful analogy is to imagine that two forests composed of different trees will look like indistinguishable green regions when viewed from a satellite. Alternatively, one can visualize the `large scale structure' of a space by placing the viewer inside the (infinite) space and viewing the 'boundary' at infinity. This is much like a viewer gazing out to the horizon. It is these two perspectives and their interplay that are at the core of this proposal. Both notions have been fruitful recently in the study of problems in many areas of mathematics but particularly when the mathematical spaces arise from algebraic objects (finitely generated groups). The PI's research focuses on how restricting to specific quasi-isometries can change the notion of similarity between finitely generated groups as well as how comparing boundaries of spaces can be used to show two groups are similar."

(Roughly, Heegaard Floer homology forms a (3+1)-dimensional topological field theory, and bordered Heegaard Floer homology is a (2+1+1)-dimensional extension of this field theory.)  This project seeks to further develop bordered Heegaard Floer homology.

If you start with a knotted circle K, it may or may not be possible to slice space into a family of surfaces with boundary on K.  So, it is natural to ask:  for which knots K is there such a family of surfaces?  Knots for which there is such a family are called ""fibered knots"", and finding ways to tell if a knot is fibered turns out to be both interesting and hard.  Surprisingly, some of the most effective tools for answering this kind of question are closely related to ideas from modern mathematical physics, quantum field theory, and string theory, and have applications not just to 3-dimensional questions but also to 4-dimensional ones.  A family of invariants called Heegaard Floer homology is one such tool.  This project seeks to further understand the structure of Heegaard Floer homology, with the goals of developing ways to compute it more efficiently and finding other related tools adapted to different problems."

This collaborative work over the last three years has already resulted in two preprints, where such a transfer has already been constructed and a basic framework for subsequent work established. The goal of the present research proposal is to explore applications of this transfer to motivic cohomology and algebraic K-theory with finite coefficients with several such applications expected. The corresponding classical notions in algebraic topology have played a key role in settling important problems like the Adams? conjecture, where the use of the transfer provided a sophisticated version of the splitting principle. A leading theme of the proposed research is that other more sophisticated applications of the same principle accounts for several of the deeper results in algebraic K-theory: for example, the reduction of Thomason's well-known result on cohomological descent for mod-l algebraic K-theory with the Bott-element inverted to Hilbert's theorem 90, and the reduction of rigidity properties of mod-l algebraic K-theory to Picard groups. However, in the absence of an analogue of the Becker-Gottlieb transfer, these reductions have been rather long and difficult, requiring the development of customized elaborate machinery. There are also currently several open problems to which similar techniques seem to apply: for example, Carlsson's conjectures relating the algebraic K-theory of fields with certain equivariant K-groups associated to the Galois group of the field and also several open questions on the motivic cohomology of the classifying spaces of algebraic groups.<br/><br/>Motivic cohomology and motivic homotopy theory are relatively new applications of well-established techniques from algebraic topology to algebraic geometry. Classically cohomology and homotopy methods are used to distinguish between topological spaces and to analyze their properties. Algebraic geometry, on the other hand, deals with special spaces arising as zeroes of polynomial equations. It is only in recent years, after the solution of an open problem called the Milnor conjecture using homotopy methods that the relevance and usefulness of such techniques in algebraic geometry have come to light. Considering that the Becker-Gottlieb transfer is one of the most versatile tools in algebraic topology, it is reasonable to expect much progress using a variant of it in the motivic context. The importance and relevance of this project stems from these observations."

The first  problem involves a new geometric criterion for when a Coxeter group is a Kleinian group. Specifically, if the defining graph of a right-angled Coxeter group can be realized as the 1-skeleton of an acute triangulation of the 2-sphere, is the Coxeter group hyperbolic?  This relates the techniques of geometric group theory and classical 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry to combinatorial problems concerning triangulations. As part of this study, the PI will investigate the moduli space of an acute triangulation of the 2-sphere.  In particular, is this space connected?  A second question asks when a group generated by reflections in hyperbolic 3-space contains a knot group.   This is deeply related to understanding commensurability of knot complements. More broadly, the PI seeks to address the conjecture that there are at most three hyperbolic knot complements in any given commensurability class.  Boileau, Boyer, Cebanu, and the PI have made significant progress on the conjecture in recent work, and this project aims to address the remaining case.  In a third project, the PI seeks a CAT(0) space for the group of outer automorphisms of the free product of four copies of the integers mod 2.  This group of outer automorphisms is particularly pleasing and related to the proposal as it is generated by involutions.<br/><br/>Groups generated by involutions have long been guiding examples in furthering the understanding of the geometry of groups.  They are inherently geometric and relevant to the modern theory of orbifolds. These groups have been studied in various ways by Coxeter, Thurston, Davis, and Moussong, as well as by many other celebrated mathematicians, and they continue to inform current research. Imposing some condition, such as the presence of a reflection, allows one to gain traction on a difficult problem and eventually see the whole picture.   The projects proposed here have potential impact in other fields.  For example, the study of triangulations, particularly acute triangulations, is important in computer-aided design and scientific computing."

For example, Haken solved many important problems by building hierarchies of incompressible surfaces that decompose large classes of 3-manifolds into balls. Casson and Gordon introduced the idea of strongly irreducible surfaces to study Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds. This proposal concerns the further development and application of the PI's theory of topologically minimal surfaces, which generalize both incompressible and strongly irreducible surfaces. Such surfaces have been used by the PI to solve several long standing conjectures, ""Gordon's Conjecture"" and the ""Stabilization Conjecture."" The specific goals of this proposal are to: (1) Further explore the relationships between topologically minimal, PL minimal, and geometrically minimal surfaces; (2) Use topologically minimal surfaces to explore what happens to the set of Heegaard surfaces under Dehn filling; and (3) Understand the behavior of topologically minimal surfaces under finite coverings.<br/><br/>Just as the surface of the Earth seems like a plane to those confined to local observations, a 3-manifold is an object that is locally indistinguishable from 3-dimensional Euclidean space, such as our universe. A classical way to study 3-manifolds is to utilize surfaces they contain that are non-trivial in some suitable sense. ""Topological minimality"" is a very general notion of non-triviality for such surfaces that was introduced by the PI to solve several problems in topology. These surfaces are the analogue of more classical objects, the so-called ""geometrically minimal"" surfaces. Familiar examples of such surfaces include soap films. Conjecturally, topologically minimal surfaces have all of the same properties as geometrically minimal surfaces. The goal of the present work is to elucidate those properties that are shared by these two kinds of surfaces."

Most of the projects in the proposal are interdisciplinary in nature, and will likely require solutions that involve a mix of techniques from various different fields (differential and metric geometry, algebraic and differential topology, etc.). The PI's projects loosely fall into three broad categories: 1. Topology of CAT(0)-manifolds (and more generally, of aspherical manifolds): the PI plans on focusing on the distinction, for manifolds, between Riemannian non-positive curvature and metric non-positive curvature. The PI also proposes some homological criterion for finding lattice subgroups. Another project involves studying some new examples of aspherical manifolds. 2. Riemannian geometry: the PI plans on exploring manifolds of non-positive curvature from the viewpoint of Riemannian geometry. This includes studying the distribution of lengths of geodesics (arithmetic progressions), constructing new phenomena in spectral theory (can one hear the Hauptvermutung?), and studying the structure of almost non-positively curved manifolds. 3. Algebraic K-theory: the PI plans on continuing his research on computational aspects of algebraic K-theory in the presence of non-positive curvature. Some concrete goals include establishing the Farrell-Jones Isomorphism conjecture for classical Kleinian groups, constructing ""small"" models for classifying spaces for mapping class groups, and finding efficient algorithms for computing the lower algebraic K-theory of 3-orbifold groups.<br/><br/>Geometry is usually focused on understanding objects quantitatively. Topology is focused on understanding objects qualitatively. For example, a sphere and an ellipsoid are quantitatively different: the sphere contains a point (the center) through which all ""slices"" are identical, while an ellipsoid contains no such point. But qualitatively they are the same: one can ""squish"" an ellipsoid and turn it into a sphere (without puncturing or tearing). In contrast, a sphere and a donut are qualitatively different; the donut has a ""hole"", and you cannot turn a sphere into a donut without puncturing. The projects in this proposal study the relationship between geometry and topology. In other words, how do qualitative properties of a space constrain (and in turn, are constrained by) the quantitative properties of the space."

Another project is to study transitions between different homogenous structures within the setting of projective structures.

This  arose from the study of perspective developed by artists in the Renaissance and is based on the notion of straight line but without a notion of distance. This geometry is useful in computer graphics. Freeing oneself from length and distance introduces added flexibility.

It allows one to measure and compare groups on a large scale and has numerous applications in geometry, topology, analysis, probability, dynamics and other areas of mathematics. The growth of a group can be polynomial, exponential or intermediate between polynomial and exponential. The class of groups of intermediate growth is mysterious. Milnor's question as to whether this class is empty was open for more than 15 years. In 1983 the PI constructed uncountably many groups of intermediate growth with different types of growth. This led to the first construction of uncountably many quasi-isometry classes of 2-generated groups and gave the first explicit construction of a Cantor subset in the space of marked groups. Despite these successes in the study of groups of intermediate growth, there are still many fundamental open problems. The main open problems include: the question about the existence of finitely presented groups of intermediate growth, and the question (Gap Conjecture) about the size of  the ""gap"" between polynomial growth and intermediate growth. Among other important problems are the questions about the existence of hereditary just-infinite groups and of simple groups of intermediate growth. This proposal addresses these and other related questions. The PI has a reduction of the Gap Conjecture to  just-infinite groups, which includes the consideration of the above two classes and the class of branch groups. Techniques include  group actions on rooted trees and the methods of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>Growth of finitely generated groups is related with the theory of random walks, the geometry of fractals, crystals and quasi-crystals, coding theory, formal languages, dynamics of finite automata and cellular automata, modeling of communication networks, Kolmogorov complexity and many other topics. Results obtained as a part of the current research have potential implications for these areas, and for the scientific and technological understanding of communication networks, cryptography, and transportation systems. Schreier graphs and fractals constructed on the basis of self-similar groups of intermediate growth may be relevant for our understanding of some processes studied in biology, chemistry and demographic studies. Algorithms arising from the study of groups of intermediate growth are different from those used before, and have applications in science and technology.  In mathematics, the notion of growth is important not only for Geometric Group Theory, but also for Operator Algebras, Topology, Geometry, Dynamical Systems, Functional Analysis, Probability Theory, Discrete Mathematics, Differential Equations and other fields. The subject of growth is very suitable for graduate and even undergraduate courses, since it touches on many relevant topics in modern mathematics. The PI will disseminate the results of this research through peer reviewed publication and by giving seminar and colloquium talks, invited lectures and presentations to various types of audiences both domestically and internationally."

Furthermore, groups appear as symmetries of geometric objects of physical nature, from elementary particles to the entire universe (treated as a geometric object). Algebra (group theory) allows one to encode the underlying symmetries, and, conversely, geometry allows one to approach successfully purely algebraic problems. One of the examples of such interaction  of seemingly different mathematical fields is project (3), which aims to apply groups of symmetries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space to complex-algebraic geometry (the latter deals with geometry of solution spaces of systems of polynomial equations with complex variables)."

In particular, given a one-parametric monotone (increasing) definable family of subsets of a definable compact K, the goal is to construct a definable triangulation of K such that, inside each simplex of the triangulation, the family is equivalent to one of the ""standard"" families, classified by lex-monotone Boolean functions. Other classical geometric constructions that can be extended to definable families include cylindrical cell decomposition and Whitney stratification. Existence of such geometric constructions would allow one to investigate the ""fine structure"" of a definable family, and to compute its topological invariants, such as vanishing homology, intersection homology and the homotopy type of its Hausdorff limit. A monotone one-parametric definable family can be alternatively viewed as the family of sub-level sets of a definable function, so the proposed research can be viewed as a topological resolution of singularities of definable functions. The original motivation for the proposed research comes from the theory of approximation of definable sets by homotopy equivalent definable families of compact sets developed by Gabrielov and Vorobjov. Triangulation of a definable family would provide a crucial tool for the proof of the main conjecture of that theory.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The proposed research would substantially enhance our understanding of geometry, topology and combinatorics of the sets definable in an o-minimal structure, and of the families of such sets. It suggests a new approach to the resolution of singularities of definable functions. The expected results would be new even for real semi-algebraic sets, the most basic (and the most important in applications) of all o-minimal structures. The proposed research will have impact in several different areas of pure and applied mathematics. Firstly, it will introduce fundamental new tools in the areas of real algebraic and o-minimal geometry, which will have direct impact in the the study of geometric and topological properties of definable sets in arbitrary o-minimal structure, including topological resolution of singularities in this context. It will also potentially have impact in certain areas of currently active interest in algebraic geometry and topological combinatorics. Finally, it is very likely the theory of semi-monotone sets and monotone maps will find applications in the extremely active areas of discrete and computational geometry (around the theory of persistent homology), as well as in control theory and dynamical systems.  One such application  to ""toric cubes"" emerged recently. These semi-algebraic sets which are related to edge-product sets in phylogenetics  are closures of graphs of monotone maps, thus they are topologically closed balls. At a higher level, the proposed research will bring ideas and techniques developed originally in the context of o-minimal geometry, to currently important problems in several other areas - in particular, algebraic geometry, discrete and computational geometry and control theory."

Now a family of six-dimensional quantum field theories is emerging as an object of acute mathematical interest.  This Focused Research Group brings together researchers working in diverse parts of mathematics and physics to study these theories.  They originally arose as limits of string theories and are usually called 'superconformal (2,0)-theories' to call attention to their symmetries.  The simpler appellation 'Theory X' emphasizes how little is known.  The projects undertaken here have two overall goals.  First, we will make inroads on the structure of Theory X by applying the detailed and profound mathematical understanding of topological and conformal quantum field theories obtained over the past 25 years.  Second, we will use expected properties of Theory X and its compactifications to lower dimensions to deduce new conjectures and new organizing principles in geometric representation theory.  The rapidly developing web of interactions between the six-dimensional quantum Theory X and a host of central topics in twenty-first century geometry, topology, and geometric representation theory indicates that we are seeing the beginnings of a new revolution, one in which Theory X plays the dominant physical role. Progress towards unraveling its structure and its consequences will have broad ramifications.<br/><br/>Physics has long fueled developments in mathematics, and the past 30 years have been a particularly fruitful period.  The depth of mathematics which enters fundamental physical theories has steadily intensified, and at the same time the structure and predictions of these theories have had increasingly profound impacts on mathematics.  This project is one of many efforts to mine this intellectually fertile mix of ideas.  Our pursuit of Theory X will inevitably illuminate a much broader circle of ideas and contribute to the mathematical understanding of contemporary physics.  The work of past generations at the mathematics-physics interface fuels the modern world: our computers, GPS systems, transportation, sophisticated medical tools, and much more owe their existence to basic research in this area which stretches back well over a century.  While we cannot predict how current basic research will impact the future, we can say with certainty that the effect will be far-reaching."

Many special cases of this duality are well-understood, but what links them remains to be investigated. This research is also tied up in the exploration of individual examples of these singularities; in these our proposal would be a ""geometrification"" and ""categorification"" of well-known dualities in mathematics, such as Schur-Weyl duality, rank-level duality and Gale duality. Our perspective also provides a fruitful approach to topics as diverse as the representation theory of symplectic reflection algebras and the Rouquier-Khovanov-Lauda categorification of quantum groups, and has applications as far afield as low-dimensional topology. <br/><br/>One of the most shocking discoveries of the 20th century was the discovery of quantum mechanics, and the introduction of non-commuting observables into physics.

The PI's work is about the relationships between the geometry of classical limits of noncommutative spaces on one hand, and state spaces that could describe related physical systems on the other.  The PI further proposes an educational component which creates a website platform for mathematical exposition, based on Wordpress.

Since it's introduction roughly a decade ago, Heegaard Floer theory has revolutionized the study of knots, 3-manifolds and smooth 4-manifolds.

Specifically, the principle investigator aims to develop obstructions to contact structures having support genus one and to find lower bounds for the binding number.  Finally, the project seeks to broaden our understanding of Legendrian and transverse knot theory.  To accomplish this, the principle investigator aims to develop new Legendrian and transverse invariants and to apply these and other known invariants to classify Legendrian and transverse representatives in a broad class of knot types.<br/><br/>The principle investigator seeks to broaden our understanding of 3 and 4-dimensional spaces by studying geometric objects called contact structures.

The second project is to count ""virtual immersions"" of a geometrically finite open 3-manifold into a closed hyperbolic 3- or 4-manifold, with an aim toward assembling these virtual immersions into a virtual immersion of a more complex 3-manifold (and inductively counting the number of such immersions).

Recent results including the work of the proposer have made it possible to classify three-dimensional manifolds as well; this classification is made possible by finding two-dimensional objects within the three-dimensional manifold that divides it in such a way as to elucidate its structure.

Jones conjecture states that the algebraic K-theory of the integral group ring ZG comes from the algebraic K-theory of the virtually cyclic subgroups of G. This conjecture has been proven for large classes of groups, and leads to very concrete calculations. The proposed research will use this conjecture to compute the lower algebraic K-groups of the following groups among others: hyperbolic n-simplex reflection groups, hyperbolic reflection groups, three-dimensional and four-dimensional crystallographic groups, Bianchi groups, Hilbert modular groups, and three-dimensional orbifold groups. We also intend to get some preliminary results on the lower algebraic K-theory mapping class groups (for these groups the Farrell-Jones Conjecture is still open).

In topology, surgery theory is the name given to a collection of techniques used to produce one manifold from another in a controlled fashion. Surgery refers to cutting out parts of the manifold and replacing it with a part of another manifold, matching up along the cut or boundary. With the development of this theory in the 1960's, many problems in high dimensional topology, in particular the classification of high dimensional manifolds, were found to have obstructions in (and were often classified by) the algebraic K-theory of the integral group ring of the fundamental group G of the manifold being studied. As such, it is of great interest to obtain  explicit computations of these K groups for various groups G."

Understanding and bounding how simple closed curves on a surface can project to subsurfaces provides tools to construct models for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, classify Weil-Petersson geodesics, and elucidate the fine topological structure in boundaries of deformation spaces. Indeed, the existence and uniqueness of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds gives little information about their geometric features and their connection to topological properties of the manifold.  Through his expansion of the use of the bi-Lipschitz Model Theorem (of the PI with Canary and Minsky), the PI will explore geometric models for arbitrary closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds and connect their structure to combinatorial features of the manifold.  This ongoing project with collaborators Minsky, Namazi and Souto will produce explicit models for Heegaard splittings, and a new weak geometrization for 3-manifolds arising as infinite gluings with bounded combinatorics.  Further, the PI will apply coarse methods in the study of the mapping class group via the curve complex and its associated ""hierarchy paths"" to understand the large scale structure of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmueller space, a fundamental object whose large scale geometry remains mysterious despite many investigations.  Finally, the PI will exhibit further features of the deformation space of a hyperbolic 3-manifold, generalizing our study of the local topology of deformation spaces with Bromberg, Canary, and Minsky, and undertaking generalized studies of central compactness theorems for deformation spaces in the context of the curve complex.<br/><br/>In mathematics, the study of dynamical systems seeks to describe chaotic phenomena in simple terms.  Sometimes dynamical systems can exhibit a kind of rigidity, where a small tweak or perturbation does not affect the long term behavior of the system.  In the context of understanding our own three-dimesnsional universe and what kind of structures three-dimensional spaces can have, structures give rise to these rigid dynamical systems.  The recent work of Grisha Perelman solving the famous Poincare Conjecture has ensured this study applies to virtually all three-dimensional spaces.  When a space is rigid, one can understand it completely via ""coarse"" information, via so-called ""models.""  In a recent result of the PI with R. Canary and Y. Minsky, such models were used to classify all constantly negatively curved, or ""hyperbolic"" three-dimensional spaces of infinite volume that are tame in a certain sense.  The classification result solved a long-standing conjecture of William Thurston, and opened the door to developing a more detailed and complete picture of geometries on manifolds previously considered understood. The groundwork is in place for a fundamental investigation of algebraic and topological properties of all spaces of 3-dimensions and how these properties interrelate."

Examples of the former are high-dimensional topologists and examples of the latter are geometric group theorists and differential geometers.<br/><br/>Topology is often described as ""rubber geometry"": spaces are considered the same if one can be deformed into another via stretching and compressing (but without tearing or puncturing). A basic problem is to decide whether two spaces can be deformed into each other. The primary method for doing this is to develop ways to assign computable invariants to the space: if two spaces can be deformed into each other, then the associated invariants have to coincide. And conversely, if two spaces have different invariants, then they cannot be deformed into each other. An example of such invariants are the homotopy groups of a space. One can then ask whether the homotopy groups are good enough invariants to determine spaces. In other words, if if we have two spaces whose homotopy groups are the same, can they be deformed into each other? One of the central conjectures in topology is the Borel Conjecture, which predicts that for a certain class of spaces, the answer to the previous question is ""yes"". This problem has been central to high-dimensional topology, and work on it has involved sophisticated techniques from areas as diverse as algebra, geometry, and dynamics.
