To this end the                     investigator plans to study new invariants of homology 3-spheres                and their relationship with 4-dimensional topology.  These                      invariants include Floer homology, the invariant ""R"" of the                     investigator and R. Stern, and a new invariant related to both of               these.  He hopes to be able to compute the Floer homology of all                Seifert fibered homology spheres and to relate the results to the               other invariants mentioned.  These invariants should be useful                  tools.  Furthermore, there is some reason to believe these                      techniques can be extended beyond the realm of Seifert fibrations."

On the most basic level,              tools from (finite) group theory have been used to construct                    topological tools:  Steenrod squares, characteristic classes,                   spaces with A(n)-free cohomology, etc.  On a more subtle level,                 many basic topological structures seem to be determined by group                theoretic structures - for example, infinite loop space structures              are determined by the combinatorics of the symmetric groups, and                the theorem of Atiyah that calculates K(BG), says that group theory             determines this ring.

In particular, in his ongoing                           collaboration with M. Hopkins and D. Ravenel, a combination of                  group theory, equivariant homotopy, and number theory is being                  used to gain greater understanding of the ""geometry"" underlying                 complex oriented cohomology theories.  These include, in                        particular, the Morava K-theories - known by the work of E.                     Devinatz, Hopkins, and J. Smith to be of central importance in                  stable homotopy theory."

It has been conjectured by W.                          Thurston that all 3-manifolds can be decomposed into                            components, each of which has one of eight geometries.  He                      has already proven this conjecture for large classes of 3-                      manifolds.  A complete classification of the 3-manifolds with                   seven of those geometries has already been completed.  The                      largest and richest case corresponds to those manifolds with                    the eighth geometry, namely hyperbolic geometry.                                     A hyperbolic 3-manifold has a well-defined volume, which                   is an invariant for the topology of the manifold.  The set of                   volumes of all finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds is a                        well-ordered subset of the reals.  Hence it is of interest to                   determine some of the hyperbolic manifolds of low volume, a                     problem suggested by Thurston.                                                       A noncompact hyperbolic 3-manifold has additional                          invariants called cusp volumes.  They offer a means of                          determining manifolds of low volume.  This idea has already                     been utilized by the investigator to determine the smallest                     hyperbolic manifolds of one or two cusps.

It clarifies some                 points about how theta-functions transform, and most                            interestingly of all, reveals hitherto unsuspected connections                  between geometry/topology (in the guise of holonomy/Rochlin                     invariants) and theta-functions, and raises interesting new                     questions about the latter.  (The project represents a                          continuation of a long-running research program, much of it joint               work with other mathematicians.)"

Furthermore, the techniques involved are quite effective,                  and the investigators hope to be able to use existing software to               implement algorithms to determine the shape and the topology of                 complex analytic singularities."

He will continue               work on the dynamics of free group automorphisms, with questions                concerning the fixed subgroup as one of the intended realms of                  application.  In addition, the question of whether a certain                    ""Teichmuller space"" for the outer automorphism group is simply                  connected at infinity will be investigated.  Finally (with lowest               priority) a question about free products modulo a single relator                will be studied."

On a purely geometrical front, he will pursue the question as to whether crossing-number of links is additive with respect to connected sum."

There is a highly developed, essentially combinatorial, theory of conformal classes of punctured Riemann surfaces. Some recent work at once suggests new approaches to old problems in the Teichmuller theory and in the theory of the mapping class group. Furthermore, there is a great deal of interplay between these new results and several central problems in the string theory of high energy physics. This second interface should probably be regarded as one of co- development rather than one of application."

These classification questions all involve extracting geometric information from algebraic information about the manifolds or group actions in question."

Buechler's research project is in stability theory, a subfield of model theory. In recent years several general model- theoretic problems have been systematically approached via the stability hierarchy. Even though the problem itself may not involve stability-theoretic notions, considering separately the cases: omega-stable, superstable, etc., brings into play a mass of technical machinery. Such is the case with Vaught's conjecture, which was proved by Shelah for omega-stable theories. The next step is to consider all superstable theories, but this has proven to be too difficult. Buechler will approach this problem by separating the superstable theories according to their ""geometrical"" properties. The first case to consider is when the universe has Shelah rank 1. Buechler has already made progress on this problem."

The methods of logic are necessary because many fundamental questions of point set topology cannot be answered within the usual axioms of set theory. In other words, certain statements are neither provable nor refutable without appealing to extra axioms. Fleissner intends to use methods of set theory, especially forcing, large cardinals, and the structure of Godel's constructible universe, to prove theorems and create counterexamples in the theory of topology, and related areas of combinatorics and Boolean algebras."

There are many ways to construct examples of 3-manifolds, but the simplest sorts of questions about the constructed manifolds often cannot be answered. For example, it is very difficult to tell whether two construction schemes yield the same or different manifolds. What is needed is a computable collection of invariants which distill the vast amount of information contained in the three-manifold into a useable form. The standard invariants, Euler characteristic, homology, fundamental group, either contain almost no information or are very difficult to work with. Hyperbolic 3-manifolds are the most important and most complicated class of geometric 3-manifolds. The hyperbolic structures on these manifolds can be used to describe such invariants as the Chern-Simons invariant, the volume, and the eta-invariant. By Mostow's theorem, these geometric invariants are actually topological invariants, at least in the closed case. Recent research indicates that these invariants may be very useful in helping us to understand 3-manifolds. This project mounts a multi-sided attack on understanding these invariants."
