More generally, the PI will investigate the Johnson filtration, which is a sequence of subgroups of the mapping class group starting with the Torelli group.  A major open question is whether or not Torelli groups are finitely presented or not.  The Pi would also like to understand how pseudo-Anosov dilatations are distributed among the terms of the Johnson filtration. Finally, the PI aims to find generating sets for terms of the Johnson filtration and related groups.<br/><br/>The mapping class group describes the symmetries of surfaces, or two-dimensional objects which are analogous to the three-dimensional space we live in.  The set of symmetries of an object is often most easily understood by using matrices.  In the case of the mapping class group, there is a natural way to use matrices to understand a large piece of the picture, but there is also a large amount of information that escapes detection by these matrices.  It is this mysterious part of the mapping class groups that the PI is studying.<br/><br/>"

It is this correspondence between two classically studied, fundamentally important, objects that the PIs propose to study.  Since positive stabilization of surface automorphisms generates an almost intractable equivalence relation, it is important to discern the properties of a contact structure from just a single representative automorphism.  An example of such a result is the fact that automorphisms which are compositions of positive Dehn twists induce contact structures that are Stein fillable, i.e. that arise as natural boundaries of Stein manifolds. We are working to understand questions like: what property of an automorphism guarantees symplectic fillability, what property implies existence of Giroux torsion. Investigating these questions will have applications to the study of contact invariants in Heegaard-Floer homology theory in both the bounded and unbounded cases.<br/><br/><br/>Contact topology or geometry and its even dimensional counterparts, symplectic topology or geometry, were born out of the study of questions arising in classical mechanics and thermodynamics. Three-dimensional manifolds are mathematical objects modeled on the space in which we live.  Contact structures on such spaces arise naturally in the study of fluid flows as the family of planes perpendicular to the flow. A familiar example of a contact structure occurs in the design of DLP front projection televisions where they dictate the use of literally millions of tiny mirrors rather than one large curved mirror.  Considerable progress has been made in the last several decades on the three-dimensional contact topology and four-dimensional symplectic topology.  Recent progress has allowed researchers to apply two-dimensional techniques to the inherently three-dimensional study of contact topology.<br/>"

In this direction a basic question is whether any topological simply connected 4-manifold which admits a smooth structure in fact admits infinitely many. This proposal suggests a technique called 'reverse engineering' which can be used to attack this problem. Many, perhaps all, of the examples of infinite families of pairwise nondiffeomorphic but homeomorphic simply connected 4-manifolds can be recast as examples of reverse engineering. In recent years there have been exciting developments in producing new examples of smooth simply connected 4-manifolds with b^+=1, and a main goal of this proposal is to use reverse engineering to find even better examples. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop more systematic constructions of smooth 4-manifolds with the hope that a general picture begins to emerge that will suggest a classification scheme.<br/><br/>The broader impact of this proposal will address the relationship between mathematics and theoretical physics, opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in topology, and career development of postdoctoral fellows. Four-dimensional geometry and topology has very close ties to physics. For example, the proposer will study geography problems for symplectic manifolds which have been shown to impact physics via the notion of 'superconformal simple type'. Any general results concerning Seiberg-Witten theory hold the prospect of engendering interaction with the physics community, and this will be a basic concern. Another basic goal of this is to address 'pipeline issues' in mathematics. Our approach is to to get students and young mathematicians working on interesting problems. A key aspect of this proposal is the development of problems which are accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students. It presents problems which will be suitable thesis problems for students and  research projects for postdoctoral fellows at Michigan State. It also discusses computational problems which are suitable for advanced undergraduate students.<br/>"

The first is joint work with John Franks.  One question that we address is : for which elements of the diffeomorphism group of  a surface does the centralizer  have a finite index subgroup with a global fixed point.  This relates directly to understanding  which subgroups of the mapping class group can act faithfully on a surface by diffeomorphisms.     We are also looking for an analog in the group of area preserving  homeomorphisms of the disk, of the Calabi invariant, which is defined for area preserving diffeomorphisms of the disk.    The goal of the second project, which is a collaboration with Mark Feighn,  is to solve the conjugacy problem for the group of outer automorphisms of a free group.      The third project continues joint work with Lee Mosher.    One of our goals is to  show that an infinite subgroup of the outer automorphism group  of a free group is either reducible or contains a fully irreducible element.  Another is to show that the complex of free splittings of the free group is hyperbolic.  <br/><br/><br/>     The mapping class group of a surface, the diffeomorphism group of a surface and the outer automorphism group of the free group are related in fundamental ways.  Classification theorems for elements of the mapping class group yield information about the algebraic properties of subgroups of the diffeomorphism group and so yield restrictions on the kinds of groups that can act on surfaces and on the ways in which groups can act.  One of the main motivations for studying the outer automorphism group of the free group is its very close connection to mapping class groups.  One part of the proposal focuses on finding global fixed points for subgroups of diffeomorphisms acting on a surface; i.e. points that are stationary for every element of the subgroup.  Another is to understand actions of the mapping class group of a surface on that surface.   Other parts of the proposal seek to generalize known important results about the mapping class group to the outer automorphism  groupof the free group.  Among these results are the conjugacy problem and a subgroup dichotomy.   The former asks for an algorithm to decide if two elements differ only by a change of coordinates and the latter is the analogue for subgroups  of a basic classification theorem for individual elements.    <br/>"

The next step in the project will be to translate more general structures from open string topology to contact geometry, thereby formulating a  relative version of symplectic field theory as a generalization of Legendrian contact homology. Via this conormal construction, the investigator plans to use the homology to study smooth submanifolds, such as knots, in Euclidean or projective space.

The relationship between holomorphic curves and gradient flow trees should facilitate many of the project's computations.<br/><br/>Contact geometry makes many appearances in physics, from optics to thermodynamics to classical mechanics. For example, particles obeying the Least Action Principal from mechanics translate into objects in contact geometry (or its closely related field, symplectic geometry) known as holomorphic curves.

Specifically, studying these holomorphic curves have led to some powerful and sometimes surprising discoveries about contact rigidity and contact dynamics. In the last couple of years, an active area of research has evolved around applying these holomorphic curves towards studying unresolved problems in three and four-dimensional topology. As stated, these problems in low-dimensional topology seem to have nothing to do with holomorphic curves. Yet, the techniques from recent results have firmly established a connection. The Principal Investigator plans to further study the effectiveness of holomorphic curves, with an emphasis on connecting it to the theory of topological knots in three dimensions.<br/><br/><br/>"

This project involves extending this to obtain further information about the mapping class group, for example, investigating whether random walks on this group make linear progress in the complex of curves. Such results may have applications to the study of 3-manifolds, as every 3-manifold has a Heegaard splitting, determined by a gluing map, which is an element of the mapping class group. One aim of this project is to show that the volume of the resulting manifold grows linearly with the length of the random walk.

One problem involves completing the classification problem for proper affine actions, a basic problem in geometry whose history stretches back to the classification of Euclidean crystallographic groups in the early 20th century. In the last 25 years, the classification in 3 dimensions has been reduced to a problem in 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. Another side of this general problem stems from the observation that deformation spaces of geometric structures are themselves locally modeled on representation spaces of fundamental groups. This naturally leads to dynamical questions on actions of mapping class groups. Moduli spaces of surface group representations  support invariant Poisson structures, as well as finer structures depending on a conformal structure. The dependence of these as the Riemann surface varies over Teichmueller space is crucial to understanding dynamics of surface group representations.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the relation between topology and geometry. While topology concerns the loose qualitative organization of patterns of points, geometry concerns quantitative measurements such as distance, angle and area. These two viewpoints are compared through symmetries, leading to algebraic calculations involving groups. The Experimental Geometry Lab has been a center for the PI and his students and collaborators (at all levels) to develop tools for these calculations and visualization. Many of the above projects have an experimental component and the PI will continue to work with students (from high school to postdocs) to develop user-friendly software to assist in their investigation and dissemination.<br/>"

Link homology theories can be though of as four-dimensional topological quantum field theories, restricted to links in the 3-space and link cobordisms. Applications of link homology include a combinatorial proof of the Milnor conjecture, efficient estimates of the Thurston-Bennequin invariant of knots, and nonexistence of taut foliations on many double branched covers of knots.

From the very beginning, algebra played an important role in distinguishing links and manifolds, since algebraic objects are in general easier to compare to each other than geometric ones. Categorification, also known as link homology, is a procedure of replacing a known link invariant with a family of algebraic objects that significantly enhance the original invariant. This procedure was recently developed by the lead principal investigator, who found categorifications of several polynomial invariants of links. These categorifications are relatively easy to describe, but rather challenging to compute for a given link. The aim of this project is to better understand existing link homology theories and their interrelations, as well as to find new ones. The principal investigators also plan to write efficient programs for computing link homology. Link homology is a young and quickly growing field. It lies on the crossroads of research in 3- and 4-dimensional topology, symplectic topology, homological algebra, and representation theory.

They encompass hyperbolic groups, the fundamental groups of geometrically finite hyperbolic manifolds, free products and limit groups (also known as `fully residually free groups'), and thus are directly related to combinatorial and geometric group theory, to hyperbolic geometry, to topology and to logic.  The purpose of this project is to examine some of the logical aspects of relatively hyperbolic groups.  The elementary theory of a group consists of those first order sentences which are true in the group.  This is an interesting and powerful invariant of a group, the study of which is still at an early stage.  This project will answer questions about the elementary theory of relatively hyperbolic groups, and also what can be said about a group with the same elementary theory as a relatively hyperbolic group.  This will lead to applications both to logic and also to geometric group theory.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Discrete groups arise as sets of symmetries of many geometric objects in mathematics.  For this reason, the study of discrete groups impacts on, and is impacted by, a wide variety of fields in mathematics.  The groups under consideration in this project are relatively hyperbolic groups, which arise naturally from within topology and hyperbolic geometry, as well as in combinatorial and geometric group theory and also in the study of the logic of groups.  Relatively hyperbolic groups form a bridge between `negatively curved groups' (called hyperbolic groups), which are well understood, and `non-positively curved groups', which have been much studied but in many ways remain a mystery.  The purpose of this project is to study relatively hyperbolic groups from the point of view of logic.  In particular, what can formal logical sentences tell us about a group? To consider only formal logical sentences is quite a restrictive limit to place upon ourselves, and leads to a natural invariant of a group, called the elementary theory of a group.  The elementary theory is the set of formal (first order) logical sentences which are true in a group.  It is a powerful invariant, and yet there are different groups with the same elementary theory.

If you pull a loop of string tight on a surface, how will it cross itself? What is the most efficient (abstract) way to encode a data structure in a computer program? How do vortices in fluids or strands of DNA in a cell become knotted, and how does this knottiness affect their structural stability?

The aim in the<br/>first project is to give a topological interpretation to the<br/>class of highest weight representations of infinite dimensional<br/>Kac-Moody groups. The PI plans to construct a variant of equivariant<br/>K-theory on the category of spaces that admit a proper action of<br/>a Kac-Moody group. In particular, one hopes to relate the class of<br/>highest weight representations with elements in this<br/>K-theory. This project will generalize recent work of<br/>Freed-Hopkins-Teleman. The authors cited gave a topological<br/>interpretation of the positive energy representations of Loop<br/>groups. This is a special case of an affine Kac-Moody group. <br/>This research program will study more general Kac-Moody groups.<br/>The goal of the next project is to understand the topology of the<br/>space of compatible complex structures on a symplectic<br/>4-manifold. This builds on an earlier joint project of mine where<br/>we showed that for rational ruled surfaces with arbitrary<br/>symplectic forms, the space of compatible complex structures is<br/>weakly contractible. In that project, we use a comparison<br/>technique that relates the space of complex structures with the<br/>space of almost complex structures, and decompose the latter<br/>using the theory of J-holomorphic curves. In the proposed<br/>project, we will attempt to apply our techniques to other<br/>4-dimensional symplectic manifolds. As a by product of our<br/>techniques, we hope to derive consequences about the group of<br/>symplectomorphisms of 4-dimensional manifolds. In the final<br/>project, we study a new cohomology theory called real<br/>Johnson-Wilson theory, and develop computational tools to make it<br/>accessible. Real Johnson-Wilson theory is constructed by taking<br/>fixed points with respect to an involution on standard<br/>Johnson-Wilson theory. These are 2-local theories indexed over<br/>the integers, with the first theory being 2-localized real<br/>K-theory. We plan to use our tools, along with techniques in<br/>Algebraic Topology, to settle various old questions regarding<br/>immersions of real projective spaces in euclidean<br/>space. Previously, the best know results used the theory TMF<br/>(Topological Modular forms).<br/><br/>The general focus of my projects is to explore the interaction<br/>between geometry and topology.  The objects of study in geometry<br/>are fundamental physical objects (in possibly more than three<br/>dimensions), that are endowed with various structure. The<br/>structure one associates to these spaces could be as crude as the<br/>homotopy type (the information about the space that is preserved<br/>under all continuous deformations), or one may be interested in<br/>more subtle structure like the differential structure (the local<br/>information about the space that makes it smooth). One may refine<br/>the smooth structure even further and study symplectic, or<br/>complex structure. These questions are motivated by fundamental<br/>inquiries into our physical universe. Indeed, mathematical<br/>physics is a rich source of questions and ideas. Given a<br/>particular structure of interest, one may ask the question of how<br/>to enumerate them. In other words, one is interested in ways to<br/>parametrize all possible structures on a space. For example, John<br/>Milnor was the first person to really show that spheres admit<br/>multiple non-equivalent smooth structures, starting with the<br/>7-dimensional sphere which admits 28 such structures. One of my<br/>projects is to study the question that inquires into the number<br/>of complex structures in 4-dimensional smooth spaces. The<br/>techniques that one uses to understand the space of complex<br/>structures is to decompose it into pieces that have some<br/>significance in terms of their symmetry. Then one studies these<br/>pieces using the invariants of topology and then reassembles<br/>these pieces to get a coherent picture on the global level.  The<br/>question of symmetry is also important in other projects that I<br/>propose. For example, the linear symmetries of a vector space<br/>(like euclidean space), which preserve some property, are known<br/>as representations. Another project aims to study a class of such<br/>representations that act on infinite dimensional vector<br/>spaces. We will try to encode these objects via a topological<br/>invariant known as equivariant K-theory. Such invariants are<br/>generally known as cohomology theories and form natural<br/>receptacles for algebraic information derived from geometry. In a<br/>third and final project, the PI plans to develop such a<br/>cohomology theory, called real Johnson-Wilson theory. We hope to<br/>justify its importance by showing that it helps to solve an old<br/>geometric question about the minimum dimension of euclidean space<br/>where a certain class of spaces, known as real projective spaces,<br/>may be realized.<br/>"

Of particular interest are modular forms that are of cohomological type but are not associated to Shimura varieties, especially modular forms over an imaginary quadratic field K. In this case, the associated symmetric space quotients are hyperbolic manifolds of real dimension 3, and thus, the study of such forms is not amenable to the usual techniques of algebraic geometry. A long-term goal of the project is to establish the modularity of elliptic curves over K, adapting the method of Taylor-Wiles to this setting. Modular forms over K can be thought of geometrically as cohomology classes of certain local systems on arithmetic 3-manifolds. From a topological viewpoint, the cohomology of arithmetic 3-manifolds has been intensely studied in relation to such questions as Thurston's ""Virtual Positive Betti Number Conjecture."" However, in number theory, these cohomology classes have conjectural associations to motives and Galois representations. The tension between these different perspectives makes this a fertile area for interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wiles' famous work on Fermat's last theorem established a correspondence between two classes of disparate objects: elliptic curves, given by polynomial equations of degree three in two variables, and modular forms.Associated to each elliptic curve is a modular form, which is like the DNA of the corresponding elliptic curve: many properties of the elliptic curve can be determined directly from the modular form. An emerging theme in number theory (and beyond) in the last twenty years is the Langlands program, a vast generalization of this correspondence. In the Langlands program, one considers algebraic varieties, which are finite collections of polynomial equations of arbitrary degree, and automorphic forms, which, like modular forms in the classical case, play the role of algebraic variety DNA. For example, given a set of equations, one would like to know if there exist infinitely many solutions where all the variables are integers. Conjecturally, one can determine this directly from the corresponding automorphic form by computing whether a particular integral vanishes. The Langlands program is still, in many respects, in its infancy --- we neither know exactly how to relate systems of equations, in general, to automorphic forms, nor have we ""cracked the code"" for understanding how to extract useful information from automorphic forms, or have even determined all the components from which automorphic forms are built. Nevertheless, this broad area of study promises to be a guiding problem in number theory for the foreseeable future.<br/>"

It is also of interest  for Mathematical Physics.  The current project should further clarify the relations  between  SFT and these disciplines.

It poses lots of deep, absolutely fascinating analytical and algebraic challenges and bears relations to many rapidly emerging fields of scientific investigation in the world, like the recent development in low dimensional topology (in dimension 3 and 4) or the structure of objects known to physicists as ``integrable systems and hierarchies'' that have been a resurgent theme of research over the last fifty years.<br/><br/>"

The purpose of the workshop is to engage established experts and younger researchers in discussions on the current state of affairs and on possibilities for future research.  The theme of the workshop is the calculation and handling of mysterious algebraic structures called Nil and UNil, defined 35 years ago by Friedhelm Waldhausen and Sylvain Cappell.  Algebraically, these structures are the correction terms to Mayer-Vietoris type sequences in K- and L-theory, which have a strong connection to the Farrell-Jones Isomorphism Conjecture.  Geometrically, these structures obstruct the splitting of homotopy equivalences between manifolds along two-sided sub-manifolds, which has a strong connection to the Equivariant Borel Conjecture.  Therefore these obstruction groups play a central role in the reduction problem in the geometric topology of high-dimensional manifolds.<br/><br/>The workshop is timely in that it aims to connect the various sub-disciplines of the ""Nil phenomena"" that have emerged in the past 35 years.  The points of view that merit publicity at this gathering are the categorical, the manipulative, the differential-geometric, and the controlled-topological.  Besides a general awareness of the big picture, we would like to stimulate more collaboration in the ""assembly line""  from theoretical structure to algebraic computations to geometric consequences in the topology of manifolds.

The central rigidity conjecture is the Farrell-Jones Conjecture, which generalizes both the Novikov and Borel rigidity conjectures.  The conference will bring together researchers who use geometric methods to study topological problems with researchers who use topological methods to study geometric problems.  Examples of the former are high-dimensional topologists and examples of the latter are geometric group  theorists.   While the conference will have speakers in a wide variety of fields, two fields of research will be particularly strongly represented: (1) surgery theory, L- and K-theory, and high dimensional topology, and (2) geometric group theory.<br/><br/>Recent years have seen an increasing exchange of methods and techniques between topology, algebra and geometry.   Furthermore, recent trends in research suggest that methods arising from geometric group theory will be key to the resolution of (special cases of) various classical problems in high dimensional topology.

Davis and Januszkiewicz plan to continue<br/>their research on these and other topics in geometric group<br/>theory.  The ""weight"" in L^2 -cohomology depends on a positive<br/>real parameter q and on word length in the Coxeter group W.  The<br/>major unsolved problem is to determine this cohomology in the<br/>""intermediate range,"" for q between r and 1/r, where r is the<br/>radius of convergence of the growth series of W.

A first goal is to obtain explicite estimates of geometric data in terms of topological and combinatorial information such as the rank of the fundamental group of the Heegaard genus of the manifold. The second goal is to use these geometric information to reconstruct, under suitable assumptions, the hyperbolic metric itself.<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is a mathematical object of fundamental interest. For example, the space we live in is a 3-manifold.

A certain amount of information is lost in the process. The goal of the project is to quantify how much information actually gets lost. Obtaining concrete a priori estimates is then crucial. For example, they open the door to predictions in terms of finite models of phenomena occurig in 3-manifolds. <br/>Surprisingly, it seems very likely that in many situations sufficiently precise a priori estimates will allow to recover all the geometric information.

This project will investigate properties of these groups, their automorphisms and the associated geometries.  In addition to right-angled Artin groups, the project will study the large scale geometry of more general Artin groups.  Some Artin groups, such as braid groups, are well understood and have important applications to topology, cryptography, and other fields.

A central objective is to understand the topological quantum field theoretic aspects of various Floer homology theories in dimensions (2+1).  Goals of the project include the discovery of formulas for the Floer homology of three-manifolds obtained by gluing together manifolds with boundary, the definition of relative Floer invariants for knots and surfaces in the context of contact and symplectic homology theories, and the discovery of topological characterizations of three-manifolds and knots which arise as the boundaries of complex surfaces and curves, respectively.  As the invariants studied have already proved to be quite powerful, many possible applications could arise. Among these applications are the study of Dehn surgery problems, smooth concordance and unknotting numbers of knots, and the study of algebraic curves.<br/><br/>The study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, and knotted curves and surfaces within them, is a central task to our understanding of both large and small scale aspects of the universe.  Determining the shape of the universe depends upon a mathematical understanding of the possible shapes that could occur and the properties these shapes have.  These properties are known as invariants, and the project furthers our understanding of space by the discovery of new invariants and the study of existing invariants.  In this pursuit it has been quite fruitful to examine the way in which curves and surfaces can be tied in knots.  This kind of knotting is not only relevant to understanding the shape of space, but has recently become significant in the study of DNA.  Confined to a small space, long strands of DNA naturally become knotted, and certain processes depend upon an understanding of the complexity of these knots.  Applications of this project include effective ways of measuring different types of complexity of knots.<br/>"

Perelman has made great advances in applying Ricci flow to the topology of 3-manifolds. There remain open questions about using his ideas to completely classify closed 3-manifolds (i.e., establish Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture). These questions revolve around the theory of sufficiently collapsed 3-manifolds and their relationship to Alexandrov spaces of dimension at most 2. Sorting these issues out will give  a complete, detailed argument proving the Geometrization Conjecture. There should be an analogous theory of sufficiently collapsed 4-manifolds and the relation of these objects to Alexandrov spaces of dimension at most 3. Developing such a theory for 4-manifolds will be important in its own right, but may also be crucial in applying Ricci flow to prove topological results in dimension 4. The other area of study is mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau 3-folds in toric varieties.Here the idea is to establish mirror symmetry for these examples at the fairly delicate level of variations of Hodge structure and monodromy representations.<br/><br/>There have been exciting developments in the subject of topology in the last few years which this proposal will explore. These involve the interplay between topology and other, more geometric and analytic, areas of mathematics. Perelman's application of a heat-type flow equation and techniques from geometry to establish the Poincare Conjecture, the oldest and most fundamental of all topological questions, is a major watershed moment in the subject. This is one of the deepest and most beautiful applications of partial differential equations to a purely topological problem ever. There remain many questions of how to apply the same ideas to all 3-dimensional spaces, not just simplest, which is the 3-dimensional sphere. More speculatively, there is the question of how to extend these ideas to provide new insights into 4-dimensional spaces, about which we know little, except that the possibilities are much wider than in dimension 3. Another main theme in topology and geometry over the past few years is to make sense of the mirror symmetry. This principle is derived by non-rigorous physics arguments and is unlike anything normally seen in `classical mathematics.' It is some version of `quantum mathematics.' This notion has led to an incredibly rich flourishing of mathematics on the interface of topology and geometry as mathematicians attempt to understand special cases of this notion, to formulate this notion precisely, and to establish it mathematically.<br/>"

Goodwillie<br/><br/>All of the proposed research is connected with the calculus of<br/>functors in its various forms. First, the main results of<br/>homotopy calculus will be extended to a natural and high degree<br/>of generality.  Geometric language will be used to develop the<br/>analogy with ordinary differential calculus, so that a suitable<br/>homotopical category gets something like tangent and cotangent<br/>spaces, spaces of tensor fields, connections, differential<br/>operators, and so on. The language should be useful both for<br/>clarifying the ideas and for suggesting new directions. Second,<br/>the derivative of algebraic K-theory will be investigated in a<br/>general setting. Third, the part of manifold theory which in some<br/>sense comes next after stable pseudoisotopy (it could be called<br/>metastable pseudoisotopy) will be explored from the calculus<br/>viewpoint. Its derivatives will be studied by methods analogous<br/>to the Hochschild and cyclic homology methods that were relevant<br/>to the stable theory; where loops in a manifold were involved,<br/>now there should be maps of rank two graphs into the manifold. In<br/>addition to working out the metastable analogue of cyclic<br/>homology, there is the more fundamental question of seeking to<br/>understand the metastable phenomena in non-manifold terms as<br/>Waldhausen K-theory does for the stable theory, and calculus may<br/>hold clues to this. There is a sequence: (0) homotopy theory,<br/>where calculus leads to trees, (1) algebraic K-theory, where<br/>calculus leads to circles, and (2) metastable theory, where<br/>calculus leads to rank two graphs. One thing to be worked out is<br/>the relevant kinds of interactions between all these kinds of<br/>graphs in a manifold.<br/><br/>Functor calculus involves extremes of abstraction, but it has<br/>down-to-earth roots. It is an organizing principle named for<br/>resemblance to the ordinary calculus of Newton and<br/>Leibniz. Sometimes a fact about numbers is best proved by placing<br/>it in a context where the number is part of a huge family of<br/>numbers -- a numerical function. Properties of the function can<br/>lead, by general theorems of calculus that at first seem like<br/>magic, to a computation of the number. The story here is similar:<br/>sometimes a fact about some mathematical entity -- not a number<br/>now, but perhaps a geometric object of some kind -- is best<br/>proved by placing it in a context where the object is part of a<br/>huge family of such objects -- a functor -- and using some magic<br/>of more recent vintage. One area of application of functor<br/>calculus is manifold topology. Another is homotopy theory. A<br/>manifold is a kind of mathematical system involving many<br/>variables. These are ubiquitous in science and<br/>mathematics. Manifold topology studies such systems for their own<br/>sake, treating them as geometric objects; an N-variable system is<br/>viewed as an N-dimensional object. Homotopy theory studies<br/>manifolds and other objects from a point of view in which a great<br/>deal of information is ignored, leaving only the coarsest<br/>features to consider. This change in viewpoint is a powerful<br/>idea, because this process of distillation leads to conceptual<br/>clarity and new methods.  Besides being a key tool in the study<br/>of manifolds, homotopy theory is a branch of topology in its own<br/>right. Thus geometry grows, surprisingly and naturally, as the<br/>years go by. In functor calculus it becomes possible in a sense<br/>to view all of homotopy theory as a geometric object.<br/>"

If one restricts attention to spaces with strong geometric properties (such as metric trees or CAT(0) spaces), one can often make the set of actions of  G   into a topological space itself, called a  deformation space, with good topological properties.  The automorphism group of  G  acts on the deformation space by twisting each action to get a new action.   In this project we study automorphism groups of various classes of groups by studying their actions  on deformation spaces.   For free groups, the relevant deformation space, originally defined by the PI and M. Culler, is known as Outer space.  A fairly recent development in this subject is that Morita used a connection found by Kontsevich between Outer space and a certain infinite-dimensional symplectic Lie algebra to detect cocycles for  Out(F_n), the group of outer automorphisms of the free group of rank n.  The PI and J. Conant have reinterpreted these cocycles as cycles on the quotient of Outer space by the action of  Out(F_n), and plan to use these to study the unstable cohomology of Out(F_n).  A second goal of this project, joint with R. Charney, is to develop an analog of Outer space for right-angled Artin groups, a class which includes both free groups and free abelian groups.  A third component is motivated by previous work of the PI on stability of the homology of  Out(F_n) and Aut(F_n).  Techniques developed for proving these stability results apply to other sequences of groups related to low-dimensional topology, and the PI will  further investigate these applications. Other ongoing projects include a study of the space of phylogenetic trees and an investigation of  rigidity properties of Out(F_n).   <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>       A phenomenon which occurs throughout mathematics and the sciences is that complicated structures can often be understood more easily by codifying the information they contain in terms of graphs and trees.   On example of this is the use of graphs and trees to describe the possible splittings of an algebraic object called a group into simpler pieces. When there are many possible splittings, one can construct deformation spaces which measure the ambiguity.   In this project we study groups by considering actions of the  symmetries of the group on such deformation spaces. <br/>"

Two very important classes of groups that are studied in this manner are mapping class groups of surfaces and outer automorphism groups of free groups. In both cases, these groups arise naturally from topological considerations that are not, at their heart, geometric in nature: mapping class groups arise from the topological symmetries of 2-dimensional surfaces; outer automorphism groups of free groups arise from the homotopic symmetries of 1-dimensional graphs. The principal investigator will pursue the study of geometric objects whose symmetry groups are realized by mapping class groups of surfaces or by outer automorphism groups of free groups, with applications to the structure of these groups.<br/>"

Exciting progress has recently been made in each of these subjects independently, including a proof of the Weinstein conjecture in dimension three, and the degree-0 Donaldson-Thomas/Gromov-Witten duality. Important open conjectures motivate continued study; these include notonly the higher-degree Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas conjecture and the general Weinstein conjecture, but also such important topics as the Volume conjecture, the Crepant Resolution Conjecture. Furthermore, and central to our symposium, there are important conjectures relating these two sub jects. Most notable is Large N duality, relating Gromov-Witten theory to knot theory and low dimensional topology. The speakers at this symposium will announce accomplishments and also discuss new directions of research. Specifically, Joel Kamnitzer will give an introduction to knot theory and its relation to derived categories, Mariel Vazqeuz will discuss applications of knot theory, and Kevin Costello will discuss connections to Algebraic Geometry and Gromov-Witten theory. <br/><br/>This symposium will enable and encourage students and other scientists to pursue research in areas related to the interaction of quantum geometry and low dimensional topology, provide the opportunity for scientists to interact and foster collaboration and new research, and disseminate knowledge to a wide and extraordinarily diverse audience. While the reasons for organizing a scientific symposium on low dimensional topology and quantum geometry are many, there is additionally an acute need to do so for an audience of underrepresented minorities. There is at this time significant underrepresentation of minorities in the mathematical sciences; this underrepresentation is evidently severe in both low dimensional topology and quantum geometry and certainly the intersection of these subjects. There are very important questions that need to be addressed in these subjects, and it is necessary to attract a broad and diverse audience to work on these problems. Gromov-Witten theory and related &#64257;elds have been extremely successful in solving outstanding problems, some over 100 years old, in several branches of mathematics and physics. Low dimensional topology is not only of basic importance in geometry and topology, but in several areas of applied mathematics as well, as highlighted in this symposium. It is predicted that underrepresented minorities will become the majority of United States Citizens; as such, it is in the long term interest of low dimensional topology and quantum geometry to have increased participation from members of these groups.

In a typical instance, such a theory assigns bigraded homology groups to a link and a homomorphism of groups to a link cobordism. Various quantum invariants of links gain a novel interpretation as the Euler characteristics of these theories. Link homology theories can be though of as four-dimensional topological quantum field theories, restricted to links in the 3-space and link cobordisms. Applications of link homology include a combinatorial proof of the Milnor conjecture, efficient estimates of the Thurston-Bennequin invariant of knots, and nonexistence of taut foliations on many double branched covers of knots. The proposal's aim is to deepen understanding of known link homology theories and their interrelations, including the ones between Khovanov homology and knot Floer homology, find more applications of link homology to low-dimensional topology, discover link homology theories categorifying a variety of quantum link invariants, extend knot Floer homology to tangles, find categorifications of quantum 3-manifold invariants, and explore the relations of link homology to various branches of mathematics, including homological algebra and representation theory.

One of the main problems in studying links and manifolds is their classification, that is, finding methods to tell them apart from each other. From the very beginning, algebra played an important role in distinguishing links and manifolds, since algebraic objects are in general easier to compare to each other than geometric ones. Categorification, also known as link homology, is a procedure of replacing a known link invariant with a family of algebraic objects that significantly enhance the original invariant. This procedure was recently developed by the lead principal investigator, who found categorifications of several polynomial invariants of links. These categorifications are relatively easy to describe, but rather challenging to compute for a given link. The aim of this project is to better understand existing link homology theories and their interrelations, as well as to find new ones. The principal investigators also plan to write efficient programs for computing link homology. Link homology is a young and quickly growing field. It lies on the crossroads of research in 3- and 4-dimensional topology, symplectic topology, homological algebra, and representation theory.

The purpose of the conference is to consolidate these recent advances, facilitate communication between researchers in these areas, set directions for future research, and strengthen the connections with other fields.<br/><br/>Two of the main themes in mathematics are geometry and algebra. Geometry, and its variants, such as topology, involve the study of higher dimensional shapes and their frequently subtle distinguishing qualities. Algebra, on the other hand, deals with ordinary numbers and their generalizations. Algebraic topology is a hybrid area which essentially looks for ways to extract interesting numerical information from shapes. Recently there have been major advances in the part of algebraic topology that is concerned with studying geometrical symmetries. The purpose of this proposal is to provide support for travel by researchers to an international conference devoted to presenting and discussing these advances. The conference will also contribute to establishing and reinforcing contacts between US, European, and North African mathematicians.<br/>"

The focus is typically on the behavior of surfaces contained in the 3-manifolds (a classical approach) but in a more sophisticated way.  Added to old-fashioned combinatorial arguments on surface intersections are ideas from graph theory; added to the classic study of hierarchies on 3-manifolds is Gabai's notion of sutured manifold decomposition, in which parameterizing surfaces and estimates of the Thurston norm help control and understand the topology of the hierarchy; and, added to the classic tool of Morse theory, is the minimax principle of thin position, in which  handles of a given index are added not all at once, but as slowly as possible.  Recently Scharlemann has gotten interested in how these and similar new tools can also be used towards resolving questions in the topology of 4-manifolds.  For example, his recent proof of the genus three Schoenflies Conjecture began with an effort to prove the full Schoenflies Conjecture with, among other ideas, a 4-dimensional application of thin  position.  The proof of the genus three case (which includes ideas on the general problem and its connection to Property R) also integrates Heegaard theory into this important 4-dimensional problem through the natural use of  Heegaard unions.    These may be only the first steps of a useful application of 3-manifold ideas to those intriguing topological questions which are sometimes called (3 + 1)-dimensional because they ask how 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds are interrelated. <br/><br/><br/>A focus of Scharlemann's interest for many years has been the topology of 3-manifolds.  To explain:  one of the most basic observations about the world around us, apparent almost from our birth, is that it is 3-dimensional.  So it is of interest to understand objects with precisely this property: anyone living in one would see their world as 3-dimensional.  Such objects are called ``3-manifolds"", and the broad goal of this research proposal is to increase our understanding of them.  Of particular (but not sole) interest is what our emerging understanding of 3-dimensional manifolds can tell us about some old and important questions concerning 4-dimensional manifolds.   Such 4-manifolds also connect to our natural experience,  when we incorporate time as well as space into our thinking.  The particular emphasis in this proposal is on questions that sit on the edge between 3- and 4-dimensional manifold theory.  Both of these dimensions are interesting in part because they model the universe in which we live.<br/><br/><br/>"

The problems raised here are motivated by the applications of knot theory in chemistry, physics, and biophysics. The main goal is to develop and implement new algorithms that sample the space of large knots and that are capable of embedding large knots tightly or semi-tightly in the simple cubic lattice. In this research, theoretical work will enhance the algorithms to be developed and the empirical results will support the theoretical approaches. The proposed research project consists of several inter-related objectives: developing fast algorithms capable of generating representative samples of large knot diagrams, developing better algorithms capable of embedding large knots tightly in the simple cubic lattice, and developing new theoretical approaches to improve the upper and lower bounds of the ropelength in general or for special knot classes such as alternating knots. These objectives are difficult and challenging. For example, the distribution of large knots is unknown, determining the crossing number of large non-alternating knots is known to be NP-hard, and theoretical results concerning large knots are scarce in general. Concretely the PIs expect to sample the space of large knots using and comparing three approaches:   first applying uniform prefix vectors to generate large Hamiltonian prime knot diagrams; second, adapting a method based on uniform random polygons to sample large prime knot diagrams; finally, using graph tensor products to construct large non-alternating knots whose crossing number can be approximated by computing the breadth of the Jones polynomial (via the Tutte polynomial); sampling such non-alternating knots allows a comparison with alternating knots of similar size.  Furthermore, the PIs will work on developing a more efficient embedding algorithm by extending the constructive proof of two of the PIs regarding the embedding length of closed braids to general knots. This approach also aims at improving the general upper bound on the ropelength of knots from the current bound of crossing number to the power of 1.5.<br/> <br/>The main subjects to be studied in this proposal are large physical knots, i.e. large knots that can actually occur in the real world. Examples of such occurrences are long, knotted polymer chains or circular DNA. The problems raised in this proposal are motivated by the applications of knot theory in chemistry, physics and biophysics. For example, DNA knots formed under extreme conditions of condensation, such as those found in bacteriophage P4, can be quite large. Such large and tightly packed circular DNAs are difficult to analyze experimentally. Theoretical results or computational simulations on such systems would be of great help. Yet theoretical studies on large knots are scarce. The proposed project aims at gaining more knowledge about large knots: How much space is needed in order to pack certain large knots? How efficiently can knots be packed tightly? Is there a difference between packing a complicated knot in comparison to packing a simple knot? What role does the topology (shape) of the knot play? The PIs intend to develop computer programs that can generate large knots and pack them tightly, based on theoretical results and algorithms they have developed in the past. Empirical data can then be gathered through the repeated applications of these programs. The proposed activities may have significant implications in DNA research, polymer science, and other sciences. The activities will result in tools for researchers to compute various geometric and topological characteristics of the large knots they encounter in their field and thus help them to better understand biological and physical systems where large knotted molecules occur.<br/>"

Cochran of William Marsh Rice University in Houston Texas. The broad goal of the project is to find applications of methods of noncommutative algebra to problems in topology and group theory. Over the last ten years the PI and collaborators have developed a vast theory of so-called higher-order Alexander modules, linking forms and signatures. These can be associated to knots, links, 3-manifolds, spaces, groups or even surface homeomorphisms. The PI and Shelly Harvey have many new results on how homology constrains these invariants of the fundamental group.  The project will apply these techniques to important open problems in topology and group theory. Specific goals are:  to find a refinement of Heegard Floer Knot Homology that better reflects the noncommutativity of the fundamental group of the knot exterior; to use higher-order signatures to construct quasi-homomorphisms of subgroups of mapping class groups and to construct homology classes for such subgroups; to further investigate the knot concordance group, both topological and smooth; to apply these techniques to study algebraic curves in complex 2-space;  to continue to find further relationships between homology equivalence and fundamental group and  apply these results to the virtual betti number problem in 3-manifolds.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>This project studies mathematical aspects of the shape, or topology, of 3-dimensional objects. Shape is very important in the study of networks, search algorithms, in the design of drugs, satellite recognition of objects, the medical imaging and modeling of human organs and in the function of cellular DNA. Even though all common objects are 3-dimensional in nature, such shapes can be quite complicated. For example, the shape of a tangled piece of string is quite complex. Moreover much is unknown: the shapes of most proteins, for example. How can an imaging device distinguish a tank from a house given only partial data? How can one usefully quantify the shape of a brain given that all brains are different? The scientific study of shape requires mathematical ideas that can accurately quantify the complex non-linear behavior of such objects. Grade-school mathematics is very linear: 2 times 3 equals 3 times two. In college one learns that noncommutative algebra, such as matrices where AB is not necessarily BA, is necessary to model simple real-life situations. This project will develop new tools in noncommutative mathematics and apply these to specific problems concerning the shape of 3-dimensional objects."

The PI and Tillmann are developing a theory of transversally oriented normal surfaces which we expect to have significant applications. Another project is to develop the theory of Voronoi decompositions (nearest-point neighbor sets for a discretization of a space) beyond the well know setting of Euclidean space to general Riemannian manifolds. Such decompositions are frequently used in computational situations to approximate a continuum by a finite grid.

In physics ever more sophisticated mathematical  ideas from these areas are being used to develop string theory and related areas. In computer science the effective use of graphics requires sophisticated geometry. In biology the construction of evolutionary  trees uses techniques from geometry. Projective  geometry was born in the Renaissance from the work of the mathematician and artist Gerard Desargues who wanted to accurately  depict what  he saw on a flat canvas. This led in the nineteenth century to a great mathematical  theory.
