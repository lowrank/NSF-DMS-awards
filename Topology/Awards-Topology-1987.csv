Another area has been that of (finite) group theoretic               constructions, becoming, in its most modern form, equivariant                   stable homotopy theory.  Results in recent years, most                          spectacularly the proofs of Segal's Burnside ring conjecture and                Ravenel's nilpotence conjecture, have dramatically begun to bring               to fruition these two branches of stable homotopy theory.                               Historically, these branches have been basically independent            of each other.  An exception is Atiyah's theorem relating K*(BG)                (a bordism type of object) to the complex representation ring of                G.  There are now indications of much more widespread                           interrelations.  This is the subject of Kuhn's recent and current               research.  It is hard to say where the study of such intricate                  algebraic patterns will lead, but the history of mathematics                    strongly suggests that mastering them will have repercussions                   elsewhere, either in use of the patterns themselves or of the                   techniques developed for treating them."

Consider                closed oriented irreducible 3-manifolds with infinite fundamental               groups.  If M and N are homotopically equivalent, are they                      homeomorphic?  If the fundamental group contains a central                      subgroup isomorphic to the integers, is M a classical Seifert                   3-manifold?  Is the universal covering homeomorphic to Euclidean                space?

A number of problems are connected to the classical                     distributivity formula obtained from the Hilton-Milnor theorem.                 Problem one here is a reformulation of the strong form of the                   Kervaire invariant, the first step being the analysis of zero                   divisors in Dickson's analogues of the Cayley numbers.

Lempp hopes that strategies from the solution to the                 deep degree problem (with Slaman) will help with the necessary                  embeddings of homomorphisms of partial orders into these sets of                degrees.  Secondly, Lempp will investigate the existence of a                   join operation in the r.e. degrees modulo some equivalence                      relation defined by iterated jumps.  In a forcing argument, Lempp               has already shown that the join does not necessarily exist in the               Turing degrees modulo this equivalence relation.  Furthermore,                  Lempp plans to conclude work begun with Cooper and Watson by                    proving an extension of the nondensity theorem in the d.r.e.                    degrees.

Often a manifold E comes equipped with a map p:E--B onto               another manifold which is locally a product projection.  Such a                 map is called a bundle projection.

The nilpotence                   theorem determines the prime ideals of the sphere spectrum                      thought of as a ring up to homotopy.  The sphere is analogous to                the ring of integers, being an initial object in a suitable                     category of rings.  This analogy becomes more striking when one                 observes that the ""completions"" of the sphere at its prime ideals               acquire natural compact topologies.  He would like to assemble                  these completions into a global object analogous to the ring of                 adeles in number theory.  Such an object would be appropriate for               getting at large-scale aspects of stable homotopy theory.  One                  goal would be to construct L-series with analytic properties                    measuring the homotopy groups of finite complexes and the                       homomorphisms induced by maps between them.                                             Fundamental to this is a family of cohomology theories                  generalizing K-theory, and a basic problem is to represent them                 geometrically with ""generalized vector bundles"".  A theorem of                  Atiyah relates the K-theory of the classifying space of a finite                group to its character ring.  D. Ravenel and Hopkins have                       recently generalized the notion of character and proved an                      analogue of Atiyah's result for these exotic K-theories.  It is                 hoped that construction will shed light on what ""generalized                    vector bundles"" should be.                                                              All of this activity falls under the general heading of                 exploring and perfecting algebraic techniques for treating                      qualitative features of spaces, e.g. connectedness, knottedness,                stability, and so forth.

Bass about the Hattori-Stallings               trace of an idempotent matrix with group ring entries.  Groups                  are ubiquitous in mathematics and the natural sciences as                       codifiers of symmetry, and one can never have too many approaches               to discovering their properties."

Other                 questions concern automorphisms of manifolds, e.g., how can they                act, and what is the structure of the full group of                             automorphisms?

Characterization of the amalgamation bases of the variety. The plans for deductiveness are less specific. The general issue is to attempt to classify those varieties that are deductive.
