Our<br/>main goal is to develop the 3-dimensional cut-and-paste techniques<br/>involving convex surfaces and ``bypasses"" into a largely<br/>combinatorial one. The investigators propose to import ideas and<br/>constructions from the theory of foliations and laminations (in<br/>joint work with J. Etnyre and W. Kazez). Convex surfaces and<br/>bypasses aid the decomposition of a tight contact manifold<br/>(eventually) into balls, similar to the `` sutured manifold<br/>decomposition"", due to Gabai.  The ``dividing curves on the<br/>surfaces along which the cuttings take place determine the tight<br/>contact structure.  A project which is currently under way is to<br/>carefully follow the sutured manifold decompositions of Gabai in<br/>constructing taut foliations on most 3-manifolds, and to construct<br/>tight contact structures by gluing in much the same way as Gabai's<br/>construction.  We hope to produce an effective gluing theorem for<br/>tight contact structures.  Another direction of research is<br/>Legendrian knot theory. Using the classification of tight contact<br/>structures on solid tori, Etnyre and Honda propose to classify<br/>Legendrian torus knots and Legendrian figure eight knots. <br/><br/>The investigators propose a study of 3-dimensional spaces.  The<br/>3-dimensional spaces we study will locally be similar to the<br/>standard Euclidean 3-dimensional space.  These objects may be very<br/>complicated globally, but a local observer cannot tell the<br/>difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a<br/>flat plane or a very large sphere.  `Finite' 2-dimensional spaces<br/>have been classified and understood for a long time - they are the<br/>2-dimensional sphere, the doughnut, the doughnut with 2 holes, the doughnut<br/>with 3 holes, etc., and are distinguished by the number of holes. <br/>However, in spite of work by numerous mathematicians this century,<br/>a complete classification of 3-dimensional spaces is far from<br/>understood.  In our work we seek to better understand 3-dimensional<br/>spaces by imposing an additional structure, called a contact<br/>structure, which, very loosely speaking, amounts to choosing a<br/>preferred direction (or a spinning axis) at every point in the<br/>3-dimensional space.  Contact structures have intimate connections<br/>with 4-dimensional geometry, quantum physics, and dynamics (such as<br/>fluid dynamics), and we hope to gain better understanding of<br/>3-dimensional spaces through contact structures. <br/>"

The major problem in this field is the classification of smooth simply connected<br/>4-manifolds. The interaction between topology and physics has<br/>stimulated the construction of invariants - at first Donaldson's invariant, and then the invariant of Seiberg and Witten - which are useful in distinguishing the diffeomorphism types of 4-manifolds. These have led to major advances, and they have allowed workers to study new constructions of 4-manifolds. These have confused the issue of classification, but also have invigorated the theory and reinforced its richness. The theory is now left without even a conjectural classification. It seems that still further examples are needed to identify a suitable classification scheme, and the proposer intends to work on such constructions. One class of 4-manifolds which have exceptionally close ties to theoretical physics are those with a symplectic structure, and the last few years have also seen progress in the theory of symplectic 4-manifolds; especially new constructions, and most notably, Donaldson's work on Lefschetz fibrations. The proposer intends to continue work on the explicit constructions of Lefschetz fibrations and related questions on symplectic submanifolds. The ultimate goal of the proposer is to develop new constructions of smooth 4 manifolds in the hope that a general picture will begin to emerge.<br/><br/>   The focus of this project will be to construct new types of examples of smooth and symplectic 4-manifolds and to study the diversity of embedded symplectic submanifolds (up to smooth isotopy) in a given homology class. In particular, is every symplectic surface in the complex projective plane smoothly isotopic to a holomorphic curve? If one allows enough blowups, this is not true.<br/>Another issue is the geography problem for simply connected<br/>irreducible 4-manifolds. Each such manifold can be assigned a lattice point in the plane corresponding to its characteristic numbers. The problem is to study which points are realized. There has  been notable<br/>progress, but much work still remains, and the principal investigator plans to seek new methods for constructing irreducible simply connected 4-manifolds of positive signature. These techniques are related to a kind of theory of minimal genus surfaces with constraints. Also he, along with R. Stern, conjectures a replacement for the Noether inequality for symplectic 4-manifolds,  and they have a promising technique for its proof, which they plan to pursue.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The existing evidence suggests that quantum invariants can be disassembled into simpler pieces, the first of which are known classical invariants, whereas the others are their close cousins which may also have a nice direct interpretation in the framework of classical topology.  The invariants that appear in the decomposition of <br/>quantum invariants, are the so-called Vassiliev or finite type invariants. Therefore it turns out that Vassiliev invariants are a link between the quantum and classical invariants.  I propose to study the properties of Vassiliev invariants appearing in the decomposition of quantum invariants and especially their relation to classical topology. In particular, I propose to study the new polynomial Vassiliev invariants that are hidden inside the colored Jones polynomials. These new polynomial invariants of knots and links seem to be the <br/>descendants of the Alexander polynomial and therefore, similarly to their ancestor, they may have a direct topological interpretation. The first direct descendant of the Alexander polynomial is a 2-variable polynomial with integer coefficients. Path integral arguments  suggest that it is a knot analog of the Casson-Walker invariant of rational homology spheres.<br/><br/>The topological classification of 3-manifolds and knots is still an open problem. A natural way to approach it is to construct as many invariants of knots and 3-manifolds as one would need in order to distinguish between any non-equivalent objects. In recent years we  witnessed an outburst of new ""quantum"" invariants  (Jones polynomial and Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant in particular). These invariants are more powerful than the old Alexander polynomial, yet they are relatively easy to compute. However, their application towards the solution of topological problems is impeded by the fact that their definition is purely combinatorial and has no obvious connection to the well-established methods of classical topology.  Existing evidence suggests that quantum invariants are packed up with an infinite number of simpler invariants the first of which are well-known classical invariants. <br/>Therefore a study of quantum invariants (especially in the semi-classical approximation when they unpack) may produce an infinite number of new classical invariants which may be enough to distinguish all 3-manifolds and knots. I propose to study the properties of new simple invariants that come from the quantum ones. In particular, I will study the decomposition of the colored Jones polynomial into an infinite sequence of simpler polynomials which seem to be the descendants of the Alexander polynomial.<br/>"

This extends Knudson's previous work on the homology of rank one groups over such rings.  In addition, a new homology theory based on algebraic cycles in the product of a scheme with the simplicial classifying scheme of an algebraic group is constructed and its properties investigated.  The hope is that this construction will lead to a proof of the Friedlander-Milnor conjecture concerning the homology of algebraic groups made discrete.  Also, the investigator's previous work on the structure of special linear groups over integral Laurent polynomial rings is used in the study of the Burau representation of the braid groups.  This representation is known to be faithful for three strings and unfaithful for five or more strings; the remaining case of four strings is singled out for study in this project.  Finally, Knudson studies the completion of a discrete group relative to a Zariski dense representation in a reductive group over a field of positive characteristic.  This generalizes the classical unipotent completion of a group and extends to positive characteristic R. Hain's work in characteristic zero.<br/><br/>A scheme is a geometric object constructed from solution sets of polynomial equations.  Algebraic K-theory associates to a scheme a sequence of groups which encode information about the scheme.  One aspect of this project is the study of the K-groups of an elliptic curve.  Such curves have remarkably rich structure and appear in various branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry and coding theory.  A seemingly unrelated part of this project concerns the so-called Burau representation of the braid groups which is intimately connected with knot theory.  These diverse topics are unified by studying the structure of groups of matrices with entries in various rings (the coordinate ring of the elliptic curve in the first case and the ring of integral Laurent polynomials in the second). The hope is to solve several outstanding conjectures about these objects.<br/><br/>"

In addition it includes applications of topological methods to engineering questions in the field of Robotics.<br/><br/>The topology of 3-dimensional manifolds is intimately connected to differential geometry, particularly to homogeneous structures like Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry.  Of these, hyperbolic geometry is the most prevalent.  On a closed 3-manifold a hyperbolic structure, if it exists, is unique by the Mostow Rigidity Theorem.  Thus, any geometric invariant is a topological invariant and can be used to distinguish different 3-manifolds.  When the 3-manifold has boundary, it can have a large parameter space of hyperbolic structures; in this case, the qualitative properties of the structures as one varies over the parameter space are of particular interest.   Kerckhoff and Brock are studying hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds, trying to describe the behavior of these geometric structures under a topological procedure, called Dehn surgery.  For manifolds with boundary, <br/>they are also trying to understand the limiting behavior of the structures as one moves to the limits of the parameter space.  R.L.

A 3-manifold has the<br/>property that sufficiently small subsets can be parametrized by 3<br/>coordinates.<br/><br/>The problem of characterizing the geometry and topology of surfaces, i.e.,<br/>manifolds of dimension 2, was completely answered nearly a century ago.

Husek's 1977 question of whether<br/>compact spaces having a small diagonal are metrizable, J. Steprans'<br/>fifteen-year old problem concerning the existence of uncountable<br/>non-discrete spaces which are homeomorphic to each of their uncountable<br/>subspaces, and J. Ceder's forty year old problem of whether stratifiable<br/>spaces have a sigma-closure preserving base.  All three questions involve<br/>fundamental topological properties and constructions; they lie in the<br/>mainstream of set-theoretic topology and have been worked on by many<br/>researchers.   The principle investigator has significant partial results<br/>on all of them which answer related questions and give hope for further<br/>progress.  In particular, he has settled the first question for countably<br/>compact spaces, affirmatively answered a countable version of the second<br/>question, and with respect to the third question has obtained several<br/>important results including a positive answer to a closely related<br/>question of Ceder.    <br/><br/>Set theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines<br/>with common turn-of-the-century roots.  General topology provides a<br/>framework for the study of shapes, from ordinary structures in standard<br/>three-dimensional space to much more abstract shapes, and the continuous<br/>deformations of these shapes.  Dramatic advances in set theory and logic<br/>during the past forty years have led to the realization that many<br/>long-standing questions in the general topology of abstract spaces rest on<br/>complicated set-theoreti combinatorics and often cannot be solved<br/>assuming only the standard axioms of set theory.  Thus began a fruitful<br/>interaction between the set theory and general topology which continues<br/>today.    The principle investigator's proposed problems lie within the<br/>scope of this interesting interaction.   Proposed methods of solutions to<br/>the problems involve an interweaving of topological methods with<br/>sophisticated set theoretic tools.

Binary trees appear as parameters in: (1) Hierarchical clustering problems, for instance for micro-array data from contemporary genetics; (2) Methods that use decision trees such as the Classification and Regression trees (CART); (3) Estimation of phylogenetic trees built from DNA data for the taxonomy of species, but also for building `gene trees'.  The embedding of tree estimation in a statistical framework allows one to see trees as a special type of parameter to be estimated.  However the estimation procedures have been developed without the ability to construct confidence regions for these paramters or ways of comparing various estimators of these parameters.  Currently biologists validate the tree estimated by perturbing the data through a simple bootstrap of the DNA sequences and then summarizing the collection of trees obtained by associating p-values to the branches of a consensus tree.  This reduces the problem to a collection of binomial simulations, losing much of the multivariate information of which groups appear simultaneously.  This new constructive geometrical approach uses the tools available from topology and algebraic combinatorics.  Collaboration with a combinatorialist, Louis Billera, and a topologist, Karen Vogtmann, on a more mathematical understanding of tree space allows a more natural definition of distances between points in the `tree polytope'.  This topological study of tree space is crucial in the definition of a notion of neighborhood that then allows a definition of continuity of the estimation function.  The space of trees is a space with negative curvature.  It is also possible to define geodesics on this space and convex hulls.  The notion of confidence region can be defined, and it is possible to combine trees from built from different datasets or to combine trees obtained from different genes or even compare trees with other data (biogeographic, for instance).<br/><br/>Understanding the geometry of ""tree space"" helps understand how to combine and compare trees.  Whether they are hierarchical clustering trees built for micro-array DNA data or family trees built from DNA sequences, binary tree data are abundant in today's genome era.  The current proposal aims to consider trees as a whole, instead of breaking them down into just sibling relationships as is done currently.  This problem uses recent results from topology and the geometry of spaces with negative curvature, like the surface of a hyperboloid.  In these spaces notions of average and distance have to be redefined, the hardest being ways of representing what is not naturally representable in our usual euclidean space.  The challenges are both computational and geometric.<br/>"

The first is the study of<br/>boundaries of connectedness loci for families of polynomials. This<br/>generalizes the study of the boundary of the Mandelbrot set. Problems<br/>include the metric structure of the boundary, including the boundary<br/>behavior of the Riemann map of the complement and the distribution of<br/>the harmonic measure.

However, <br/>frequently one dominant parameter emerges<br/>which controls long time-behavior of the system. In such a way the<br/>logistic family appears in the study of many complicated systems. The<br/>logistic maps are quadratic polynomials. It is useful to study them on<br/>the complex plane, and thus complex quadratic polynomials enter the<br/>picture. This is the first object of our study. <br/>In other situations the system begins to show quasi-periodic<br/>or ``rotational'' behavior.

The attractor<br/>for an iterated function system which we will also investigate appears<br/>as a projection of a certain fractal set.

The latter is closely related, in the case of anti-holomorphic <br/>involutions, to the topology of Stein surfaces and the non-compact Kaehler <br/>geometry. The investigator also continues his study of the links of complete<br/>intersection singularities, and the relevance of the equivariant Casson <br/>invariant to homology cobordisms and the triangulation conjecture for <br/>topological manifolds in dimensions five and higher. <br/><br/>The research is a study of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds by the methods of <br/>gauge theory, coming from theoretical physics. In the last two decades, these <br/>methods brought new life into the classical low dimensional topology, leading <br/>to many spectacular developments and to the solutions of many difficult <br/>problems. The area was revolutionized to the point that the state of knowledge<br/>of two decades ago looks now, in many aspects, like a desert of nearly <br/>complete ignorance. Manifolds of dimension four were the ones that benefited <br/>the most: gauge theory methods worked very efficiently in this setting. At <br/>the same time, their analogue in dimension three, which is known as the Floer <br/>homology, is yet to reveal its full potential. The Floer homology is in the <br/>focus of investigator's research efforts.<br/>"

Thomas Farrell<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to resolve some questions about <br/>the structure of manifolds. Manifolds are geometric objects <br/>which locally resemble the space of Euclidean geometry; but <br/>could be quite different globally. For example the surface of <br/>the earth, on a small scale, can be thought of as Euclid's plane. <br/>But on a large scale, it is more useful to model it on the<br/>sphere. One way to detect global differences is to travel <br/>long distances, return and see if something has changed. For <br/>example, if you walk around the surface of a Moebius band, <br/>you'll return on the opposite side. The collection of all <br/>travel routes (up to continuous deformation) forms an algebraic <br/>object called the Poincare group of the manifold. A basic <br/>conjecture formulated almost 50 years ago by A. Borel is <br/>that the Poincare group of a closed aspherical manifold <br/>determines this manifold up to a continuous bijective <br/>correspondence. Closed means without boundary but finite in <br/>extent. The Moebius band, for example, is not closed but <br/>the sphere is. Aspherical means that any continuous image <br/>of a sphere bounds the image of a ball.  Spheres of <br/>dimension bigger than two and correspondingly higher <br/>dimensional balls must be allowed in this definition. <br/>For example, the Borel conjecture is true for the surface <br/>of a doughnut.  However, the sphere itself is ""clearly"" <br/>not aspherical.<br/><br/>Farrell in collaboration with L.E. Jones have verified <br/>some important cases of Borel's conjecture and will continue <br/>to work on it. One interesting question is whether there is <br/>a ""best of all possible"" maps giving the continuous bijection. <br/>It was once thought that the unique harmonic homotopy<br/>equivalence does this in the case both manifolds are <br/>negatively curved.  Farrell, Jones, and P. Ontaneda have <br/>recently shown that this is not so in general. (Farrell,<br/>Ontaneda and M.S. Raghunathan extending this work have <br/>just produced such examples even with pairs of diffeomorphic <br/>manifolds: i.e. the harmonic map homotopic to the diffeomorphism <br/>is not univalent.) But it is still open whether this harmonic <br/>map is always cellular.  Note if so this would contradict <br/>the Poincare Conjecture.  Another problem to be investigated <br/>is whether any finite group of symmetries of the Poincare <br/>group lifts to a group of symmetries of the closed aspherical <br/>manifold provided the Poincare group has trivial center. The <br/>thrust of this problem is to find interesting cases where <br/>it is true.  The case of surfaces is, for example, the <br/>classical Nielsen problem solved by Kerkhoff. Farrell and <br/>Jones have already obtained some other positive partial <br/>results on this problem. In their work on these geometric <br/>problems, Farrell and Jones have formulated conjectures <br/>about the structure of the algebraic K and L theories of <br/>an arbitrary group ring. They will continue their work on <br/>verifying these conjectures. Again the thrust of this effort <br/>is to give positive solutions for interesting groups<br/>"

There are many connections among these structures, but nevertheless the known connections are sporadic and often only loose, although suggestive of deeper connections remaining to be discovered.  The PI will investigate these various structures and their interrelationships, with an emphasis on analyzing computability, and developing techniques for actually constructing and computing examples.  For example, is there a construction to go from a taut foliation or an essential lamination to a geometric decomposition? And conversely, does every hyperbolic 3-manifold admit a foliation or at least a genuine lamination?<br/><br/>Three-manifolds are the mathematical descriptions of the possible ways for 3-dimensional space to be topologically interconnected. They are important because they arise through geometric models in every corner of mathematics.  A central theme in modern three-manifold topology is the Geometrization conjecture, which is the conjecture that all three-manifolds are made up of locally homogeneous pieces, that is, three-manifolds that have a geometry in which a neighborhood of any one point is completely identical to a neighborhood of any other point, up to some fixed radius.  This conjecture, proposed by the PI about 20 years ago  is now supported by a great deal of theoretical and empirical evidence.  Nonetheless, many basic questions remain unknown, including the famous Poincare conjecture a special case of the Geometrization conjecture which asserts that there is only one possible topology for a three-manifold in which every loop can be contracted to fit inside a small ball.  Besides geometric structures for 3-manifolds, there are a number of other interesting structures that have important implications for topology, but only loose connections among them are understood.  Among these structures are  incompressible surfaces, foliations (a kind of layered structure), laminations (layered structures that only exist on part of the manifold), contact structures (related to Hamiltonian mechanics), and various combinatorial structures from group theory.  The PI will investigate connections among these various structures, with an emphasis on computability and techniques of making actual computations of examples<br/><br/>The project is supported by both the Topology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Numeric, Symbolic, and Geometric Computation Program in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate<br/>"

Fenley<br/><br/>ABSTRACT: Reebless foliations are a basic and fundamental object in the study of 3-manifolds. They yield deep results on 3-manifold topology and are also related to the geometrization conjecture for 3-manifolds.  An important tool is the universal circle associated to a foliation with hyperbolic leaves (the generic case).  Using this tool, the PI has recently proved that in the case of R-covered foliations, then either the manifold is toroidal or there is a pseudo-Anosov flow transverse to the foliation. Such a flow has excellent dynamical properties and this gives a strong relationship with the topology of the manifold. One objective of this project is to analyze the universal circle construction for various families of foliations and to search for transverse pseudo-Anosov flows. A second goal is to study foliation and transverse flows as dual objects and to understand the deep consequences of their joint dynamical structure. The project aims to study general pseudo-Anosov flows and the additional structure imposed by a transverse foliation. A third goal of the project is to understand geometric behavior of foliations and transverse flows in hyperbolic 3-manifolds - the generic case.  The focus will be on the large scale geometric behavior in the universal cover. An important question to be analyzed is whether the pseudo-Anosov flows transverse to foliations are quasigeodesic - that is, whether they measure distances well. This property has been proved by the PI (and Lee Mosher) in the case of a flow transverse to a Reebless finite depth foliation. One objective of this study is to use the quasigeodesic property for flows to derive information about the asymptotic geometric behavior of the foliation transverse to the flow. This is specially promising in the case of general finite depth foliations.<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is an object that locally has 3-dimensions, like 3-dimensional Euclidean space. A 2-dimensional foliation of a3-manifold is a decomposition of the manifold into 2-dimensional objects, much like the pages of a book. Good foliations exist in large classes of 3-manifolds and they yield very useful information about the manifold. The goal of the project is to understand the relationship of the foliation with geometric and topological structures of the manifold. Geometry measures distance and roughly topology measures the structures of ""holes"" in the manifold. It is best to look at the universal cover of the manifold: for example the universal cover of a cylinder is obtained by unrolling it into an infinite carpet.  Universal covers are unbounded objects but they carry a lot of information about the manifold, contained in the ""folding"" allowed to recover the manifold. One important goal of the project is to analyse the foliation in the universal cover. Of particular interest is the large scale properties of the ""leaves"" of the foliation.  We will concentrate in the case where the manifold is hyperbolic -this is the generic situation. Finally there is a dual object to a foliation which is a transverse flow to the leaves of the foliation.  The flow and foliation jointly produce a rich dynamical structure in the manifold with many deep consequences. There are many cases when there is a ""tightest"" amongst all possible transverse flows.  The tightest flow should give information about the structure of the foliation and connections with the manifold. The tightest flow is called a pseudo-Anosov flow.<br/>"
