To classify such spaces we need to mathematically  understand the possible shapes they can take as well as their rigidity and flexibility properties. Such properties are called invariants of the spaces and they  arise from a variety of mathematical considerations, often with crucial input from physics. The proof of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture established that certain three-dimensional spaces, called manifolds, decompose into pieces with nice geometric properties. In the last few decades, ideas from quantum physics have led mathematicians to discover a variety of subtle invariants and structures of three-manifolds.There are several open conjectures, both in physics and in mathematics, that predict deep relations between quantum structures and geometries of three-manifolds. This project  will study the relations of these quantum invariants to the geometric structures arising from Thurston's picture, with an eye towards developing tools to tackle  open conjectures in topology and physics. The project includes topics for graduate  student research and contributes to training and professional development by providing critical support through mentoring and conference travel.<br/><br/><br/>One direction of the project will study relations between asymptotic aspects of Topological Quantum Field Theories, the coarse geometry of Teichmuller spaces and volumes of fibered 3-manifolds.Another direction will study  the asymptotic growth of the Turaev-Viro three-manifold invariants aiming to prove that it detects the existence of hyperbolic pieces in the geometric decompositions of three-manifolds. A third direction will continue the study of relations between the colored Jones knot polynomials and incompressible surfaces in link complements. The PI will further develop this framework and, in particular, study the strong slope conjecture, and its applications, within it. The PI will also use quantum invariants to understand classical invariants such as crossing numbers and crosscap numbers of knots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The annual Georgia Topology Conference has been an important event for the topological community ever since the first such conference was held in 1961. The focus of the 2023 conference will be the study of spaces of diffeomorphisms, symplectomorphisms and contactomorphisms in dimensions three and four. The 2024 edition will focus on surfaces in smooth 4-dimensional space. In both settings, we are interested in studying the properties of spaces which locally look like the space, or space-time, that we live in, and in which we can combine the tools of calculus with combinatorial and diagrammatic tools. In the first case, we study these spaces by thinking about their symmetries, and in the second case we study these spaces by thinking about how simpler objects (surfaces) sit inside the spaces. These are both hot topics that have seen some dramatic recent results and the purpose of the conferences is to bring advanced and beginning researchers together to learn about the details of recent results, to understand the next questions that need to be solved, and to kick start collaborations to address these questions.<br/><br/>The 2023 conference will focus on spaces of diffeomorphisms, symplectomorphisms and contactomorphisms in dimensions 3 and 4, and will be co-organized by co-PIs David Gay, Gordana Matic, Akram Alishahi and Michael Usher, with help from UGA postdocs Eduardo Fernandez Fuertes, Feride Ceren Kose and Lev Tovstopyat-Nelip. Much work in 4-dimensional topology has focused on classifying and distinguishing the objects, namely 4-manifolds, but an equally important project is to classify and distinguish the {morphisms, namely diffeomorphisms between 4-manifolds. To illustrate how little we know in the smooth setting, until very recently we had no idea whether the group of diffeomorphisms of the 4-ball which are the identity on the boundary was contractible. In a dramatic development, Watanabe showed in 2018 that this group is not contractible by showing that certain homotopy groups were nontrivial (thus disproving the smooth 4-dimensional Smale conjecture) but we still do not know if this group is even path connected. Given the importance of symplectic structures in dimension 4, it is interesting to compare this to Gromov's result that the space of symplectomorphisms of the 4-ball is contractible, along with similar results for contactomorphisms in dimension 3. The 2024 conference will focus on the smooth topology of surfaces embedded in 4-manifolds as a probe into smooth 4-dimensional topology in general. Numerous foundational open problems exist, such as the question of whether a smoothly embedded 2-sphere in the 4-sphere whose complement has cyclic fundamental group bounds a smoothly embedded 3-ball. At the same time there have been dramatic developments recently, such as Gabai's proof of the 4-dimensional lightbulb theorem, that in certain situations completely classifies smooth 2-spheres up to smooth isotopy in the presence of dual spheres. This is a very active area of study with contributions combining tools from gauge theory, Khovanov homology, higher dimensional Morse theory and explicit 4-dimensional visualization.

For example, a key step in finding all possible solutions to a system of equations is to understand the relevant collection, or ""group"", of symmetries of the system. The main goal of this project is to investigate two particular, yet, in a certain sense, ""universal"" symmetry groups: the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group (GRT), and the Kashiwara-Vergne group (KRV). Both are known to have deep connections to many important areas of mathematics and mathematical physics including: quantum theory, number theory, the theory of knots and tangles, and the theory of universal geometric invariants called ""motives"" in algebraic geometry. In spite of their significance, the structure of both groups remains quite mysterious. There are long-standing conjectures concerning their relationship to one another, as well as their relationship to other symmetry groups. In particular, A. Alekseev and C. Torossian proved that KRV contains GRT and conjectured that they are, in fact, equal, a question that remains unsolved. In this project, the PI and his collaborators will initiate a new multidisciplinary approach towards answering specific questions concerning GRT, KRV, and thus shed more light on the Alekseev and Torossian question. The PI?s focus will be on studying these groups via their actions on explicit geometric and topological objects. The project includes topics suitable for graduate student research and will help accelerate the growth of the nascent Mathematics Ph.D. program at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). The broader impacts of the project also include coordinating research and career development events with UNR's chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics. <br/>  <br/>This project will find supporting evidence for the validity of the Alekseev-Torossian conjecture by building on the PI's previous exhibiting non-trivial actions of GRT on smooth complex algebraic varieties, and a topological characterization of KRV using wheeled props and knotted surfaces in 4-dimensional space. The tools needed for this work will be constructed using homotopical and deformation-theoretic methods, which have already shown to be very successful in studying GRT and related phenomena. The anticipated outcomes include a ""Kashiwara-Vergne lift"" of formality morphisms in deformation quantization; new insights into Duflo theory and Rozansky-Witten theory; and new examples of GRT and KRV actions in algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Topology, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Central in this subject is the study of knotting and linking of circles in three-dimensional spaces, called knot theory. For instance, knots and links can be used to construct three- and four-dimensional spaces. Low dimensional topology and knot theory have various connections to cosmology and physics (the shape of the universe and string theory), and biochemistry (the knotting behavior of DNA molecules). Unintuitively, many classification questions in topology are harder in dimensions three and four, and over the past three decades, topologists have developed modern tools (with roots in physics) for studying these questions. Two examples of such tools are Heegaard Floer invariants, which grew out of gauge theory, and Khovanov homology, which has roots in representation theory. This project will further develop these invariants and investigate their similarities and relations. Moreover, it will harness their power to study symmetries of surfaces (two-dimensional spaces), in connection with hyperbolic geometry and dynamics, and will investigate several fundamental questions in low-dimensional topology such as finding the minimum number of times a knot must cross itself to become unknotted. In parallel, this project aims to make mathematics and in particular topology accessible to a broad audience, through educational activities at all levels with an emphasis on diversity and inclusion. These activities include, establishing a Math Circle program in the Athens-Clarke County public library and organizing summer Math Camps for high school and middle school students, running a summer research experience project for undergraduate students and a topology summer school for graduate students and postdocs. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The major goals of this research program are organized around four areas. First, developing new invariants for studying spatial graphs and graph concordance. The main tool will be a generalization of (minus) Heegaard Floer homology called, tangle Floer homology. Studying spatial graphs up to concordance has applications in studying equivariant concordance between knots, and strong concordance between links. Second, studying mapping class group and extensions of surface diffeomorphisms over handlebodies using another generalization of Heegaard Floer homology, called bordered Heegaard Floer homology. Third, further developing the bordered Heegaard Floer homology tools by generalizing and refining the contact invariant defined by the PI and her co-authors and use it to address open questions in contact topology. Lastly, the PI focuses on connections and similarities between Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer invariants, with the three major goals of defining new concordance invariants to study smooth 4D Poincare conjecture, finding new lower bounds for the unknotting number and developing new invariants for transverse knots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of deformations of possible geometric structures on manifolds arises naturally in many fields of mathematics as well as in physics. The PI will also contribute to the mathematical community through involvement in the Inquiry Based Learning Center at the University of Michigan, his involvement in the formation of the MACSS scholars program which is designed to support low-income students majoring in Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics, curriculum development for undergraduate courses, serving as editor of mathematical journals, organizing conferences, and mentoring undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral assistant professors.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project focuses on the study of the Hitchin component of higher rank structures on surfaces and on space of hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds.

Striking analogies with classical Teichmuller theory have been discovered, including pressure metrics which generalize the Weil-Petersson metric from classical Teichmuller theory. The metric completion of the Teichmuller space of a closed surface, with respect to the Weil-Petersson metric, is the augmented Teichmuller space, which one may view as the orbifold universal cover of moduli space.

The project uses knot theory techniques to develop a model that can be used to quantify and to relate local topological complexity with biophysical processes. The model can also be used to potentially design synthetic biopolymers with special biophysical properties. The project includes a number of research problems suitable for collaboration with undergraduate students, as well as outreach and dissemination activities that seek to increase interest in mathematics more generally. The PI has successfully involved undergraduate students in similar research in the past and will continue to advise and encourage students to continue careers in mathematics and related areas.   <br/><br/>The research is split into three parts, two seek to connect quantum topology with hyperbolic geometry and one applies knot theory to molecular biology. One project concerns a version of the Volume Conjecture based the theory of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra from quantum topology and its relationship to the Teichmuller space of a surface from hyperbolic geometry. A second project studies algebraic and geometric properties of a generalization of the Kauffman bracket algebra which is related to the decorated Teichmuller space of a surface with punctures. A third project involves a collaboration with a biophysicist to study local entanglements that are held tightly in place by molecular forces in biopolymers. The proposed knot-theoretic model would give a description of such local entanglements, allowing one to quantify and measure changes in the local topological complexity of biopolymers in experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will lead to advances in equivariant homotopy theory, an enhancement of homotopy theory which is sensitive to the symmetries of shapes.

Equivariant Steenrod operations will immediately lead to equivariant analogs of Stiefel-Whitney classes which can find many applications in the study of equivariant vector bundles and equivariant smooth manifolds. Atiyah Real vector bundles, which are important examples of equivariant vector bundles, will be studied. In particular, the James periodicity number of tautological Atiyah Real vector bundles will be determined using an equivariant analog of the Adams conjecture formulated using Atiyah Real K-theory.

This object often has a complicated shape reflecting properties of the singularity. In this context, the PI will study a number of questions relating algebraic and topological properties of the link and its fillings that are four-dimensional shapes with given boundary. The project includes applications of these shapes to other much-studied questions in geometry and the role they may play in certain new constructions. The research has applications in several other areas of mathematics and science.

The PI will co-organize research seminars, conferences, workshops, and continue her editorial work at Quantum Topology, a research journal. <br/><br/>The PI?s collaborative research will make significant contributions to important areas in topology of three- and four-manifolds, with connections to algebraic geometry and combinatorics. This project will further develop and expand recent results of the PI and her collaborators, where a new perspective and novel tools were introduced to the study of symplectic and contact topology of links of singularities. One of the important questions to be addressed is the comparison between symplectic fillings that arise in the algebraic context and those that have more general nature. In addition to fillings, symplectic cobordisms will be studied. The PI plans to find applications of the newly-developed tools to constructions of exotic smooth four-manifolds and exotically knotted surfaces. Another goal is to understand further connections between combinatorial and symplectic phenomena, and in particular, to use invariants such as Khovanov homology to detect ""unexpected"" monodromy factorizations and symplectic fillings.

Analyzing the dynamics of these time series of random objects requires qualitative inference methods that capture information on the geometric properties, i.e., the evolution of descriptors of the 'shape.' Analyzing shape is of paramount interest in many research areas such as genomics, climatology, neuroscience, and finance. In this project, we develop novel methodology and provide probabilistic and statistical foundations to model, analyze, and predict the evolution over time of geometric and topological features of data sets. The research will broaden the scope of the methodological interface between mathematics, computer science, statistics, and probability theory and will have direct applications to genomics and cell biology. We focus our theoretical work to support applications coming from two areas in genomics; cell differentiation in development and tumor evolution. This will be done in collaboration with the Herbert and Florence Irving Institute for cancer dynamics (IICD) at Columbia University. The research findings are also expected to influence model-building and data analysis techniques in geospatial data. Besides the theoretical contribution, we will provide software packages to make the inference methods available to a broad audience. The PIs further propose to design classes and produce expository notes from a cross-disciplinary perspective, and provide projects at the interface of mathematical statistics and topological data analysis for summer undergraduate mentoring.<br/><br/>Over the past few decades, there has been substantial interest in the area of geometric data analysis known as topological data analysis (TDA); this provides qualitative multiscale shape descriptors for point clouds. However, in order to draw reliable qualitative inferences on shape and topological features, it is crucial to account for the (evolving) spatial and temporal dependence present in the data. To address these questions, we take the point of view that the fundamental datum is a function, i.e., the observations are points in a function space. This perspective integrates statistical methodology and TDA in the context of functional time series (FTS). We provide novel methodology to model, analyze and predict data generated from nonstationary metric space-valued stochastic processes. Our framework establishes the statistical and probabilistic foundations for applying multiscale geometric descriptors to meaningfully capture their evolving geometric features as well as the investigation of topological invariants. This new methodology will allow practitioners to perform statistical inference to address important scientific questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A group can be thought of as the set of symmetries of an object such as a water molecule or a Rubik's Cube.  A single group can represent the symmetries of many geometric or topological spaces.  If the chosen space is nice enough and can be sufficiently well understood, the characteristics of the spaces can reveal properties inherent to the group.  One can take the opposite approach as well.  Often one can detect properties of a topological or geometric space by studying groups which describe their symmetries.  This project aims to explore these connections between groups and the spaces on which they act.  Broader impacts of the project include continued mentoring through various programs and networks, public outreach for middle and high school students, and dissemination of knowledge through conference organization.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is primarily on groups acting on infinite trees and on boundaries of infinite trees.  This includes large classes of groups; for instance it contains all residually finite groups but also many of the known examples of infinite simple groups.  The first goal of the project is to extend the PI's past work to better understand the universe of infinite simple groups.  The last 10 years have seen an influx of new and surprising theorems illuminating the understanding of the variety of groups in this class.  The PI will study groups in the extended Thompson family using their partial actions on a rooted tree, their full action on the Stein-Farley complex, and their embeddings into the homeomorphism group of the Cantor space.  The second goal of the project is to better understand branch and automata groups.  Over the last forty years, this class of groups has served as a rich source of exotic yet tractable groups.  The PI will use automata theory to investigate questions of growth and torsion and apply the long developed theory of branch groups to work towards a general theory of maximal subgroups of branch groups. The final focus of the project is on group properties coming from topological constructions.  The PI will develop a geometric group theory analog of the topological theory of branch coverings as well as explore connections between the general theory of homological stability and topological finiteness properties, first through certain natural subgroups of some big mapping class groups by exploiting actions on highly connected complexes related to the curve complex.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The homotopy groups of spheres are collections of continuous functions between spheres considered up to certain deformations.  These groups hold fundamental information about maps between topological spaces and have deep connections to number theory, differential topology, and geometric topology.  However, despite their simple definition, the homotopy groups of spheres are extremely difficult to compute.  To better understand these groups, chromatic homotopy theory is a powerful tool that organizes theory and computations by analyzing the algebraic geometry of smooth one-parameter formal groups.  The moduli stack of formal groups has a stratification by height, which corresponds in the stable homotopy category to localizations with respect to the Lubin-Tate theories. The Lubin-Tate theories give rise to higher periodicity in the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and studying them is one of the most important areas of research in chromatic homotopy theory.  Starting from Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel's resolution of the Kervaire invariant problem, the newly developed equivariant machinery offers new methods to attack problems in chromatic homotopy theory that were notoriously difficult to approach via classical methods.  The planned research explores the connections between equivariant homotopy theory and chromatic homotopy theory, and uses cutting-edge equivariant technology to produce state-of-the-art computations in chromatic homotopy theory.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will study periodicity phenomena in the stable homotopy groups of spheres through the lens of equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory. In current and ongoing projects, the PI establishes the first known connection between the obstruction-theoretic actions in chromatic homotopy theory and the geometry of complex conjugations. Using this newly discovered connection, the PI will study Lubin-Tate theories as equivariant spectra and use equivariant machinery developed by Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel to produce higher chromatic height computations at the prime 2.  This project aims to deepen the connection between equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory by proving Periodicity, Gap, and Detection theorems for norms of Real bordism theories and fixed points of Lubin-Tate theories. The PI will carry out more chromatic computations to study the last open case of the Kervaire invariant problem.

For example, groups appear in the study of shapes of geometric objects, crystals and quasi-crystals, structure of roots of polynomials, cryptography, algorithm design etc. The study of finite groups, i.e. groups with finitely many elements, has reached a fairly mature stage, accumulating to a complete classification of finite simple groups. However, most infinite groups are fairly mysterious and hard to understand. In the 1980s, Gromov proposed a geometric approaches to group theory.  One idea was to realize the mysterious group as a collection of symmetries of some geometric objects with interesting curvature properties, allowing us to study groups from the viewpoint of geometry. This has evolved into a very active field called geometric group theory. This proposal aims to study problems in the frontier of geometric group theory, and seeks applications to some long-standing problems in topology. The proposal also aims to provide resources for training graduate students and postdocs working in the area at the Ohio State University, with an emphasis on supporting under-represented early career stage mathematicians at OSU working in this filed.<br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with rigidity and curvature properties of some infinite discrete groups from the viewpoint of geometric group theory, combined with ideas and techniques from ergodic theory, metric geometry, metric graph theory and combinatorial group theory. The project has two more specific research goals. The first is to make progress on a major conjecture on Artin groups, using a new strategy motivated from ideas in metric graph theory. The second is to understand fundamental forms of rigidity for discrete groups, namely quasi-isometric rigidity and measure equivalence rigidity. The project emphasizes the close connections between these forms of rigidity and the curvature properties of singular metric spaces and groups. Several classes of groups of fundamental importance are studied, including Artin groups, CAT(0) groups, graph products etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such operations can carry a classical, or even more intriguingly a quantum algebraic structure. Originally appearing in physical models within statistical mechanics and quantum integrable systems, quantum groups and the theory surrounding them are now a thriving source of uncovering new mathematical principles. This project will develop a richer understanding of this theory by building a common ground for combining algebraic, combinatorial, and higher-structural categorical techniques for the study of quantum groups and associated diagram algebras. This will lead to a more unified approach and provide connections between several areas of mathematics, as well as potential physical applications. The project will involve the participation of undergraduate students and create opportunities for discussion and collaboration among early-career researchers. <br/><br/>Specifically, the project will answer several questions about the representation theory of quantum groups and their related algebras from a categorical and a combinatorial perspective. In more detail, the centers of quantum groups are key to understanding the structure of their representations, which have further key symmetries captured by braid and cactus groups. The actions of quantum groups are intertwined with actions of Hecke and Temperley-Lieb algebras, informing each other's behavior and the structures of their representations. The main goals of the project are to first construct and diagonalize elements of the centers of categorified quantum groups, and use the resulting collection of idempotents to study the decomposition of categorical representations. Subsequently, the PI will develop new tools and build connections between braid and cactus group actions, both on the classical and higher-structure, categorical level, and in the process develop the representation theory of the cactus group. Finally, the PI will investigate a family of closely related diagram algebras?the two-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebras?and unite three radial viewpoints of their standard modules, which will enable the study of their decomposition and irreducibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a foundation in modern physics, quantum field theory remains the best experimentally-verified model of the real world. A topological quantum field theory (TQFT) is a quantum field theory whose correlation functions do not depend on the geometries of the spacetime. Hence it computes quantities which are not sensitive to the shape of the spacetime; this is essentially what topology is about. The quantities computed from a TQFT are called quantum invariants. They provide powerful tools to understand curved spacetimes -- manifolds. Mathematically, TQFTs bridge several subjects including tensor categories, low dimensional topology, and quantum computing. This project aims to study quantum invariants of three- and four-dimensional manifolds. The PI will use innovative methods to construct interesting quantum invariants. The broader impacts of the project contain mentoring and outreach. The PI will continue mentoring students and postdocs to work on topics related to the project. The PI will also organize conferences as a platform to foster collaboration and broaden participation of research.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to investigate non-semisimple quantum invariants of three and four manifolds. Previously, the PI initiated the program of constructing Kuperberg-type invariants of 4-manifolds utilizing trisection diagrams and Hopf triplets. The Hopf triplets, serving as the algebraic input to the construction, were initially assumed to be semisimple and this was recently generalized to the non-semisimple case, but specific examples of such triplets have not been found. This project will continue the development of the program. Firstly, the PI plans to systematically search for non-semisimple Hopf triplets that produce invariants of 4-manifolds. Besides theoretical studies of its properties, extensive computations will be conducted on exotic manifolds to assess the strength of the invariant. Secondly, the PI will refine the procedure to derive an invariant of complex spin structures of 4-manifolds by using Hopf triplets consisting of Hopf superalgebras. Thirdly, the construction will be extended to its full generality by introducing the notion of trialgebras. In dimension three, the project aims to extend the Kuperberg invariant on the basis of weak Hopf algebras, and thus provides a unification of various 3-dimensional quantum invariants. Additionally, the PI will mathematically explore a novel program of constructing modular tensor categories from 3-manifolds using techniques from geometric topology. Specifically, the PI will develop methods to produce the F- and R-matrices of the category which are currently not achievable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stable homotopy theory, a central part of algebraic topology, expands from the study of spaces to that of spectra, which are ""stabilized spaces"" that also represent generalized cohomology theories, or ways to assign algebraic invariants to spaces or other spectra. Equivariant stable homotopy theory further adds to spectra the actions of groups, which can be thought of as ways to map a spectrum to itself in composable and invertible ways. Equivariant stable homotopy theory has grown to be an important tool that offers insights into many deep questions in algebraic topology. The techniques of equivariant stable homotopy theory have also found applications in other areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry and number theory. The broader impact aspect of the project includes mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in mathematical research. The principal investigator (PI) will also continue outreach efforts by working to make her research area accessible to the public.<br/><br/>This project includes a circle of ideas in equivariant stable homotopy theory.

Representation theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with the study of symmetry using techniques from linear algebra. Classical examples of symmetry in geometry include reflections of a square and rotations of a sphere. Modern research in mathematics naturally encounters more abstract notions of symmetry and so requires the development of more advanced techniques for their study. This project will identify and study concrete instances of these abstract symmetries and apply the results to advance the mathematical understanding of quantum field theory in dimensions two (via Landau-Ginzburg models) and three (via Rozansky-Witten models). Two novel features of these quantum field theories are that they are defined on non-orientable geometries or involve non-semisimple categories of line operators; both features make them particularly challenging to study. This project provides research and career training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>More specifically, the PI will engage in three related research projects, all of which involve students. Through the first project the PI will develop a theory of real equivariant matrix factorizations, using techniques from categorical representation theory, and apply the results to formulate a mathematical theory of Landau-Ginzburg orientifolds. In the second project the PI will extend prior work on the representation theory of cohomological Hall algebras and its applications to orientifold Donaldson-Thomas theory. In the third project the PI will use the representation theory of quantum supergroups to construct the equivariant Rozansky-Witten theory of a holomorphic symplectic manifold.

Symmetries are formalized mathematically via algebraic objects called groups. The PI adopts a modern perspective by seeking out spaces where abstract groups can manifest as symmetries of those spaces. Leveraging the geometric properties of those spaces, one can deduce algebraic properties of the groups, and vice versa. The robust interplay between algebra and geometry is a central theme in mathematics, and working in low dimensions offers the distinct advantage of working with concrete objects. These objects can be visualized, drawn, modeled, and held, allowing for a true and intuitive understanding. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. While this project belongs to pure mathematics, the skills developed, such as strong geometric intuition and imagination, hold wide-ranging applications beyond mathematics. <br/><br/>A fundamental theorem in surface theory is the Nielsen-Thurston classification of surface homeomorphisms. Inspired by Bers?s proof of the classification theorem, the PI recasts several extremal problems in complex analysis using the language of hyperbolic geometry. The solutions to these problems have several applications, including a new proof of the Nielsen-Thurston classification and the classification of isometries in the Thurston metric on Teichmuller space. The PI's projects aim to develop a Nielsen-Thurston theory for surfaces of infinite-type, arguably the most important problem in this burgeoning field. In addition to surfaces, the PI will study the outer automorphism Out(Fn) groups of free groups.

Being one of the largest conferences in the world dedicated to young researchers in this field, the YTM provides a unique opportunity for junior topologists to gain experience giving conference presentations to a wide audience, broaden their horizons by learning about subfields not represented at their institutions, expose their work to the international topology community, and develop collaborations with other young researchers. Furthermore, the YTM seeks to promote diversity by featuring graduate student speakers from underrepresented groups and from universities that are less well-represented in topology and by providing a friendly and welcoming community for students from all backgrounds. By funding US participants, the NSF is promoting the exchange of scientific ideas between the US and the international topology community, providing a setting for young topologists from the US to make research connections and develop relationships with their future international colleagues, as well as supporting a culture of diversity and inclusion.<br/><br/>Two mini courses will be run by Katharine Turner (ANU)  on Persistent Homology Transform (PHT), covering the mathematical theory behind these topological transforms, outlining some statistical methodology and also surveying a variety of nice applications from disease prognosis from the shapes of brain tumors to the identification of plants from their leaf contours, and by Marc Hoyois (Uni Regensberg) on motivic homotopy theory with a view towards the formalism of six functors. The latter is a general categorical framework for homology and cohomology devised by Grothendieck, which explains and generalizes many non-trivial facts like Poincar duality and the Lefschetz trace formula.

They model many types of behavior, from animal neurons to epidemics to weather modeling.  In some cases, we have a classification of the simplest types, and know how they are arranged.  For example, we have now a good understanding in the real quadratic case. This achievement was the result of work by many researchers from different fields. It remains a central challenge to give a classification of examples beyond the real quadratic setting.  This project takes up this challenge using tools from several different areas of mathematics.  It focuses on systems that involve complex numbers, and on more general types called conformal.  The conformal dynamical systems studied in this project include newly discovered, more exotic examples.  Though our understanding of those more general systems is poorer, we have many new tools, from algebra to analysis, with which to study them.  The project applies techniques from the well-developed theory of mapping class groups to the classification problem.  Mapping class groups are symmetries of two-dimensional objects and are studied by both mathematicians and physicists. This project generalizes the notion of a mapping class group in a way that includes these two-dimensional complex dynamical systems.  It also applies new tools from the recently developed theory of self-similar groups. This research area has an abundance of accessible problems.  Students who engage with these topics will come to appreciate the essential unity of mathematics and the excitement of research. This will contribute to the development of a pool of mathematical talent that is broadly trained.  Special software designed for this study allows for rich experimentation and the development of technical skills.   <br/><br/>The combinatorial foundations of complex dynamical systems were laid by A. Douady, J. Hubbard, and W. Thurston. The lack of a sufficiently natural algebraic framework delayed progress on fundamental problems until new techniques were introduced by L. Bartholdi and V. Nekrashevych in 2006. These selfsimilar group techniques are now standard. The recent developments in this new field are paralleling those in the theory of mapping class groups. The natural objects?branched self-covers of the sphere whose forward orbits of branch points form a finite set?may be fruitfully regarded as representing branched mapping classes in a countable semigroup. That this semigroup is in addition a biset over the pure mapping class group makes the combinatorial structure immensely rich. Just as with mapping class groups, on the semigroup side, there are similarly very deep connections to Teichmueller theory, dynamics, geometry, and algorithmic questions. The fuller exploration of these connections is the focus of this project. Basic dynamical finiteness results, and the development of an appropriate notion of relative hyperbolicity, are currently lacking. Intriguingly, the notions of relative hyperbolicity seem to lead naturally to connections with both coarse geometry and arithmetic dynamics on Berkovich spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the individual parts of a car are relatively simple, but assemble into a complex and powerful machine; sectional images from MRI can be used to reconstruct a picture of the human body that carries enough information to diagnose medical problems.  Studying objects as the amalgam of simpler pieces has great utility in mathematics.  This project concerns complicated spaces that can be built out of simpler ones, namely surfaces, like the surface of a ball or a doughnut (as well as more complicated surfaces).  The instructions for assembling the pieces are described by a mathematical object called the mapping class group, which carries all the information necessary to build certain spaces from surfaces.  The PI will work with a diverse team of PhD students, postdocs, and colleagues and investigate the kinds of spaces that can be built from surfaces, and their geometric, algebraic, and analytic features.<br/><br/>This project involves the study of surfaces of finite and infinite type, their mapping class groups, and geometric features of manifolds and bundles we can understand from these.  The PI, together with his students, postdocs, and collaborators, will focus on the following themes:  (1) Convex cocompact and geometrically finite subgroups of the mapping class group for finite type surfaces and the geometry of the associated extension groups/surface bundles. (2) The hyperbolic geometry of depth-one foliations via mapping tori of end-periodic homeomorphism. (3) The geometric group theory of ``medium size? mapping class groups naturally containing end-periodic homeomorphisms.

Within the world of natural numbers, only 1 and -1 are invertible, yet all non-zero rational numbers have an inverse. In stable homotopy theory, the role that numbers play in ordinary arithmetic is taken by objects called spectra, which arise as algebraic invariants of topological spaces that are unaffected by continuous deformations. There are not very many invertible spectra, only spheres of various dimensions. Here again we observe a phenomenon that the situation changes when we pass to certain localizations analogous to passing from the integers to the rationals. The localizations in question are studied by chromatic homotopy theory, which aims to disassemble complicated homotopical information into building blocks with more understandable with more regular behaviors. This proposal aims to undertake a systematic study of the role of symmetries to get a grasp of the exotic invertible objects in chromatic homotopy, with the hope of understanding the extent to which such exotic objects can be understood as twisted versions of spheres. The main focus of the PIs broader impacts is the rebuilding and strengthening the mathematical community in the post-coronavirus pandemic, through efforts such as organizing workshops, conferences, seminars, discussions, as well as a research program at a mathematical institute, all with a particular emphasis on inclusivity and support for underserved groups.<br/><br/>The research supported by this grant will work towards a better understanding of large-scale invertibility phenomena in chromatic homotopy theory, namely the exotic K(n)-local Picard groups, by attempting to organize a variety of ad-hoc computational methods into a systematic investigation using equivariant and representation-theoretic methods. At least two different avenues will be pursued: one is a shift of focus from subgroups to quotients of the Morava stabilizer group, already subtly present in the PIs previous work (with Barthel, Beaudry, Bobkova, Goerss, Henn, and Pham) on determinant spheres, and on the K(2)-local exotic Picard group at the prime 2. The other idea, pursued in a collaboration with Dicks, is a completely new use of Mazurs classical deformation theory of modular representations, which is much less explored but is promising new connections and deeper understanding of invertible objects in chromatic homotopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These dimensions are special from an anthropic perspective, since they model our everyday perception of the physical world.  They are also special from a mathematical perspective, since the phenomena they exhibit, and the collection of techniques used to study them are rather different from those in higher dimensions.  The research component of the project explores a collection of important problems from across low-dimensional topology.  A concrete example is a famous old problem which asks whether every continuous closed curve in the plane contains the vertices of a square. A unifying thread through the research is the use of modern methods from nearby fields, such as combinatorics (the mathematics of discrete structures) and symplectic geometry (the geometry of classical mechanics).  Alongside the research, the PI proposes education and training initiatives reaching audiences from high schoolers to professional mathematicians.  The PI will continue his active involvement with mathematics enrichment at the high school level through the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics and through Mathematical Staircase, Inc.

Combinatorial and symplectic methods have long influenced the field.  Amongst the various techniques that come to bear on low-dimensional topology are Floer homology, graphs of surface intersections, and lattice-theoretic methods.

These surfaces inherit their own hyperbolic structures from their inclusion into the 3-manifold, and these structures are very coarsely encoded by collections of curves on the surface.  Miraculously, in key situations, the hyperbolic 3-manifold can be reconstituted from this collection of curves--this is the essential content of the Ending Lamination Theorem.  The mathematics developed to study curves used in the proof of this theorem simultaneously provide a powerful toolkit for studying mapping class groups of surfaces.

Since spheres are the fundamental building blocks of topological spaces, the stable stems, which encode the possible relations between high-dimensional spheres up to continuous deformation, are a central object of study. Beyond topology, the stable stems have surprisingly broad applications throughout mathematics, ranging from geometric problems, such as classifying differentiable structures on spheres, to algebraic problems, such as classifying projective modules over rings. This project will explore further applications of stable homotopy theory in algebra, topology, and geometry. Broader impacts center on online community building. The PI will continue co-organizing the Electronic Computational Homotopy Theory Online Research Community, which aims to increase inclusion at the undergraduate, graduate, and senior levels by organizing undergraduate research opportunities, graduate courses, online seminars, mini-courses, and networking events. To address inequality at the K-12 level, the PI will develop and manage a program pairing undergraduates from his home institution with students from local after-school programs for online tutoring. This program would circumvent certain barriers to participation, such as lack of access to transportation and facilities, which are common in traditional outreach.<br/><br/>Specific research projects include the study of the stable stems and their applications in geometric topology, algebro-geometric analogues of the stable stems and their connections to number theory, and equivariant analogues of algebraic K-theory and their applications in algebra and geometry. More specifically, building on previous work, the PI will study the stable stems using topological modular forms and the Mahowald invariant, aiming to deduce the existence of exotic spheres in new dimensions. In a related direction, the PI will use the kq-resolution introduced in previous work to study the motivic stable stems, an algebro-geometric analogues of the stable stems. The main goal is to apply the kq-resolution to relate the motivic stable stems to arithmetic invariants like Hermitian K-theory. Real algebraic K-theory, which encodes classical invariants like algebraic K-theory, Hermitian K-theory, and L-theory, will also be studied using the trace methods developed in previous work. The overarching goal is extending results from algebraic K-theory to real algebraic K-theory, thereby obtaining results for Hermitian K-theory and L-theory that will have applications in algebra and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Homotopy type theory is a new field of Mathematics that draws on multiple disciplines, including logic, homotopy theory, category theory, and computer science. It is closely tied to the development of new computerized proof assistants that permit mathematical proofs to be constructed interactively and verified to be correct.  Student participants will learn about both the theory and practice of such computational tools, which are becoming increasingly important in the exact sciences.<br/><br/>Homotopy type theory is based on recently discovered connections between constructive type theory, homotopy theory, and higher category theory.  Martin-Lf?s dependent type theory is a formal system that underlies computerized proof assistants such as Lean, Coq, and Agda.  This system was recently shown to interpret into certain higher-categories originally developed for homotopy theory.  As a result, it can also be used for reasoning in higher mathematics.  Importantly, the proof assistants based on it can then be used to formally verify difficult results in these areas not previously attainable by such tools.  Extensions to the system suggested by the new applications also greatly extend the range of mathematics that can be developed and formalized using proof assistants.

The conference has been a force in the mathematical life of topologists and geometers in the northeastern United States since 1963, providing an arena for the development and dissemination of a broad array of results from within algebraic, differential, and geometric topology and allied subjects. The activities are designed to encourage mathematical breadth and exchange of ideas between different branches of topology, as well as to welcome early career mathematicians into the field and promote interactions between junior and senior participants.   Each year, several of the talks cluster around one significant theme, in order to communicated a recent research development in one subarea to topologists across other areas, and to educate graduate students and early career researchers on a subject of recent interest.   Each iteration of the conference starts with a day of introductory talks by early junior speakers, and a colloquium talk on the history of the topic chosen for the main theme. It also includes a lightning session of short talks on exciting new research directions.  All of these activities serve to counter recent trends towards increasing specialization, by showcasing developments across inter-related fields at an accessible level.  <br/><br/>The area of interest for the 2023 conference will be recent developments in the theory of 4-manifolds, a topic with deep connections to geometric, algebraic, and symplectic topology and geometry.   About one third of the talks will be on this subject, in order to introduce topologists across sub-disciplines to this area in more detail than obtainable by attending a single talk or mini-course.  Possible future themes include: high dimensional negatively curved manifolds, trace methods, and homotopy type theory; although the organizers remain flexible should a new exciting development come to light elsewhere.  The remainder of talks at the conference showcase a broad range of recent developments in different areas of topology, selected with a view towards breadth.   Additionally, all speakers participate in a ?lightning round?  consisting of short pitches of recent exciting work by others and speculation on future trends. This gives a forward-looking perspective on new developments and stimulates discussion.  The opening introductory day of activities and graduate student talks provides a point of entry for interested non-experts and encourages graduate student involvement.  The broader impacts of the activities include a more broadly-trained community of topologists, able to transcend the boundaries of subspecialties; a more diverse mathematical workforce; a more rapid integration of younger topologists into areas of current research; and the enhancement of collaboration among researchers in different areas of topology.  The training effects of the conference will be extended by dissemination of lecture notes from the workshops and summaries of the panel discussion and problem session; the main vehicle for this is the conference web site, which has been maintained continuously since 1997.<br/><br/>https://e.math.cornell.edu/sites/topology/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will focus on developing connections between trisection theory, an emerging area of research in four-manifold topology, and the study of the topology and geometry of symplectic four-manifolds. It will catalyze research developments by bringing together mathematicians of all career stages ? including established experts, early-career researchers, and students ? and will have a number of features that are designed to actively engage the participants. First, there will be pre-workshop, virtual, introductory mini-courses given by experts in the field and designed to preview and motivate the central topics of the workshop. Second, there will be both plenary talks and shorter, lightning-style talks aimed at highlighting recent developments by a wide range of researchers during the morning sessions. Third, the workshop will feature afternoon working-group sessions in which participants will collaborate on open problems relating to the theory of trisections and symplectic topology and geometry of four-manifolds.<br/><br/>Symplectic geometry originally arose from Hamiltonian mechanics but has since developed into a rich field of its own with applications to several areas of mathematics, such as complex geometry, algebraic geometry, exotic smooth structures on four-manifolds, singularity theory, dynamics, and mirror symmetry. Despite decades of development and many seminal advances, seemingly basic problems ? such as the symplectic isotopy problem ? remain wide open. Trisection theory provides new combinatorial methods to study symplectic manifolds and offers a new perspective to shed light on difficult open problems. This provides a starting point for many new directions and applications and a rich opportunity for making advances through the synergy of these two fields. In the ten years since its introduction, trisection theory has developed to touch nearly every facet of four-manifold topology ? from comparing smooth structures and introducing new invariants to representing knotted surfaces and describing surgery operations. The workshop will build on recent successes of the theory highlighting the interplay between the symplectic and complex geometry of four-manifolds and the combinatorial features of trisections. These include: a characterization of symplectic surfaces in the complex projective plane as those admitting transverse shadow diagrams; a proof of the existence of trisections on symplectic four-manifolds that are compatible with the ambient symplectic structure; and an established correspondence between certain complex curves in the complex projective plane and hexagonal lattices on the torus that yields a combinatorial approach to the symplectic isotopy problem.

The tentative topics for the mini-courses are: 1) virtual algebraic fibering of groups, an algebraic analogue to topological fibering of manifolds; 2) Artin groups, a family of groups vastly generalizing braid groups and right-angled Artin groups; 3) locally compact groups, a powerful framework for the study of finitely generated groups acting by isometries on metric spaces. The principal aims of the conference will be to facilitate in-person interactions between participants, attract and maintain new mathematical talent and encourage a diverse group of early career researchers. To this end, the conference will feature problem sessions attached to the mini-courses, poster presentations for early career participants, thematic lunches, and a panel discussion.

Since the 1970s, it has been known that there is a deep relationship between foliations and diffeomorphism groups (or symmetry groups of manifolds), and algebraic properties of these groups have been used to study foliations. This project aims to use foliation theory to extract information about these symmetry groups and to apply recently developed techniques around the study of diffeomorphism groups to generate new results on the structure of foliations. The project will also support educational initiatives, including a biweekly program for high school students to introduce them to mathematical thinking and the use of math in the daily world around them. <br/><br/>This project will apply a bundle theoretic point of view to a conjecture of Haefliger and Thurston on the cohomology of diffeomorphism groups.  The results will in turn lead to a multitude of research directions around the invariance of flat bundles. In previous work, the PI provided evidence that in the piecewise linear (PL) category this conjecture is related to the algebraic K-theory of real numbers and proved the conjecture for codimension 2 PL foliations. With Monod, the PI developed techniques to compute the bounded cohomology of certain diffeomorphism groups leading to boundedness results for certain invariants of flat bundles. The project aims to further develop these techniques to compute the bounded and continuous cohomology of diffeomorphism groups with the goal of better understanding the group cohomology of diffeomorphism groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Second, if one wants to study some collection of spaces (for a simple example, think of polygons in the plane), then it can be helpful to turn this collection of spaces into a single space (often called a moduli space) whose properties are illuminating. For the educational component, the PI will organize topology workshops with the aim of introducing graduate students to active areas of research and giving them tools to contribute to these areas.

Regarding group actions, the focus is on determining when a group of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms can be realized as a group of homeomorphisms. This problem, known as Nielsen realization, dates back to the work of Nielsen in the early 1900s and has connections to dynamics, foliation theory, and the geometry of manifolds and fiber bundles. The moduli spaces of interest in this proposal relate to low-dimensional topology and nonpositive curvature. A central goal is to compute new homological and homotopical invariants of the moduli spaces of interest. The specific research project are as follows. (1) Solve Nielsen realization problems for 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds. (2) Study finite groups actions on aspherical manifolds with exotic smooth structures using rigidity results related to the Borel conjecture. (3) Show non-triviality of twist tori in the homology of finite covers of moduli space by reducing the problem to tropical geometry and combinatorics.

The workshops will include introductory lectures and research talks by leading experts as well as offer the early career researchers the professional development opportunity to present their own work and form new international collaborations.<br/><br/>The multiple connections between the seemingly disparate themes of these workshops can be articulated by the central role played by spaces of representations of a discrete group into a larger group: for example a Lie group, groups of diffeomorphisms or groups of homeomorphisms. These are powerful tools in unpacking the structure of the original group, particularly when it is the fundamental group of a compact manifold. The classical case of surface group representations is particularly noteworthy, providing connections with Teichmuller Theory, three-manifold topology and more recently Higher Teichmuller theory. In the setting of Higher Teichmuller theory there is a very different perspective given through the lens of Higgs bundles over a compact surface (equipped with a complex structure).  Since Hitchin's original insight around thirty years ago, this viewpoint has had a tremendous impact in geometry, topology and theoretical physics.
