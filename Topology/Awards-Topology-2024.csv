The workshop centers on a series of long-standing conjectures that appear in parallel in two major fields of mathematics. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers from these two fields to discuss recent advances on these conjectures. Another goal is to train more researchers to work on these important problems and help them build connections between the two fields. The overarching goal of this award would be to increase US participation in this highly active area of research, and to foster collaborations between US mathematicians and those from other countries. The funding is aimed especially at postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, as well as participants who do not have independent funding, to attend this workshop, and it will also be used to encourage participation by individuals from underrepresented groups in mathematics. A recent workshop held in Banff, Canada in 2022 initiated this goal, and funding for this event would cement the connections already made and build new ones for younger participants. The bridges we are building will not only connect researchers located in different countries but also between those working in different areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Algebra and topology are thriving branches of mathematics that are well represented in most math departments. Commutative algebra, as the algebraic underpinnings of algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology, with its strong focus on homology and homotopy, have occasional significant overlap in both methods and aims. The goal is to create a strong working alliance between the groups working on these conjectures and related problems, and also to get younger researchers involved in these problems. In fact, total Betti numbers appear in related, decades-old rank conjectures in commutative algebra and equivariant topology. On the topological side, Halperin and Carlsson conjectured that the total Betti number of a compact space with a free torus action or p-torus action of rank r is bounded below by 2r, which has inspired much research on the topological side of spaces with a group action. On the algebraic side, Avramov conjectured a similar lower bound for the total Betti number of finite length modules over a local ring. Recent work of Walker and VandeBogert-Walker resolves this conjecture positively for rings of prime characteristic, whereas counterexamples to a stronger conjecture show the subtlety of the questions.

This conference is a 5-day research and professional development workshop for graduate students in the fields of geometric group theory, geometry, and topology.  Its primary goals are to a) expose graduate students to a wide range of current research in topology,  b) build their communication, networking, and problem-sharing skills, and c) give guidance on necessary but typically untaught aspects of the profession.   Approximately 50 graduate students will participate, guided by 10 mentors, who come from a wide range of career stages and represent a broad array of topics within geometry and topology including contact and symplectic topology, 3-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry, group actions, and complex dynamics. The conference provides the participants, especially those from underrepresented groups, with many tools that will help them to succeed as scientists at the highest levels, in graduate school and beyond.<br/><br/>For many of the students, the TSW is the first conference they attend and at which they present their own results. The workshop is designed to facilitate this experience (for instance, our first professional development session is an introduction to conferences and how best to benefit from them).  The goal is to build confidence and research potential among students, as well as to build community.  The skills addressed here are not typically taught in grad school and can be disproportionately beneficial to students from minority groups, as indicated from responses from participants in previous iterations of the program. The professional development and research sides of the workshop run in tandem, with mentors giving guidance in both areas.  The workshop includes structured sessions on networking and etiquette, the job application process, communication skills, and a panel discussion on career paths (which also involves mathematicians from organizations such as NSA, Amazon, Google, and private high schools).   Mentors also give research talks, both to model good communication and introduce their research areas (deliberately chosen broadly) and relevant problems to students who are embarking on a research career.   Effective communication is a major theme: two evening sessions are devoted to workshopping presentations in small groups; the final presentations are videotaped and critiqued by those in attendance.

Workshop attendees will include established experts, early-career researchers, and students, and the program will actively engage all participants.  Each morning will feature plenary talks by experts and/or lightning talks highlighting the work of junior researchers.  The afternoons will be devoted to working in groups on open problems.  This series of regular workshops has been critical to the development of an enthusiastic community of researchers in low-dimensional topology, helping this new and growing area gain momentum and fostering numerous collaborations across career stages and demographics. The organizers take pride in the camaraderie and welcoming atmosphere they strive to create, and many in the community deeply value and appreciate these events. <br/> <br/>A trisection splits a 4-dimensional space into three simple pieces.  Since their introduction roughly a decade ago, trisections have proven to be a successful new tool with which to study smooth 4-manifolds, with numerous articles written in the interim to develop the foundations for trisection theory. An important strength of the theory of trisections is the way it interfaces with a variety of other topics in low-dimensional topology.  This interface provides an opportunity to explore many classical areas of 4-manifold topology through a new lens. Such areas include, for example, the study of knotted surfaces in 4-space, diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds, exotic smooth structures, group actions and (branched) covering spaces, and symplectic structures.  The main goal of these workshops is to bring together researchers from multiple areas to propose and to work on open problems, with a particular focus on the inclusion of early career researchers.  The workshops are preceded by a series of introductory virtual pre-workshop talks, which serve to bring new researchers up to speed, to facilitate the work to be done in groups, and to incorporate a broader, worldwide audience.

A n-dimensional manifold is a space that locally resembles n-dimensional real space.  For example, the surface of a donut is a two-dimensional manifold, because under very high magnification, this surface looks like a two-dimensional plane.  Three-dimensional objects arise naturally in our physical world, and four-dimensional objects can be motivated by thinking about the evolution of three-dimensional objects over time.  Notably, low-dimensional topology has a number of interesting applications to biology, chemistry, physics, and quantum computing.  This project focuses on the search for deep connections between manifold theory in dimensions three and four.  In addition, the project includes funding for graduate and undergraduate student research, and it will support the Great Plains Alliance, a program that pairs graduate students with speaking opportunities at other institutions for the purpose of broadening the impact of their work and promoting graduate school in mathematics to the undergraduate attendees.  The project will also fund the Distinguished Women in Mathematics colloquium series at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the PI?s home institution.  This series connects UNL faculty and graduate students with prominent women mathematicians and their research.<br/><br/>Topology in dimension three has seen an explosion of activity over the last several decades, and a number of important open problems have now been resolved.  In contrast, the topology of four-dimensional manifolds has become an increasingly active area of research, motivated by fundamental conjectures that have stubbornly resisted progress.  Two of the most famous examples include the smooth four-dimensional Poincaré conjecture (SPC4) and the slice-ribbon conjecture.  Recently, the PI has shown that a substantial family of four-manifolds satisfies the SPC4 in joint work with Jeffrey Meier.  The work connects four-dimensional handle calculus with results about Dehn surgery on knots and links in three-manifolds; it brings together a wide range of tools and techniques; and it subsumes several historically important results.  The collection of manifolds can be characterized by families of links, including some of the most promising potential counterexamples to the slice-ribbon conjecture.  This project describes a varied set of problems stemming from past work and interweaving ideas from knot theory, three-manifolds, and smooth four-manifold topology.  Specific objectives include proving additional cases of the SPC4, finding new relationships between the topology of certain homotopy four-spheres and the Andrews-Curtis conjecture in combinatorial group theory, developing connections between three- and four-dimensional knot invariants, and utilizing bridge trisections in new constructions of surfaces in four-manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since spheres are the fundamental building blocks of topological spaces, the stable stems, which encode the possible relations between high-dimensional spheres up to continuous deformation, are a central object of study. Beyond topology, the stable stems have surprisingly broad applications throughout mathematics, ranging from geometric problems, such as classifying differentiable structures on spheres, to algebraic problems, such as classifying projective modules over rings. This project will explore further applications of stable homotopy theory in algebra, topology, and geometry. Broader impacts center on online community building. The PI will continue co-organizing the Electronic Computational Homotopy Theory Online Research Community, which aims to increase inclusion at the undergraduate, graduate, and senior levels by organizing undergraduate research opportunities, graduate courses, online seminars, mini-courses, and networking events. To address inequality at the K-12 level, the PI will develop and manage a program pairing undergraduates from his home institution with students from local after-school programs for online tutoring. This program would circumvent certain barriers to participation, such as lack of access to transportation and facilities, which are common in traditional outreach.<br/><br/>Specific research projects include the study of the stable stems and their applications in geometric topology, algebro-geometric analogues of the stable stems and their connections to number theory, and equivariant analogues of algebraic K-theory and their applications in algebra and geometry. More specifically, building on previous work, the PI will study the stable stems using topological modular forms and the Mahowald invariant, aiming to deduce the existence of exotic spheres in new dimensions. In a related direction, the PI will use the kq-resolution introduced in previous work to study the motivic stable stems, an algebro-geometric analogues of the stable stems. The main goal is to apply the kq-resolution to relate the motivic stable stems to arithmetic invariants like Hermitian K-theory. Real algebraic K-theory, which encodes classical invariants like algebraic K-theory, Hermitian K-theory, and L-theory, will also be studied using the trace methods developed in previous work. The overarching goal is extending results from algebraic K-theory to real algebraic K-theory, thereby obtaining results for Hermitian K-theory and L-theory that will have applications in algebra and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It offers insights into fundamental theories like relativity and quantum mechanics, enhancing our conception of the structure and dynamics of the universe. Additionally, it enables exploration of complex phenomena such as higher-dimensional geometry, offering solutions to theoretical puzzles and practical challenges. Embracing the concept of four-dimensional spaces expands our intellectual horizons and has the potential to lead to advancements in technology and change how we interact with our surroundings. The focus of this research program is the study of knotted objects in dimension four and the connections that arise between the topology and geometry of the ambient four dimensional manifold and the knotted objects found within. This grant will allow the PI to carry out a robust program of undergraduate research, training, and mentoring; organize conferences, seminars, and an undergraduate math club; and implement student-centered teaching pedagogies. All of these activities help to create a new generation of researchers who will grapple with the challenging problem of understanding four-dimensional topology.<br/> <br/>The four-dimensional sphere is the simplest closed, four-dimensional manifold, yet it remains little understood in several important ways.

Finally, it is unknown which four-manifolds arise as irregular three-fold covers of the four-sphere. This research program aims to make progress on these and important related problems through the study of knotted disks in homotopy four-balls; the diagrams of knotted surfaces in the four-sphere; and the topology, geometry, and symmetries of the four-manifolds obtained as branched covers over these surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic topology is a field of theoretical mathematics whose main goal is to study different notions of ?shape? that belong to the realm of ?continuous? mathematics, using tools from algebra that belong to the ?discrete? realm. Algebraic topology has been applied successfully to other fields of mathematics, and, more recently, to science including quantum physics, solid state physics, string theory, data science, and computer science. This conference will focus on recent developments in algebraic topology and its applications. The conference will feature a series of events accessible to audiences at different levels. These include: 1) a three-day school with mini-courses accessible to graduate students and mathematicians from fields outside algebraic topology, 2) a public event with talks and discussions accessible to a general audience, 3) a week-long research conference featuring invited speakers and contributed talks in algebraic topology. Furthermore, the conference aims to engage with groups that are historically underrepresented in academic research in mathematics, particularly with mathematicians of Hispanic and Latin American origin, in a deep and direct manner. Geographically, culturally, as well as politically, the strategically selected location, Puerto Rico, sits between the mathematical communities based in United States, Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Along with a strong engagement with the local community, the event will feature works by a significant number of Hispanic mathematicians. <br/><br/>The overarching theme of the conference is the use of algebra to give structure to geometric contexts. The mini-courses will be on the topics of algebraic K-theory, configuration spaces, and string topology and aim to bring participants to the state-of-the-art in these subjects. The research talks will highlight recent breakthroughs in different sub-fields of algebraic topology including stable and chromatic homotopy theory, K-theory, higher category theory, higher algebra, derived geometry, operads, homological stability, configuration spaces, string topology, and topological data analysis and will be given by leading experts in these fields. By bringing together a diverse cohort of mathematicians working on different sub-fields, the organizers aim to foster new ideas and perspectives.

Gradually, it was realized that the algebraic invariants called cohomology theories could themselves be represented by geometric objects, known as spectra. A central triumph of modern homotopy theory has been the construction of categories of ring spectra (representing objects for multiplicative cohomology theories) which are suitable for performing constructions directly analogous to those of classical algebra. This move has turned out to be incredibly fruitful, both by providing invariants which shed new light on old questions as well as by raising new questions which have unexpected connections to other areas of mathematics and physics. This research proposal studies such constructions in algebraic K-theory, the newly emerging field of Floer homotopy theory, and the foundations of equivariant stable homotopy theory. Broader impacts include workforce development in the form of graduate student advising, undergraduate and postdoc mentorship, high school mathematical science project mentorship, conference organization, and development of new education and training programs.<br/><br/>This proposal describes a broad research program to study a wide variety of problems in homotopy theory, geometry, and arithmetic. The PIs' prior work gives a complete description of the homotopy groups of algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectral at odd primes and a canonical identification of the fiber of the cyclotomic trace via a spectral lift of Tate-Poitou duality. In this proposal, the PIs describe a vast expansion of that argument to study the fiber of the cyclotomic trace on more general rings and schemes over algebraic p-integers in number fields and a related K-theory question more generally for other kinds of Artin duality. The prior work also leads to a new approach to the Kummer-Vandiver conjecture based on Bökstedt-Hsiang-Madsen's geometric Soule embedding that the PIs propose to study. The PIs' recent work with Yuan established a theory of topological cyclic homology (TC) relative to MU-algebras, where there are many interesting computations to explore. Prior work of PI Blumberg with Abouzaid building a Morava K-theory Floer homotopy type has opened new lines of research in Floer homotopy theory; this already has been used to resolve old conjectures in symplectic geometry. The PIs propose to extend this construction to its natural generality, building the homotopy type over MUP and KU and rigidifying the multiplication. They propose to obtain spectral models of deformed operations on quantum cohomology (i.e., quantum Steenrod operations). This work will have myriad applications in symplectic geometry and potentially have transformative impact on the Floer homotopy theory program. The PIs propose to resolve the longstanding confusion about the role of multiplicative norm maps in equivariant stable homotopy theory for positive dimensional compact Lie groups. This requires a new foundation for factorization homology and will lead to genuine equivariant factorization homology for positive dimensional compact Lie groups. In prior work, the PIs identified previously unknown multiplicative transfers on geometric fixed points of G-commutative ring spectra. The PIs propose to study how these fit into the foundations of G-symmetric monoidal categories; a first step is to establish new multiplicative splittings that have the feel of multiplicative versions of the tom Dieck splitting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process and the deployment of data-centric technologies have recently brought unprecedented advances in many scientific fields, as well as increased global prosperity with the advent of knowledge-based economies and systems. At a high level, this revolution is driven by two thrusts: the modern technologies which allow for the collection of complex data sets, and the theories and algorithms we use to make sense of them. That said, and for all its benefits, extracting actionable knowledge from data is difficult. Observations gathered in uncontrolled environments are often high-dimensional, complex and noisy; and even when controlled experiments are used, the intricate systems that underlie them --- like those from meteorology, chemistry, medicine and biology --- can yield data sets with highly nontrivial underlying topology. This refers to properties such as the number of disconnected pieces (i.e., clusters), the existence of holes or the orientability of the data space. The research funded through this CAREER award will leverage ideas from algebraic topology to address data science questions like visualization and representation of complex data sets, as well as the challenges posed by nontrivial topology when designing learning systems for prediction and classification. This work will be integrated into the educational program of the PI through the creation of an online TDA (Topological Data Analysis) academy, with the dual purpose of lowering the barrier of entry into the field for data scientists and academics, as well as increasing the representation of underserved communities in the field of computational mathematics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Understanding the set of maps between topological spaces has led to rich and sophisticated mathematics, for it subsumes algebraic invariants like homotopy groups and generalized (co)homology theories. And while several data science questions are discrete versions of mapping space problems --- including nonlinear dimensionality reduction and supervised learning --- the corresponding theoretical and algorithm treatment is currently lacking. This CAREER award will contribute towards remedying this situation. The research program articulated here seeks to launch a novel research program addressing the theory and algorithms of how the underlying topology of a data set can be leveraged for data modeling (e.g., in dimensionality reduction) as well as when learning maps between complex data spaces (e.g., in supervised learning). This work will yield methodologies for the computation of topology-aware and robust multiscale coordinatizations for data via classifying spaces, a computational theory of topological obstructions to the robust extension of maps between data sets, as well as the introduction of modern deep learning paradigms in order to learn maps between non-Euclidean data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research proposal studies such constructions in algebraic K-theory, the newly emerging field of Floer homotopy theory, and the foundations of equivariant stable homotopy theory. Broader impacts include workforce development in the form of graduate student advising, undergraduate and postdoc mentorship, high school mathematical science project mentorship, conference organization, and development of new education and training programs.<br/><br/>This proposal describes a broad research program to study a wide variety of problems in homotopy theory, geometry, and arithmetic. The PIs' prior work gives a complete description of the homotopy groups of algebraic K-theory of the sphere spectral at odd primes and a canonical identification of the fiber of the cyclotomic trace via a spectral lift of Tate-Poitou duality. In this proposal, the PIs describe a vast expansion of that argument to study the fiber of the cyclotomic trace on more general rings and schemes over algebraic p-integers in number fields and a related K-theory question more generally for other kinds of Artin duality. The prior work also leads to a new approach to the Kummer-Vandiver conjecture based on Bökstedt-Hsiang-Madsen's geometric Soule embedding that the PIs propose to study. The PIs' recent work with Yuan established a theory of topological cyclic homology (TC) relative to MU-algebras, where there are many interesting computations to explore. Prior work of PI Blumberg with Abouzaid building a Morava K-theory Floer homotopy type has opened new lines of research in Floer homotopy theory; this already has been used to resolve old conjectures in symplectic geometry. The PIs propose to extend this construction to its natural generality, building the homotopy type over MUP and KU and rigidifying the multiplication. They propose to obtain spectral models of deformed operations on quantum cohomology (i.e., quantum Steenrod operations). This work will have myriad applications in symplectic geometry and potentially have transformative impact on the Floer homotopy theory program. The PIs propose to resolve the longstanding confusion about the role of multiplicative norm maps in equivariant stable homotopy theory for positive dimensional compact Lie groups. This requires a new foundation for factorization homology and will lead to genuine equivariant factorization homology for positive dimensional compact Lie groups. In prior work, the PIs identified previously unknown multiplicative transfers on geometric fixed points of G-commutative ring spectra. The PIs propose to study how these fit into the foundations of G-symmetric monoidal categories; a first step is to establish new multiplicative splittings that have the feel of multiplicative versions of the tom Dieck splitting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The construction is deeply rooted in the interaction between modern mathematical methods and ideas from mathematical physics; and indeed, Heegaard Floer homology has found interactions with many other mathematical fields, including symplectic geometry, analysis, representation theory, and homological algebra. But in its essence, Heegaard Floer homology was designed to study low-dimensional phenomena, such as how knotted a circle can be in a three-dimensional manifold, how knotted two-dimensional surfaces can be in four-dimensional space, and how interesting a four-dimensional space can be.  The project aims to further explore the topological applications of Heegaard Floer homology; and to further build the foundations of this invariant, both to develop computational schemes and to build a broader theoretical framework into which the theory fits in algebraically. The project will also help support graduate students studying in low-dimensional topology and related areas.<br/><br/>The project will further develop bordered aspects of Heegaard Floer homology, specifically for dealing with its U-unspecialized versions, which are more sensitive to four-dimensional differential topology than the U-specialized versions. Parts of the project involve collaborations with other researchers, including Robert Lipshitz, Zoltan Szabo, and Dylan Thurston. Joint work with Lipshitz and Thurston sets up the algebraic background needed for this extension of weighted A-infinity algebras, their tensor products, and modules; constructed the weighted A-infinity module for the torus; weighted modules associated to three-manifolds with (bordered) torus boundary. The project aims at proving a pairing theorem, which expresses the Heegaard Floer homology module of a union of two three-manifolds glued along a torus as a suitable tensor product of the modules associated to the two manifolds. The project also aims to generalize the picture to three-manifolds whose boundary is a closed, hyperbolic surface. In a different direction, the project aims to give a description of the full (unspecialized) knot Floer complex in terms of a knot projection, as a tensor product of bimodules associated to the elementary pieces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knot theory is an important sub-field of topology where one studies one-dimensional objects inside three-dimensional spaces, for example, knotted pieces of strings inside the three-dimensional space that we live in. Knot theory is useful for a variety of applications, such as for studying DNA knotting, analyzing orbits in magnetic fields, or creating new data encryption schemes. One of the fundamental problems in knot theory is to study if a knot can be transformed into another without tearing or crossing itself; knot invariants are mathematical objects (such as numbers or groups) which one associates to knots which remain unchanged during such a transformation, and are therefore, widely used in knot theory. Occasionally, one imposes additional restrictions on the knots---if one imagines a knot to be a path traced out by a particle moving in the three-dimensional space, then these restrict the velocity of the particle depending on its position. Knots with such restrictions are called Legendrian knots, and these have many real-world applications as well, such as motion planning for robotics. The current topology project will focus on knot theory, and will create new knot and Legendrian knot invariants based on existing ones. Broader impacts of the project are through workshop organization, graduate student mentoring, undergraduate research, high school outreach, and the writing of a textbook for Directed Reading Programs.<br/><br/>This project will concentrate on three families of modern knot and Legendrian knot invariants: Khovanov homology, knot Floer homology, and Legendrian contact homology. These invariants are all of the homological type, that is, they take the form of chain complexes whose chain homotopy types are (Legendrian) knot invariants. The project will construct and study spectrifications of these theories, which are cellular spaces whose cellular chain complex is the original chain complex, and whose stable homotopy type is also a (Legendrian) knot invariant. For the three families of invariants, three specific goals of the project are: to study the behavior of the odd Khovanov spectrum invariant under disjoint union, to prove that the knot Floer spectrum is a knot invariant, and to construct new Legendrian contact spectrum generalizing Legendrian contact homology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These range from observable phenomena in fluid dynamics (vortex rings in a fluid coming together to become a new ring or self-intersecting and breaking apart into multiple rings) to patterns arising in areas of theoretical physics such as string theory and quantum field theory. String topology proposes a mathematical model to study these interactions in terms of operations defined by intersecting, reconnecting, and cutting strings (closed curves) evolving in time in a manifold. Giving a rigorous and complete description of the structure of string topology, which is one of the aims of the proposed project, will also provide solid foundations for physical theories. Furthermore, the physicially inspired theory of string topology turns out to inform theoretical questions in mathematics: probing a space through strings and studying how all possible interactions are organized also reveals intricate aspects of the background geometry. Building upon previous work of the PI, the project proposes to algebraicize string topology through tractable models obtained by decomposing, or discretizing, the underlying space into cells and using techniques from algebraic topology and homological algebra, two well developed active fields of pure mathematics. These models will be applicable to study a wide range of string interaction phenomena appearing in both pure and applied mathematics as well as in theoretical physics. The proposed project includes a broad educational component focused on fostering mathematical activity and access at multiple levels. This involves graduate student training, organization of summer workshops and conferences that bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, and the support of periodic seminars at the PI?s institution. <br/><br/>In more technical detail, this project aims to study chain-level string topology with a focus on operations that are sensitive to geometric structure beyond the homotopy type of the underlying manifold. In particular, the PI proposes to construct a homotopy coherent structure lifting the Goresky-Hingston loop coalgebra (and its S^1-symmetric Lie cobracket version) originally defined on the homology of the space of free loops on a manifold relative to the constant loops. The construction of such structure will use an appropriate refinement of Poincaré duality and intersection theory at the level of chains on a finely triangulated manifold together with the theory of algebraic models for loop spaces of non-simply connected manifolds developed in previous work of the PI using techniques from Hochschild homology theory and Koszul duality theory. These models will be transparent enough to reveal the precise geometric ingredients that are necessary to construct a coherent hierarchy of higher structures for string topology. This hierarchy of chain-level operations will provide a rich source of computable and potentially new manifold invariants. Connections with symplectic geometry, homological mirror symmetry, and the theory of quantization will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It matters if the solution to a set of equations can be expressed using the usual counting numbers, or if real numbers are required, or if one must use imaginary numbers. The enriched count detects such differences. In some cases, it is closely connected to the number of holes of dimension d in the shape of a space of real solutions to the equations. This project exploits the power of the enriched count, exposing potential applications in number theory and algebraic geometry. The award will also support a pipeline for a strong and diverse mathematical workforce.  This will involve a continuing program of week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During this program, the PI will facilitate collaborative projects with high school student and teachers, providing background material as necessary. Graduates from the summer program will be encouraged to continue on to a Research Experience for Undergraduates that will provide further mathematical training and research mentorship.  <br/><br/>The proposed research studies number-theoretic and algebro-geometric questions using cohomology theories and homotopical methods in the framework of Morel and Voevodsky's A1-homotopy theory. The project uses stable A1-homotopy theory to produce results in enumerative geometry over non-algebraically closed fields and rings of integers. New Gromov--Witten invariants defined over general fields have the potential to satisfy wall-crossing formulas, surgery formulas, and WDVV equations. For this, the project studies notions of spin over general fields. The Weil conjectures connect the number of solutions to equations over finite fields to the topology of their complex points: The zeta function of a variety over a finite field is simultaneously a generating function for the number of solutions to its defining equations and a product of characteristic polynomials of endomorphisms of cohomology groups. The ranks of these cohomology groups are the Betti numbers of the associated complex manifold. The logarithmic derivative of the zeta function is enriched to a power series with coefficients in the Grothendieck--Witt group, producing a connection with the associated real manifold. This project aims to increase our control over this logarithmic derivative of the zeta function and its applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each morning will feature plenary talks by experts and/or lightning talks highlighting the work of junior researchers.  The afternoons will be devoted to working in groups on open problems.  This series of regular workshops has been critical to the development of an enthusiastic community of researchers in low-dimensional topology, helping this new and growing area gain momentum and fostering numerous collaborations across career stages and demographics. The organizers take pride in the camaraderie and welcoming atmosphere they strive to create, and many in the community deeply value and appreciate these events. <br/> <br/>A trisection splits a 4-dimensional space into three simple pieces.  Since their introduction roughly a decade ago, trisections have proven to be a successful new tool with which to study smooth 4-manifolds, with numerous articles written in the interim to develop the foundations for trisection theory. An important strength of the theory of trisections is the way it interfaces with a variety of other topics in low-dimensional topology.  This interface provides an opportunity to explore many classical areas of 4-manifold topology through a new lens. Such areas include, for example, the study of knotted surfaces in 4-space, diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds, exotic smooth structures, group actions and (branched) covering spaces, and symplectic structures.  The main goal of these workshops is to bring together researchers from multiple areas to propose and to work on open problems, with a particular focus on the inclusion of early career researchers.

A central challenge is to classify all maps from spheres to other spheres, where two maps are considered equivalent if one can be deformed to the other. The equivalence classes of these maps are called the homotopy groups of spheres, and collectively they form one of the deepest and most central objects in the field. Historically, much important theory has arisen out of attempts to compute more homotopy groups of spheres and understand patterns within them. This project involves furthering knowledge of the homotopy groups of spheres, using old and new techniques as well as computer calculations. The project also involves studying an analogue of these groups in algebraic geometry; this falls under a relatively new and actively developed area called motivic homotopy theory, which applies techniques in algebraic topology to study algebraic geometry. The broader impacts of this project center around supporting the local mathematics community through mentoring and promoting diversity. The principal investigator will help build the nascent homotopy theory community at the university and promote women and minorities in the subject through seminar organization and mentoring.<br/> <br/>One of the main planned projects is a large-scale effort to compute the homotopy groups of spheres at the prime 3 in a range, using old and new techniques such as the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence as well as infinite descent machinery.

Another main group of projects concerns computing the analogue of the stable homotopy groups of spheres in the world of R-motivic homotopy theory. This represents a continuation of prior work of the PI and collaborator; the plan is to supplement the techniques used in that work with computer calculations and a new tool, the slice spectral sequence.

On the other hand, this seemingly geometric approach to infinite groups also has deep connections to the more classical theme of decidability, logic, and algorithmic aspects of group theory, which lie in the intersection of computer science and mathematics. This conference will bring together prominent researchers interested in group theory, but from different sub-fields and viewpoints, some on the geometric side, while others on the algorithmic/computation side, to present their work. The speakers are carefully chosen in order to emphasize connections between different aspects, and to stimulate further collaboration. A wide range of infinite groups of great importance will be discussed during the conference, including cubical groups, hyperbolic groups, automaton groups, automatic groups, Artin groups, Coxeter groups, self-similar groups, non-positively curved groups etc. More information is available on the webpage of the conference at https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/3149.html.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A goal of this conference is to highlight research being conducted by underrepresented students in the areas of algebra and topology. At this unique meeting, attendees are exposed to a greater variety of current research, ideas, and results in their areas of study and beyond. Participants are also given the opportunity to meet and network with underrepresented professors and students who may later become collaborators and colleagues. This is particularly important for students with great academic potential who do not attend top-tier research institutions; students that are often overlooked, despite a strong faculty and graduate student population. Furthermore, USTARS promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Participants of USTARS continue to influence the next generation of students in positive ways by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events. USTARS exposes all participants to the research and activities of underrepresented mathematicians, encouraging a more collaborative mathematics community. <br/><br/>The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) is a project proposed by a group of underrepresented young mathematicians. The conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and is well-positioned to actively encourage participation by women and minorities. The symposium includes networking sessions along with research presentations. Speakers will give 30-minute parallel research talks. Graduate students will give at least 75% of these presentations. Two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour presentations and a poster session featuring invited undergraduates is also planned. Additionally, a discussion panel and creative math session will provide networking, guidance, and mentorship opportunities from past USTARS participants that have transitioned to full-time faculty positions.

The theme of the conference is Flows and Foliations in 3-manifolds. The mathematical concept of a dynamical system allows for any continuously time-varying physical system to be considered within a uniform framework, as a ?state space? that organizes all possible instantaneous configurations, together with a ?flow? that describes the evolution of states with time. The conference is focused on the way that the geometry and topology of a space interacts with the kinds of dynamical systems that it supports, with an eye towards applications in dynamics, geometry, and topology. The organizers are committed to broad recruitment across a diverse set of students and postdoctoral researchers. In addition to hour-long lectures by established researchers, there will be lightning talks as well as a panel discussion on issues faced by early career mathematicians.<br/><br/>Flows and foliations in three dimensional manifolds can be fruitfully viewed through many lenses, as they stand at the intersection of dynamics, topology, and geometry. Interest in this general area has accelerated since Agol's resolution of the Virtual Fibering Conjecture, with researchers using a variety of tools and ideas such as (pseudo-) Anosov and partially hyperbolic flows, sutured manifold hierarchies, geometric group theory, contact geometry, Floer theory, veering triangulations, and the so-called big mapping class group to study a variety of questions. These include among others the L-space conjecture, the Cannon Conjecture, the Pseudo-Anosov Finiteness Conjecture, and the classification of infinite-type mapping classes. Recent conferences have tended to focus on small subsets of these topics and techniques, and there is a need for an event at which researchers with expertise in these different topics can meet and share their knowledge. Talks will take place at Washington University.

Algebraic geometry can be described as the study of systems of polynomial equations and their solutions, whereas topology is the mathematical discipline that studies notions such as ?shape? and ?space"" and develops mathematical techniques to distinguish and classify such objects. A notion of central importance in these areas is that of a ?moduli space? - this is a mathematical ?world map? that gives a complete inventory and classification of all instances of a particular mathematical object. The main research objective of the project is to better understand the structure of these spaces and to explore new phenomena, by importing techniques from neighboring areas of mathematics. While the primary aim is to advance knowledge in pure mathematics, developments from these areas have also had a long track record of successful applications in physics, data science, computer vision, and robotics. The educational component includes an outreach initiative consisting of a ?Math Circles Institute? (MCI). The purpose of the MCI is to train K-12 teachers from around the country in running the mathematical enrichment activities known as Math Circles. This annual 1-week program will pair teachers with experienced instructors to collaboratively develop new materials and methods to be brought back to their home communities. In addition, a research conference will be organized with the aim of attracting an international community of researchers and students and disseminating developments related to the research objectives of the proposal.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the research component is to develop new methods via topology and geometric group theory to study various moduli spaces, specifically, (1) strata of Abelian differentials and (2) families of polynomials. A major objective is to establish ?asphericality"" (vanishing of higher homotopy) of these spaces. A second objective is to develop the geometric theory of their fundamental groups. Asphericality occurs with surprising frequency in spaces coming from algebraic geometry, and often has profound consequences. Decades on, asphericality conjectures of Arnol?d, Thom, and Kontsevich?Zorich remain largely unsolved, and it has come to be regarded as a significantly challenging topic. This project?s goal is to identify promising-looking inroads. The PI has developed a method called ""Abel-Jacobi flow"" that he proposes to use to establish asphericality of some special strata of Abelian differentials. A successful resolution of this program would constitute a major advance on the Kontsevich?Zorich conjecture; other potential applications are also described. The second main focus is on families of polynomials. This includes linear systems on algebraic surfaces; a program to better understand the fundamental groups is outlined. Two families of univariate polynomials are also discussed, with an eye towards asphericality conjectures: (1) the equicritical stratification and (2) spaces of fewnomials. These are simple enough to be understood concretely, while being complex enough to require new techniques. In addition to topology, the work proposed here promises to inject new examples into geometric group theory. Many of the central objects of interest in the field (braid groups, mapping class groups, Artin groups) are intimately related to algebraic geometry. The fundamental groups of the spaces the PI studies here should be just as rich, and a major goal of the project is to bring this to fruition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
