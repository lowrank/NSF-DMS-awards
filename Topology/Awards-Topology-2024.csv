This process and the deployment of data-centric technologies have recently brought unprecedented advances in many scientific fields, as well as increased global prosperity with the advent of knowledge-based economies and systems. At a high level, this revolution is driven by two thrusts: the modern technologies which allow for the collection of complex data sets, and the theories and algorithms we use to make sense of them. That said, and for all its benefits, extracting actionable knowledge from data is difficult. Observations gathered in uncontrolled environments are often high-dimensional, complex and noisy; and even when controlled experiments are used, the intricate systems that underlie them --- like those from meteorology, chemistry, medicine and biology --- can yield data sets with highly nontrivial underlying topology. This refers to properties such as the number of disconnected pieces (i.e., clusters), the existence of holes or the orientability of the data space. The research funded through this CAREER award will leverage ideas from algebraic topology to address data science questions like visualization and representation of complex data sets, as well as the challenges posed by nontrivial topology when designing learning systems for prediction and classification. This work will be integrated into the educational program of the PI through the creation of an online TDA (Topological Data Analysis) academy, with the dual purpose of lowering the barrier of entry into the field for data scientists and academics, as well as increasing the representation of underserved communities in the field of computational mathematics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Understanding the set of maps between topological spaces has led to rich and sophisticated mathematics, for it subsumes algebraic invariants like homotopy groups and generalized (co)homology theories. And while several data science questions are discrete versions of mapping space problems --- including nonlinear dimensionality reduction and supervised learning --- the corresponding theoretical and algorithm treatment is currently lacking. This CAREER award will contribute towards remedying this situation. The research program articulated here seeks to launch a novel research program addressing the theory and algorithms of how the underlying topology of a data set can be leveraged for data modeling (e.g., in dimensionality reduction) as well as when learning maps between complex data spaces (e.g., in supervised learning). This work will yield methodologies for the computation of topology-aware and robust multiscale coordinatizations for data via classifying spaces, a computational theory of topological obstructions to the robust extension of maps between data sets, as well as the introduction of modern deep learning paradigms in order to learn maps between non-Euclidean data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond lectures delivered by internationally recognized experts, vertically integrated participation will be fostered by a poster session showcasing the contributions of early-career researchers and a Career and Mentorship Panel.<br/> <br/>The conference will investigate the intersection of low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. The roots of this interdisciplinary exploration trace back to Witten's groundbreaking work in the late 1980s and the emergence of the Jones polynomial in Chern-Simons theory. Since then, a landscape of profound connections between knot theory, moduli spaces, and string theory has emerged, due to the collective efforts of generations of mathematicians and physicists. Noteworthy developments include the deep ties between Heegaard Floer homology and the Fukaya category of surfaces, the intricate interplay revealed by Khovanov homology, and the correspondence of Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas theories. The study of moduli spaces of curves, as exemplified in Heegaard Floer homology, has played a pivotal role in several developments. The preceding three editions of the Richmond Geometry Meeting, encompassing both virtual and in-person gatherings, have showcased a wave of collaborative advancements in knot theory, algebraic geometry, and string theory. Topics such as braid varieties, Khovanov homotopy, link lattice homology, and the GW/DT correspondence in families have been explored, unveiling a nexus of interdependent breakthroughs.

Interactions of strings, paths, and loops are ubiquitous throughout mathematics and science. These range from observable phenomena in fluid dynamics (vortex rings in a fluid coming together to become a new ring or self-intersecting and breaking apart into multiple rings) to patterns arising in areas of theoretical physics such as string theory and quantum field theory. String topology proposes a mathematical model to study these interactions in terms of operations defined by intersecting, reconnecting, and cutting strings (closed curves) evolving in time in a manifold. Giving a rigorous and complete description of the structure of string topology, which is one of the aims of the proposed project, will also provide solid foundations for physical theories. Furthermore, the physicially inspired theory of string topology turns out to inform theoretical questions in mathematics: probing a space through strings and studying how all possible interactions are organized also reveals intricate aspects of the background geometry. Building upon previous work of the PI, the project proposes to algebraicize string topology through tractable models obtained by decomposing, or discretizing, the underlying space into cells and using techniques from algebraic topology and homological algebra, two well developed active fields of pure mathematics. These models will be applicable to study a wide range of string interaction phenomena appearing in both pure and applied mathematics as well as in theoretical physics. The proposed project includes a broad educational component focused on fostering mathematical activity and access at multiple levels. This involves graduate student training, organization of summer workshops and conferences that bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, and the support of periodic seminars at the PI?s institution. <br/><br/>In more technical detail, this project aims to study chain-level string topology with a focus on operations that are sensitive to geometric structure beyond the homotopy type of the underlying manifold. In particular, the PI proposes to construct a homotopy coherent structure lifting the Goresky-Hingston loop coalgebra (and its S^1-symmetric Lie cobracket version) originally defined on the homology of the space of free loops on a manifold relative to the constant loops. The construction of such structure will use an appropriate refinement of Poincaré duality and intersection theory at the level of chains on a finely triangulated manifold together with the theory of algebraic models for loop spaces of non-simply connected manifolds developed in previous work of the PI using techniques from Hochschild homology theory and Koszul duality theory. These models will be transparent enough to reveal the precise geometric ingredients that are necessary to construct a coherent hierarchy of higher structures for string topology. This hierarchy of chain-level operations will provide a rich source of computable and potentially new manifold invariants. Connections with symplectic geometry, homological mirror symmetry, and the theory of quantization will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A variety of leading experts working in the relevant fields will present their work. Early career US based participants will also be given the opportunity to give talks and thereby enhance their international profile. The exposure to recent developments in the field and the opportunities to communicate with their colleagues from all over the world is expected to initiate new research collaborations. Conference organizers will devote special efforts to recruit and encourage members of under-represented groups in mathematics.<br/><br/>The study of infinite groups is a very active area in modern mathematics. A major trend in this area is geometric group theory, which aims at understanding the asymptotic geometry of finitely generated groups. On the other hand, this seemingly geometric approach to infinite groups also has deep connections to the more classical theme of decidability, logic, and algorithmic aspects of group theory, which lie in the intersection of computer science and mathematics. This conference will bring together prominent researchers interested in group theory, but from different sub-fields and viewpoints, some on the geometric side, while others on the algorithmic/computation side, to present their work. The speakers are carefully chosen in order to emphasize connections between different aspects, and to stimulate further collaboration. A wide range of infinite groups of great importance will be discussed during the conference, including cubical groups, hyperbolic groups, automaton groups, automatic groups, Artin groups, Coxeter groups, self-similar groups, non-positively curved groups etc. More information is available on the webpage of the conference at https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/3149.html.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic topology is a field of theoretical mathematics whose main goal is to study different notions of ?shape? that belong to the realm of ?continuous? mathematics, using tools from algebra that belong to the ?discrete? realm. Algebraic topology has been applied successfully to other fields of mathematics, and, more recently, to science including quantum physics, solid state physics, string theory, data science, and computer science. This conference will focus on recent developments in algebraic topology and its applications. The conference will feature a series of events accessible to audiences at different levels. These include: 1) a three-day school with mini-courses accessible to graduate students and mathematicians from fields outside algebraic topology, 2) a public event with talks and discussions accessible to a general audience, 3) a week-long research conference featuring invited speakers and contributed talks in algebraic topology. Furthermore, the conference aims to engage with groups that are historically underrepresented in academic research in mathematics, particularly with mathematicians of Hispanic and Latin American origin, in a deep and direct manner. Geographically, culturally, as well as politically, the strategically selected location, Puerto Rico, sits between the mathematical communities based in United States, Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Along with a strong engagement with the local community, the event will feature works by a significant number of Hispanic mathematicians. <br/><br/>The overarching theme of the conference is the use of algebra to give structure to geometric contexts. The mini-courses will be on the topics of algebraic K-theory, configuration spaces, and string topology and aim to bring participants to the state-of-the-art in these subjects. The research talks will highlight recent breakthroughs in different sub-fields of algebraic topology including stable and chromatic homotopy theory, K-theory, higher category theory, higher algebra, derived geometry, operads, homological stability, configuration spaces, string topology, and topological data analysis and will be given by leading experts in these fields. By bringing together a diverse cohort of mathematicians working on different sub-fields, the organizers aim to foster new ideas and perspectives.

In addition to hour-long lectures by established researchers, there will be lightning talks as well as a panel discussion on issues faced by early career mathematicians.<br/><br/>Flows and foliations in three dimensional manifolds can be fruitfully viewed through many lenses, as they stand at the intersection of dynamics, topology, and geometry. Interest in this general area has accelerated since Agol's resolution of the Virtual Fibering Conjecture, with researchers using a variety of tools and ideas such as (pseudo-) Anosov and partially hyperbolic flows, sutured manifold hierarchies, geometric group theory, contact geometry, Floer theory, veering triangulations, and the so-called big mapping class group to study a variety of questions. These include among others the L-space conjecture, the Cannon Conjecture, the Pseudo-Anosov Finiteness Conjecture, and the classification of infinite-type mapping classes. Recent conferences have tended to focus on small subsets of these topics and techniques, and there is a need for an event at which researchers with expertise in these different topics can meet and share their knowledge. Talks will take place at Washington University.

This conference is a 5-day research and professional development workshop for graduate students in the fields of geometric group theory, geometry, and topology.  Its primary goals are to a) expose graduate students to a wide range of current research in topology,  b) build their communication, networking, and problem-sharing skills, and c) give guidance on necessary but typically untaught aspects of the profession.   Approximately 50 graduate students will participate, guided by 10 mentors, who come from a wide range of career stages and represent a broad array of topics within geometry and topology including contact and symplectic topology, 3-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry, group actions, and complex dynamics. The conference provides the participants, especially those from underrepresented groups, with many tools that will help them to succeed as scientists at the highest levels, in graduate school and beyond.<br/><br/>For many of the students, the TSW is the first conference they attend and at which they present their own results. The workshop is designed to facilitate this experience (for instance, our first professional development session is an introduction to conferences and how best to benefit from them).  The goal is to build confidence and research potential among students, as well as to build community.  The skills addressed here are not typically taught in grad school and can be disproportionately beneficial to students from minority groups, as indicated from responses from participants in previous iterations of the program. The professional development and research sides of the workshop run in tandem, with mentors giving guidance in both areas.  The workshop includes structured sessions on networking and etiquette, the job application process, communication skills, and a panel discussion on career paths (which also involves mathematicians from organizations such as NSA, Amazon, Google, and private high schools).   Mentors also give research talks, both to model good communication and introduce their research areas (deliberately chosen broadly) and relevant problems to students who are embarking on a research career.   Effective communication is a major theme: two evening sessions are devoted to workshopping presentations in small groups; the final presentations are videotaped and critiqued by those in attendance.

It matters if the solution to a set of equations can be expressed using the usual counting numbers, or if real numbers are required, or if one must use imaginary numbers. The enriched count detects such differences. In some cases, it is closely connected to the number of holes of dimension d in the shape of a space of real solutions to the equations. This project exploits the power of the enriched count, exposing potential applications in number theory and algebraic geometry. The award will also support a pipeline for a strong and diverse mathematical workforce.  This will involve a continuing program of week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During this program, the PI will facilitate collaborative projects with high school student and teachers, providing background material as necessary. Graduates from the summer program will be encouraged to continue on to a Research Experience for Undergraduates that will provide further mathematical training and research mentorship.  <br/><br/>The proposed research studies number-theoretic and algebro-geometric questions using cohomology theories and homotopical methods in the framework of Morel and Voevodsky's A1-homotopy theory. The project uses stable A1-homotopy theory to produce results in enumerative geometry over non-algebraically closed fields and rings of integers. New Gromov--Witten invariants defined over general fields have the potential to satisfy wall-crossing formulas, surgery formulas, and WDVV equations. For this, the project studies notions of spin over general fields. The Weil conjectures connect the number of solutions to equations over finite fields to the topology of their complex points: The zeta function of a variety over a finite field is simultaneously a generating function for the number of solutions to its defining equations and a product of characteristic polynomials of endomorphisms of cohomology groups. The ranks of these cohomology groups are the Betti numbers of the associated complex manifold. The logarithmic derivative of the zeta function is enriched to a power series with coefficients in the Grothendieck--Witt group, producing a connection with the associated real manifold. This project aims to increase our control over this logarithmic derivative of the zeta function and its applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research is divided into two themes: low dimensional topology and operator K-theory. In both fields, the aforementioned analytic tools are used to build invariants to study the geometric structure of manifolds, which are spaces modelled on Euclidean spaces, like the 3-dimensional space we live in. In both low dimensional topology and operator K-theory, the PI will use analytic tools to study questions about these spaces, such as how they are curved or how objects can be embedded inside them. These questions have a wide range of applications in biology and physics. The educational and outreach goals of this project involve math and general STEM enrichment programs at the middle and high school levels, with a focus on programs aimed at students from underserved communities and underrepresented groups, as well as mentorship in research at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.<br/><br/>In low dimensional topology, this project focuses on furthering our understanding of instanton and monopole Floer homologies and their relation to Khovanov homology, and using this to study existence questions of families of metrics with positive scalar curvature on manifolds, as well as questions about knot concordance. Separately this project also involves computationally studying knot concordance, both by a computer search for concordances and by computationally studying certain local equivalence and almost local equivalence groups that receive homomorphisms from the knot concordance groups. In operator algebras, this project focuses on studying their K-theory and its applications to invariants in geometry and topology. The K-theory groups of operator algebras are the targets of index maps of elliptic operators and have important applications to the geometry and topology of manifolds. This project involves studying the K-theory of certain C*-algebras and using them to study infinite dimensional spaces; studying the noncommutative geometry of groups that act on these infinite dimensional spaces and, in particular, the strong Novikov conjecture for these groups; and studying the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture for high dimensional expanders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry can be described as the study of systems of polynomial equations and their solutions, whereas topology is the mathematical discipline that studies notions such as ?shape? and ?space"" and develops mathematical techniques to distinguish and classify such objects. A notion of central importance in these areas is that of a ?moduli space? - this is a mathematical ?world map? that gives a complete inventory and classification of all instances of a particular mathematical object. The main research objective of the project is to better understand the structure of these spaces and to explore new phenomena, by importing techniques from neighboring areas of mathematics. While the primary aim is to advance knowledge in pure mathematics, developments from these areas have also had a long track record of successful applications in physics, data science, computer vision, and robotics. The educational component includes an outreach initiative consisting of a ?Math Circles Institute? (MCI). The purpose of the MCI is to train K-12 teachers from around the country in running the mathematical enrichment activities known as Math Circles. This annual 1-week program will pair teachers with experienced instructors to collaboratively develop new materials and methods to be brought back to their home communities. In addition, a research conference will be organized with the aim of attracting an international community of researchers and students and disseminating developments related to the research objectives of the proposal.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the research component is to develop new methods via topology and geometric group theory to study various moduli spaces, specifically, (1) strata of Abelian differentials and (2) families of polynomials. A major objective is to establish ?asphericality"" (vanishing of higher homotopy) of these spaces. A second objective is to develop the geometric theory of their fundamental groups. Asphericality occurs with surprising frequency in spaces coming from algebraic geometry, and often has profound consequences. Decades on, asphericality conjectures of Arnol?d, Thom, and Kontsevich?Zorich remain largely unsolved, and it has come to be regarded as a significantly challenging topic. This project?s goal is to identify promising-looking inroads. The PI has developed a method called ""Abel-Jacobi flow"" that he proposes to use to establish asphericality of some special strata of Abelian differentials. A successful resolution of this program would constitute a major advance on the Kontsevich?Zorich conjecture; other potential applications are also described. The second main focus is on families of polynomials. This includes linear systems on algebraic surfaces; a program to better understand the fundamental groups is outlined. Two families of univariate polynomials are also discussed, with an eye towards asphericality conjectures: (1) the equicritical stratification and (2) spaces of fewnomials. These are simple enough to be understood concretely, while being complex enough to require new techniques. In addition to topology, the work proposed here promises to inject new examples into geometric group theory. Many of the central objects of interest in the field (braid groups, mapping class groups, Artin groups) are intimately related to algebraic geometry. The fundamental groups of the spaces the PI studies here should be just as rich, and a major goal of the project is to bring this to fruition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program will expose a new generation of undergraduates and early-career researchers to the new ideas, developments, and open problems in the exciting meeting place between topology and quantum field theory where many surprising advances were made recently.<br/><br/>There is a rich interplay between quantum field theory and topology. The program ?Field theory and Topology? will focus on recent extraordinary developments in this interplay -- new invariants of manifolds and knots coming from field-theoretic constructions; new languages and paradigms for field theory coming from interaction with topology:  functorial field theory, cohomological (Batalin-Vilkovisky) approach, approach via derived geometry and via factorization algebras. Among subjects discussed at the program will also be supersymmetric and extended topological field theories, holomorphic twists.

This project will investigate the rigidity problems concerning mapping class groups and homeomorphism groups of manifolds. The PI will use methods from dynamical systems, geometric group theory, low dimensional topology, and differential geometry. The educational activities include high school outreach, undergraduates research through REU projects, mentoring graduate students in the home institution, and workshops organizations. <br/><br/>Symmetry is a pervasive concept in mathematics. In the study of differential topology, the full symmetry group is the diffeomorphism group of a manifold. There are two sides of a diffeomorphism group: one is the mapping class group, the group of connected components of a diffeomorphism group; the other is the identity component of a diffeomorphism group, which is a connected topological group. The PI will study these groups using both geometric group theory through the study of how those groups act on certain complexes and dynamical tools through the study of how those groups act on other manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An unsolved conjecture posits a deep connection between the geometry of supersymmetric quantum field theories and certain structures in algebraic topology. Resolving this conjecture would provide new insight into the mathematical foundations of quantum field theory, while also providing several long-anticipated applications of algebraic topology in physics. The projects the PI will work on leverage higher categorical symmetries to gain new insights into this 30-year-old conjecture. The award supports graduate students working with the PI whose research will contribute to this area. The PI will also continue his involvement in mathematics education for incarcerated people through the Education Justice Project in Illinois.<br/><br/>The proposed research is centered on an equivariant refinement of Stolz and Teichner?s conjectured geometric model for elliptic cohomology from 2-dimensional supersymmetric field theories. The overarching goal is to link structures in Lurie?s 2-equivariant elliptic cohomology with the geometry of supersymmetric gauge theories. Some of the projects are natural extensions of prior work at heights zero and one, focusing on height 2 generalizations of specific quantum field theories that are expected to construct elliptic Thom classes. Other projects will initiate the study of 2-equivariant geometry, interfacing with topics in string geometry, loop group representation theory, and elliptic power operations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award will also fund workshops at Oberlin College in 2025 and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 2026. These workshops provide an annual opportunity for active researchers and graduate students in the mathematical field of geometric topology to interact in a setting that provides multiple tangible benefits, including:<br/>1) attending the lectures of a principal speaker to receive an in-depth introduction to important current streams of research being performed by nationally-recognized experts,<br/>2) learning about a breadth of other research activities by attending shorter talks given by the other workshop participants,<br/>3) the opportunity to share their own work by giving talks in a congenial environment, and<br/>4) important time for informal discussion and interaction among participants and with the principal speaker.<br/>These workshops regularly feature participation and talks by members of underrepresented groups in mathematics, and, to further broaden the impact of the workshops, the talks of the principal speaker will be recorded and posted to the internet. The workshops also provide significant benefits to graduate students by providing a serious but informal research atmosphere in which they can meet and learn from others in the field. NSF funding will be used to cover the attendance costs of workshop participants.<br/><br/>More specifically, the workshops provide opportunities for geometric topologists to interact and share ideas, leading to research collaborations. Furthermore, the proposed workshops will continue the tradition of inviting each year a renowned principal speaker to provide a series of three lectures on a topic of his or her choice for the purpose of expanding the interests of the participants by having a nationally-recognized expert discuss an important area of current interest. The 2024 workshop will feature Professor Maggie Miller of the University of Texas -- Austin.

Since spheres are the fundamental building blocks of topological spaces, the stable stems, which encode the possible relations between high-dimensional spheres up to continuous deformation, are a central object of study. Beyond topology, the stable stems have surprisingly broad applications throughout mathematics, ranging from geometric problems, such as classifying differentiable structures on spheres, to algebraic problems, such as classifying projective modules over rings. This project will explore further applications of stable homotopy theory in algebra, topology, and geometry. Broader impacts center on online community building. The PI will continue co-organizing the Electronic Computational Homotopy Theory Online Research Community, which aims to increase inclusion at the undergraduate, graduate, and senior levels by organizing undergraduate research opportunities, graduate courses, online seminars, mini-courses, and networking events. To address inequality at the K-12 level, the PI will develop and manage a program pairing undergraduates from his home institution with students from local after-school programs for online tutoring. This program would circumvent certain barriers to participation, such as lack of access to transportation and facilities, which are common in traditional outreach.<br/><br/>Specific research projects include the study of the stable stems and their applications in geometric topology, algebro-geometric analogues of the stable stems and their connections to number theory, and equivariant analogues of algebraic K-theory and their applications in algebra and geometry. More specifically, building on previous work, the PI will study the stable stems using topological modular forms and the Mahowald invariant, aiming to deduce the existence of exotic spheres in new dimensions. In a related direction, the PI will use the kq-resolution introduced in previous work to study the motivic stable stems, an algebro-geometric analogues of the stable stems. The main goal is to apply the kq-resolution to relate the motivic stable stems to arithmetic invariants like Hermitian K-theory. Real algebraic K-theory, which encodes classical invariants like algebraic K-theory, Hermitian K-theory, and L-theory, will also be studied using the trace methods developed in previous work. The overarching goal is extending results from algebraic K-theory to real algebraic K-theory, thereby obtaining results for Hermitian K-theory and L-theory that will have applications in algebra and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
