Major projects include: (a) studying quasi-isometries using a new notion of coarse differentiation (introduced in recent joint work with Eskin and Whyte); (b) developing techniques for studying rigidity of dynamical systems based on analytic techniques from pde, particularly the theory of wavefront sets; (c) classifying hyperbolic groups which act smoothly on their boundaries using ideas from both dynamics and geometric group theory; (d) developing new cohomological methods in the study of rigidity of group actions. All research lies in the broad interdisciplinary area of rigidity in dynamics, geometry and topology. Many proposed projects involve applying analytic ideas and techniques to problems traditionally studied by dynamical, geometric or topological methods.<br/><br/>In the study of mathematical objects, a key role is often played by the symmetries of the object - particularly when the object has many symmetries. The PI investigates ways of characterizing, describing and studying spaces with many symmetries in various dynamical, geometric and topological settings. These questions are interdisciplinary in nature and often require learning, adapting and applying ideas and techniques from many areas of mathematics. The PI's work has connections with diverse areas of mathematics: from differential equations (the use of waverfront sets to study fine analytic properties of solutions to equations) to theoretical computer science (expander graphs, Kazhdan's property (T) and coarse embedding problems)."

Major directions for this research include: (1) Applications of autostackable structures to 3-manifold groups, Thompson's group F, and metabelian groups; these structures are characterized using a combination of topological and formal language theory properties of the Cayley graph, and provide algorithms for solving the word problem and for building Dehn diagrams for the group.  (2) A study of the asymptotic growth of conjugacy classes and of geodesic words and elements (up to conjugacy) of groups. (3) Improving understanding of filling invariants, by studying refinements of the isodiametric (i.e. intrinsic diameter) inequality and its extrinsic analog. (4) Applications of group invariants to problems in knot theory; local moves, in combination with the standard Reidemeister operations, will be studied to determine when these local moves are (or are not) unknotting or unlinking operations.<br/><br/>The proposed work is centered around mathematical problems at the interface between group theory, geometry, and computer science.  Group theory is the mathematical study of symmetries of objects; this research area has its beginnings in the study of crystal structures in chemistry, but now has wide applications across many disparate areas of mathematics and the sciences. Knot theory also has seen wide application in recent years, and in particular the study of unknotting via local moves is used to model enzyme actions on DNA molecules. The methods proposed make essential use of tools from one or more of these fields to shed light on important problems in another field.  In particular geometric methods are used in the pursuit of computationally effective and efficient algorithms for groups, and algorithmic methods are used to determine geometric properties of groups, including applications to knot theory.  This project includes mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics research."

Undergraduate students will also have the opportunity to work on independent research projects during the Spring semester. At the graduate level, there will be 3 advanced summer mini-courses, each 2 weeks long, with speakers coming from around the country and abroad. Other activities include various types of seminars. There will be vertical integration in these activities among faculty, postdocs and students. Activities will cover the span of the 5 academic years during the funding period, plus a total of 10 summer weeks. The grant will support directly 6 undergraduate students in one-semester long independent research projects, 25 eleven-month graduate student stipends, and 9 postdoctoral fellows to be partially supported by the grant with the remaining support coming from the department. The grant will also provide support for about 50 undergraduates and 60 graduate students during the summers schools, and cover tuition for the semester-long courses in Modern Mathematics for 30 undergraduate students. <br/> <br/>This research training is designed to provide students and postdocs a high level of mathematical training. The faculty in the Algebraic Geometry and Topology groups at the University of Utah has a prominent research record, and the grant will support bringing the graduate and postdoctoral program to the same level. The grant will also strengthen the already close connections between the two groups. The various activities, especially the summer mini-courses, will serve to attract talented students to come to Utah, either as graduate students or as postdoctoral associates. This program will impact young mathematical scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels, and will provide an environment which will stimulate collaboration across levels and across fields. The program will have a deep impact also in the training of our senior graduate students and postdocs into becoming effective, motivated teachers and mentors. As they grow into mature mathematicians, this will have a long-lasting effect well beyond our local environment and the duration of the grant."

Based on his recent work, the PI proposes an approach to the A-B slice problem, a formulation of the topological 4-dimensional surgery conjecture for non-abelian free groups. In recent years algebraic invariants have been found for key examples of decompositions of the 4-ball, and the goal is to combine them to formulate an obstruction to surgery in the context of the A-B slice problem. The project also includes a number of problems in quantum topology; some of them are motivated by the PI's recent work with Cooper on categorification of the Jones-Wenzl projectors. Specific problems concern algebraic structures underlying categorified spin networks and the colored Jones polynomial, and an approach to categorification of 3-manifold invariants using ideas related to localization. The PI's ongoing collaboration with physicist Fendley is aimed at identifying higher categorical structures in the context of quantum statistical mechanics.<br/><br/>Topology is the study of shapes that locally look like the Euclidean space. Topological study of shapes in dimensions 3 and 4 is particularly important due to connections with physics, and it became apparent in the 1980s that the geometric classification in these ""low"" dimensions is a substantially more difficult problem than that in dimensions greater than four. At the same time, a wide array of tools and insights from other areas of mathematics and theoretical physics is available for solving topological problems in three and four dimensions. A part of this project will use such algebraic tools to address the classification of large-scale 4-dimensional shapes. The relevant algebraic invariants (in particular, the Milnor group) precisely encode the topological information about the motion of strings in 3-space. Another part of this project will explore interdisciplinary connections between Topology and Statistical Mechanics, with expected applications in both fields."

It is natural to impose geometric constraints to narrow the possibilities, and an interesting such constraint is the existence of a symplectic structure. In the case of 4-manifolds with boundary the natural structure arising on the boundary is a contact structure; there are many deep and fascinating questions involving contact and symplectic topology, and their interplay with smooth topology coming from gauge-theoretic invariants. The PI will use symplectic and contact geometry in conjunction with Floer homology invariants to study several related questions. First, the PI has introduced several new geometric operations on 4-manifolds that can be realized as instances of monodromy substitutions in Lefschetz fibrations, and has proved convexity results that mean such substitution operations are  symplectic. The PI will pursue this line of inquiry with the goal of finding new constructions of exotic symplectic 4-manifolds. Second, the PI will study Stein fillings of contact structures supported by planar open books: by translating the classification problem for Stein fillings into a certain symplectic isotopy problem, the PI will adapt pseudo-holomorphic techniques of Siebert--Tian and others to study finiteness questions for this situation. Next, the PI will study the problem of ""symplectic fiber sum decomposition,"" which is the question of whether a symplectic manifold diffeomorphic to a fiber sum can be realized as a symplectic fiber sum. This question has bearing on the hypothesis that gauge-theoretic invariants do not provide complete information on the diffeomorphism types of 4-manifolds in a fixed homeomorphism class. Finally, he will pursue recent work relating Heegaard Floer homology with an invariant of open book decompositions of 3-manifolds called the fractional Dehn twist coefficient. <br/><br/>Since Einstein's description of mechanics and electrodynamics as inherently a four-dimensional theory, the observed universe has generally been conceived as a smooth four-dimensional manifold: that is, a four-dimensional analog of a smooth surface such as a plane or sphere. A fundamental question is then: what manifold is it? To pose a simplified analogy, the surface of the earth is generally ""flat"" when viewed by a casual observer, but it is a mistake to infer that it is planar. The universe is similarly ""mostly flat"" on an appropriate distance scale, but its global topology or ""shape"" is not known. A goal of the 4-manifold topologist, then, is to describe the list of possibilities for the structure of the universe, in analogy with the relatively easy-to-understand list of possible surfaces from which a ""generally flat"" object like the surface of the earth can select. There are two ways to focus this effort: by introducing  geometric structures (in this case a ""symplectic"" structure, loosely a way of measuring area or volume) that do not exist on every 4-manifold, yet leave a rich and interesting class of examples to study and may also give a stepping-stone to the general situation; and by ""cutting"" a complicated manifold into simpler pieces and studying the latter individually. The work supported by this grant will use both these approaches: apply techniques recently introduced by the PI and collaborators to construct interesting new examples of symplectic 4-manifolds; and also study whether and how symplectic 4-manifolds can be decomposed into simpler pieces. Moreover, the PI hopes to make progress in classifying some of the most rigid of these pieces, known as Stein manifolds, with the aim of exploring some of the poorly-understood myriad of possibilities in smooth 4-dimensional topology."

The first is to find surface subgroups for certain natural classes of groups: the fundamental group of a negatively curved rank 1 locally symmetric space, or more generally of a closed negatively curved manifold; a hyperbolic group whose Gromov boundary is connected; or the mapping class group of a compact surface. The second project is to count ""virtual immersions"" of a geometrically finite open 3-manifold into a closed hyperbolic 3- or 4-manifold, with an aim toward assembling these virtual immersions into a virtual immersion of a more complex 3-manifold (and inductively counting the number of such immersions). The third project is to develop the theory of degenerate complex structures (with something like measured laminations), and use this theory to prove bounds for renormalization of quadratic-like maps, and to provide a sufficient condition for a finite subdivision rule to be conformally realized, with an eye towards proving the Cannon conjecture. <br/><br/>One of the fundamental jobs of the mathematical researcher is to classify the objects that we have defined. A manifold is a space with some number of dimensions, with no boundaries or edges but which is finite in extent. Examples of two-dimensional manifolds include the surface of the Earth and the surface of an inner tube; the two-dimensional manifolds have been classified since the early twentieth century. Recent results including the work of the proposer have made it possible to classify three-dimensional manifolds as well; this classification is made possible by finding two-dimensional objects within the three-dimensional manifold that divides it in such a way as to elucidate its structure. Our ultimate goal is to arrive at a much deeper understanding of the three-dimensional space that we live in."

One of the central themes in the project is the analysis of weakly commensurable Zariski-dense subgroups.  The notion of weak commensurability was introduced earlier in a joint work of the PI and G. Prasad, and its analysis for arithmetic groups has led to a resolution of several problems in differential geometry dealing with length-commensurable and isospectral arithmetically defined locally symmetric spaces.  In the current project, some finiteness results which were previously known only for arithmetic groups are expected to be generalized to arbitrary Zariski-dense subgroups.  This work is likely to have interesting consequences for non-arithmetically defined locally symmetric spaces.  It is also related to the problem in the theory of algebraic groups of to what extent an absolutely almost simple algebraic group over a field K is determined by the isomorphism classes of its maximal K-tori.  This part of the project will build on the PI's recent results analyzing division algebras having the same maximal subfields.  The PI also intends to continue the investigation of the congruence subgroup problem.<br/> <br/>Generally speaking, the project focuses on the analysis of a very broad class of matrix groups (Zariski-dense subgroups of semisimple algebraic groups) based on the information about the eigenvalues of their elements.  This approach is fundamental in the representation theory of finite groups, but as was discovered by the PI and G. Prasad it can also be used to characterize many arithmetic groups (which are special groups whose elements are matrices with integer matrices).  The goal of the project is to extend some of these results to groups much more general than arithmetic.  This work has applications to the famous question ''Can one hear the shape of a drum?'' in the context of some special spaces called locally symmetric spaces."

Mark Feighn and the PI have been focusing on the  conjugacy problem for Out(F)  in the case that the elements in question have polynomial growth.  The intent is to complete this  important special case and then to the solve the full conjugacy problem by merging the techniques from the polynomially growing case with those already developed to solve the exponentially growing case.

Topological and geometric methods are used to study dynamical systems and in return, ideas from dynamics are used to formulate and prove fundamental topological and geometric properties of outer automorphisms  and mapping classes.  There is currently a great deal of interest in the large scale geometry of the group of outer automorphisms of the free group and this proposal is well situated to make substantial progress on this front."

The long term research objective of this program is proving the conjecture of the PI and his collaborators that there is a duality operation on symplectic singularities. At moment, the most important property of this proposed duality is its effect on the representation theory of associated algebras: ""categories O"" attached to the singularities should be Koszul dual (that is, induce a very special equivalence of categories). Many special cases of this duality are well-understood, but what links them remains to be investigated. This research is also tied up in the exploration of individual examples of these singularities; in these our proposal would be a ""geometrification"" and ""categorification"" of well-known dualities in mathematics, such as Schur-Weyl duality, rank-level duality and Gale duality. Our perspective also provides a fruitful approach to topics as diverse as the representation theory of symplectic reflection algebras and the Rouquier-Khovanov-Lauda categorification of quantum groups, and has applications as far afield as low-dimensional topology. <br/><br/>One of the most shocking discoveries of the 20th century was the discovery of quantum mechanics, and the introduction of non-commuting observables into physics.  Mathematicians have built on these observations to create an abstract theory of ""deformation quantization"" and ""noncommutative geometry."" The PI's work is about the relationships between the geometry of classical limits of noncommutative spaces on one hand, and state spaces that could describe related physical systems on the other.  The PI further proposes an educational component which creates a website platform for mathematical exposition, based on Wordpress. This will make blogs, wikis, and a whole range of of websites that don?t quite fit in those categories, and more closely resemble a dynamic version of a homepage freely and easily available to the mathematical community in a professional setting.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Topology program."

Three projects aim to use topological methods to understand the Brauer group, Azumaya algebras, and more generally torsors on schemes. (1) The PI will study the extent to which the foundational results of Jackowski, McClure, and Oliver on maps between classifying spaces of complex algebraic groups can be extended to finite approximations to these classifying spaces. Progress on this problem will enable the solution of a host of problems about when torsors for complex algebraic groups extend from the generic point of a scheme to the entire scheme. In low dimensions, early progress on this problem has been used by the PI and Ben Williams to settle an old question of Auslander and Goldman on the existence of Azumaya maximal orders in unramified division algebras, where it transpires that there are purely topological obstructions to the existence of these Azumaya maximal orders. (2) The PI will work toward computing the Chow groups and singular cohomology of the classifying spaces of special linear groups by various central subgroups. This has been done in special cases by Vezzosi and Vistoli. However, greater generality is needed for most applications. These Chow groups are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry, controlling the characteristic classes associated to certain torsors of fundamental importance in the study of the Brauer group. The computations will be directly useful to the first project, and to the following project. (3) The PI and Ben Williams previously formulated the topological period-index problem and established first results. They will continue this study, especially as it relates to the algebraic period-index conjecture. In particular, their results in low dimensions suggest a method for disproving the period-index conjecture, which would be a fundamental advance. Following this idea to its conclusion is the major aspiration of the first set of projects. A fourth project aims to continue to build a bridge between higher category theory and classical algebraic geometry, bringing the formidable techniques of the former to bear on various questions in the arithmetic of derived categories. For example, the PI is developing a toolbox using higher category theory that will allow a purely derived-category proof of Panin's computations of the K-theory of projective homogeneous spaces, once the existence of certain exceptional objects on the split forms of these spaces is known.<br/><br/>The PI proposes work in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, two areas of modern mathematics. Algebraic geometry is an ancient subject with many connections to real-world problems. Its goal is to understand the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, equations of central importance in various disciplines, such as theoretical physics, cryptography, and the modeling of dynamical systems like weather. Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to the analysis of large data sets that occur in computer vision and cancer research, frequently finding patterns that more traditional methods of data analysis fail to find. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several questions in algebraic geometry which have been identified by the community as among the most important."

Principally, the investigator plans to study dynamical and geometric structures of ""higher rank"" systems in these areas. These appear naturally in seemingly quite separate areas, for example in number theory or in studying the spectrum of the Laplacian. The investigator will work on rigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian and semi-simple Lie groups and their lattices striving to classify such systems under suitable geometric or dynamical hypotheses.  In particular, he will study higher rank hyperbolic abelian actions and their cocycles on tori and homogeneous spaces as well as general Cartan actions of rank 2. These special cases provide tests for more general conjectures.  The investigator will also study actions by semi-simple groups and their lattices preserving projective, affine and other geometric structures.  In addition, the investigator will analyze Riemannian manifolds (especially those of higher spherical rank) and more general singular spaces and their geodesic flows. Geometric, dynamical and group theoretic tools will be used in this research.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems and ergodic theory investigate the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time, such as turbulence in a fluid flow. New ideas and concepts such as chaos and fractals have changed our understanding of the world. Dynamics and ergodic theory provide excellent mathematical tools, and have a strong impact on the sciences and engineering. Symbolic dynamics for instance has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for computer science. Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology. Geometry is a highly developed and ancient field in mathematics of amazing vigor.  It studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.  Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, starting with Gauss in the nineteenth century. It is closely linked with physics and other sciences and applied areas such as computer vision. Geometry and dynamics are closely related.  Indeed, important dynamical systems come from geometry, and vice versa geometry provides tools to study dynamical systems. One main goal of this project studies when two dynamical systems commute, i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes brought on by the other. Important examples of such systems arise from geometry when the space contains many flat subspaces.  Group theory finally enters both dynamics and geometry by studying the group of symmetries of a geometry or dynamical situation, or by investigating the dynamical and geometric behavior of the group of symmetries acting on a space."

Many of these investigations are motivated by the classical study of  the Teichmuller space of hyperbolic (or conformal) structures on a surface. For example, the Hitchin component of the space of (conjugacy classes of) representations of a closed surface group into PSL(n,R) has been shown to have many striking resemblances to Teichmuller space. Prof. Canary, in collaboration with Bridgeman, Labourie and Sambarino, has recently developed a mapping class group invariant metric on each Hitchin component which restricts to the Weil-Petersson metric on the Fuchsian locus. Prof. Canary proposes to investigate the properties of this metric and use it as a tool to understand the geometry of the Hitchin component. More generally, he proposes to study metrics on spaces of Anosov representations of word hyperbolic groups into semi-simple Lie groups. Prof. Canary also proposes to study the topology and geometry of deformation spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The Ending Lamination Theorem provides a classification of the manifolds in these deformation spaces, but as the invariants in this classification are not continuous, it does not provide a parameterization. Recent work has shown that the topology of these spaces has a rich structure and many intriguing questions remain to be studied.<br/><br/><br/>Prof. Canary will study deformation spaces of geometric structures on manifolds. A 2-dimensional manifold is a space which looks locally like the 2-dimensional plane, e.g. the surface of a basketball or a pretzel. A geometric structure gives a way of measuring distances and angles on the manifold. It is natural to then study  spaces of  geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed  manifold. The classical Teichmuller theory studies all hyperbolic geometric structures on a fixed surface.  Teichmuller theory has played a central role in several mathematical fields, e.g. complex analysis and dynamics, as well as in physics, especially in string theory. Similarly, a 3-manifold is a space that looks locally like 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The universe we live in is an example of a 3-dimensional manifold. Professor Canary proposes to study deformation spaces of hyperbolic geometric structures on 3-manifolds. More generally,  Prof. Canary will study  both the geometry and the topology of deformation spaces of  geometric structures arising from representations of groups into semi-simple Lie groups. In addition, Prof. Canary will continue his commitment to undergraduate education, by continuing his involvement with curriculum development in courses using inquiry-based learning techniques, and his work mentoring graduate students and postdoctoral assistant professors."

These compactifications, called moduli spaces of stable quasimaps, produce new curve-counting invariants, which are expected to be related by wall-crossing formulas with Gromov-Witten invariants. In recent work with Kim, the PI has found such wall-crossing formulas in genus zero and they turn out to give a significant generalization of Givental's toric mirror theorems. The PI will work to extend the theory in several directions. First, the wall-crossing formulas should extend to curves of higher genus, and the resulting theory for Calabi-Yau three-folds is conjecturally equal to the BCOV B-model theory of the mirror Calabi-Yau, but WITHOUT changing coordinates by the mirror map. The PI plans to prove this conjecture at least for local Calabi-Yau targets. Other projects will provide extensions to orbifold targets (with applications to the Crepant Resolution Conjecture), and to Landau-Ginzburg models (with applications to the Calabi-Yau/LG correspondence). Further applications, such as a proof of the general Abelian/Non-abelian Correspondence in Gromov-Witten theory are also expected.<br/><br/>This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, an old and highly developed branch of mathematics, which at its core is the study of geometric shapes defined by polynomial equations. Moduli theory is concerned with how these shapes deform. The moduli spaces studied by the investigator have deep connections with the mirror symmetry phenomenon discovered in string theory, a very active area of theoretical physics. In the last two decades, the results and techniques from algebraic geometry, especially the theory of moduli spaces, have been successfully employed in string theory. On the other hand, ideas from string theory have opened up new directions of research in mathematics by suggesting striking conjectures and at the same time putting old unsolved problems into a new light. The project will continue this fruitful interaction by offering new insights on mirror symmetry at higher genus.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Topology programs."

A primary feature in this investigation is a certain localization of complexity that occurs in maps of surfaces, and has deep relations to the theory of 3-manifolds and their hyperbolic structure, as well as to the geometry of the Teichmuller and moduli space of conformal structures on a surface. The structure of the complex of curves on a surface plays a role in all these settings, which the PI plans to continue investigating and refining. Particular goals include genus-independent versions of existing theorems on the complex of curves, or versions where genus dependence is explicit; quantitative control of Thurston's skinning map; and better understanding of other settings where gluing maps determine the structure of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Particular attention will be paid to the compressible-boundary case. In Teichmuller theory, the PI will investigate the behavior of Weil-Petersson geodesic flow and its relation to combinatorial invariants arising from the complex of curves.<br/><br/><br/>Geometry and topology play a fundamental role in mathematics. Geometric spaces arise in many settings, either as explicit objects we visualize directly, or via abstractions such as configuration spaces of systems or parameter spaces. The topology of a space is the way it is combinatorially put together without regard to geometry, but often these topological descriptions suffice to determine the geometry uniquely. This phenomenon is called rigidity and plays a central role. In low dimensions there is a confluence of many different aspects of mathematics which interact with rigidity, including analysis, complex analysis and dynamics. Moreover, the visualizability and accessibility of the low-dimensional setting brings many subtle phenomena into focus and serves as a testing ground for new mathematical ideas. Within this setting we propose to investigate a number of quantitative aspects of rigidity, particularly ways in which complexity in the topological description translates to features of the geometry."

Research one-hour talks are complemented by several mini-courses given by the leading experts in the field. <br/><br/>Geometric group theory is a relatively young field with roots in combinatorial group theory and topology. In the mid 1980's, spurred by ideas of Gromov, group theorists began to pay attention to the geometric structures which cell complexes can carry. This attention shed a great deal of light on the earlier combinatorial and topological investigations and stimulated other innovative ideas which have been developing at a rapid pace. As it has grown over the past 20 years, geometric group theory has developed many different facets, including geometry, topology, analysis, logic.  Asymptotic behavior of infinite groups has been one of the main themes in geometric group theory since the early nineties. The asymptotic invariants of a group reflect the large-scale geometry of the group, they paly an important part in theory and applications.  Interplay between group actions and dynamical systems is a new area of group theory.  On the one hand, conformal dynamical systems yield a rich source of such groups with interesting algebraic, geometric, and spectral properties. On the other hand, such groups can be shown to yield conformal dynamical systems with remarkable geometric and measure-theoretic regularity. <br/><br/>http://www.unige.ch/~tatiana/Diablerets/Diablerets/home.html"

Many moduli spaces of interest arise in this fashion: flat fiber bundles over a surface, and (parabolic) Higgs bundles are examples. These spaces are sometimes called character varieties. The study of character varieties intersects the invariant theory of products of matrix groups, and so owes much of its structure to the non-commutative ring of generic matrices (matrices over polynomial indeterminates). Since character varieties may be considered spaces of equivalence classes of representations of the fundamental group of a base space (topology) into a Lie group (geometry), they find applications throughout differential geometry and mathematical physics. The central goal of the proposed work is to use the strong relationship to non-commutative ring theory to answer questions about the homotopic, arithmetic, and dynamical structure of character varieties.<br/><br/>Mathematicians' endeavor to classify mathematical objects is not unlike, for example, the biologists' endeavor to classify species. The purpose of this project is to classify and advance the understanding of certain mathematical objects called ""character varieties."" Informally, character varieties provide data which encodes equivalent ways one can associate the flexible shape of a object to a rigid shape of that same object. For example, a rubber band is a flexible ""circle,"" but once one stipulates a radius a rigid circle is determined. The study of the geometry of character varieties in some sense can be thought of as the ""geometry of geometry."" In part because of this, character varieties find applications throughout differential geometry and in mathematical physics. In this project, the PI and his collaborators and students will use certain non-symmetrical structures associated with character varieties as a tool to explore and answer novel questions about their shape, and how their elements relate to each other by certain motions. Another important part of this project is the training of undergraduate research assistants in the PI's Experimental Algebra and Geometry Lab, and the conducting of community outreach activities which communicate the importance and beauty of pure mathematics."

One way to understand a surface is to study the various ?natural? geometric structures on the surface and how the different structures relate to each other. The parameter space all geometric structures on a given surface is a fundamental mathematical object called the moduli space. This is usually a higher-dimensional space that itself naturally carries many rich and interesting geometric structures.

Hyperbolic 3-manifolds constitute a complicated and mysterious class of 3-manifolds, and it is important to understand them to the fullest extent possible.  The simplest tool for analyzing hyperbolic 3-manifolds is the volume invariant.  The proposer plans to work on a grandiose open problem in the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and to use the knowledge gained from this work to better understand the connections between the topology and the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  The grandiose open problem is to find the first infinite string of volumes of 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds; that is, to find all 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds with volume less than that of the minimum volume 2-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold(s).  The proposer, working jointly with D. Gabai, and in consultation with N. Thurston, has a computer-based scheme to attack this problem.  The computational aspects of the approach are interesting in their own right.  <br/><br/>Almost 200 years ago, J. Bolyai, C. Gauss, and N. Lobachevsky revolutionized mathematics by claiming that a legitimate geometry could be constructed by taking the five classical postulates of Euclid and negating the fifth postulate (the parallel postulate).   Further, they theorized that this new and mysterious non-Euclidean geometry (now called ""hyperbolic geometry"") would have important applications.  Their theorizing has been borne out:  hyperbolic geometry is vitally important in the modern study of geometry.  For example, hyperbolic geometry turns out to be much more important than Euclidean geometry in the study of ""3-dimensional manifolds"" (our 3-dimensional Universe is an example of a 3-dimensional manifold).  As another example, it is quite possible that our Universe adheres to the laws of non-Euclidean geometry rather than the laws of Euclidean geometry.The proposer, working jointly with D. Gabai, and in consultation with N. Thurston, plans to work on a computer-based approach to understanding hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds by studying their volume, or size.  This understanding of volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds should lead to a variety of insights about hyperbolic 3-manifolds, including connections between their topology (shape) and geometry (measurement).  Such connections between seemingly unrelated areas often have profound implications for mathematics."

In the setting of Riemann surfaces we study Teichmueller curves, Jacobians with real multiplication, volumes of complex hyperbolic cone manifolds and representations of the braid group developed by Picard, Deligne-Mostow and Thurston.

In the setting of lattices we aim to investigate packing constants of ideals in number fields, and to demonstrate an abundance of bounded orbits for rank one flows, to complement the dearth of such orbits predicted in higher rank by conjectures of Littlewood and Margulis. Finally, in the setting of iterated rational maps in one complex variable, we study the natural bifurcation measure on moduli spaces attached to individual critical points, and aim to show their independence and transversality, with an eye towards arithmetic applications. We also intend to link the theory of Berkovitch spaces to the degeneration of hyperbolic manifolds to trees.<br/><br/>From particle physics to finance, from evolution to climate change, the world is full of dynamical systems.  Simple algebraic transformations already exhibit many of the features of these natural phenomena, such as phase transitions and tipping points that signal the onset of new regimes.

Heegaard Floer homology is a package of invariants defined via methods in gauge theory and symplectic geometry. The PI will investigate the relationship between Heegaard Floer homology and many other aspects of low-dimensional topology. More specifically, the PI will study the geography and botany problems of Heegaard Floer homology. By doing so, the PI hopes to answer questions about Dehn surgeries and Khovanov homology. The PI will also address the applications of Floer homology to 4-dimensional topology, for example, the topology of knot surgeries on the K3 surface.<br/><br/>Topology is a fundamental discipline of mathematics which studies the shape of spaces. The basic question is whether two spaces have the same shape. Moreover, if two spaces have different shapes, how different these two shapes are? Can we transform one space to another by certain simple processes? The techniques studied in this project give a way to extract information about spaces, thus answer the previous questions in some cases. This project also aims to make geometry and topology accessible to a broad audience, including undergraduate math majors and scholars from other disciplines. The PI will design new courses on the topics studied in this project. In addition, this project will incorporate Caltech's SURF program, which provides a chance to undergraduate students to do research. The PI will also broaden the influence of this field by mentoring graduate students and postdoctors, organizing seminars and conferences, teaching short courses in summer schools and workshops."

Understanding this could lead to quasi-isometric rigidity of automorphism groups of free groups. The proposal concludes with several smaller sections involving specific questions about the second homology of Torelli groups, homology growth of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms in finite covers, and the geometry of quadratic forms as seen from the well rounded retract.<br/><br/>The subject of the proposal is the study of topological and geometric properties of several objects that naturally appear in mathematics. For example, consider the collection of all possible finite graphs with a fixed number of cycles. This collection forms a space, called Outer space. There is a natural geometry associated with it, whose intrinsic feature is that it is not symmetric (not unlike in a city with one-way streets, where it might be quicker to get from A to B than from B to A). Nevertheless, this geometry displays hyperbolic features as well. In hyperbolic geometry, if one considers shortest paths joining each pair of three points A,B,C there is always a ""point of congestion"" T with all three of these paths coming close to T.

Goerss<br/><br/>The chromatic picture of stable homotopy uses the algebraic geometry of formal groups to organize and direct investigations into the deeper structures of the field. The program supported by this grant is to gather local information - the data that can been seen from formal groups of a single height - and then to assemble that data into a more global picture. It is in the second step where we can use constructions and information from derived algebraic geometry; these allow us to interpolate among heights. This proposal focuses on four projects, all growing out of this local-to-global mixture. The most computational is an investigation of the homotopy groups of the K(2)-local sphere; that is, what we can see at height 2. This long-standing project, with Hans-Werner Henn and others; we are seeing beautiful and  unexpected phenomena at low primes. A second, closely related project, is to investigate the fixed point spectra of Morava E-theory for certain closed subgroups of the Morava stabilizer group. These are much simpler than the sphere itself, but capture a great deal of the important homotopy theory. The other two projects are more global in nature. One is to investigate the existence and non-existence of derived schemes (or stacks) elliptic curves with level structure; that is, structured versions of the Hopkins-Miller theory of topological modular forms. The point here is to make a systematic investigation of the equivariant structure. The other project is to look at the Chromatic Splitting Conjecture through the lens of p-divisible groups.<br/><br/>All of these projects lie in homotopy theory, a branch of topology. The main aim of this field is to study mathematical phenomena which remain invariant under continuous transformations. Many familiar geometric phenomena - such as angles - are not invariant in this fashion; yet continuous transformations are natural and abundant. Long study has indicated that the among the most fruitful invariant phenomena are classes of maps from circles or, more generally, higher dimensional spheres, into the space to be studied. These are the homotopy groups. Historically these groups were described as a ""milling crowd""; however, the recent introduction of techniques and constructions from number theory and algebraic geometry have permitted us to do detailed calculations and to uncover large scale patterns of remarkable regularity and beauty."

The conference organizers hope to emphasize this point, highlighting the recent calculations and explaining what we have learned about basic homotopy theory. The largest success has been the solution of the Kervaire invariant problem and the attendant resurgence in interest in computational techniques in equivariant stable homotopy theory. Complementing this has been more progress in chromatic homotopy theory, both with large spectra, such as ring spectra coming from the theory of topological automorphic forms, and with small spectra, such as the K(2)-local sphere. There have also been new applications of old techniques, as the use of the Goodwillie calculus to study the EHP sequence and the use of Hochschild homology to make difficult calculations in algebraic K-theory.<br/><br/>Partly due to the shock provided by the solution of the Kervaire Invariant Problem, a great many young researchers have entered the field of algebraic topology, ranging from beginning graduate students to junior tenure-line faculty.

These topics are a natural outgrowth of previous research programs that focused on low-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds.  The areas of Kleinian groups and the geometry of 3-manifolds have seen an amazing amount of progress over the last decade. As a result these areas are in a position to refocus their efforts.  The situation has become more like that of surfaces where one is interested in families and spaces of structures.  It is important to try to understand the genealogy of 3-manifolds, how they are related by various topological and geometric operations. This has led to the study of many other types of geometric structures, such as projective and Lorentzian structures, that don't have an invariant metric.  These structures are interesting in their own right.  They also provide a context in which to view the relation between the different eight 3-dimensional metric geometries, leading to the concept of transitional geometry.  Furthermore, there are interesting questions about geometric structures in other dimensions, involving an array of different Lie groups, such as hyperbolic structures in high dimensions, complex and real projective structures on surfaces, and representations of surface groups into higher rank Lie groups.<br/><br/>The idea of studying various types of metrics on spaces dates back at least to the late 19th century and the work of Poincare, Klein, and others.  Much of their motivation came from the desire to understand physical phenomena.  Modern physics, beginning with Einstein, has led to an even greater need for sophisticated mathematics to understand the physical universe, particularly that coming from metric geometry.  Although the physical world is not a completely homogeneous one like the type of structures studied in this project, hyperbolic and Lorentzian geometry are believed to represent useful models for understanding physical phenomena.  Geometry in dimension 3 is particularly appealing because it is visually accessible to many people, including beginning mathematics students and those with less technical backgrounds.  It also has led to the creation of a number of graphical interfaces that have been widely utilized."

Define the deRham coHomotopy to  be the cohomology of the linearized deRham complex defined as  follows: first construct a resolution of the deRham algebra (A,d).  This is a differential algebra map of a free differential graded   commutative algebra (T,d) to the deRham algebra (A,d)   inducing a bijection on cohomology.The  linearized complex  is that induced on the generators [or indecomposables] of T by its  differential. This deRham Cohomotopy can be related to ordinary  homotopy for simply connected spaces and to algebraic K theory  of associative algebras using spaces with contractible universal  covers. The  concrete proof that this recipe is meaningful is the key  non-trivial point of  deRham Topology and to the applications  of this proposal. It is based on developing  explicitly the nonlinear  notion of homotopy between maps of differential algebras. One obtains  an illuminated picture of algebraic structures and maps between them  that closely resembles that of maps between cell complexes and  fibrations in usual topology. Thus one may analyze the theory of  algebraic objects defined by any number of multilinear operations with  j inputs and k outputs for j and k positive.In one envisaged set of  applications mathematical models in geometry and analysis that  involve infinitely many degrees of freedom and nonlinear structures,  finite dimensional approximating models  are constructed with  coherent mappings between the different levels of approximations.  The Hodge star operator [which associates to a linear subspace its  orthogonal complement] is not immediately amenable to this method. Thus the proposal also focuses on several  algebraic structures like  string theories and geometric structures like singularities in open and  closed strings particular to manifolds in order to finesse the  Hodge Star difficulty.<br/><br/>Some questions are linear problems. The quantitative answer depends  linearly on the data of the  problem. There are good techniques for these  problems. Nonlinear problems like the mathematical  models of ocean currents, flows of oil in a reservoir  and the weather  are   much more difficult to  get a grip on mathematically and computationally. The proposal claims that a technique of nonlinear topology holds some  promise to give a new  technique for treating quite general nonlinear  mathematical models of physical processes. The technique will be easy  to apply by offering finite models approximating nonlinear problems. The  likelihood these models will fit with reality and have predictive value is  enhanced because their derivation is based on the underlying  mathematical structure of the nonlinearities."

The main goal of the conference is to bring together mathematicians and physicists who work on ideas related to string theory. String theory, as well as quantum field theory, has contributed a series of profound ideas which gave rise to entirely new mathematical fields and revitalized older ones. For mathematics, string theory has been a source of many significant inspirations, ranging from Seiberg-Witten theory in four-manifolds, to enumerative geometry and Gromov-Witten theory in algebraic geometry, to work on the Jones polynomial in knot theory, to advances in symplectic topology, to recent progress in the geometric Langlands program and the development of derived algebraic geometry and n-category theory. In the other direction, mathematics has provided physicists with powerful tools, ranging from powerful differential geometric techniques for solving or analyzing key partial differential equations, to toric geometry, to K-theory and derived categories in D-branes, to the analysis of Calabi-Yau manifolds and string compactifications, to the use of modular forms and other arithmetic techniques. The depth, power and novelty of the results obtained in both fields thanks to their interaction is truly mind boggling. String-Math is the annual conference that was founded to reflect the most significant progress at the interface of string theory and mathematics.<br/><br/>String theory is the attempt to build a mathematical model which describes all four fundamental forces and all forms of matter. It assumes that the fundamental objects of the theory are one-dimensional objects - ""strings"" with elementary particles (i.e., electrons and quarks) being oscillations of fundamental strings. In particular, string theory aims to reconcile gravity, i.e., general relativity, with quantum mechanics which is the formalism in which the other three forces are described. String theory is very mathematical in nature and its development was based on advances in modern mathematics and inspired many recent developments in mathematics.  The main goal of the String-Math conference is to bring together mathematicians and physicists who work on ideas related to string theory.  By now there is a large and rapidly growing number of both mathematicians and physicists working at the string-theoretic interface between the two academic fields. The influence flows in both directions, with mathematical techniques and ideas contributing crucially to major advances in string theory. Following the success of first two meetings of String-Math series the conference String-Math 2013 is expected to have a major impact on the field and to serve as a record of the state of the art in string-related mathematics."

The proposed research will also focus on continuing the PI's development and research of generalized Kashaev quantum 3-manifold invariants.  These invariants are modeled on Kashaev's foundational work that led to the original formulation of the Volume Conjecture.  The final topic of the proposed research is to generalize his re-normalized Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants by defining 3-manifold invariants via surgery presentations of links with flat connections in their complements.  This work is both geometric and physical in nature and related to Chern-Simons theory.  <br/><br/>One of the fundamental ways mathematics arises in nature is through geometry and more generally topology.  In particular, geometric objects called manifolds are used to model space and time in general relativity.  Surprisingly, several features of manifolds can be studied via their underlying topology.  The discovery of the Jones polynomial by V. Jones in 1984 and its 3-dimensional quantum field theory interpretation by E. Witten in 1989 have opened the door for the use of new algebraic techniques to study topology.  These developments led to a new branch of mathematics known as ""quantum topology.""  This area has connections to theoretical physics, including quantum gravity, topological quantum field theory and quantum computing.  Many established techniques in quantum topology become zero when quantum dimensions vanish.  This project focuses on developing and studying new systematic strategies to re-normalize topological invariants when quantum dimensions are zero."

Stratified spaces are usually not quite manifolds - they may possess singularities - but they are composed of manifold strata. Examples, including algebraic and analytic varieties and quotients of manifolds by certain group actions, occur naturally in numerous fields of pure mathematics and in interactions with other sciences. Intersection homology is a modification of ordinary homology theory for which a form of Poincare duality holds for stratified spaces. Consequently, such spaces admit intersection homology analogues of historically important manifold invariants, such as signatures and characteristic classes, and raise interesting questions regarding their broader context and applications.  The PI proposes several lines of research in this area.  This includes work with James McClure (Purdue) to apply methods of modern algebraic topology to research on the algebraic structures of intersection (co)chain complexes, on an intersection homology version of rational homotopy theory, and on homotopy theory of stratified spaces; work with Eugenie Hunsicker (Loughborough) on topological aspects of signature invariants with motivations from geometric analysis; work with Dev Sinha (University of Oregon) to study concrete aspects of the E-infinity algebra of cochains on manifolds via linking forms; and the writing of an introductory textbook on intersection homology.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, topology is the study of spatial configuration, both in the physical universe and of abstract spaces that can model real-life phenomena. For example, a topologist might study how a physical string or protein strand is knotted in the real three-dimensional world, or he or she might study the abstract space of positions that a machine could inhabit, allowing for an arbitrary number of parameters that describe the positions of various components. The principal investigator's line of research concerns ""stratified spaces"" that simultaneously exhibit phenomena in a multitude of dimensions; for example, a machine's motions might exhibit different numbers of degrees of freedom depending upon its current position. While these research projects tend to be purely theoretical, theoretical results percolate over time into applications; topology, in particular, is currently experiencing a renaissance of applications to real-world problems. In particular, recent applications of the topology of stratified spaces have occurred in such applied fields as robot motion planning, topological data analysis, and statistical biology, as well as in other theoretical fields, such as string theory physics."

First, she will relate hyperbolic geometry to quantum invariants, in particular continuing her recent work to find connections between hyperbolic geometry and the colored Jones polynomial.

One way to study 3-manifolds is to drill out tubes around circles from a 3-dimensional sphere, and then reattach the tubes in a different manner.  The space of drilled tubes about circles is called a link complement, or knot complement if there is just one circle.  In this way, knot and link complements are building blocks for 3-manifolds.  The investigator will study the geometry of knot and link complements, with the hope of finding new results on the properties of broader classes of 3-manifolds.

Geometric group theory is most often focused on quasi-isometry invariants: measurements that are insensitive to bounded (additive and multiplicative) distortion of distances. This allows us to pass between the study of groups and the spaces they act on geometrically, and between different Cayley graphs for finitely generated groups. A unifying theme for the research projects described here is the pursuit of ""finer"" approaches to asymptotic geometry through the use of more sensitive measurements.  In particular, the PI proposes to study large-scale geometric statistics that are not invariant under quasi-isometry.  This point of view facilitates the study of randomness and asymptotic density in groups, and of properties of ""typical"" geodesics in spaces.<br/><br/>The ideas in play here have already led the PI and her collaborators to new density results in free abelian groups and the Heisenberg group; new invariants used to further the classification program for right-angled Artin groups; and progress in the study of Teichmueller geometry.   Statistical geometry is broadly applicable in a range of settings outside pure mathematics, from computer science to medicine---wherever geometric models are made and long-term probabilistic prediction is required.  In addition to the research program, this proposal describes a collection of educational projects:  principally, the development of an organizational infrastructure for Research Labs engaging faculty and students from a wide variety of institutions.  Each lab will work on a cluster of problems around a coherent mathematical nucleus, with opportunities for mutli-level teaching, learning, exploration, and collaboration.  There will be conferences and journal issues coordinated with these Labs, guided by the principles of combining expository soundness with research value and emphasizing collaboration."

Cohomology theories provide useful invariants for topological spaces, and their classification by the spectra provides a unified picture, indicating how numerous they are. Nevertheless, our understanding of cohomology theories, along with their equivariant, differential, and other mixed variants, remains limited. This is partly due to the fact that aside from a few examples, such as ordinary cohomology and K-theory, there are no good geometric descriptions of the cohomology classes of a given theory with immediate ties to naturally occurring objects in geometry. Even in the case of K-theory and its variants, our current understanding leaves many questions unanswered. Geometrically representing classes of a theory has proven to be useful in many regards, including the construction of non-homotopy invariant refinements, like differential theories, their equivariant versions, and pushforwards (cocycle level index theorems). In this proposal, the PI studies several ways of obtaining geometric models for K-theories (equivariant, differential, and their mixes) as well as refinements that take into account the Wilson line effects by using the Bismut Chern character. In one component of the research, the PI studies differential K-theory using representatives of the Atiyah class in the Toledo-Tong twisted resolution. In another, the PI aims to use his work with his collaborators, on the equivariant holonomy for abelian gerbes, to study topological invariants of non-abelian grebes. The main tool for this part is the equivariant topological chiral homology. This research has graduate student components.<br/><br/>Cohomology theories, their variants, and refinements are part of a branch of mathematics called topology. Cohomological invariants can measure a wide variety of phenomena, from wrappings of a piece of rope around a pole, to the possibilities for the shape of the universe. Cohomological techniques and descriptions have taken a central role in modeling high energy physics phenomena to the extent that several fundamental concepts were originally discovered by physicist and mathematicians independently. Comparison and cross-fertilization between the two fields has resulted in an accelerated enrichment of both, a trend that continues to pick up momentum increasingly. A modern categorical point of view now serves as a common language for mathematicians and physicists to explore cohomological ideas and their byproducts. Several components of the grant engage undergraduate and graduate students."

Specifically, there will be two valuable instances of such dualizing modules. One will be studied in joint work with Tomer Schlank; it will give a homotopical extension of the arithmetic duality theorems of Tate-Poitou, which state that the cohomology of certain absolute Galois groups has a twisted form of self-duality. The PI and Tomer Schlank will also investigate applications of such duality results to problems of existence of rational points on algebraic varieties. A different example is related to the spectra of topological modular forms with or without level structures. Previous work of the PI suggests that the spectrally derived moduli stack of generalized elliptic curves has a simply describable dualizing sheaf of commutative ring spectra; an objective of the proposed project is to prove that result. Topological modular forms are crucial for understanding v2 periodic homotopy in the sphere spectrum; though somewhat removed from the theme of duality, the PI will collaborate with Mark Behrens, Kyle Ormsby, and Nathaniel Stapleton to compute the cooperations in the homology based on connective topological modular forms. <br/><br/><br/>Duality is a pervasive concept in mathematics; the proposed project will study different types of duality in a unified framework, thereby arriving at novel and otherwise inaccessible information. In particular, the project is motivated by the idea that introducing a homotopical viewpoint can shed new light on our understanding of geometry and arithmetic. One of the objects with such curious self-duality properties, namely topological modular forms, lends itself to vast applications, some already explored and others not, as it mirrors itself in homotopy, algebraic geometry, number theory, and even quantum field theory as the receptacle of the Witten genus."

In earlier works of the principal investigator and his collaborators it was shown that bounds for the hyperbolic volume of certain classes of knots can be read off from coefficients of the colored Jones polynomial. This made it interesting to study the leading and trailing coefficients of the colored Jones polynomial.

In addition, he will extend recent advances in  Legendrian knot theory to not only better understand the structure of such knots but also to classify contact structures on some families of three manifolds including some of the much studied and notoriously difficult small Seifert fibered spaces. In higher dimensions even the existence of contact structures is not completely understood. Recent progress in higher dimensional contact geometry makes the time ripe for an intense investigation of these structures. Namely, a few years ago Niederkrueger introduced the notion of a plastikstufe in hopes of finding an analog of the famed three dimensional tight vs. overtwisted dichotomy in all dimensions (other proposed notions, such as bLobs, have even more recently surfaced) and most recently the Principal Investigator has completely answered the existence question for contact structures on five manifolds (as has another team of researchers). Part of the project  will involve addressing the existence of contact structures on all odd dimensional manifolds as well as investigating notions of overtwistedness in higher dimensions.

The Principal Investigator will illuminate the connection between contact geometry and Riemannian geometry and the topology of manifolds. He will also explore basic and fundamental questions concerning the existence and uniqueness of contact structures and their submanifolds in high dimensions.

Through this proposal, the PI will expand on recent collaborations and look at the connections between isometric Hilbert space actions and actions on median spaces via the tool of low dimensional cohomology.<br/><br/>Newton affirmed that the universe ""looks the same in every direction.""

These geometries can only be understood in the large scale since Einstein's theory of general relativity asserts that masses locally distort the space-time fabric. Understanding the study of large scale geometry and symmetry was revolutionized by Gromov's approach to group theory. A group is the collection of symmetries of an object. The PI's research is concerned with CAT(0) geometry, a mix between Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries. More specifically, she studies rigidity, which can be thought to address the questions: 1) Can a group be represented as a collection of symmetries of a certain geometric object? 2) If so, is such a representation unique? The study of rigidity is important in its own right as a mathematical phenomenon. Nevertheless, it could one day lead to a better understanding of our universe."

The aim of the first part of the project is to gain a better understanding of the smooth knot concordance group C, by studying a new filtration of the subgroup of topologically slice knots called the bipolar filtration, defining a primary decomposition for the n-solvable quotients, and viewing C as a metric space and studying operators acting on it.  Questions about the knot concordance group are closely related to questions about smooth 4-manifolds and thus will provide insight into the mysterious and exciting world of 4-manifolds.  In the second project, the PI proposes to establish a higher-order Heegaard Floer homology theory that categorifies the higher-order and twisted Alexander polynomials.   The PI will use this theory to define new concordance invariants generalizing the Heegaard Floer tau invariant. In the third project, the PI will investigate the study Legendrian spatial graphs and spatial graph concordance via the recent Graph Floer homology invariant of spatial graph defined by the PI and coauthor. <br/><br/>Knot theory is the study of knotted circles or strings in 3-dimensional space.  Knots have been studied for over a century, ever since Lord Kelvin (incorrectly) hypothesized that atoms were made of knotted tubes of ether.  However, we are still far from a complete classification of them or how they are related to one another.   This project will give a better understanding of knots and how they interact in 3- and 4-dimensions.   Since the world we live in is 3-dimensional (or 4-dimensional if one considers time), knots and links play a special role in many real life applications.  For example, the Jones polynomial of a knot is related to the Pott's model in statistical mechanics.  In addition, knot theory plays an role in the study of DNA and cancer research.  One can view circular DNA as a knot and certain enzymes, called topoisomerases, manipulate DNA; this manipulation can be viewed as certain simple moves on knots."

The overall goal is to understand the universal structure possessed by the Goodwillie derivatives of a functor, from which the Taylor tower of the functor can be reconstructed. The PI and Greg Arone have proved the existence of such a structure in the form of a coalgebra over a certain comonad. In the case of spectrum-valued functors, there is a close relationship between this comonad and those associated to right modules over various operads, including the little disc operads. We now study the corresponding comonads for space-valued functors, as well as for derivatives at arbitrary base objects. We also apply our previous theory to calculations such as the Taylor tower of algebraic K-theory. The Koszul duality of operads of spectra plays a key role in this theory, and we study this duality in its own right, building on previous work of the PI and John E. Harper. The main goal here is to get an equivalence between the categories of algebras over one operad and of divided power coalgebras over the Koszul dual operad.<br/><br/>Topology is the study of properties of shapes and spaces in any number of dimensions. One particular goal is to develop ways to measure aspects of these spaces that are usually considered qualitative. For example, a basic problem is to give a precise description of the difference between the shapes formed by the surface of the Earth (a sphere), and the surface of a bagel (a torus). The difference is intuitively clear - the bagel has a hole - but giving a precise definition of what we mean by a 'hole' in a shape allows us to make calculations in higher dimensions, where intuition is less reliable. Some of these calculations (the so-called 'homotopy groups of spheres') turn out to be extremely complicated and have been studied extensively. This project is concerned with systematic approximations to these calculations that are analogous to the Taylor series of undergraduate calculus. Our central goal is to understand how more complex calculations can be built, in a natural way, from simpler pieces. A good understanding of the pieces should then provide us with better tools for making the hard computations. The foundational nature of our approach lends itself to applications in a range of areas of mathematics, including homological algebra and representation theory, in addition to topology."

The programs will actively engage the participants, and alternate between larger and smaller scale.  In the larger week-long programs, aiming for between 50 and 100 participants, a large organizing committee will plan lectures which some participants will prepare and then present.  There will only be about 15 lectures for the week, leaving time for participants to work on problems formulated by the organizing committee, to ask questions of each other (especially the presenters) and the organizers, to read supporting materials and go over their own notes, to talk informally with each other about their work related to the program, etc.  The smaller three-day programs will be primarily organized by graduate students from institutions providing both in-kind and additional financial support, namely Stanford University, the University of Oregon, the University of Washington, and the University of British Columbia.  In September 6-8, 2013 at the University of Oregon the program will be on Infinity Categories, a topic which has recently become a key technical piece of some of the most significant recent breakthroughs in algebraic topology and its applications to algebraic geometry and geometric topology.  With the upcoming yearlong program at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, the student organizers have chosen to learn about arguably the most important new machinery developed in the subject in recent years.  In July 2014, the week-long program at the University of British Columbia (with significant additional financial and in-kind support from the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences), the program will be on Topological Field Theories.  Development of these theories requires interplay both between the mathematics and physics communities, and within mathematics between algebraic topologists, geometric topologists, differential geometers, and representation theorists among others.  A program designed to address the different aspects of the theory while being coherent will aid a generation of researchers in interfacing with a remarkably fruitful subfield.  The topics in 2015 and 2016 will continue to be chosen based on their importance and timeliness and connections with other fields.  The 2016 program will likely focus on Chromatic Homotopy Theory, while determining the topic for the 2015 program will involve the participants. At all of these programs, we will have additional opportunities for professional learning addressing needs for early-career mathematicians to develop as teachers and to position themselves for career growth.<br/><br/>Knowledge of topology is essential for example in studying the structure of the early universe, in designing a robot arm with a minimal number of controllers, and in new kinds of data analysis.  In its role as a basic study of shape, algebraic topology has significant ramifications in other areas of mathematics, from basic counting problems (combinatorics) to solutions of equations (algebra) to applications and extensions of the calculus (analysis).  The West Coast Algebraic Topology Summer School chooses topics with such connections in mind.  Early career mathematicians have a great need for research-level professional learning, which can open up new research pathways, and for enlarging their professional networks, which can open up new collaborations.  Without such early-career opportunities, research programs can narrow or stall out altogether.  These needs can be more prominent for early career mathematicians in the western half of the United States, which is more geographically isolated than other regions, and for mathematicians from under-represented groups, who are actively recruited to be participants.  These summer schools build on a series of successful programs which have exceeded expectations in both the depth of learning and the strength of professional relationships fostered.  Many participants have reported them to be transformative experiences, and we expect those kinds of experiences to continue in our series from 2013-2016.  The active learning aspects of these experiences inform not only the research programs of participants but their approach to pedagogy as well.  Thus the program's impact goes beyond mathematical and scientific research to postsecondary and even K-12 education."

The project also involves studying objects central to the  geometric group theory, like automorphism groups of free groups.

Margulis gave the first explicit construction of expanders, following Pinsker's observation that random sparse graphs are expanders. This construction was improved in the eighties by  Margulis, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak who constructed Ramanujan graphs (optimal expanders) using deep number-theoretic results. In the ensuing years the scope and depth of applications of expanders has increased -- over the past decade several completely new and unexpected lines of development have emerged and the field has undergone explosive growth. The principal investigator plans to pursue projects centered on expanders and involving mutually beneficial interactions between arithmetic, group theory and combinatorics."

One goal is to better understand the knot concordance group, in particular the difference between the smooth and topological categories. Concordance invariants coming from Floer homology, such as d-invariants and epsilon, are well-suited for this task. Specifically, the principal investigator aims to show that the subgroup of the smooth concordance group generated by topologically slice knots contains an infinite rank summand. A different approach to concordance is via bordered Floer homology. In the same sense that knot Floer homology categorifies the Alexander polynomial, one may hope that the bordered Floer homology of a Seifert surface categorifies the Seifert form. Many classical concordance invariants can be defined in terms of the Seifert form, and the project will investigate how these invariants manifest themselves within the bordered invariants.<br/><br/>The structure of knotted curves in space is intimately related to our understanding of the shape of 3- and 4-dimensional space. Thinking of time as the fourth dimension, the study of knot concordance becomes a question about the evolution of knots over time. By putting different restrictions on how knots may evolve, one obtains different definitions of the complexity of a knot. These measures of complexity have applications from the very small (e.g., the behavior of knotted strands of DNA) to the very large (e.g., the shape of the universe)."

Three projects aim to use topological methods to understand the Brauer group, Azumaya algebras, and more generally torsors on schemes. (1) The PI will study the extent to which the foundational results of Jackowski, McClure, and Oliver on maps between classifying spaces of complex algebraic groups can be extended to finite approximations to these classifying spaces. Progress on this problem will enable the solution of a host of problems about when torsors for complex algebraic groups extend from the generic point of a scheme to the entire scheme. In low dimensions, early progress on this problem has been used by the PI and Ben Williams to settle an old question of Auslander and Goldman on the existence of Azumaya maximal orders in unramified division algebras, where it transpires that there are purely topological obstructions to the existence of these Azumaya maximal orders. (2) The PI will work toward computing the Chow groups and singular cohomology of the classifying spaces of special linear groups by various central subgroups. This has been done in special cases by Vezzosi and Vistoli. However, greater generality is needed for most applications. These Chow groups are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry, controlling the characteristic classes associated to certain torsors of fundamental importance in the study of the Brauer group. The computations will be directly useful to the first project, and to the following project. (3) The PI and Ben Williams previously formulated the topological period-index problem and established first results. They will continue this study, especially as it relates to the algebraic period-index conjecture. In particular, their results in low dimensions suggest a method for disproving the period-index conjecture, which would be a fundamental advance. Following this idea to its conclusion is the major aspiration of the first set of projects. A fourth project aims to continue to build a bridge between higher category theory and classical algebraic geometry, bringing the formidable techniques of the former to bear on various questions in the arithmetic of derived categories. For example, the PI is developing a toolbox using higher category theory that will allow a purely derived-category proof of Panin's computations of the K-theory of projective homogeneous spaces, once the existence of certain exceptional objects on the split forms of these spaces is known.<br/><br/>The PI proposes work in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, two areas of modern mathematics. Algebraic geometry is an ancient subject with many connections to real-world problems. Its goal is to understand the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, equations of central importance in various disciplines, such as theoretical physics, cryptography, and the modeling of dynamical systems like weather. Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to the analysis of large data sets that occur in computer vision and cancer research, frequently finding patterns that more traditional methods of data analysis fail to find. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several questions in algebraic geometry which have been identified by the community as among the most important."

The focus is on understanding the effect of singularities on the geometry and topology of complex algebraic varieties. The first project deals with a detailed study of global analytical invariants (e.g., characteristic numbers and classes) of local complete intersections which measure the complexity of singularities. The PI also proposes a characteristic class version of Steenbrink's notion of Hodge spectrum for hypersurface singularities. The second project studies topological and analytical properties of Hilbert schemes of points on a quasi-projective algebraic manifold. These are moduli spaces describing collections of (not necessarily distinct) points on a given space, which bring out seemingly hidden aspects of the geometry and topology of the space under consideration. These moduli spaces, originally studied in algebraic geometry, are closely related to several branches of mathematics, such as singularities, symplectic geometry, representation theory and even theoretical physics. The PI aims to obtain a generating series formula for characteristic classes of these (very singular) moduli spaces. The third project deals with a study of characteristic classes of toric varieties, with applications to generalized Pick-type formulae and Euler-MacLaurin summation formulae. Toric varieties are of interest both in their own right as complex algebraic varieties, and for their applications to the theory of convex polytopes. For instance, the problem of counting lattice points in a convex polytope amounts to the computation of Todd classes of a certain toric variety. Characteristic class formulae for toric varieties often translate into surprising number-theoretic identities (e.g., expressed in terms of generalized Dedekind sums), which the PI aims to investigate in detail.<br/><br/>Topology is the branch of mathematics that studies patterns of geometric figures involving position and relative position without regard to size. From the very beginning, topology has developed under the influence of questions arising from the attempt to understand properties of ""singular"" (or irregular) spaces. Such spaces occur naturally in various fields of pure mathematics including geometric topology, algebraic geometry, number theory, and also in more applied fields, such as the study of configuration spaces for robot motion planning. Algebraic varieties, i.e., the spaces of solutions of polynomial equations, are major examples of singular spaces. They are the main objects of study in algebraic geometry, and also provide a convenient testing ground for topological theories. The proposed research aims to improve our understanding of topological properties of algebraic varieties, a task which often involves the discovery and study of subtle interactions between the local and global behavior of various invariants."

The goal is to extend further the analogy between the two situations, specifically to show that the associated harmonic measures on the boundaries of these spaces share similar properties. Other projects include the study of dynamical aspects of non-classical interval exchanges and continuation of the study of translation lengths of pseudo-Anosov maps on the curve complex. The relationship between dilatations and curve complex translation lengths along a fibered face for the Thurston norm on the second homology of a fibered hyperbolic 3-manifold will also be explored.<br/><br/>The theory of surfaces such as the surface of the ball or the donut, is of fundamental interest across many fields of mathematics. Teichmuller theory is the study of the possible shapes a surface can assume. The proposal focuses on these shapes and their interactions with certain transformations of the surface called mapping classes. The main goal is to explain how the shape evolves under random transformations. Other projects include understanding the complexity of the transformations. One measure of complexity is the complexity of curves obtained on the surface by repeating a transformation. The problems outlined in the proposal are important in varied fields like geometry, topology and dynamical systems. It is hoped that the proposal will initiate fruitful collaborations and offer mentoring opportunities at several levels from postdoctoral fellows to undergraduate students."

In particular, the conference will concentrate on the interaction between hyperbolic geometry and quantum topology. In the last two decades, both of these areas have seen significant progress.  In hyperbolic geometry, several longstanding conjectures concerning the geometric structure of 3-manifolds and their covers have been proved.  On the quantum side, families of TQFTs have been constructed and shown to be related to quantum invariants such as the Jones polynomial.  There is increasing evidence that many quantum invariants have connections to hyperbolic geometry, and there are several open conjectures in these directions, including the Volume Conjecture and its variants.

First, it will stimulate dialogue among an international group of mathematicians, by bringing together leading experts from the US and other countries to discuss cutting edge research.  Second, it will promote an exchange of ideas and collaboration among hyperbolic geometers and quantum topologists, leading to further integration of these two fields.  Finally, it will expose graduate students and early career mathematicians to the important developments in these areas.  Both junior and senior mathematicians will be given an opportunity to learn of new research and present their results to a broad audience.

In addition to plenary talks connected to these research areas, and usually to more than one area, there will be two workshops:  (1) Coarse Topology, with an emphasis on connections to geometric group theory, dimension theory, and geometric topology, and (2) Homogeneous Compact Spaces, one of the most important classes of spaces, for instance, containing the class of compact topological groups.  Each workshop will consist of a series of lectures intended to enable participants to begin research in these areas.  Although the workshops will be tied to General Topology and Geometric Topology, each will focus on new theory and techniques, will have broad appeal to attendees in other sessions, and will feature connections to areas both inside and outside topology. The conference proceedings will be published in the fully refereed journal Topology Proceedings (http://topology.auburn.edu/tp/).<br/><br/><br/>There are two major conference series on Topology in North America: the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference and the Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications.  The summer conference brings together mathematicians who have research interests in general topology, set-theoretic topology, topological algebras, topological groups, functional analysis, geometric topology, topological dynamics, and continuum theory as well as applied areas such as  computer science and computational topology/geometry, and other areas where topology has  applications and connections.  The scheduled workshops, one on Coarse Topology and the other on Homogeneous Compact Spaces, will acquaint younger researchers, including recent PhDs and graduate students, with active research areas in topology and its applications.  Major speakers with international reputations have been selected who are active in these research areas and others.  Students and junior researchers, whose focus has necessarily often been narrow, will be exposed to research techniques and results that draw from multiple sources.  NSF support will enable at least 12 US-based students and junior researchers to attend the conference and expand their research horizons.    <br/>http://topology.nipissingu.ca/summertop2013/<br/>http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/13-14/topology/index.html"

Among the projects proposed is the study of the stable sympelctic category. This category is the stabilization of A. Weinstein's symplectic category (which is a domain category for geometric quantization). We achieve stabilization by inverting the symplectic manifold given by the complex plane. The resulting stable category is extremely tractable, and retains a lot of structure (like an action of the Grothendieck-Teichmuller group that was conjectured by Kontsevich). Another project proposed is the continuing study of real Johnson-Wilson theories, with collaborator W.S.Wilson. This is a computationally accessible theory that contains higher-level information which can be used to solve several geometric problems like the non-immersion problem. Among other projects proposed include the study of the homotopical and representation theoretic properties of Kac-Moody groups. These groups are of interest in mathematical physics and topology. <br/><br/>The major thrust of the above proposal is to construct and apply (homotopical) techniques and methods designed to better understand hard geometric questions that may be of interest to a wide variety of mathematicians and mathematical-physicists. One such technique is called stabilization, which suitably linearizes a possibly intractable  question, thereby making it accessible. The process often allows us to gain a lot of insight into the original problem. Another technique studied is the study via classifying spaces. The classifying space is a construction that takes the set of symmetries of a geometric object, and encodes them into a space that can then be studied in standard ways to recover information about the original geometric object."

Further, in collaboration with the co-PI, the investigator will undertake a study of certain algebraic structures arising from quantum field theory and topological strings. The research contains two major perspectives. The first aim is to develop the mathematical foundations of the quantum geometry of the B-twisted topological string on a Calabi-Yau geometry; a complete description will include open-closed string field theory and the Landau-Ginzburg B-model. Secondly, the PI and co-PI will analyze the perturbative quantization of two dimensional sigma models and develop various algebraic index theories for higher differential operators via a rigorous observable theory. <br/>            <br/>The blossoming of quantum field theory and string theory has provided a great driving force in the creation of new areas in mathematics. The proposed project explores examples arising from quantum field theory relevant to geometry and topology in a mathematically rigorous setting. The aim is to develop new mathematical tools and reveal the geometry of quantum phenomenon by anchoring physical intuition and arguments in the harbor of mathematics. The implications of the proposed projects live both in an array of mathematical fields (differential geometry, algebraic geometry, topology) and theoretical physics."

It is a growing discipline which has some analogy with the classical dimension theory which is a part of topology, a science of small scales. Many invariants of the large scale dimension theory such as the asymptotic dimension and the macroscopic dimension proved to be useful in studying finitely generated groups and open Riemannian manifolds. Thus, the large scale dimension appears in different areas of mathematics such as topology of manifolds, group theory, differential geometry. One of the main goals of this project is to prove the Gromov Conjecture about manifolds with positive scalar curvature. Another application of this project is a further development of a dimension theoretic approach to the Novikov Higher Signature Conjecture.<br/><br/>The classical topology has a century long history and it is substantially developed in all directions. It became a fundamental core part of mathematics. Despite on abstractness it has many profound applications to virtually all sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Economics, etc.). The large scale version of topology and in particular the large scale analogue of dimension theory has a potential to grow in a discipline of similar weight and to bring numerous application beyond the scope of Mathematics. Thus the ideas of coarse geometry are already used in the large data mining. Clearly, a quantitative  processing of overwhelming flaws of data of different kind will be more and more on demand in all activities of the mankind. Another area of application of dimension theory which is addressed in this project is studying the complexity of robot motion planning algorithms."

Together with J. Fasel, he will, for example, attempt to study splitting problems for projective modules of rank below the dimension by better understanding A^1-homotopy sheaves of punctured affine spaces.  Together with C. Haesemeyer, he will attempt to produce computable new obstructions to existence of a rational point on smooth algebraic varieties over a field, again using A^1-homotopy theory.  By their very nature, these problems draw together several branches of mathematics and thus illustrate the fundamental unity of the subject.  To make the techniques used in the above study and related areas accessible to a new generation of researchers, the PI will organize a series of summer schools devoted to introducing graduate students to A^1-homotopy theory and related subjects. <br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, one of the oldest branches of mathematics, is at its core concerned with the study of algebraic varieties, i.e., solutions to systems of polynomial equations in many variables. Algebraic topology studies the problem of attaching invariants, e.g., numbers or, more generally, abstract algebraic structures, to spaces in a manner independent of the way they are pulled and twisted (without being torn).  Solutions to systems of polynomial equations are not obviously amenable to the tools of algebraic topology, especially when such systems arise from arithmetic. Nevertheless, the relatively recently introduced subject of A^1-homotopy theory provides a framework in which one may apply the full power of techniques of algebraic topology to objects of interest in algebraic geometry---one can treat spaces having deep arithmetic structure, but a priori limited geometric structure, on equal footing with spaces that are more inherently geometric.  This project aims to study two general classes of problems by transplanting a very successful method from algebraic topology (the theory of obstructions) to the setting of algebraic geometry by means of A^1-homotopy theory.  With the goal of making some ideas involved in the above pursuits accessible to a broader audience, the PI will collaborate with artist Lun-Yi Tsai to organize public ``dialogues"" between artists and mathematicians to explore some common themes between the subjects.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Topology programs."

The proposed research has three parts.  In the first, the investigator will use representation theory to study the stable cohomology of these groups and their subgroups.  A special focus will be on congruence subgroups and the Torelli group.  In the second part, the investigator will study vanishing conjectures for the high-dimensional unstable cohomology of these groups.  Finally, in the third part the investigator will study the topology and geometry of the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class group.  Foci of these projects include the structure of the Johnson filtration of the Torelli group and relationships with the Casson invariant of homology 3-spheres.<br/><br/>Groups are mathematical objects that encode symmetries.  The groups discussed in this proposal are related to the symmetries of two fundamental types of objects.  The mapping class group encodes the symmetries of two-dimensional surfaces like the surface of a donut or the earth.  Arithmetic groups encode symmetries of special kinds of structures that arise when studying natural numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3,...). For mysterious reasons, these groups share many fundamental properties. The investigator will study these shared properties with a focus on the ""cohomology"" of the groups, which in some sense is a measure of higher-dimensional ""holes"" that exist in them.  The investigator will also run a mathematical summer program for disadvantaged high-school students from the Houston public schools."

One research objective seeks to exploit an analogy between knot homology and categorified representation theory to produce new representation theoretic objects arising from odd Khovanov homology.  Another research direction seeks to use the powerful tool of categorical skew Howe duality to solve open problems in link homology theory for the special linear Lie algebra.  This work will have applications to Landau-Ginzburg models in theoretical physics via the Kapustin-Li formula.  The same diagrammatics used to encode the structure of categorified quantum groups will be used to transform current research into unique educational opportunities including an undergraduate research program at USC and innovative curriculum development of an undergraduate course on 'Diagrammatic Algebra'.  The PI will also tap into the existing infrastructure of USC's community involvement to recruit high school students for a mathematics based event using diagrammatic algebra as a tool for engaging high school students.<br/><br/>An emerging mathematical philosophy known as ""categorification"" has significantly altered our perception of mathematics and the way we analyze our surroundings.  Imagine if an architect studied a building by only examining its shadow.  In much the same way, the perspective of categorification uncovers a hidden layer in mathematical objects allowing mathematicians to see the entire structure rather than its shadow.  The PI's research uncovers these hidden structures in an area of mathematics known as representation theory which is closely connected to some of the most sophisticated models in theoretical physics.  Following the philosophy that fundamental structures in mathematics should be simple and intuitive the PI utilizes a diagrammatic framework to encode a great deal of complexity into an intuitive diagrammatic language that greatly simplifies computations.  The PI will incorporate this diagrammatic philosophy into transformative educational programs aimed at high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students making the tools of modern research accessible to a new generation of researchers.
