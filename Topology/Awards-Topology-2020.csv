The project will progress the study of braids (links that look like actual braids) that has numerous applications to Algebraic Geometry, Operator Algebras, Homotopy Theory, Robotics, Cryptography, Geometry and Topology. The fundamental issue the project seeks to address is using diagrams on the plane way to detect whether contact structures are tight or overtwisted. Some parts of the project will involve research by graduate students. The Kids Topology Club will engage young Iowans who have potential to contribute to the STEM research of the US. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Project goals are: (1) to develop a diagrammatic method to detect tightness or overtwistedness of a given contact 3-manifold, (2) to extend the idea of (1) to knot theory (detection of non-looseness or looseness of a transverse link), (3) to compare various positivities of knots and links from braid theory and contact geometry view points, and find their geometric meanings. Main methods used are the Bennequin-Eliashberg inequality, the Giroux correspondence, Birman and Menasco?s braid foliations, and Ito and Kawamuro?s open book foliations. To approach the goals, properties of twist-left-veering mapping classes and the defects of the 3- and 4-dimensional Bennequin-Eliashberg inequalities will be investigated. Scope of the project is (1) to study relation between twist-left-veering that Ito-Kawamuro introduce and inconsistency that Wand defined, (2) to continue investigating the depth of transverse knots via twist-left-veering, and (3) to study relation between the above-mentioned defects and Heegaard-Floer and Khovanov invariants. Potential contribution is to advance the study of (1) tight contact structures that is a central subject in contact geometry and has strong connection to symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry, and (2) quasipositive knots that are important in topology and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process and the deployment of data-centric technologies have recently brought unprecedented advances in many scientific fields, as well as increased global prosperity with the advent of knowledge-based economies and systems. At a high level, this revolution is driven by two thrusts: the modern technologies which allow for the collection of complex data sets, and the theories and algorithms we use to make sense of them. That said, and for all its benefits, extracting actionable knowledge from data is difficult. Observations gathered in uncontrolled environments are often high-dimensional, complex and noisy; and even when controlled experiments are used, the intricate systems that underlie them --- like those from meteorology, chemistry, medicine and biology --- can yield data sets with highly nontrivial underlying topology. This refers to properties such as the number of disconnected pieces (i.e., clusters), the existence of holes or the orientability of the data space. The research funded through this CAREER award will leverage ideas from algebraic topology to address data science questions like visualization and representation of complex data sets, as well as the challenges posed by nontrivial topology when designing learning systems for prediction and classification. This work will be integrated into the educational program of the PI through the creation of an online TDA (Topological Data Analysis) academy, with the dual purpose of lowering the barrier of entry into the field for data scientists and academics, as well as increasing the representation of underserved communities in the field of computational mathematics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Understanding the set of maps between topological spaces has led to rich and sophisticated mathematics, for it subsumes algebraic invariants like homotopy groups and generalized (co)homology theories. And while several data science questions are discrete versions of mapping space problems --- including nonlinear dimensionality reduction and supervised learning --- the corresponding theoretical and algorithm treatment is currently lacking. This CAREER award will contribute towards remedying this situation. The research program articulated here seeks to launch a novel research program addressing the theory and algorithms of how the underlying topology of a data set can be leveraged for data modeling (e.g., in dimensionality reduction) as well as when learning maps between complex data spaces (e.g., in supervised learning). This work will yield methodologies for the computation of topology-aware and robust multiscale coordinatizations for data via classifying spaces, a computational theory of topological obstructions to the robust extension of maps between data sets, as well as the introduction of modern deep learning paradigms in order to learn maps between non-Euclidean data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dowdall<br/><br/>This project concerns two foundational branches of mathematics: group theory, and low-dimensional topology/geometry. A group is an algebraic framework that encodes symmetries of objects, such as the rigid motions of space, the configurations of a Rubik's cube, or the symmetries of a molecule.  Low-dimensional topology and geometry concern the structure of space itself, like the surface of the earth or the universe we live in, together with inherent geometric features like curvature, distance, and volume. One way in which these topics are linked is through the concept of a parameter space (such as the geometric structures supported on a given object, or the configurations of points in that object) and its symmetry group. This project will focus on two important classes of examples in these contexts: group extensions, which are ways of building new groups out of old, and mapping class groups of surfaces, which are the symmetry groups for parameter spaces of hyperbolic structures on a surface. The purpose of the project is to identify and study key structural features, particularly rigid features that are invariant under perturbation or reparametrization, as well as general features that emerge from random constructions. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project will investigate geometric and dynamical aspects of free group and surface automorphisms and explore how these interact with associated group extensions and moduli spaces of geometric structures. Firstly, the project will study cyclic extensions of surface groups and free groups. This entails the use of veering triangulations to study low-dilatation pseudo-Anosov surface homeomorphims, and the development of a parallel theory of veering triangulations for free-by-cyclic groups that will illuminate features of free group automorphisms. The project will also introduce a new universal attracting tree for free-by-cyclic groups that will be used to encode important algebraic and dynamical invariants. Secondly, the project will study hyperbolicity for extensions of free groups and surface groups. Building on past results, the PI will characterize when free group extensions are hyperbolic, and will study algebraic features of randomly constructed free group extensions. By means of analogy with Kleinian groups, the project will also develop a new theory of geometrically finite subgroups of mapping class groups and connect this to the budding theory of hierarchical hyperbolicity. Thirdly, the project will investigate the moduli space of hyperbolic structures on a surface by quantifying the prevalence of certain types of elements of the mapping class group and by studying shrinking target properties of the geodesic and horocycle flow. Finally, in a view towards more general surfaces, the project will explore aspects of algebraic rigidity in mapping class groups of infinite-type surface and dynamical rigidity for length spectra of billiard-style dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop will address the latest advances in the field of mathematics known as the real enumerative geometry, with senior and junior researchers of different expertise reporting on topics of common interests. The main goal of the meeting is to facilitate discussions and collaborations in a focused setting. The small size of the workshop provides an ideal environment for graduate students and early career researchers to interact with experts in the field. A diverse group of researchers will report on new advances in the field, assuring that a vast amount of techniques are shared among its participants. The intensive and substantial exchange of a broad spectrum of ideas during the workshop is expected to stimulate further research with the aim of pushing the boundaries of this field.<br/> <br/>Real enumerative geometry is an area of research with a long history, which has been rapidly evolving in the recent years. The main impetus in present-day developments comes from ideas of J.-Y. Welschinger, who proposed a signed counting in the enumerative geometry of curves defined over the field of real numbers. These ideas were used to answer many long-standing questions in the enumerative geometry of real algebraic varieties through their implementation in the symplectic, tropical or algebraic geometry framework. Very recently, these ideas were adapted in the A1-homotopy theory in an attempt to answer questions in enumerative geometry over arbitrary fields. The workshop is expected to lift the barriers between the seemingly unrelated fields of real enumerative geometry and A1-homotopy theory and build bridges between these fields. Classical aspects of real enumerative geometry will be addressed by V. Kharlamov, tropical aspects by O. Viro, a symplectic geometry approach will be discussed by X. Chen and S. Tukachinsky, while recent results in A1-enumerative geometry will be presented by J. Kass, S. Pauli and I. Vogt.

The conference focuses on a confluence of areas in algebraic topology that are currently at the forefront of research: arithmetic topology, chromatic homotopy theory, applied topology, manifold topology, and geometric representation theory. Priority for funding will be given to graduate students and to junior researchers without other funding sources, and among those to members of underrepresented groups in mathematics. Algebraic topology is enjoying a growing diversity, which this conference will foster through the selection of speakers and participants. This conference is quite timely in light of the research growth in algebraic topology seen on the East Coast in recent years and the resulting growth of student groups in the subject. <br/> <br/>Modern algebraic topology is intimately tied to a host of fields. From Thom's thesis to the Madsen-Weiss theorem and beyond, stable homotopy theory has long played a crucial role in the study of manifolds. More recently, sophisticated techniques of equivariant stable homotopy theory were brought to bear in the solution of the Kervaire invariant problem concerning exotic smooth structures on spheres, opening new research directions and applications. On the other hand, homotopy theory is connected to algebraic geometry via motivic homotopy theory and applications such as those of abstract scissors congruence K-theory to the classical Grothendieck ring of varieties. Moreover, algebraic topology has seen notable recent application to the study of data in the emerging field of topological data analysis. One of the aims for this conference is to provide a sample of new directions in algebraic topology and interactions with other fields such as geometric topology, arithmetic geometry, and applied topology. The conference features nine 45-minute invited talks over two days. The scientific focus of the conference is decidedly forward-looking: the speakers are rising leaders in the field and include early career researchers; each speaker represents a distinct and vital aspect of the topology of the future.

In the past few decades, symplectic geometry has emerged as an exciting and fundamental area of mathematical research, due in part to close connections with many other parts of mathematics as well as physics. It has had especially striking recent applications to topology, the study of geometric shapes and spaces, and particularly the theory of knots, loops of string that are tied together at their ends. The Principal Investigator will apply ideas from symplectic geometry to construct and study invariants of knots as well as geometric spaces in three and higher dimensions. Preliminary past work suggests that these invariants provide a surprising and unexpected bridge between several modern areas of mathematics (symplectic geometry, algebraic geometry, and quantum knot theory) and physics (string theory, a model for the fundamental forces that shape the universe). This project will explore this bridge, with the goal of creating and strengthening new lines of two-way communication between mathematics and theoretical physics. As part of this project, the Principal Investigator will also promote the training of early-career researchers in mathematics, especially through research experiences in mathematics for undergraduate students. In addition the project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project supported by this award will focus on several related lines of research, all centered around holomorphic curves, which have become central to the modern study of symplectic geometry since work of Gromov in the 1980s. One direction builds on the construction of Fukaya categories, algebraic structures associated to symplectic manifolds that play a key role in Homological Mirror Symmetry. The present project will construct a version of the Fukaya category for contact manifolds, built out of knots in a contact manifold. A key motivation for studying this category for contact manifolds is that it can serve as a central repository for holomorphic-curve invariants of the contact manifold. In particular, it will be a key intermediary in a larger picture that brings together other categories, both geometric (infinitesimal Fukaya categories) and algebraic (microlocal sheaf categories). Another aspect of the project deals with a package of knot invariants called knot contact homology, which has been studied by the Principal Investigator in previous work. This project will investigate the connection between knot contact homology and certain other knot invariants such as HOMFLY-PT polynomials, using recent progress in topological string theory. Goals in this direction include developing a formula for colored HOMFLY-PT polynomials in terms of holomorphic curves and quantizing the augmentation variety, a knot invariant devised from knot contact homology, to produce a recurrence relation for these polynomials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The areas of the major advances are abstract: category theory is a framework for organizing different types of mathematical objects and admissible transformations between these types, while homotopy theory seeks to understand the coarse nature of shapes. The applications on the other hand include new results on the geometry and solutions of polynomial equations, important areas of research with concrete applications inside and outside of mathematics.  The present proposal will harness these advances in the areas of algebraic K-theory, which is a mysterious but powerful tool for counting mathematical objects, and arithmetic geometry, which is about the influence of geometry on the structure of solutions of polynomial equations with rational coordinates. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>The project's three main objectives are (1) to directly compare the motivic and syntomic approaches to p-adic etale K-theory by showing that if R is a smooth commutative p-local commutative ring, then the trace map from K-theory to topological cyclic homology respects the motivic and syntomic filtrations after p-completion, (2) to construct a theory of coefficient systems for p-adic cohomology using cyclotomic spectra and to verify the PI's liftability conjecture, which will help to explain the relationship between the window-frame approach to the classification of formal groups and the recent prismatic Dieudonne theory developed by Anschuetz and Le Bras, and (3) to understand the filtration on prismatic cohomology arising from the cyclotomic t-structure.

Performing integrated tasks with an image, such as shape generation, animation, editing, or partial matching, requires structure-aware shape processing. A full shape structure consists of a decomposition into parts, an understanding of which parts are more significant than others, and an ability to measure similarity of parts moving toward recognition. A pipeline that takes as input two- or three-dimensional images, performs accurate segmentation to determine shapes of interest, extracts a shape structure, then recognizes the parts and the shapes would represent a fundamental step forward in artificial vision. The task is challenging because human visual perception does not follow computational rules. For example, two shapes can both be similar to a third shape without being similar to each other. For another, our understanding of meaning of shapes adds a semantic level to our geometric perception: if someone is seated on an object, we classify that object as a chair regardless of its shape. Any useful shape analysis must explicitly model the interplay between semantics and geometric shape. This project aims to develop the foundational theory of shape structure and provide robust implementations of the resulting techniques while maintaining the connection to human semantic perception through benchmarking to user studies.<br/><br/>The Blum medial axis gives a skeletal decomposition of a closed region in Euclidean space. For spatial dimensions 2 and 3, these regions can be interpreted as 2D and 3D shapes, with the skeletal model providing a lower-dimensional representation of the shape. The skeleton, a Whitney stratified set, is a deformation retract of the shape boundary that captures complete geometric information about the boundary of the shape. This project will introduce functions on the medial axis that encode shape geometry in a way that allows for the determination of a parts decomposition and hierarchy within a shape, as well as similarity between parts, for shapes of any finite genus. Based on that analysis, the research will develop formal measures of shape complexity and benchmark results through human perception studies. Finally, the project aims to connect the new shape structure characterization to current approaches using neural networks for image understanding by developing network architectures that learn the geometry of a shape skeleton from its natural or binary image representation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While solutions in 1-variable functions exist for low degree polynomials (up to degree 5), no such formulas are known beyond this.  At the beginning of the 20th century, David Hilbert conjectured that for polynomials of degree more than 5, no 1-variable formulas exist (his specific conjecture for degree 7 is 13th on his famous list of mathematical problems).

One of the guiding principles behind geometric group theory, as developed by Klein and more recently Gromov, is that one can understand a geometric object by studying its symmetries. The primary goal of this project is to utilize techniques from geometric group theory as a bridge to simplify and solve problems in other fields of mathematics. The first part of this project focuses on algebraic varieties, which are geometric spaces defined by polynomial equations. Algebraic varieties arise naturally in a wide-range of disciplines, including high-energy physics and cryptography. Although these objects have been studied for centuries, many of their geometric properties still remain unknown, and cannot be uncovered using traditional means. The PI proposes novel geometric group theory methods to develop restrictions on properties of algebraic varieties. The second part of this project studies the symmetries of right-angled Artin groups, which have important connections to low-dimensional topology, as well as robotics, phylogenetic trees, and computer science. In addition, the PI will advise undergraduate mathematics majors and mentor graduate students through organizing seminars and other mathematical activities.<br/><br/>The study of mapping class groups and the moduli space of curves lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry, Riemannian geometry, and topology.  The first part of this project studies the topology of surface and torus bundles admitting some extra structure such as a Kaehler metric, or which are formal in the sense of rational homotopy theory.  The PI proposes techniques from geometric group theory and mapping class groups that can place restrictions on the fundamental group and monodromy of such bundles, but also connect questions about the geometry of complex projective surfaces to questions about mapping class groups. The second part of this project studies the automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs), which comprise a large class of groups extending both free and free abelian groups. There is a fruitful analogy between the study of mapping class groups of surfaces, outer automorphism groups of free groups, and lattices in semisimple Lie groups.

This means that, locally, one can move in three independent directions: left/right, forward/backward, and up/down.  However, the global nature of our three-dimensional space is not known.  For example, it is not known whether our universe extends infinitely far in every direction or if it curls back on itself.  To complicate things, it becomes more natural to view the space we inhabit as a four-dimensional space by including time.  The goal of low-dimensional topology is to study and classify three-dimensional and four-dimensional spaces.  One important aspect of this program is to understand the topology (or ""shape"") of the four-dimensional sphere, which is a four-dimensional analog the spherical surface of a solid ball.  Amazingly, despite over one hundred years of study, very little is known about the topology of the four-dimensional sphere.  In contrast, the analogous objects in dimensions greater than or less than four are much better understood.  The goal of this research project is to apply novel techniques and approaches better understand four-dimensional sphere.  This  work will help to inform and advance the general study of four-dimensional spaces, such as the spacetime expanse that we inhabit. The award provides funds to support research training for undergraduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Perhaps the most important open problem in low-dimensional topology, the Smooth Poincare Conjecture, ask whether any smooth four-manifold with the homotopy-type of the four-sphere is equivalent to the four-sphere. This problem has been open for more than 100 years, yet has seen almost no progress.  Rather than approach this problem directly, this research program aims to study the smooth topology from four distinct, but related, angles. One angle is to study four-manifolds with the homotopy-type of the four-sphere that admit simple handle-decompositions. Recently, the PI and Zupan gave new results in this setting, offering the first general progress towards the Poincare Conjecture in 30 years. The first aim of this research is to build on this work to obtain results that apply in even broader settings.  In another direction, the introduction of theory of trisections by Gay and Kirby in 2016, and the subsequent development and expansion, especially by the PI and Zupan, has ushered in a new era in four-manifold topology, with applications emerging to many interesting aspects of low-dimensional topology. This research project aims to advance and refine these theories, broaden their applicability, and bring to fruition many applications and connections. In particular, the PI will investigate what sort of trisections the four-sphere can admit. In the process, connections will be established with important open problems in low-dimensional topology, such as the Andrews-Curtis, Generalized Property R, and Slice-Ribbon Conjectures. The project will include an investigation of trisections of genus three, where the additivity of trisection genus will be explored in search for exotic copies of familiar four-manifolds.  Finally, the PI will employ the theory of bridge trisections to study knotted surfaces in the four-sphere. This theory was introduced by the PI and Zupan and offers a powerful new way to study knot theory in dimension four. In particular, the PI will work to give connections between the braid group and potentially exotic knotted spheres.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This conference is a 5-day research and professional development workshop for graduate students in the fields of geometric group theory, geometry, and topology.  Its primary goals are to a) expose graduate students to a wide range of current research in topology,  b) build their communication, networking, and problem-sharing skills, and c) give guidance on necessary but typically untaught aspects of the profession.   Approximately 50 graduate students will participate, guided by 10 mentors, who come from a wide range of career stages and represent a broad array of topics within geometry and topology including contact and symplectic topology, 3-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry, group actions, and complex dynamics. The conference provides the participants, especially those from underrepresented groups, with many tools that will help them to succeed as scientists at the highest levels, in graduate school and beyond.<br/><br/>For many of the students, the TSW is the first conference they attend and at which they present their own results. The workshop is designed to facilitate this experience (for instance, our first professional development session is an introduction to conferences and how best to benefit from them).  The goal is to build confidence and research potential among students, as well as to build community.  The skills addressed here are not typically taught in grad school and can be disproportionately beneficial to students from minority groups, as indicated from responses from participants in previous iterations of the program. The professional development and research sides of the workshop run in tandem, with mentors giving guidance in both areas.  The workshop includes structured sessions on networking and etiquette, the job application process, communication skills, and a panel discussion on career paths (which also involves mathematicians from organizations such as NSA, Amazon, Google, and private high schools).   Mentors also give research talks, both to model good communication and introduce their research areas (deliberately chosen broadly) and relevant problems to students who are embarking on a research career.   Effective communication is a major theme: two evening sessions are devoted to workshopping presentations in small groups; the final presentations are videotaped and critiqued by those in attendance.

In this field two objects are considered to be similar if one of them can be continuously deformed into the other. There are many examples which can be approached from the geometric point of view: famously, a mug can be continuously deformed into a donut. But we are only able to explicitly visualize objects which lie in spaces of small dimension, up to 3 dimensions. In order to study objects lying in spaces of larger dimension we need to approach the problem through the lens of algebra.  Algebraic topology assigns various algebraic invariants to geometric objects and shapes in such a way that similar objects will have the same invariant. Then, given two objects, we only need to compute their invariants in order to be able to distinguish them. Algebraic topology itself is a theoretical subject which develops new such invariants for understanding shapes, and studies their properties. But the tools of algebraic topology work equally well regardless of the dimension of the ambient space, or the size of the objects. Due to this, they have numerous applications in physics, since problems in quantum physics and relativity deal with objects in spaces of high dimension. These algebraic invariants can also be applied to problems in the analysis of large data. A large data set is an object in a space of very many dimensions, and since tools of algebraic topology are insensitive to dimension, they are well suited to exhibit useful properties of large data sets which might be difficult to see with classical statistical tools. Broader impacts under this award include seminar organization and events promoting the participation of women in mathematics.<br/><br/>These research projects concern chromatic homotopy theory, which is a framework for identifying and explaining periodic phenomena in stable homotopy groups of spheres. It introduces a filtration on the stable homotopy category, and proposes to study the problem one chromatic level and one prime at a time. Most of the current work in this field is focused on chromatic level 2, with prime 2 being the hardest case.  A collaborative project will compute the Picard group of the K(2)-local category at the prime 2 and use this information to find the dualizing object for the K(2)-local BrownComenetz duality.  Another project plans to use SpanierWhitehead duality in the K(2)-local category to prove a decomposition result for the K(2)-local sphere spectrum. An additional collaborative effort aims to compute the Picard groups of categories of modules over certain ring spectra in chromatic homotopy theory, computing the homotopy groups of K(2)-local spectra of interest and studying the transchromatic phenomena in GrossHopkins duality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low-dimensional topology has a wide range of real-world applications, including deep connections to theoretical physics and quantum computing.  In addition, topology has applications to data science; researchers understand how to interpret a large data set as a topological space in order to gain insights by studying the topological shape of that data.  While our world is 3-dimensional in nature, the evolution of a 3-dimensional object over a period of time gives rise to a 4-dimensional space, in which time constitutes a fourth degree of freedom.  Topology in dimension three has seen an explosion of activity over the last several decades, reaching a peak with Grigory Perelman's proof of the Poincar conjecture in 2003, the only resolved problem of the seven Millennium Problems posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute. In contrast, the topology of 4-dimensional manifolds has become an increasingly active area of research, with many fundamental problems still open.  This research project involves adapting ideas from dimension three to discover novel approaches to these 4-dimensional problems. The award provides funds to support research by graduate students. The award will also support the Great Plains Alliance, a program initiated by the PI to connect graduate students with speaking opportunities at nearby institutions.<br/><br/>Two foundational open problems in 4-manifold topology are the smooth 4-dimensional Poincar Conjecture, which asserts that every closed 4-manifold homotopy equivalent to the standard 4-sphere is diffeomorphic to the standard 4-sphere, and the slice-ribbon conjecture, which posits that any knot bounding an embedded disk in the 4-ball also bounds an immersed ribbon disk in the 3-sphere.  This project describes a varied set of problems interweaving ideas from knot theory, 3-manifolds, and smooth 4-manifold topology.  The PI?s prior work includes two major collaborative contributions in this area, demonstrating that a large family of homotopy 4-spheres is diffeomorphic to the standard smooth 4-sphere, and developing far-reaching connections between 3-dimensional structures and 4-manifold trisections.  The current work involves four main problems.  First, the PI will characterize a family of knots satisfying an intermediate condition between being slice and being ribbon.  Second, the PI will pursue a new approach to the Powell conjecture, concerning the generation of the group of diffeomorphisms of the 3-sphere leaving a Heegaard surface invariant.  Third, the PI will use bridge trisections to address a Kirby problem related to representing second homology classes of 4-manifolds with smoothly embedded 2-spheres, and finally, the PI will adapt ideas from Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds to trisections of 4-manifolds in order to better understand handle decompositions of exotic 4-manifolds.  The underlying theme of this work is an approach that simultaneously integrates 3- and 4-dimensional techniques in order to obtain new insights into long-standing open problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The engagement of mathematics with other sciences, and of science with mathematics, is a continual source of fruitful ideas with long-term beneficial consequences for society.  We can measure these consequences by looking backwards: our current technology and economy rely on the foundation of basic research from past decades and centuries.  The mixing of different disciplines is mutually beneficial.  As a mathematician the PI has a particular goal to bring structures and intuitions from physics into mathematics.  The research has many facets designed to do just that.  Specifically, we will work on foundational issues in geometric formulations of quantum field theory. The projects are a mix of specific problems and general structural investigations.  The techniques are mathematical, often with inspiration from physics.  This work has ramifications for pure geometry as well as applications to questions in physics, such as classification of phases of matter. This award supports graduate students working with the PI participate in some of these projects, and they also carry out their own separate projects within this broad field.<br/><br/>We work within the Axiom System for field theories initiated by Segal and Atiyah in the 1980s.  These geometric axioms have been refined and extended in many directions since, and we seek to continue this process.  For example, the usual axioms evaluate a theory on a single manifold or bordism, whereas many computations involve evaluation on a family of manifolds, the axiomatics of which we will investigate further.  In some ways a field theory is akin to a representation of a Lie group.  In Lie theory unitary structures play a prominent role, and so too does unitarity in ordinary quantum field theory.  While the geometric axioms, especially for topological field theories, include locality in a strong form, there is no corresponding extended notion of unitarity.  This is an area we will investigate further.  Other aspects of general theory to pursue relate to non-topological invertible field theories and theories which are topological modulo invertible theories.  This project also has several lines of inquiry related to specific theories.  For example, we have a plan to construct three-dimensional topological Chern-Simons theory as a fully extended theory.  We also aim to investigate dynamics in a geometric incarnation of the two-dimensional Ising model.  Finally, we aim to construct lattice models which correspond to invertible field theories, part of a larger effort to develop a geometric theory of discrete models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology studies truly fundamental geometric issues about space that are unchanged even by smoothly bending and deforming the structure of space. As an example from three dimensions, a loop of string with a square knot tied into it is topologically distinct from a loop of string with a granny knot tied into it, in the sense that no amount of smooth deformation of the string or the space around it can turn one loop into the other; studying this kind of knottedness is the quintessential three-dimensional topological problem. Knottedness also happens in four dimensions, in numerous different ways, and is also at the core of smooth four-dimensional topology, and thus really at the core of understanding the shape and anatomy of exactly the kind of space that we spend our lives inhabiting. The research supported by this award will probe these problems by looking at four-dimensional topology from multiple different dimensions, ranging from a careful study of projections of four-dimensional spaces and their subspace onto two dimensional spaces to a careful study of motions of four-dimensional spaces inside five- and six-dimensional spaces. This research is also closely related to an outreach component, in which the principal investigator will work with design professionals and members of the local community to create exciting visualizations of important ideas in topology, to broaden the public's awareness of and interest in these fascinating topics. In addition the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Two of the biggest remaining problems in topology are the smooth 4-dimensional Poincare and Schoenflies conjectures. (Poincare: Every homotopy 4-sphere is diffeomorphic to the standard 4-sphere. Schoenflies: Every smoothly embedded 3-sphere in 4-space bounds a smoothly embedded 4-ball.) A related and foundational problem is whether the smooth mapping class group of the 4-sphere is trivial. Existing techniques such as gauge theory say nothing in the context of these problems; the basic problem is that there seems to be ""nothing to hold on to"" when working with spheres or even homotopy spheres; low-dimensional topology needs new ideas. In collaboration first with Kirby and later with a larger group, the PI, over the course of several earlier NSF awards, developed the study of Morse 2-functions, generalizing Morse theory, and then developed the theory of trisections of 4-manifolds as a striking 4-dimensional analog to the theory of Heegaard splittings. This seems to be exactly what is needed to inject new life into 4-manifold topology and to allow for extensive cross-fertilization between the worlds of 3-manifolds and 4-manifolds. The past five years (2014-19), in particular, have seen an explosion of interest by other researchers in trisections, and a significant broadening of the community involved in this work. The PI also has a strong background in contact and symplectic topology; the proposed project with Licata builds on this work, using many of the same tools used in the work on trisections. Here are two long-shot motivational examples: It is conceivable that understanding the space of all trisections on the 4-sphere will allow us to show that certain self-diffeomorphisms are not isotopic to the identity, and also perhaps distinguish the 4-sphere from other homotopy 4-spheres. Likewise it is possible that a deeper understanding of contact topology in relation to 4-manifold topology, perhaps via trisections and open book decompositions, will allow us to see every embedded 3-sphere in 4-space as being of contact type, allowing us to use symplectic tools to settle the Schoenflies conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A classification of these spaces will rest on a mathematical understanding of the possible shapes they can take and the rigidity and flexibility properties they can have. These properties are known as invariants and they come from algebraic, analytic, and geometric considerations, often with crucial input from physics. The proof of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture established that three-dimensional spaces, called manifolds, decompose into pieces that admit explicit geometries. In the last few decades, ideas from quantum physics have led mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of subtle invariants and structures of three-manifolds and the knotted curves contained in them. There are several open conjectures, both in physics and in mathematics, that predict deep relations between quantum structures and geometries of three-manifolds. This project will investigate the relations of these quantum invariants to the geometric structures arising from Thurston's picture and explore the ramifications and applications of these connections to mathematics and physics.

These are abstract mathematical objects designed to model the universe we live in.  The term locally homogeneous refers to the presence of a high degree of local symmetry which is captured by a Lie group called the (local) symmetry group.  It is this symmetry group which governs the geometry, in the following sense: the meaningful quantities we can measure in a geometric manifold (e.g. lengths or angles) are exactly those which are invariant under the symmetry group.  There are many different possible symmetry groups which lead to different types of geometric manifolds useful in many contexts across mathematics and physics.  There can also be many different geometric manifolds with the same local symmetry group. These all have the same local properties, but can look very different at large scales. The space of all such possibilities is called a moduli space; it is a topological space whose points are the possible geometric manifolds of a certain type and whose topology organizes those geometric manifolds into families whose features vary continuously. While the precise features (e.g. shape, size, etc.) of our universe is a question for empirical physics, a moduli space is the mathematical answer to the question of what possible features could the universe have.  The research component of this project studies geometric manifolds of many types, with focus on flat affine geometry, real projective geometry, and constant curvature pseudo-Riemannian geometry. These geometries have just the right amount of symmetry to allow for large interesting moduli spaces with mysterious but tractable behavior. Core elements of the educational component include training Ph.D. students, a new Texas Experimental Geometry Lab for undergraduate research, and the Texas Winter Workshop on Geometric Structures for early career mathematicians.<br/><br/>A guiding philosophy in the PI's research program is that geometric manifolds of one type may be fruitfully studied by deforming, or transitioning, to a different type of geometry.  For example, the PI?s work studying Margulis spacetimes as geometric limits of anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, has yielded many results about the geometry, topology, and deformation theory of these affine Lorentzian three-manifolds. The PI will develop new tools, following the geometric limit point of view, for new affine geometry contexts in higher dimensions, in order to address questions surrounding important open problems such as the Auslander Conjecture. The PI will also pursue a broad program to study convex real projective structures on manifolds. One focus is to identify which three-manifolds admit such structures and to describe the moduli spaces, with applications to questions in low-dimensional topology. In a more general context, the PI will conduct a thorough investigation of a new notion of convex cocompactness in real projective geometry, generalizing the well-studied notion from the Kleinian groups setting. Educational goals of this project center on expanding and vertically integrating the research training program in Geometric Structures at UT Austin being developed by the PI. The Texas Experimental Geometry Lab (TXGL) will introduce undergraduates at UT Austin to research in geometry, topology, and/or dynamics through computational and experimental projects.

An early instance of this is Euler who noted that for a polygonal surface the number of vertices minus edges plus faces is always two, which allowed him to prove that there are only five platonic solids. In the 1920s, Emmy Noether shifted the focus from numerical invariants to the algebraic structures underlying them, such as sets with algebraic operations. In Homotopy Theory, the focus is extended further to more advanced mathematical notions of infinite-dimensional spaces whose number of connected components recover the underlying numerical invariant. The projects funded by this CAREER award aim to lift classical algebraic invariants of geometric objects to the higher homotopical world and study them from this richer perspective. The educational part of the project consists in expanding access to mathematics not only within the academic world via conferences, but also beyond the usual academic settings to incarcerated individuals: the PI will introduce and teach an inquiry-based learning college level mathematics elective in the B.A. program offered at South Woods Prison. <br/><br/>The primary research goal of the project is to use new results in equivariant stable homotopy theory to study manifolds with group actions and their equivariant diffeomorphisms. Stable homotopy theory, the study of spectra, has played a crucial role in the longstanding program to classify manifolds; however, the classification of G-manifolds for a group G is far less understood than the classical nonequivariant story. Building in part on prior work of the PI on equivariant algebraic K-theory and her collaborative foundational work on equivariant infinite loop space theory, the machinery that turns suitable G-categories into G-spectra, the PI and Malkiewich were have built an equivariant generalization of Waldhausen's algebraic K-theory of spaces. Inspired by Goodwillie?s vision, they conjecture that, for a compact smooth G-manifold M, equivariant A-theory splits off a stable space of equivariant h-cobordisms. This project involves a significant extension of these efforts focused on proving this conjecture and exploiting it to further our understanding of equivariant h-cobordisms and diffeomorphisms of G-manifolds. The second research goal is to apply stable homotopy techniques to study classical invariants by deriving these, i.e., lifting them to spectra. The PI will pursue two projects of this flavor. First, together with Malkiewich and Moi, the PI will study a derived version of the classical character map from representation theory that they have defined. The second, which is a project that the PI is co-leading with Rovi for the Women in Topology Workshop, is to apply and extend recent work of Zakharevich and Campbell on scissors congruence K-theory spectra to manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overall goals of this initiative are to increase the number of math majors going to top-tier graduate schools, increase the number of Ph.D.s obtaining top-tier postdocs, improve the career placement of postdoctoral fellows after their time at UT, and increase the number of women and minorities pursuing advanced degrees and careers in mathematics research and education.<br/><br/>The UTGD is led by seven faculty members at UT Austin. The group brings a wealth of different viewpoints and motivations together, from low-dimensional topology and geometry, to amenability, representation theory, random walks and ergodic theory. Building on a departmental Group Theory and Dynamics Seminar that has run for the past five years, the emphasis and resources of the grant will bring together expertise in the many areas represented by the research group while providing an arena for new mathematics and for the training of new mathematicians. To increase the number of graduate students entering into fields involving higher mathematics, UTGD will provide a summer Directed Reading Program (DRP) designed to prepare undergraduates for graduate school. UTGD will create a course, Experimental Mathematics, and enhance another, Discrete Math, to help prepare students for research. To improve the placement of graduating UT Ph.D.s, this award will enhance the UT graduate program by providing graduate fellowships/traineeships and travel funds and support for graduate mini-Schools and a Groups and Dynamics junior seminar. To build the departmental activity centered around Groups and Dynamics, this award will add four postdoctoral positions and provide visitors to work with postdocs, graduate students, and faculty. In the use of these resources, the management team will actively seek to increase the proportion of members of underrepresented groups in mathematics. The grant also proposes a number of ways to impact mathematics outside the department. The materials resulting from any of the projects will be made available through a dedicated website. The mini-Schools will draw from graduate students nationwide; the undergraduate  conference, and the summer DRP will draw broadly from Texas schools.

The idea of noncommutative geometry is to study noncommutative algebras using tools inspired by geometry. Noncommutative algebras are mathematical objects that have addition and multiplication; however the order in which the elements get multiplied might matter. The purpose of the project, which is centered<br/>around higher structures and homotopy algebras in noncommutative geometry, is to investigate mathematical problems motivated by physics in these fields. More specifically, the project is motivated by a combination of ideas from quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, string theory, and classical areas of mathematics such as Lie theory, representation theory, complex geometry, homological algebra, foliation theory, deformation quantization and index theory, and noncommutative geometry. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed project promotes further interaction between these fields. The PI continues to disseminate his research by speaking at conferences and seminars and organizing workshops, which provide excellent opportunities for the PI to exchange, interact and collaborate with colleagues from within and outside the US and, in particular, young scientists. This award will support the training of early career researchers that work on related fields.<br/><br/>In noncommutative geometry one studies algebras as if they were algebras of functions on manifolds. However, these noncommutative spaces are virtual and not made of points. Dg manifolds are one particular type of such a noncommutative spaces. The space of functions on a dg manifold is a differential graded algebra. Another important class of noncommutative spaces is obtained as deformations of commutative algebras. Deformation quantization aims at throwing a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics. The mathematical structures of the two theories are very different, making it a challenging problem to understand how the transition from classical to quantum works. Quantization, roughly speaking, is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. The PI proposes to continue the study of higher structures and homotopy algebras arising naturally in noncommutative geometry and their relation to representation theory using tools from deformation quantization and Lie algebroid theory. The problems include investigating the role of the Todd class in Tamarkin-Tsygan calculi associated with a  dg manifold, studying the formal geometry of dg manifolds and the concept of homotopy equivalence of dg Lie algebroids, establishing a Kontsevich-Duflo type theorem in a wide context, and exploring negatively graded dg manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contact structures are the underlying geometric structures reigning the behaviour of light wavefronts in semiclassical ray optics, the evolution of thermodynamical systems and, in general, the study of real-valued functions and their first-order variations. In conjunction with its classical applications to control theory and Hamiltonian dynamics, contact topology has also recently found surprising applications to fluid mechanics and chemistry, including the study of Cholesteric Liquid Crystals. This project aims at providing an understanding of these contact structures through the manipulation of Legendrian wavefronts. These wavefronts are geometric in nature and part of this project aims at systematically describing efficient algorithms to manipulate these fronts. This will significantly enhance our ability to qualitatively study many dynamical systems in terms of the combinatorics of front diagrams. Phrasing problems in terms of front diagrams allows us to bring the strength of the theory of singularities into the study of contact structures. Thus, classical questions such as the stable behaviour of a given Hamiltonian system, the number of periodic orbits and the presence of surfaces of section will potentially be answered through the front-end development perspective offered by the combinatorics of front diagrams.<br/><br/>In technical terms, this project shall be studying the classification of codimension-2 contact submanifolds and developing the study of Legendrian Kirby Calculus and Weinstein structures in all higher dimensions. The project addresses existence and non-uniqueness questions in higher-dimensional contact knot theory, the construction and manipulation of Weinstein handlebodies and their higher-dimensional Legendrian wavefronts. The project includes new applications of these goals to complex geometry, through the study of Stein structures, mathematical physics, including applications to Homological Mirror Symmetry, and singularity theory. The techniques proposed in this project will also have immediate applications to the computation of Floer-theoretic invariants in higher-dimensional symplectic topology and the study of Lagrangian fillings and the wrapped Fukaya category.  The central tools in the project combine higher-dimensional geometric topology, the theory of h-principles and Legendrian invariants. The project includes a central conjecture on the classification of Lagrangian fillings for algebraic Legendrian links and an existence and uniqueness h-principle for higher-dimensional contact submanifolds. The techniques to be employed in the study of these conjectures include explicit constructions obtained via the manipulation of Legendrian fronts and wrinkled singularities, and the use of pseudo-holomorphic curves in order to compute their contact invariants. In addition, the project will also incorporate the development of invariants for higher-dimensional contact knots and the use of microlocal sheaf theory as a guiding connection to the theory of cluster algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, shuffling a deck of cards or rotating an atom around its nucleus.  Over the last 200 years, Group Theory has been spectacularly successful in using symmetry to study a wide variety of problems in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering.  More recently, starting in the 1980s, mathematicians and mathematical physicists have developed a theory of Quantum Groups and Quantum Symmetry which adapt ideas from Group Theory to more general settings appearing in quantum physics and related mathematics.  The first spectacular application of what we now call Group Theory was Galois' use of symmetries of number systems to explain why there's a generalization of the familiar quadratic formula to solve equations using third or fourth powers, but no such formula for solving equations with fifth powers.  Galois's number systems are parallel to von Neumann factors developed to study quantum mechanics, and several of the first spectacular applications of what we would know call Quantum Groups or Quantum Symmetries appeared in Jones's study of subfactors.  More recently Quantum Symmetry has become central to certain approaches to constructing quantum computers using so-called topological phases of matter.  The main techniques used in this project involve higher dimensional algebra.  Here the idea is that we typically write mathematical symbols on a line when doing calculations, but in many settings it is better to use the whole plane to draw pictures, or to do the calculation on ""paper"" in more interesting shapes like circles or spheres.  Sometimes the geometry allows for insight into the mathematics, for example you can ""rotate"" a calculation taking place in the plane.  The goal of this project is to use higher dimensional algebra to study questions in quantum symmetry. The project will also contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of Ph.D. and high school students.<br/><br/>In more technical language, we use planar algebras, topological quantum field theory, and higher categories to study questions coming from von Neumann subfactors and tensor categories.  These include very example-driven questions like constructing and studying exceptional small index subfactors, as well as more theoretical questions like understanding the structure of the 3-category of fusion categories (where subfactors appear as 1-morphisms).  More specifically, this project focuses on four closely related research programs.  First, we will develop a purely algebraic analogue of the author's previous work on the classification of small index subfactors. Second we will use module categories more systematically to approach analytic questions about reconstructing subfactors from their standard invariants.  Third, we will use skein theoretic approaches and Jones's planar algebras to study tensor categories, including non-semisimple tensor categories.  Finally, we study tensor categories and braided tensor categories using higher-categories and local topological quantum field theories building on the Lurie-Baez-Dolan cobordism hypothesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One fruitful way in which manifolds can be studied is through their symmetries, which taken together form an algebraic object called a group. The focus of this project is the interaction between the structure of a manifold, both local (up close) and global (as an ensemble), and its symmetries, or group actions on manifolds for short. The project aims to resolve some basic questions in this area and investigate some new phenomena. Among the problems of particular interest are those concerning smoothness of group actions, in the sense of calculus. A resolution of some of these problems has the potential to yield insight into old open questions about exotic spheres, which are certain manifolds which can be deformed into standard spheres, but only in a highly singular way.  Groups acting on manifolds are a broad class of objects which have received a large amount of attention, and their theory has developed rapidly in recent years. Planned broader impacts include research experiences for undergraduates, conference organization, and a book on right-angled Artin groups.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to these advances in several ways. One area of focus for the project is critical regularity of group actions. Previous work with Kim will be extended in order to compute the critical regularity in one dimension of right-angled Artin groups, which would then be the first natural class of non-nilpotent groups whose precise one-dimensional critical regularity is both finite and known. Moreover, the principal investigator intends to develop critical regularity in higher dimensions, with the goal of encoding the diffeomorphism type of a compact manifold by a set of finitely generated groups. Such a result would give an algebraic approach to the 4-dimensional smooth Poincare conjecture. Another focus of the project is to develop a structure theory for thin subgroups of semisimple Lie groups, with the goal of resolving a conjecture of Shalom about the discreteness of their commensurators. The final main focus of the project is in the area of mapping class groups of surfaces, where the PI has outlined a program to prove the nonlinearity of mapping class groups, and to introduce logic into low dimensional topology by investigating the model theory of the curve graph of a surface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of this conference is to bring experts in transchromatic homotopy theory together with both junior researchers and graduate students working in the area as well as experts in closely associated fields including arithmetic geometry and differential geometry. A second aim is to give very early career researchers (i,e,. graduate students and postdocs) a chance to describe their research in the form of shorter talks. In doing this, not only will graduate students receive personal mentoring, but mathematicians outside of the field will be exposed to what is going on in transchromatic homotopy theory. We hope that this will significantly raise awareness of both the techniques that have been developed and also the problems that are faced.<br/><br/>Transchromatic homotopy theory is a rapidly emerging subarea of chromatic homotopy theory. Chromatic homotopy theory organizes the stable homotopy category by decomposing it into ""chromatic layers"". In studying these layers, algebraic topologists have found deep relationships between homotopy theory and algebraic geometry, number theory, higher category theory, and supersymmetric field theories. To assemble results at each chromatic layer into global results about the stable homotopy category, the relationship between the chromatic layers must be understood. This is the primary goal of transchromatic homotopy theory. Since the first Transatlantic Transchromatic Homotopy Theory conference, which occurred at the University of Regensburg in June, 2017, real applications of transchromatic homotopy theory to other areas have begun to appear. In particular, fundamental calculations in transchromatic homotopy theory have been applied very successfully to better understand the equivariant stable homotopy category. The primary scientific aim of this conference is to describe work on the forefront of this area, explain applications to other mathematical areas, and also to get input from experts in related areas. Our speakers consist of established world experts in chromatic homotopy theory, arithmetic geometry, differential geometry, and group theory, all of whose work is related in some way to transchromatic homotopy theory, as well as early career mathematicians who are rapidly pushing the field forward.

Recently, this question has received attention in other contexts: when the spheres are considered in the realm of algebraic geometry, or when the spheres have specified symmetries which must be preserved by the mappings in question. More recently, greater understanding of how these various contexts impact each other has emerged.

In addition, topology plays an essential role in formulating modern theories in physics. Perhaps more surprisingly, tools from modern physics, more specifically quantum filed theory, have yielded significant progresses in low dimensional topology. This National Science Foundation funded project promotes systematic application of ideas in physics to topology and vice versa.

The PI will use automata theory to investigate questions of growth and torsion and apply the long developed theory of branch groups to work towards a general theory of maximal subgroups of branch groups. The final focus of the project is on group properties coming from topological constructions.  The PI will develop a geometric group theory analog of the topological theory of branch coverings as well as explore connections between the general theory of homological stability and topological finiteness properties, first through certain natural subgroups of some big mapping class groups by exploiting actions on highly connected complexes related to the curve complex.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These dimensions are special from an anthropic perspective, since they model our everyday perception of the physical world, and from a mathematical perspective, since the phenomena they exhibit and the collection of techniques used to study them are rather different from those in higher dimensions.  Combinatorics refers to the study of discrete structures, such as networks and flows, and it is influential in the development of codes and algorithms.  Combinatorial methods have long influenced topology.  Amongst the various techniques that come to bear on low-dimensional topology are graphs of surface intersections; lattice-theoretic methods; and extremal combinatorics. Each technique has led to sensational progress on the main problems in low-dimensional topology, and they lend very different perspectives on the subject.   The unifying goal of this research project is to advance combinatorial methods towards problems in low-dimensional topology. Alongside the research component, the PI will conduct activities that integrate his research interests with education and training initiatives that reach audiences from the high school level to postdoctoral researchers. For instance, the PI is actively involved with mathematics enrichment at the high school level through the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics and Mathematical Staircase, Inc. In the context of these programs and in other mentoring activities, he seeks to inspire the discovery process and aid in the exposition of beautiful mathematics. He ran a graduate summer school focused on a central theme in low-dimensional topology, Dehn surgery, and is in the process of editing a book based on it.  He has also written a survey article on Heegaard Floer homology for the Notices of the AMS, the most widely-read general interest periodical targeted at professional mathematicians, and he is committed to more expository work aimed at a wide mathematical audience. The award provides funds for supporting graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI will develop combinatorial methods in low-dimensional topology, in continuation of an established program. The main projects focus on studying graphs of surface intersections in application to exceptional Dehn surgery and embeddings of surfaces in the four-sphere; lattice embeddings and their refinements in application to the study of rational homology balls, slice links, and surface isotopy; and extremal combinatorics in application to properties of curves on surfaces. The surface intersection techniques are more direct and rely on the development of graph theoretic tools in order to draw topological conclusions.  Floer homology methods are less direct but apply heavy machinery to a vast collection of problems.  This project will more closely bind combinatorics and low-dimensional topology. The PI currently advises three PhD students and has just graduated one student.  The PI runs original graduate courses on various themes, including advanced combinatorics and the knot complement problem, and will continue to do so.  This award will support graduate students during summer months and assist them with travel funds. At the postdoctoral level, the PI mentors and collaborates with post-doctoral fellows.  This award will support them with travel funds. At the scholarly outreach level, the PI intends to undertake more expository projects with the aim of reaching and educating a wide audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology is the study of geometry where you identify one geometric object with another if one can be deformed into the other. The goal of algebraic topology is to ascribe discrete algebraic invariants to these geometric objects to distinguish their topological types.  In this way, distinguishing geometric objects is reduced to algebraic computations.  Understanding the topological type of geometric objects is a fundamental act of scientific/mathematical inquiry, comparable to the study of prime numbers, or the classification of the fundamental particles that constitute matter and carry forces.  Topological computations have recently been applied to solve problems in solid state physics.  Also, data involving the interrelation of a large number of variables naturally traces out a geometric object in a high dimensional space.  The study of such data-sets using algebraic topology is the subject of the new and active field of topological data analysis.  The focus of these projects is in the interaction of classical algebraic topology, equivariant homotopy theory, and motivic homotopy theory.  Equivariant homotopy theory is the study of the topology of symmetry, whereas motivic homotopy theory is the study of the topology of solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  Recent years have witnessed a dazzling array of progress in the field of algebraic topology through the importation of equivariant and motivic methods. Broader impacts of these projects include work with graduate students, a summer math research program, a directed reading program, and a bridge program for entering graduate students.<br/><br/>Particular projects involve investigating novel structures in equivariant and motivic stable homotopy theory, and seek to leverage these structures to give new approaches to some long outstanding problems in classical stable homotopy theory.  The telescope conjecture will be investigated using a tower of spectra which appeared in the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel solution of the Kervaire Invariant One Problem.  Recent work of Pstragowski and Gheorghe-Isaksen-Krause-Ricka gives a synthetic construction of complex motivic stable homotopy theory.  The principal investigator plans to extend this to the real motivic context using equivariant homotopy theory.  Another project uses equivariant chromatic homotopy theory to study the interaction of classical chromatic homotopy theory with the Tate construction, with the aim of making progress on the chromatic splitting conjecture.  Recent work of Barthel-Schlank-Stapleton gives a means of studying stable homotopy theory at generic primes using ultra-filters.

This award will support the development and dissemination of workshop materials and will fund travel and participation of 28 undergraduates. An additional 22 students from local communities or those already planning to attend NCUR will also have the opportunity to participate. For a day, the participants will be immersed in the fast-growing area of data science, through the lens of topology. This workshop is the first of its kind: T4DS engages students in a hands-on, collaborative experience, requiring only discrete mathematics and a desire to try something new as prerequisites.<br/><br/>T4DS will start with an overview of how to ""think with data"" through data exploration and visualization, continuing with a brief journey into the field of topology and how to use topological descriptors to summarize data. In the afternoon, students will investigate how to cluster data based on those topological descriptors, and will apply what they've learned to a new data set. The day will conclude with a reception, where a panel of five faculty members representing topology and data science will discuss their experiences with including undergraduates in research and potential career opportunities in data science. The content of T4DS will cross the disciplinary lines of computer science, statistics, and mathematics. It will blend topological data analysis, data mining, and broader data science content, delivered using an active-learning pedagogy. Most of the participants will not have any experience in topology, yet they will cluster data using topological descriptors, which will give them a glimpse into the topological data cycle. Moreover, this workshop will lay the foundation for developing materials on other aspects of data science, which will allow the organizers to broaden the offering of similar tutorials throughout Montana and surrounding states, including tribal colleges and geographically remote rural areas. After the workshop, tutorials will be distributed through Github and the Carpentries Lab---a repository of high-quality, community-reviewed, discoverable lessons--- reaching a large, diverse, international community.

For instance, for a square the set of successive rotations by 90 degrees in the plane is a collection of symmetries and yields a group of size 4.  One useful way of describing a group is via what is known as a presentation, with generators and relations between the generators completely describing the group.  For example, the collection of all integers is an infinite group that is generated by a single element, namely the integer 1.  If a group has a finite presentation (with a finite number of generators and a finite number of relations) then it is easier to understand, and easier to solve problems about that group.  In addition, a group is called coherent if it enjoys the stronger property that every finitely generated subgroup is finitely presented.  Many of the best understood groups are coherent: free groups, surface groups, and 3-manifold groups are all coherent.  This project aims to understand when groups are coherent and to find geometric indicators of subgroups that are witnesses to incoherence.  This project advances the field by investigating geometrically wild subgroups of seemingly well-behaved groups, which can be difficult to find.  The project includes work in education, and the PI is helping to organize conferences and schools that enhance the training of the next generation. <br/><br/>The PI plans to investigate the coherence of several interesting classes of groups, including groups that are expected to be coherent and groups which are expected to be incoherent.  This project addresses fundamental and difficult problems about incoherence and the geometry of subgroups.  One of the projects is a key step to a well-known conjecture that hyperbolic groups with Sierpinski carpet boundary are virtually Kleinian.  Another is a newer conjecture, that groups which act geometrically on the product of two trees are incoherent.  Solving these conjectures will shed substantial light on understanding when a group is the fundamental group of a 3-manifold, and also on the intricate subgroup structure of important classes of groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Smooth manifolds are a special class of high-dimensional shapes that are of fundamental importance in geometry and physics. This project is concerned with important and unexpected connections between these two fields. To be more precise, they can be related using algebraic K-theory, a deep and abstract but pervasive subject whose reach already encompasses several mathematical disciplines, including homotopy theory, differential topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory. These research projects will develop these connections, giving us new ways to think about classical problems and to use techniques from fixed-point theory in unexpected places.

The first shows that the Fuller trace, a certain noncommutative trace in genuine G-spectra, provides a complete invariant for removing n-periodic points from a map by a homotopy. The second uses the trace from K-theory of endomorphisms to topological restriction homology (TR) to show that this Fuller trace is a topological, non-commutative generalization of the characteristic polynomial from linear algebra. The third project proves the equivariant refinement of Waldhausen's parametrized h-cobordism theorem, a fundamental and celebrated result in high-dimensional manifold theory. The fourth project uses noncommutative traces to compute transfer maps in algebraic K-theory, leading to torsion calculations that identify exotic bundles and fibrations that cannot be stably smoothed.

The confluence of topology, geometry, group theory, complex analysis and dynamics in dimension two is a constant source of rich structure and influences many fields both directly and by analogy. Because surfaces are simple and flexible, they admit large parameter spaces of shapes. The study of these spaces is useful directly in topology and geometry in all dimensions.  The PI will explore the geometry of the space of shapes of a surface, and the relationships between flows within this more abstract space and the ways in which three-dimensional structures are built out of families of two-dimensional structures. By way of analogy, ideas in two and three dimensions have also inspired powerful techniques in allied fields such as geometric group theory and dynamics.

Recent work of the PI and coauthors has shed some new light on the study of the geodesic flow of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space, and its connection to the structure of fibered 3-manifolds. With these results in mind, the PI plans a more detailed study of the coarse structure of the Teichmuller space as made visible by the cubical and metric structure of its asymptotic cone. This point of view suggests interesting questions about minimal surfaces in the Teichmuller space, and avenues toward resolving the visibility problem for the WP geodesic flow. New connections of Weil-Petersson geometry to the structure of fibered 3-manifolds and Thurston's norm on homology hint at deeper structure which the PI plans to investigate.  In the theory of 3-manifolds, the deep interaction between decompositions along surfaces, structure of curve complexes and mapping class groups, and hyperbolic geometry continues to provide challenging questions. The PI will work on developing a more complete theory for canonical decompositions of 3-manifolds, focusing on the interactions of Heegaard splittings, fibrations and subsurface projections. He will study the problem of finding uniform models for hyperbolic manifolds and obtaining a priori bounds on skinning maps. The setting of Heegaard splittings and handlebodies connects to a new approach on character varieties of free groups, via a technique of graph folding in hyperbolic space.

Scale-independence and locality are two favorable and tenable features of quantum observables.  Scale-independence lends to stable phases of matter that can be codified via a field of mathematics called topology.  Observables possess locality if each observation on a large region of space-time is determined by those on smaller domains, such as by point- or line-observables.  Point-, line-, plane-, ? -observables organize as a mathematical entity known as a higher category, which is a higher-dimensional graph.  Factorization homology is a device that assembles such localized observables to global observables on space-time and it possesses several structural features that give a theory advantage once cast as so.  Generally, it offers conceptual and combinatorial access to long-distance/long-time quantum theory, notably even to ones that are not determined by their point-observables.  To integrate research and education between students and researchers, and to increase mathematics and physics activity in the EPSCoR State of Montana and its surrounding states, the PI will organize two conferences.  These conferences will bring together renowned researchers in mathematical physics, and will draw regional participation.  The PI will compile and disseminate literature for bias-sensitive selection processes for such events.  The PI will produce and publicly post two video series.  One series will behold research-level mathematics generated through activities related to this award.  The other series will be for experimental in-class instruction for upper-division mathematics classes.  <br/> <br/>The project continues the development and explicit identification of the theory of factorization homology for higher categories, partly in collaboration with John Francis.  Factorization homology can be conceived as the study of sheaves on moduli spaces of stratifications, much like Beilinson-Drinfeld?s construction of conformal blocks in terms of sheaves on Ran spaces.  One goal is to fulfill an essential aspect of this theory: the exact relationship between orthogonal groups and higher categorical adjunctions.  A consequence of such a relationship is a proof of the cobordism hypothesis, of Baez-Dolan and Lurie, after Atiyah.  Another goal is to recover known, and establish new, manifold and tangle invariants from representation theoretic data.  Expected examples of such include the Jones polynomial, and Reshetikhin-Turaev's invariant.  Now, factorization homology depends continuously in diffeomorphisms/isotopies; it possesses subtle functoriality and local-to-global principles; it is expected to carry natural filtrations as well as a general form of Poincare/Koszul duality.  Such a goal thusly lends advantage for computational access to manifold and tangle invariants arising through representation theory.  Such a goal also lends to surprising dualities between state-sum type topological quantum field theories and sigma-model type field theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However on a large scale, 3-manifolds have properties that may be quite different from what we are used to seeing and experiencing. Such manifolds are common objects in science, appearing for example in physics, astronomy or data science, as well as in various fields of mathematics. Here the Principal Investigator will study intrinsic properties of 3-manifolds, and how they relate to various areas of mathematics. Since many properties lend themselves to computer study and yield interesting algorithms, the PI will also look at questions that encompass how ""hard"" 3-manifolds are computationally. The award provides funds for supporting a graduate student.<br/><br/><br/>Due to Geometrization (W. Thurston, Perelman), every 3-manifold can be canonically decomposed into pieces, and each piece has a certain geometric structure.  Thus, on a global scale, one can match topological information for the manifold with the respective geometry. However, on a local scale, that is, intrinsically, the connection between the geometry and topology of a 3-manifold is not well understood. This is particularly so for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, though there are questions for other classes as well. The goal of the first part of this project is to obtain a deep insight into this, for 3-manifolds with finite hyperbolic or simplicial volume (since not all manifolds here are hyperbolic). There are projects on embedded surfaces and arcs in 3-manifolds, cusped or closed, addressing well-known conjectures in the field.  While these questions are interesting a priori, the second part of the project is concerned with applications of the developed results and techniques, and aims to use the obtained insight for deepening connections with other areas. In particular, (a) to better understand the interplay between geometric topology and algebraic geometry of 3-manifolds, through the study representation variety of a 3-manifold; (b) to address the problems on the interface of theoretical computer science and low-dimensional topology, through an overlap with complexity theory and computable analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among all spaces, the spheres are the most fundamental and beautiful objects. A central question in homotopy theory and algebraic topology - the computation of homotopy groups of spheres - is to understand how spheres can be mapped to other spheres, in different dimensions, and to understand how different maps can or cannot be deformed to each other. This topological question is not just a fundamental question on fundamental mathematical objects, but it also has deep connections and interactions to other subjects in mathematics. It has been a major research question since 1950's. For example, Kervaire and Milnor established a connection to the question on how many ways one could do calculus on spheres - smooth structures on spheres; Kervaire and Browder built a connection to the question on how one could or could not do surgeries to higher dimensional spaces to turn them into spheres - the Kervaire invariant problem. Moreover, a summand of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, the image of J, is closely related to the Bernoulli numbers; Quillen and Goerss, Hopkins, Miller, Lurie established a connection to the moduli stack of formal groups. More recently, Hill, Hopkins, Ravenel, Voevodsky, Morel, Isaksen and others established connections between equivariant homotopy theory and motivic homotopy theory. The goal of this project is to deepen the existing connections, as well as discovering new connections by pushing further the limit of existing ones.<br/><br/><br/>This research concentrates on computations of stable homotopy groups of spheres, with interactions among motivic, equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory, and applications to problems in differential topology, such as uniqueness of smooth structure on spheres and the Kervaire invariant problem. More specifically, in current and ongoing projects with Isaksen and Wang, the Principle Investigator (PI) develops new computational tools in motivic homotopy theory, with connection to chromatic homotopy theory, which computes 40 more new stems of classical stable homotopy groups of sphere within two years. The PI will deepen the new connection between motivic homotopy theory and chromatic homotopy theory, carry out more computations of stable stems in the next a few years, and use the computations to attack the last unsolved case of the Kervaire invariant problem in dimension 126. The PI will also explore connections between real motivic homotopy theory and C2 equivariant homotopy theory, following ongoing work of Behrens, Dugger, Guillou and Isaksen. The goal is to prove structural theorems in this direction, as well as providing concrete computational results. In ongoing projects with Hill, Shi and Wang, the PI will also apply equivariant techniques, such as the slice spectral sequences that are developed by Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, to do computations in heights greater than 2 in chromatic homotopy theory and to understand its connection to stable homotopy groups of spheres.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology is an area of abstract mathematics that emerged from analysis and geometry as its own discipline in the late 19th century.  It has since become one of the foundational disciplines of mathematics, underlying much of mathematics and its applications to the sciences.  Modern applications of topology include logic, computer science, data processing, life sciences, game theory, and enriched category theory.  In keeping with its predecessor conferences, SUMTOPO 2020 will be an important international event that reflects the ever-expanding world of topology and its applications, with sessions dedicated to natural and social sciences, category theory, computational topology (including block chains and data science), algebra and geometry, general and set-theoretic topology, dynamics and continuum theory, asymmetry and many-valuedness, and enriched categories and topology.  SUMTOPO 2020 will contribute to better understanding the topological structures inherent in big data, as well as solidifying topology as a foundation of data science, thus contributing to the NSF goal of Harnessing the Data Revolution. SUMTOPO 2020 will have special sessions for recent doctoral recipients and faculty at smaller institutions to help them develop sustainable research programs, as well as outlining strategies for recruiting women and minorities to mathematics.  Participants will comprise a diverse group of established researchers, junior researchers, graduate students, and retirees, with special emphasis on recruiting speakers and participants both internationally and from underrepresented populations. <br/><br/>SUMPTOPO 2020 features sessions on Algebra and Geometry, General and Set-Theoretic Topology, Dynamics and Continuum Theory, and Asymmetry, while beginning and/or expanding sessions on Topology in Data Science for Natural and Social Sciences, Category Theory, Computational Topology, Many-Valuedness, and Enriched Categories and Topology. In each session, ?topology,? whether explicitly stated or not, is a basis of the session. In the natural and social sciences, scientists and mathematicians are discovering that there are natural occurrences and phenomena that can be explained or better understood using topology and that some of the explanations raise new topological questions. Data science is of special interest in two of the sessions in SUMTOPO 2020. Data science is not only a rapidly developing area in its own right, it is also a driving force in important and on-going developments in many disciplines including most if not all the natural and social sciences. Topology is proving to be an integral part of the development of data science and its applications. Regarding category theory, we want to explore the ways in which category theory has influenced topology in the past and the ways that category theory will continue to influence topology in the future. Since the very nature of (big) data means that applications involving data science must be computational, computational topology is a critical area of focus. Computational topology also gives rise to new topological questions and areas of research. An asymmetric topology is one for which the associated specialization preorder is non-symmetric; while a many-valued topology is a collection of open sets, each of which is a mapping from the carrier set of a space to a designated complete lattice of ?truth values.? In recent years it has been discovered that these two areas of topology are linked to each other and to computational topology, particularly to spaces and topological systems often associated with programming semantics.<br/><br/>The conference web page is https://ysu.edu/sumtopo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The integers are the most basic example, but other rings with very diverse properties occur in all areas of mathematics, pure and applied.  For more than fifty years, a major goal in the study of rings has been to understand their algebraic K-theory.  This is a way of thinking about rings via topology, the qualitative study of the shape of spaces.  The research supported by this award uses the trace method to connect algebraic K-theory to things which are easier to understand, like Hochschild homology and its variants.  It turns out, moreover, that if one replaces the rings by topological versions of rings that are called ring spectra, the Hochschild-type invariants become even better approximations of algebraic K-theory of the original rings, and this field has seen a lot of recent development. The principal investigator has made calculations of algebraic K-theory using these methods, and is working on others.  Understanding the Hochschild-type invariants of ring spectra also gives good tools for classifying them by analogies with traditional discrete rings.  This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and will encourage and mentor young women mathematicians at the graduate and undergraduate levels.<br/><br/>Most of the principal investigator's work to date has been in calculations of topological Hochschild homology, the ring spectrum version of Hochschild homology.  It turns out that this is a special case, associated to a circle, of a more general idea of tensoring any topological space with a ring spectrum, and viewing the circle calculation in this wider context has already enabled a better understanding of topological Hochschild homology calculations in some cases.  Just as the tensor product of a ring with a circle is instrumental in understanding algebraic K-theory, the tensor product of a ring with a higher dimensional torus is instrumental in understanding iterated algebraic K-theory, and so one is interested in understanding the interaction between rings (or ring spectra) and spaces that makes some such tensor product calculations much easier than others.  To get algebraic K-theory calculations, these projects will address topological cyclic homology calculations using Nikolaus and Scholze's new formulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The structure of these workshops reflects the fact that mathematics is an intensely collaborative endeavor, requiring mentorship across generations and formation of trusting relationships within a given cohort. Since the initial meeting, in 2004, the Talbot Workshops have employed a uniquely human-centered approach in introducing scores of young researchers to topics of contemporary interest in a broad range of mathematics centering on algebraic topology. Each workshop gathers about 35 young participants and one or two senior mathematicians for a week-long retreat. The participants, who are mostly graduate students, learn about the workshop?s research topic by exchanging lectures and discussing the topic under the guidance of the mentors. As many of the participants are first- or second-year graduate students looking to get a start in a promising research area, the lectures begin with basic introductory material and lead up to a presentation of open problems. The workshop has been extremely successful, inspiring the future research of many students and establishing numerous collaborations among the participants. There will continue to be a serious effort to insure a broad and diverse participant list. The workshop?s unique format, in which participants live and cook together in a rental house, helps to create and sustain a relaxed and collaborative atmosphere. Organizing the workshop provides an important opportunity for professional development by the leadership committee, which is entirely made up of graduate students with backup oversight by a senior faculty member.<br/><br/>Past Talbot Workshops have focused on a wide variety of topics in homotopy theory and surrounding areas, from elliptic cohomology (2004) and Fukaya categories (2009) to non-abelian Hodge theory (2011) and solution of the Kervaire invariant problem (2016), and most recently, recent progress on Moduli Spaces of Manifolds (2019).

The equations of interest came from high energy physics where they were introduced as very symmetric models for elementary particle interactions.  Basic question to address with regards to solutions are these:  Are there finitely many or infinitely many solutions for the specific applications?  In either case, what do the solutions look like?  And what are their implications with regards to four dimensional spaces?  By way of background:  The equations are far too complicated for a computer to solve (let alone to solve by hand).  Because of this, almost all information about the solutions must be obtained via a detailed analysis of the equations themselves.  With regards to questions about four dimensional spaces, the central issue here is to understand the list of possible four dimensional spaces.  This last question is also relevant to physics by virtue of the fact that the observable universe has four dimensions--three spatial dimensions and then the time direction.  Since the equations of interest come from high energy physics theory and are close cousins to others used there and in condensed matter physics, the analysis tools developed in this project may also find applications to questions in these other fields.  There is also an important educational support aspect of this project that is meant to bring graduate students up to speed on the relevant geometry, topology and analysis.<br/><br/>The research in this prject has three primary focus points.  The first concerns the behavior of the solutions to the Kapustin-Witten equations on the product of a three-dimensional manifold and the half-line with singular boundary conditions at one end given by a knot in the three-manifold.  The goal for this focus point is to see whether non-convergent sequences of solutions have pathologies that prevent solution counting definitions of knot invariants for knots in the three dimensional manifold.  Two sources of trouble likely arise, one is a novel pathology from the boundary conditions, and the other due to the presence of Z/2 harmonic 1-forms.  The second focus point concerns the algebraic implications of the structure of the solution space for these same Kapustin-Witten equations and for the Kapustin-Witten equations on the product of the three-manifold with the line:  Can an algebraic invariant be defined from these spaces given the non-compactness issues and with the novelty of formally zero dimensional solution spaces?  The third focus point concerns the significance of the afore-mentioned Z/2 harmonic 1-forms and, more generally, Z/2 harmonic sections of a spin bundle.  Such Z/2 harmonic sections appear as renormalized limits of sequences of solutions to the Vafa-Witten equations on four dimensional manifolds and the multi-spinor Seiberg-Witten equations on manifolds of dimensions three and four.  Specific topics and questions not withstanding, the long term goal of this project is to understand the structure of smooth, four dimensional manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The deceptively simple question of when does one symplectic manifold embed inside another, and the subtle dependance of this question on quantitative parameters, has been a focal point of the subject for the last thirty years. Since Gromov's celebrated non-squeezing result, a variety of techniques drawing upon ideas in dynamical systems, toric algebraic geometry and four-dimensional gauge theory have been used to better understand such problems; yet a systematic understanding has eluded researchers thus far. The objective of the 2020 Kylerec workshop is to understand the current state of knowledge on such questions, covering both the methods researchers have developed to produce surprising symplectic embeddings, as well as the technical tools of Floer theory and embedded contact homology that have been used to provide state-of-the-art obstructions to the existence of a symplectic embedding.

The areas of the major advances are abstract: category theory is a framework for organizing different types of mathematical objects and admissible transformations between these types, while homotopy theory seeks to understand the coarse nature of shapes. The applications on the other hand include new results on the geometry and solutions of polynomial equations, important areas of research with concrete applications inside and outside of mathematics.  The present proposal will harness these advances in the areas of algebraic K-theory, which is a mysterious but powerful tool for counting mathematical objects, and arithmetic geometry, which is about the influence of geometry on the structure of solutions of polynomial equations with rational coordinates. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>The project's three main objectives are (1) to directly compare the motivic and syntomic approaches to p-adic etale K-theory by showing that if R is a smooth commutative p-local commutative ring, then the trace map from K-theory to topological cyclic homology respects the motivic and syntomic filtrations after p-completion, (2) to construct a theory of coefficient systems for p-adic cohomology using cyclotomic spectra and to verify the PI's liftability conjecture, which will help to explain the relationship between the window-frame approach to the classification of formal groups and the recent prismatic Dieudonne theory developed by Anschuetz and Le Bras, and (3) to understand the filtration on prismatic cohomology arising from the cyclotomic t-structure. Short master classes will be offered for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers that each focus on a single current issue in algebraic K-theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The transformation groups such as diffeomorphism groups and homeomorphism groups of a manifold describe all symmetries of the manifold. A manifold is a space that is locally a Euclidean space. The surface of the earth, the surface of a donut and our three or four dimensional universe are all examples of manifolds. The mapping class group is a reduced form of the homeomorphism group of a manifold, in which two transformations are identified if they can be connected by a path of transformations.  These objects have connections with many areas of mathematics, including geometric topology, geometric group theory, dynamics, number theory, quantum field theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. This project studies a number of questions about the structure of symmetries of manifolds.  Broader impacts of these efforts include reading groups for graduate students. <br/><br/>Previously, in a joint work with Kathryn Mann, the principal investigator has proved Ghys' dimension conjecture that given two manifolds M and N, if the homeomorphism group of M has a nontrivial homomorphism to the homeomorphism group of N, then the dimension of M must be less than or equal to the dimension of N. To prove this, an ""Orbit Classification Theorem"" is developed, which says that every orbit of such a homomorphism is homeomorphic to a cover of some configuration space of M. This finding has a potential to give more results about classifying homomorphisms between transformation groups. Since we have figured out all orbits, now the challenge is to understand how to glue those orbits inside the manifold N.  Another line of work studies the projection map from the transformation group to the mapping class group. In particular, we ask which subgroups of the mapping class group have sections under the projection, where the existence of sections implies that the surface bundle that the subgroup determines will admit a flat structure. In previous work on this subgroup question the principal investigator has proved several results using techniques of ""hidden torsion"" and rotation number. More tools will be developed specifically to attack this question. Another direction to explore concerns diffeomorphism groups of high dimensional manifolds, specifically, whether there is an example of an infinite torsion group that acts faithfully on some manifold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The underlying problems often arise from practical applications in the three-dimensional world we live in, but also from more theoretical considerations in mathematical physics. The project investigates a surprising connection between two very different approaches to 3-dimensional topology. The first approach is very algebraic and involves so-called quantum invariants for knotted curves in 3-dimensional spaces. The second approach is more geometric and analytic, and uses the non-euclidean geometry of the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space.  The Kashaev Volume Conjecture, experimentally verified on many examples but still without a mathematical proof guaranteeing that it holds in all cases, provides an unexpected connection between these two viewpoints. The award provides support for graduate students who will be involved in related research.<br/><br/>More precisely, the Kashaev Volume Conjecture connects the asymptotics of the colored Jones polynomial of a knot to the hyperbolic volume of its complement. This tantalizing conjecture is now 25-year old, and supported by much heuristic and experimental evidence. However, the corresponding  property has  been rigorously proved for only a very small number of cases. The goal of the project is to develop various steps in a roadmap towards a proof of the Kashaev Volume Conjecture, with a special emphasis on its analytic subtleties. As a first step, the project is focused on a closely related conjecture for surface bundles over the circle, where the combinatorics of quantum invariants are more clearly connected to the geometry of the underlying manifold. The PI and his collaborators will attack this conjecture in the even more special case of punctured torus bundles, in an effort  to be very concrete while tackling the analytic difficulties that arise in this context. The PI will then build on the experience, insights and technical expertise gathered in this first case to proceed with the next steps in the roadmap, one after the other.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This international meeting on geometric group theory is expected to have about 80-85 participants. The organizers will make a special effort to include a diverse group of graduate students and postdocs, and the program will incorporate mechanisms for encouraging their interaction with more established mathematicians. The subject of the conference can be broadly described as using geometric methods to study algebraic objects. More specifically, the idea is to study groups by realizing them as groups of symmetries of some space, then to use geometric features of the space such as curvature to draw conclusions about the group. This subject, called geometric group theory, has expanded dramatically in recent years and is now a major current in mathematics. <br/><br/>This conference will highlight the interaction between two main themes in geometric group theory: Artin groups on the one hand, and CAT(0) geometry on the other. Perhaps the most well-known examples of Artin groups are the braid groups. The study of Artin groups touches on many different fields, including low-dimensional topology, singularity theory, algebraic topology, and mathematical physics. CAT(0) spaces were introduced as a synthetic analog of non-positively curved manifolds. The symmetry groups of CAT(0) spaces turn out to have strong algebraic properties, making them an ideal tool for geometric group theory. Although Artin groups and CAT(0) geometry and their strong relationship will be the unifying theme of the conference, related topics such as Coxeter groups, three-dimensional manifolds, automorphisms of free groups, and mapping class groups will also be included in order to enrich exchanges between participants and inspire ideas for new research projects.

For example, suppose a particle is enclosed in a polygon and is traveling in a straight line, bouncing off any side it encounters. The shape of the polygon could be inferred by observing the sequences of sides encountered by the particle. The principal investigator will study the extent to which the shape of the region is determined by these observables.

(2) Probing geometric and dynamical properties of free-by-cyclic groups from the cross section of flows on 2-complexes, and pursuing a fruitful analogy with fundamental groups of surface bundles over the circle. (3) Analyzing singular Euclidean metrics on surfaces and understanding the extent to which the limited data encoded by the support of its associated Liouville current determines the geometry of the metric.

A Riemann surface gives a special way of describing such an object as the solution to a polynomial equation, much as we learn in high school algebra that some equations describe circles, others ellipses, and others far more complicated shapes. A family of Riemann surfaces arises by varying the equations used to define the Riemann surface - one can imagine ""turning a knob"" to stretch and distort the shapes of the surfaces. Families of Riemann surfaces arise in many parts of mathematics and also play an important role in theoretical physics. The principal investigator will apply tools from topology and the related discipline of geometric group theory in order to better understand some of the most important families of Riemann surfaces that mathematicians today are interested in. Broader impacts include the establishment of a new chapter of the national Directed Reading Project network.<br/><br/>The project has two components. The first will investigate the topology of strata of Abelian differentials (translation surfaces). These families have been intensively studied by dynamicists and geometers, but there are foundational topological questions that still remain. In particular, the (orbifold) fundamental groups of strata are still highly mysterious. This can be effectively probed by way of the monodromy representation, a map into the mapping class group. The principal investigator will continue his work describing these monodromy representations, and will develop new tools to understand the monodromy kernel and so further develop the theory of fundamental groups of strata. Central to this endeavor will be an elucidation of the precise relationship between Artin groups and fundamental groups of strata. The second component of this project concerns families constructed via branched covers. These families have served as an important source of examples in topology, algebraic geometry, and group theory. The principal investigator will investigate the monodromy of these families with the objective of further synthesizing the topological aspects (braid groups, mapping class groups) with the algebraic (arithmetic groups and generalizations, Burau-like representations, primitive homology).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The annual international Gokova Geometry-Topology Conferences was founded in 1992 with the purpose of creating a lively informal environment where the latest results of Geometry and Topology are discussed by active world-renowned experts and junior researchers along with enthusiastic graduate students. Many junior now-well-known mathematicians of the field got their early international exposure in these friendly conferences. These conferences aim to increase participation of junior researchers and experts from US. Gokova conferences will continue to provide a platform for exchanging ideas between American, European and Asian mathematicians in timely fashion.<br/><br/>The focus topics for each conference are  determined by the Scientific Committee during the previous year based on the major scientific breakthroughs that occur in the field, and on  availability of outstanding speakers to present them to a broad audience of geometers and topologists. The list of the topics of current interest that the organizers hope to explore via mini-courses and/or lecture series in the next few years include: C. Manolescu's solution of the triangulation conjecture (Manolescu will be giving a minicourse in 2015 meeting); Flexibility phenomena in symplectic and contact topology (Y. Eliashberg, E. Murphy, and collaborators,one of them will be  minicourse); Geometric approaches to mirror symmetry and extensions of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture (D. Auroux, K. Fukaya, M. Abouzaid, T. Ekholm); Corks, surgeries, and exotic 4-manifolds (Akbulut, Yasui, Ruberman); Refined enumerations and knot theory (Cherednik, Goettsche, Shende).
