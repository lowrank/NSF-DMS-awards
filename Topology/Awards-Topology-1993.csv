The investigators will study                        3-manifolds, using two points of view to analyze surfaces in a                  3-manifold.  The first method uses combinatorial techniques                     combined with the concept of 'thin position' of a knot.  This                   will be used to consider some old problems in knot theory, such                 as the cabling conjecture, as well as the classification problem                for Heegaard splittings of Seifert fibered spaces.  Thin position               surfaces serve as a combinatorial version of the minimax surfaces               used by Pitts-Rubinstein in their investigations of Heegaard                    splittings, and they will be used to attack problems similar to                 the recognition problem for the 3-sphere, recently solved by                    Rubinstein.  The second method uses techniques of smooth minimal                surface theory and hyperbolic geometry to investigate the                       topology of 3-manifolds.  One goal is to show that any 3-manifold               admits only a finite number of Heegaard splittings of each genus,               a result recently established for Haken manifolds by Johannson.                 Another goal is to show thatnon-Haken 3-manifolds are determined                by their fundamental groups.  Finally, the investigators will                   explore the topological consequences that follow from imposing                  curvature conditions on a manifold and its boundary.                                 The geometry of three dimensions is the geometry of the                    world we live in, so one might expect that the mathematical study               of this area would have particularly broad applications.  This is               indeed the case, and the area leads to applications in physics,                 in the study of the differential equations governing physical                   phenomena, to group theory, and to many other branches of                       mathematics.  Mathematicians study, in all dimensions, the                      geometric objects called ""manifolds,"" which have properties                     similar to those of the space we live in.  Manifolds in dimension               three exhibit unique features which make their study a                          flourishing area of current research.  The objective of this                    project is to study certain categories of these 3-manifolds, in                 pursuit of the overall goal of understanding these geometric                    objects.  Using techniques developed from studying knotted curves               and the complexity of their raveling, and from the theory of soap               films and minimal surfaces, the investigators aim to contribute                 to the classification problem for3-manifolds and to understand                  specific classes of 3-manifolds in great detail."

For instance, he is planning to study               the finiteness of Heegaard splittings of bounded genus of three-                manifolds up to homeomorphism.  Another problem he is pursuing is               the construction of functors that are similar to coupled                        topological quantum field theories using the intersection                       homology of moduli spaces of semistable holomorphic bundles with                parabolic structure over a nonsingular algebraic curve.                              Three-dimensional manifolds are very natural objects for                   topologists to study, since (ignoring time) we live in a physical               world of three dimensions.  Also dimension three is the first                   dimension where many types of rich complexity arise.  In fact, it               is a notorious and paradoxical fact that some of the difficulties               presented by three-dimensional topology disappear again in higher               dimensions.  For example, the celebrated Poincare conjecture                    about the characterization of the three-dimensional sphere                      remains as challenging as when it was first posed about the turn                of the century, while the analogous propositions in higher                      dimensions have all now been settled.  Frohman is exploring some                of these mysteries and sharpening the available tools of the                    trade."

In the course of his work on conformal field  theory, Edward Witten made several surprising observations about  the relationship between three important homology theories,  singular homology, K-theory, and elliptic cohomology.  The  general principal is that to understand the K-theory of a space,  one should understand as much as possible about the singular  homology of its free loop space, and similarly for elliptic  cohomology and K-theory.  At about the same time, Mike Hopkins  and various collaborators were showing the fundamental importance  to algebraic topology of a sequence of homology theories E-sub-n.   Their work involves a very profitable interaction between  algebraic topology and number theory.  It turns out that  E-sub-zero is close to singular homology, E-sub-one is close to  K-theory, and E-sub-two is close to elliptic homology.  Ando  outlines how certain conjectures of Witten and of Hopkins, et  al., might be closely related.  He intends to investigate these  relationships and make them more precise, in the hopes that the  advances in these two areas of research can inform each other  more directly and fruitfully.       The theme of this project, drawing connections between  deep algebraic and number theoretic theories on the one hand and  deep geometric (topological) theories on the other, is repeated  again and again in modern topology.  As the theories grow  increasingly intricate, it is only through such overall  principles of organization that mathematicians keep the structure  manageable and within the grasp of human mental powers.  The  instant project bears on one of the most fruitful recent  developments of this nature.  ***"

The refined genus retains at                least some of the properties of the rational genus (e.g.,                       modularity, integrality).  Other properties, such as rigidity,                  can be proven in special cases (e.g., for circle actions).  The                 project suggests a systematic study of the refined genus, its                   connections with Lie group theory, Riemannian geometry, and index               theory on the free loop space.

The current project  follows in this tradition, utilizing the recent work of the  principal investigator and R. Fintushel and the recent work of  Taubes, the work of Morgan, Mrowka, and Ruberman, and the work of  Kronheimer and Mrowka to determine those operations on a given  smooth 4-manifold which preserve its homeomorphism type and alter  its diffeomorphism type.  Further, exotic smooth structures will  be investigated for those manifolds which have no Donaldson  polynomials, i.e. manifolds with Euler characteristic plus  signature not divisible by 4.       The major thrust of this project is to classify smooth  simply-connected 4-manifolds, i.e. objects that are locally  modeled on 4-dimensional space.  Relativistic space-time is, of  course, the best known example of such a manifold.  Although the  precise global structure of space-time is not known, many such  manifolds can be described as solutions to systems of complex  polynomials.  Only recently have there been discovered examples  which cannot be so described, thus dashing immediate hopes of  classifying 4-manifolds.  Because of these examples, there is no  intelligent conjecture as to what form this classification might  take.  It is the fundamental purpose of the current project to  investigate these and other ""exotic 4-manifolds"" further and to  place them in a larger and less ad hoc framework.  ***"

Applications and examples illustrating how the  general theory differs from the case where G is abelian or  nilpotent have been developed and will be put into final form.   Techniques and results from Seifert fiberings will be used to  investigate space form problems for the pseudo-Riemannian  manifolds of constant curvature and their frame bundles.   Elliptic surfaces whose Euler characteristic are zero support  4-dimensional geometries.  A Teichmueller theory for these  geometries and the moduli of isometry classes will be constructed  and determined.  G. Peter Scott plans to work in three main  areas:  Firstly, he will continue his work on the topological  rigidity of 3-manifolds.  Secondly, he plans to work in the area  of 3-dimensional Poincare duality groups.  The long term aim here  is to show that any such group comes from a 3-manifold, but he  will restrict his attention to those groups which 'ought' to  correspond to Seifert fiber spaces or to Haken manifolds.   Thirdly, he plans to extend to higher dimensions his work  generating the characteristic submanifold of a 3-manifold.       Manifolds are natural geometric objects like circles  and spheres and doughnuts that can be described locally by the  same type of coordinates as a Euclidean space of the same  dimension.  Their variety and complexity increases rapidly as the  dimension increases, but some of the most intractable problems  arise already in dimensions three and four.  That we live in a  world of three dimensions, or four if time is considered, makes  this of more than purely academic interest.  Cosmologists do not  know which 3- or 4-manifold constitutes the physical universe, so  studying the possibilities that can occur has ample motivation.   These two investigators are making ingenious use of geometry and  of algebra to shed light on the question.  Their work w ill also  enrich the arsenal of tools available to others for studying  low-dimensional manifolds.  ***"

In the                past he has explored the consequences of knowing that a                         hyperbolic 3-manifold is topologically tame, i.e. homeomorphic to               the interior of a compact 3-manifold.  In particular, he studied                the spectral geometry and the dynamics of topologically tame                    hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  One application was a proof of Ahlfors'                measure conjecture for topologically tame hyperbolic 3-manifolds.               In this project he intends to study the question of which                       hyperbolic 3-manifolds are topologically tame.  The conjecture is               that every hyperbolic 3-manifold with finitely generated                        fundamental group is topologically tame.  He also intends to                    study the space of all hyperbolic structures on a given                         3-manifold.                                                                          An n-manifold is an object such that about every point there               is a neighborhood which looks like a ball in n-dimensional space.               For example, the unit sphere (in 3-dimensional space) is a                      2-manifold, since about each point there is a small neighborhood                which looks like a disk in the plane.  One natural way in which                 manifolds arise is as solution sets of equations in several                     variables.  For example, the unit sphere is the solution set of a               particularly simple equation (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1).  A metric on                a manifold M is a way of measuring distances between points on M.               A manifold may admit many different metrics.  For example, the                  unit sphere and the surface of an apple are topologically the                   same manifold, but they have different metrics.  Studying the                   types of possible metrics on a manifold has many applications in                mathematics and physics.  The investigator will study metrics on                3-manifolds such that about any point there is a small                          neighborhood which may be identified (by an identification which                preserves distances) with a ball in hyperbolic 3-space.  These                  metrics are called hyperbolic metrics.  Hyperbolic metrics on                   2-manifolds have recently been of great interest to physicists,                 in particular, to string theorists."

X is resolvable if and only if i(X)=1.                   This result, combined with a theorem of R. D. Edwards, implies                  that an n-gm X, n >= 5, is a topological manifold iff X has the                 disjoint disks property (DDP) and i(X) = 1.  Left open in the                   results of Quinn was the question of whether nonresolvable                      generalized manifolds exist.  Recently, the investigators,                      together with Steve Ferry and Shmuel Weinberger, have shown that,               given any simply connected, closed n-manifold X, n >= 6, and any                integer m = 1(mod 8), there is an n-gm X, homotopy equivalent to                M, with i(X) = m.  The discovery of these examples raises several               questions about the topology of generalized manifolds and these                 questions form the basis of this project.  The ultimate purpose                 is to understand the general classification scheme of generalized               manifolds in high dimensions with the immediate goal of                         discovering to what extent these spaces behave like real                        manifolds.                                                                           A topological manifold of dimension n, or n-manifold, is a                 geometric object that looks locally like euclidean space of                     dimension n.  Thus, scientific phenomena modeled on these spaces                can be expressed and analyzed, using local coordinate systems.                  One of the central problems of geometric topology has been to                   prescribe a ""topological characterization"" of (locally) euclidean               spaces.  By this we mean a list of properties that a topologist                 could use to check whether or not a given space is a manifold.                  Characterizations of manifolds of dimension one or two have been                known for a long time, but higher dimensional characterization                  schemes have proved to be elusive to formulate and verify.  A                   characterization of manifolds of dimension greater than four was                conjectured by James Cannon in an address to the 1978                           International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki.  Frank                    Quinn discovered that Cannon's criteria would yield a solution to               the problem,                                                                    provided that an additional integer invariant is zero.  Recently,               the proposers, along with Steve Ferry and Shmuel Weinberger,                    found a large class of geometric objects of dimension greater                   than five that satisfy Cannon's criteria, but have non-zero Quinn               invariant.  There is evidence that these new spaces should be                   incorporated in the class of manifolds and a common theory                      developed.  The investigators intend to study the foundational                  aspects of the theory and its potential applications.  As an                    example, among other things, they plan to relate these                          ""generalized manifolds"" to the study of dynamics on manifolds by                showing that they may play the role of axis of symmetry of                      motions in space."

Culler and                      Shalen's ongoing program for obtaining lower bounds for volumes                 of hyperbolic manifolds is in large measure an application of                   qualitative results from topology to quantitative estimates in                  geometry.  Their program for the Property P conjecture would be                 likely to exploit K-theory and arithmetic geometry in attacking a               problem from the topological theory of 3-manifolds.  Culler's                   project of implementing Manin's program by means of Thurston's                  theory of pleated surfaces is a way of using synthetic hyperbolic               geometry to obtain insight into number theory.  Finally, Shalen's               project involving fundamental groups of 2-complexes lies in the                 domain of geometric and combinatorial group theory but is                       motivated in part by the prospect of applications to the study of               discrete subgroups of algebraic groups and Kac-Moody groups.                         Three-dimensional manifolds are the mathematical models of                 our physical universe.  While the cosmological question of                      whether our universe is finite may be unresolved, it is certain                 that the study of finite-volume 3-manifolds is of fundamental                   importance in understanding the physical universe.  The                         quantitative estimates obtained by Culler and Shalen may be                     regarded as being mathematical analogues of measurements of                     fundamental physical constants, such as the speed of light.  The                geometry, as well as the topology, of the universe is important                 in physics.  While the non-euclidean geometries may have been                   considered curiosities in the nineteenth century, the development               of general relativity shows that negatively curved spaces, such                 as hyperbolic 3-manifolds, are the appropriate models for the                   universe.  Recent mathematical research has shown that they are                 ubiquitous and mathematically rich as well.  The research                       proposed here is aimed at expanding our understanding                           of these important spaces."

In the generic case, the knot or link complement will  have a hyperbolic structure, which persists under most surgeries.   This persistence fails if (and only if, modulo the Geometrization  Conjecture) the resulting 3-manifold contains an essential sphere  or torus, or is Seifert fibred.  This project is to continue a  joint program with Professor John Luecke of understanding and  circumscribing these exceptional surgeries via the combinatorial  analysis of intersections of surfaces.  Results obtained so far  include the Knot Complement Conjecture, the Reducibility  Conjecture, and strong restrictions on the creation of essential  tori.  Specific foci of the project will include the Cabling  Conjecture and the question of when Seifert fibred spaces (both  toroidal and atoroidal) arise.       The general context of the project is the attempt to further  our understanding of 3-manifolds.  A 3-manifold is a ""space""  which is locally like ordinary 3-dimensional Euclidean space, but  whose global topological structure may be quite complicated.  For  example, our universe is a 3-manifold, whose global structure is  at present unknown.  The problem of describing all 3-manifolds in  a reasonable way is an important one that is still unsolved,  although much progress has been made.  The subject is a rich one,  which draws on a wide range of mathematical techniques, including  some derived from quantum physics.  The main focus of the project  is Dehn surgery, which is a procedure for constructing  3-manifolds from a knot (i.e. a closed loop embedded somehow in  3-dimensional Euclidean space) or, more generally, a link (i.e.  several knots linked together).  Roughly speaking, the knot or  link is removed and ""sewn back"" differently.  Since it turns out  that all 3-manifolds can be constructed in this way, a  sufficiently good understanding of Dehn surgery wou ld have  important implications for the general theory of 3-manifolds.  ***"

Smooth 4-manifolds are spaces which                are locally diffeomorphic to Euclidean 4-space.  Symplectic                     manifolds are endowed with additional structure which keeps track               of areas and volumes.  For both types of 4-manifolds, the most                  basic questions of existence and uniqueness are still poorly                    understood; it is these questions which the project addresses.                  Traditionally, these two types of objects have been studied by                  rather different methods, but the principal investigator's                      research to date shows that much can be gained from a unified                   approach.  In fact, he has solved major problems in both fields                 by simple ""cut-and-paste"" constructions (log transforms and                     connected sums along surfaces). He intends to apply these and                   related techniques to produce even better examples (for example,                simply connected, irreducible symplectic 4-manifolds with small                 second betti numbers).  These, and other examples which the                     principal investigator has already produced, should be detectable               by means of gauge theory.  Other examples which might be produced               (such as a simply connected, symplectic, non-Kaehler 6-manifold,                or a symplectic 4-manifold which splits as a connected sum of                   indefinite pieces) could be detected by elementary means.                            Smooth manifolds of dimension 4 are presently the least                    understood manifolds of any dimension.  Only in the last decade                 has substantial progress been made in understanding the possible                shapes of these objects.  This is particularly ironic in that our               own universe is an example of a 4-dimensional manifold.                         Symplectic manifolds have also come under intense study recently.               These objects first appeared in connection with classical                       mechanics, the physics of macroscopic objects such as mechanical                systems and orbiting satellites.  Subsequently, they have turned                out to play a deep role in quantum physics, so they are of great                interest to physicists who are attempting to understand the                     fundamental forces of nature.  Symplectic manifolds are also of                 interest to pure mathematicians because of their appearance in                  such diverse fields as algebraic geometry, gauge theory and Lie                 group theory.  It is the principal investigator's belief that                   there are deep and largely unexplored connections between the                   theories of symplectic manifolds and smooth 4-manifolds.  The                   instant research project is to exploit these connections to                     illuminate both theories."

Some of the problems are designed to expand the uses of the                     methods of boundedly controlled topology by applying them to                    problems in other areas, while others lie entirely within the                   domain of boundedly controlled topology itself.  Attempts to                    expand the scope of the methods are intended to demonstrate their               relevance and clarify their limitations and may expose additional               questions within the subject which need to be addressed.  The                   problems within the area itself represent extensions of research                already done by Anderson and H. J. Munkholm of Odense, Denmark.                 The objectives are to understand more clearly the exact                         relationship between this part of topology and the versions of                  controlled topology introduced by such other researchers as T. A.               Chapman, S. C. Ferry, and F. S.

Topology is the study of properties of geometric objects                   which are not destroyed by continuous transformations, such                     properties as connectedness, knottedness, and so forth.                         Topological properties are as basic and ubiquitous as the more                  familiar geometric properties of length and area, but they call                 for entirely different techniques to deal with them.  By now the                topology of high dimensions has been intensively developed, and                 the array of techniques available is quite extensive.  From time                to time in the development of a subject, it becomes necessary to                organize its methods to make them more readily available to                     others and easier to pass on to future generations which will                   wish to use them without having been directly involved in their                 invention.  Such a time has arisen in high dimensional topology,                and the boundedly controlled approach is a natural codifying                    principle that is proving useful in making order in the toolbox,                so to speak."

The main progress under prior support was               achieved in 3-dimensional contact geometry, construction of new                 invariants of high-dimensional closed and open contact manifolds,               in the description of invariant properties of boundaries of                     symplectic manifolds, and in the application of symplectic                      methods to the theory of 2-knots in real 4-space.  In the present               continuation, several new areas of research are suggested.  In                  particular, there is the study of newly discovered connections                  between symplectic geometry, pseudoisotopy theory and algebraic                 K-theory, applications of Lagrangian intersection theory to Morse               theory for plurisubharmonic functions on complex manifolds, and                 the development and application of contact homology theory.

It seems that in modern mathematics interdisciplinary                      research plays a very special and important role.  Many recent                  discoveries were made in areas which do not fit into any                        traditional classification.  For instance, a breakthrough in                    4-dimensional topology by Donaldson came from gauge theory, a                   topic in quantum physics, and many other recent topological                     discoveries were motivated by physics.  Symplectic topology at                  present is a beautiful blend of different mathematical sciences:                topology, Hamiltonian dynamics, complex analysis, differential                  geometry, etc.  It attracts more and more ideas from different                  fields and repays them with unexpected new applications, which                  makes research in this direction especially promising."

This work will lead to a new  interpretation of polylogarithms in terms of multicategories.

(1) Edgar H. Brown, Jr. will continue his                  applications of the machinery developed in ""Continuous Cohomology               and Real Homotopy Theory"" to mod p homotopy theory, classifying                 spaces of foliations, and real homotopy type of Kaehler                         manifolds.  (2) Kiyoshi Igusa will study the relationship between               the higher Reidemeister torsion invariants (algebraic K-theory                  invariants associated to the diffeomorphism space of a smooth                   manifold) and the simpler cyclic homology groups associated to                  circle bundles.  In particular, he has a plan to prove a                        complexified version of a theorem of Bokstedt, which if proved                  would give an explicit realization of these difficult invariants.               The methods he will use are Morse theory, algebraic K-theory, and               cyclic homology.  (3) Jerome P. Levine will work on a direct                    topological description of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer rho-invariant               of an odd-dimensional manifold, and determining when it is a                    homotopy invariant.  In particular, he has a conjectured formula                for the jump along a path of representations.  He is also                       investigating the possible use of the algebraic version of the                  rho-invariant (a multisignature) to determine the torsion-free                  part of the homology concordance surgery group (Gamma-group) of                 Cappell-Shaneson.  He will continue to study the ""algebraic                     closure"" construction in group theory, particularly in its                      application to link concordance questions.  Several geometric                   questions reduce to purely algebraic questions about the                        algebraic closure of the free group.  (4) Daniel Ruberman will                  treat a number of problems in gauge theory related to the                       topology of low dimensional manifolds.  One main aspect of the                  work is the further development of gauge theory on 4-manifolds                  with boundary, via the moduli space of finite energy                            anti-self-dual connections.  Applications include obstructions to               the representation of homology classes by surfaces of low genus                 as well as a new knot cobordism invariant.  The project also                    includes a study of gauge-theoretic invariants of connections on                3-manifolds, and the relation of such invariants to the topology                of the space of flat SU(2) connections.  These invariants lead to               potentially new obstructions to a group's being the fundamental                 group of a 3-manifold.                                                               These various projects concern the topology and geometry of                manifolds, which are spaces locally resembling the familiar                     Euclidean spaces.  Three and four-dimensional manifolds provide                 models for the physical world of space and time, while manifolds                of higher dimension arise naturally as the parameter spaces for                 complicated systems involving many variables.  The fundamental                  problems about such spaces include their classification in terms                of numerical and algebraic invariants, the classification of                    their symmetries (or diffeomorphisms) and the determination of                  how one space may sit inside another (as a knotted curve sits                   inside of 3-dimensional space).  Brown is perfecting some of the                algebraic machinery required.  Igusa's part of the project                      studies ways in which complicated families of symmetries may be                 understood in terms of algebraic invariants derived from                        corresponding families of matrices.  Levine is investigating the                interpretation in topology of an analytically defined invariant,                as well its uses in the theory of knots.  Ruberman will use the                 Yang-Mills equations of mathematical physics to understand the                  nature of four-dimensional manifolds and the two-dimensional                    surfaces which they contain."

The main focus will be on modern homotopy theory.  The conference  will be accessible to graduate students and other young scientists  in this field.  Members of traditionally underrepresented groups  will be encouraged to attend.  It will represent an important  opportunity for all to meet with the leaders in the subject.  The  main topics will be two areas which have experienced spectacular  growth over the past few years: the chromatic perspective on stable  homotopy theory (the telescope conjecture, Picard groups,  axiomatics of structured ring spectra), and unstable homotopy  theory (localizations, finite loop spaces, loop spaces of finite  complexes, algebraic homotopy theory).       Topology concerns itself with aspects of geometric spaces and  structures which remain unchanged by continuous transformations.   Dimension, connectedness (being all in one piece), the properties  of being knotted or linked, and many more, all are subjects of  topological study, for they are preserved so long as cutting or  tearing are not permitted despite quite drastic alteration of shape  and size.  It is clear that these are fundamental and significant  properties but that their study requires different tools from those  of ordinary analytic geometry to make them manageable and a subject  for calculation.  Algebraic topology is devoted to developing,  understanding, and applying these tools, and homotopy is one of the  most powerful and complex tools in the arsenal.  ***"

The most pressing               of these concern the nonresolvable homology manifolds discovered                by the investigator, J. Bryant, W. Mio, and S. Weinberger.                      Simply put, he wishes to study these spaces and see to what                     extent the classical theory of manifolds carries over to this new               category of spaces.  This study is closely related to the                       well-known Borel and Bing-Borsuk Conjectures.  Other problems                   involved include applications of controlled Gamma-surgery to the                study of topological embeddings in codimension two, the Borel and               integral Novikov Conjectures for certain classes of groups, and                 applications of controlled topology to differential geometry.                        There are a number of potential applications for this work.                The new spaces being studied have the global properties of                      manifolds modelled on euclidean space, but have very different                  small-scale properties.  Such spaces could be of interest to                    workers trying to reconcile large-scale and small-scale models of               the universe.  The Borel and Novikov Conjectures are conjectures                involving the rigidity of certain classes of manifolds.  Typical                results say that manifolds which are ""close together"" in some                   topological sense are the same.  This appears to be a naturally                 occurring instance of quantization in geometry and topology."

Specifically, Bestvina intends to continue working with R. D.                   Edwards on the Hilbert-Smith Conjecture, a classical conjecture                 on the topology of manifolds, and on a program of research                      related to the dynamics of group actions on R-trees.  The notion                of an R-tree, i.e. a tree-like space modelled on the real                       numbers, has developed into a powerful research tool in topology                and group theory in recent years.  Understanding R-trees will                   lead to a deeper understanding of the degeneration of the                       universal cover of a negatively curved space.  Certain phenomena                first discovered in 3-dimensional manifolds, in particular, the                 characteristic submanifold, the classification of surface                       homeomorphisms, and the role of measured laminations, have a                    wider significance in light of this new theory, as has become                   clear through the work of Gromov, Rips, and many others.  Mess                  intends to work on various problems about discrete and geometric                structures, especially in connection with 3-manifolds.  Work in                 this area over the past decade has made clear the power of                      geometric analysis in developing new insights.  With this in                    mind, Mess seeks to understand more about the deformations of                   geometric structures by means of laminations, and to understand                 uniformly quasisymmetric groups.                                                     The group of symmetries of an object plays an important role               in an attempt to understand the object.  Conversely, abstract                   groups often arise as groups of symmetries of a space.  In the                  cases this project deals with, the spaces have fractal nature,                  which makes for a fascinating interplay between the fractal                     geometry of the spaces and the properties of the groups.                        (Fractal geometry is characterized by the repetition of similar                 structures on ever smaller scales in an infinite recession.  It                 is a notion that has come into its own in recent years as a                     natural theoretical construct for a computer to model, and, as a                practical matter, it has enabled computer graphics to depict                    unusually realistic mountains, clouds, etc. from remarkably                     simple programs.)"

The first one is the  theory of mixed motives.  This, yet conjectural, theory is aimed  to unfold the hidden topological pattern of arithmetic geometry.   It helps to explain various phenomena in K-theory and the theory  of algebraic cycles and to provide information about the values  of the special functions of arithmetic origin.  Several results  in that direction have already been obtained, e.g., in a joint  paper with P. Deligne, a proof of part of D. Zagier's conjecture  on the values of the polylogarithm function.  At the moment, the  problem of the actual construction of the category of mixed  motives (at least modulo Grothendieck's Standard Conjectures)  seems to be quite tractable.  The second subject of the project  is the study of the geometry of conformal field theory.  This  theory has been developing rapidly during the last decade.  The  investigator's first modest aim was to write down (jointly with  B. Feigin and B. Mazur) an account of an algebro-geometric  setting.  The next thing to pursue (work in progress with V.  Drinfeld and V. Ginzburg) is a theory, as foreseen by Drinfeld,  relating the representations of Kac-Moody algebras at the  critical level with the geometric version of Langlands'  correspondence.  The ultimate aim of the project is to tie  together the two subjects above, which remains a tantalizing  hope.       The two subjects of this project, conformal field theory and  the theory of motives, have somewhat different origins.   Conformal field theory came first to physics approximately ten  years ago.  It was observed there that often objects at the  critical temperature (the melting ice cube in your glass)  suddenly acquire infinitely greater inner symmetry than before;  this symmetry governs the intricate pattern that singles out the  object.  The mathematical structures that described this soon  became - after the string theory upheaval - the most popular  structures of theoretical physics, a dev elopment that also helped  to connect previously unrelated but intensively studied  mathematical areas such as representation theory of  infinite-dimensional groups, geometry of moduli spaces, and the  Langlands' program.  The first part of this project dwells here.   The theory of motives, discovered by Grothendieck in the  mid-60's, has, in a sense, a similar flavor.  It starts with an  old insight that number theory suggests that one consider the  whole numbers as if they were functions on a certain complicated  space.  This space, with its inner symmetries, replaces the  ordinary geometric notion of a point; morally, the ordinary  geometry acquires an extra arithmetic dimension.  The theory of  motives studies such a geometry.  As an application, it may  provide a range of yet unpredictable results about the values of  the classical arithmetic functions.  ***"

This expression is given in terms of orbital  integrals, volumes of stabilizer groups, and characters of  discrete series representations.  Arthur's formula will be  rederived (in this joint project with R. MacPherson of M.I.T.) by  interpreting it as the Lefschetz fixed point formula for the  action of the Hecke correspondence on the weighted cohomology of  the reductive Borel-Serre compactification of Y.  This  interpretation will be used (a) to extend Arthur's formula to  include the case of the ordinary cohomology, (b) to derive a  similar expression for the alternating sum of traces on the Hodge  components of the cohomology, and (c) to conjecture a related  expression which should be valid for Shimura varieties defined  over fields of characteristic p > 0.       During the 1970's, R. Langlands (of the Institute for  Advanced Study in Princeton) outlined a series of conjectures and  ideas of enormous scope and depth which, when fully explored and  verified, will result in a ""grand unification"" of several  branches of mathematics, including number theory, representation  theory of Lie groups, and harmonic analysis.  During the last  twenty years enormous progress has been made on this program and  very difficult obstacles have been overcome.  Nevertheless, it is  commonly believed that it may take another fifty years (or more)  before Langlands' ideas are fully explored.  The present project  concerns a newly discovered geometric and topological  interpretation and proof of the ""trace formula,"" one of the basic  tools in the subject.  Using this interpretation, the trace  formula has been generalized and refined to the point where it  may be applied to the central objects of interest (namely, Hecke  correspondences on Shimura varieties).  Although these geometric  techniques have b een developed primarily to carry out this step  in Langlands' program, they have already been applied to problems  in other areas of mathematics.  ***"

Here the investigators have recently               begun the development of a new three-dimensional model for                      automorphisms of free groups, refining the standard model, which                is essentially one-dimensional.

Free groups are the least                          constrained types of groups, from which all other groups are                    obtained by adding special relations.  Hence the study of the                   symmetries, or automorphisms, of free groups has a particular                   significance for group theory.  Manifolds are the global                        mathematical models of the universe we live in.  Recent                         developments in theoretical physics, such as string theory, show                that one should not confine one's attention just to three                       dimensions or even the four dimensions of space-time; more                      dimensions often provide a more accurate model, even if we cannot               see them with our eyes."
