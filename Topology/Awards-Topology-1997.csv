Most of this work will be in the context of quantum groups, quantum topological invariants, and finite-type invariants of 3-manifolds.  The conjecture that the Jones polynomial distinguishes the unknot is one example of a problem that motivates this work.  Another example is the conjecture that no Vassiliev invariant distinguishes a knot from its reverse. This research involves the investigation of connections between topology, enumeration, and quantum mechanics.  Topology is the study of how objects such as knots and surfaces are connected to themselves; although it was first established firmly as a field of mathematics a century ago, it has seen major advances in the past 30 years due to contributions from many areas of mathematics and physics.  Enumeration is the art of counting things, such as how many way that there are to tile a square tray with dominos; it is related to the thermal properties of materials and other questions in physics.  Quantum mechanics is a famous subject, but it is less well known that it has had an enormous influence in mathematics; it has partly redefined our conception of geometry and mathematical spaces.  These three areas saw a confluence in the 1980's, culminating in the Fields medals awarded to Vaughan Jones, Vladimir Drinfeld, and Edward Witten.  The hope is to extend the work of these and other mathematicians and physicists."

The long-term goal is to make progress in  solving the long-standing problem of R. Kirby about the existence of elements  of order two in this group carrying the Rohlin invariant.  The investigator  concentrates his attention at the elements represented by the links of  algebraic singularities, in particular, Seifert fibered homology spheres.  His approach is based on application of the methods of modern gauge theory to  investigation of the invariant introduced in the 70's by W. Neumann and L.  Siebenmann for the so-called graph homology 3-spheres.  This application is  threefold.  First, he uses some special resolutions of singularities to  construct a 4-cobordism of an algebraic link with the prescribed intersection  form, and he then applies the gauge-theoretical results which prohibit  certain integral bilinear forms as intersection forms of such a resolution if  the link bounds a homology ball.  The result of this investigation is further  applied to show that Rohlin invariant one algebraic links cannot have order  two in the homology cobordism group.  Second, the investigator uses the  instanton Floer homology to introduce a new invariant for arbitrary homology  3-spheres, and he proves that it agrees with the invariant of Neumann and  Siebenmann when the latter is defined (graph manifolds).  This result also  gives new insights into Floer homology, in particular, answers positively  M. Atiyah's question whether there is a Milnor fiber description of Floer  homology of certain algebraic links, and whether it is related to the complex  conjugation action on the homology of the Milnor fiber.  Finally, the  investigator applies his new invariant to investigate Kirby's problem for  general homology spheres.  The first step in this direction is to prove that  his invariant should vanish on all hom ology 3-spheres that bound a homology  ball with just one 1-handle (and a 0- and 2-handle).  His technique is to use  the Floer exact triangle to keep track of the Floer homology along the  cobordism.       One of the central objects of investigation in both mathematics and  theoretical physics is a smooth n-dimensional manifold.  Although this object  looks locally like an n-dimensional Euclidean space, its global structure may  still be very rich and complicated.  Most major results about 2-dimensional  manifolds were obtained in the 19th century.  Manifolds in dimensions greater  than or equal to 5 were successfully classified in the 1960's.  Though some  major questions about 3-manifolds remain unanswered, it is manifolds of  dimension 4, the dimension of relativity theory, that occupy the most special  place in the manifold hierarchy.  On the one hand, they are not ""big enough""   to apply to them the arguments that proved to be so useful in higher  dimensions.  On the other hand, their dimension is too big to apply more  intuitive methods that work effectively in lower dimensions.  Progress has  been slow here for a few decades until recent developments that involved the  application of ideas from the physics of gauge theories.  The main results  are due to S. Donaldson, who initiated the whole program in the early 1980's,  and most recently to N. Seiberg and E. Witten.  The gauge-theoretical  approach proved to be very fruitful and led to the solution of many hard  problems.  The investigator is applying these modern methods to make progress  on yet another long-standing problem in topology, the structure of the  homology cobordism group of homology 3-spheres, which would provide new  insight into manifold structure.  ***"

Already the investigator,  jointly with R. Stern, has accomplished this for the Alexander polynomial.  Any symmetric Laurent polynomial P(t) with absolute value of P(1)=1 occurs  as the Alexander polynomial of some knot in the 3-sphere.  For  example, R. Stern and the principal investigator have constructed a  family of distinct 4-manifolds, each homeomorphic to the K3-surface,  constructed from knots, and distinguished by the fact that their  Seiberg-Witten invariants are the Alexander polynomials of the knots.  There are other knot invariants that should correspond to other  constructions.  A related issue is the geography problem for simply  connected irreducible 4-manifolds.  Each such manifold can be assigned  a lattice point in the plane corresponding to its characteristic  numbers.  The problem is to study which points are realized.  There  has been notable progress, but much work still remains, and the  principal investigator plans to seek new methods for constructing  irreducible simply connected 4-manifolds of positive signature.  He  and R. Stern also conjecture a replacement for the Noether  inequality for certain symplectic 4-manifolds that generalize the  notion of `general type'.  The investigator has a promising  technique for its proof, which he plans to pursue.       The theory of smooth 4-manifolds gains its importance both from  its central location between low and high-dimensional topology, and  from its close interaction with high energy physics.  The major  problem in this field is the classification of smooth simply connected  4-manifolds.  The interaction between topology and physics has  stimulated the construction of invariants - at first Donaldson's  invariant, and then the invariant of Seiberg and Witten - tha t are  useful in distinguishing the (diffeomorphism) types of 4-manifolds.  These have led to major advances in the classification problem.  Specifically, researchers who have constructed possibly new families  of 4-manifolds can use these invariants to confirm that their phenomena  are indeed `new'.  Recent years have given rise to simply connected  (irreducible) smooth 4-manifolds that admit no complex structure (even  up to homotopy), then to those that admit no symplectic structure.  These examples have confused the issue of classification to the point  that we are left without even a conjectural classification, but they  have also invigorated the theory and reinforced its richness.  ***"

As is well known, they are deeply related, and  also related to the combinatorial structure of complexes of curves of  surfaces.  The investigator, Nikolai Ivanov, has successfully exploited  these interrelations in the past, and intends to continue this line of  research.  First, he is planning to explore the possibility that the  mapping class groups are quasi-isometrically rigid, guided by the  analogy between mapping class groups and arithmetic groups and recent  results about arithmetic groups due to R. Schwartz, B. Farb, A. Eskin,  B. Kleiner and B. Leeb.  Another part of the project is concerned with  the structure of subgroups of the mapping class groups normally  generated by pseudo-Anosov elements.  The hope is that the  Teichmueller spaces are ""sufficiently hyperbolic"" (as evidenced by the  recent theorem of H. Masur and Y. Minsky about hyperbolicity of  complexes of curves) in order for such subgroups to exist in  abundance.  Finally, the investigator is planning to explore two more  recent geometric structures on Teichmueller spaces, namely, the  Thurston semi-metric and the Kerckhoff geometry.  In particular, he  is planning to find all automorphisms of these structures.       The global study of surfaces and of various geometric structures  on them goes back to the last century, with the foundations laid down  by Gauss, Moebius, and Riemann.  The mapping class groups encode all  possible symmetries of surfaces, while Teichmueller spaces collect  together all possible geometric structures of a particular sort on a  surface.  It turns out that these two aspects of the theory of  surfaces are deeply interrelated, and the project focuses on several  aspects of this relationship.  In the last decade, the theory of  surfaces acquired an additional significance as a result of a promising  physical ""theory of everything ,"" namely the so-called string theory.  In this theory, the elementary constituents of matter are not  point-like particles, but rather collections of loops (""strings"")  sweeping a surface during their motion.  It turns out that both  various geometric structures on surfaces, as well as their symmetries,  are of fundamental importance here.  ***"

The  classification of 2-dimensional manifolds provides a model of the kind  of classification sought for 3-manifolds.  A crucial step in the  classification problem was completed by J. H. Rubinstein in 1992, when  he described an algorithm to decide if a given 3-manifold was  homeomorphic to the 3-sphere, the ""simplest"" 3-manifold.  His  arguments used minimal surface theory in the context of a triangulated  3-manifold.  There is a deep connection between this type of minimal  surface theory and the notion of thin position for knots in the  3-sphere, an idea introduced by D. Gabai.  This interplay between  standard knot theory and minimal surface theory provides significant  new techniques to explore outstanding problems.  This project explores  two particular applications of these techniques.  The first is the  extension of the standard 1-parameter idea of thin position for a knot  to multi-parameter families.  These extensions are used to approach  some long-standing problems in knot theory.  Connections between  multi-parameter thin position and other well-known invariants, such as  the energy of a knot, another notion of efficient imbedding, are also  described.  The second application is to a new type of irreducibility  for Heegaard splittings that divides splittings into two groups, one  of which is atoroidal.  The techniques will be used to seek injective  immersed surfaces in one group and negatively curved metrics in the  other.       People originally thought the earth was flat.  This was a reasonable  hypothesis, arrived at by considering the local information available  at the time.  Similarly, by considering the local information  available to us, we might hypothesize that the spatial universe we  live in is 3-dimensional Euclidean space.  Evidence from physics makes  th is unlikely.  The question then is, what is the 3-dimensional shape  of the universe we live in?  Is it the 3-dimensional analog of the  sphere?  Perhaps -- but here we encounter a deep mathematical problem.  Unlike 2-dimensional spaces, which are well-understood, there is no  list of all 3-dimensional spaces.  So we don't even understand what  the possibilities are for the shape of the 3-dimensional universe.  Perhaps the most important problem in low-dimensional topology today  is to find such a list.  This project uses the interplay between new  minimization techniques from piecewise linear geometry and knot theory  to explore aspects of this problem.  ***"

The central problem of the program is to determine whether every plane continuum that does not separate the plane has the fixed-point property .  R. H. Bing called this the most interesting problem in plane topology.  Aside from providing a beautiful generalization to Brouwer's theorem, a solution to this problem would represent the final step in a historical research effort that has involved many of our brightest mathematicians;  P. Alexandroff, R. H. Bing, K. Borsuk, and K. Kuratowski are among the international giants who have worked extensively on this famous problem.  Through the years a list of related problems has been developed, each of which has taken on a significance of its own.  Recently, the PI has solved two of these problems, establishing the fixed-point property for every simply-connected plane continuum and proving that every deformation of a tree-like continuum has a fixed point.  The techniques developed should lead to further advances in this program.    Topology is the study of properties that persist when geometric objects are bent, folded, shrunk, stretched, turned, twisted, or in any other way continuously transformed.  For example, when points are marked on a rubber band and it is stretched, the order in which the points appear does not change.  Other topological facts are more subtle.  Among these are the fixed-point theorems, results about points that remain in their original position after an object has been transformed.  Consider a cup of coffee that has been stirred (but not whipped) so that the surface of the liquid remains on top.  The Brouwer fixed-point theorem tells us that when the liquid stops moving, some point on the surface will be in the same place that it was before we started stirring.  There are a wide variety of interesting applications of this theorem in the literature.  It has been used to prove a well-known theorem on the existence of roots of  complex polynomials, the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, as well as the existence of equilibrium points in an economy.  Fixed points of deformations also appear in a variety of scientific applications.  For example, in electromagnetic-wave theory, they are used to show that there are no isotropic antennas       and explain why most magnetic plasma containers are tori instead of spheres.  This project will deal with generalizations of this theorem."

He further plans to complete writing  his work on the structure of sets of solutions to systems of equations  in a free group, and on families of such systems depending on a set of  defining parameters.  This work is based on borrowing notions and  ideas from algebraic geometry and low dimensional topology and  implementing them in group theory.       Sela and E. Rips (Hebrew University) are engaged in a  long-standing investigation of fundamental algebraic structures known  as ``groups,'' structures which abstract and capture the essence of  symmetry.  One of three key problem of the field is the isomorphism  problem, the problem of telling when two groups, presented  differently, are really the same.  It is known that there can be no  general recipe for solving this problem, one that will work for a  completely arbitrary pair of groups.  For this reason, recipes have  been sought that work within large classes of interesting groups, and  Sela is closing in on such a recipe for the class of (Gromov)  hyperbolic groups, groups whose interest derives from being attached  to geometric objects known as manifolds, both arbitrary manifolds of  dimension three and negatively curved ones of any dimension.  The  ideas and techniques evolved in this work have led to other questions  and to unexpected answers, all bearing on the deep and intimate  connection between the algebra of groups and the geometry of  manifolds.  During the last year, Sela has developed a geometric  approach to sets of solutions of equations in a so-called free group.  The approach borrows heavily from algebraic geometry.  More recently  he has pushed this geometric approach further in order to study indexed  families of sets of solutions of equations in groups.  Sela and Rips  now expect that the structure theory they have developed will find  many  applications in group theory and in mathematical logic.  In  particular, they believe that the tools they have in hand will provide  positive answers to several questions posed by the logician Alfred  Tarski around 1950.  Since their techniques borrow heavily from low  dimensional topology, they hope that their structure theory will also  find applications to basic questions in low-d topology.  ***"

The set of representations into a finite group of the commutator subgroup of an oriented knot group or the augementation subgroup of an oriented link group has the structure of a shift of finite type, a special type of dynamical system that can be completely described by a finite graph. The set of representations into a finite abelian group of the commutator subgroup of an oriented link group is a higher dimensional shift of finite type. Dynamical invariants of the shift such as topological entropy, directional entropy and the zeta function produce new, computable knot invariants, and give useful information about branched cyclic covering spaces. Elementary and effective obstructions to conjugacy for free group automorphisms result as a byproduct. The project will expand the investigators' previous work, using these new techniques to address several open questions in knot theory. DNA, solar plasma filaments and garden hoses have a common feature: each exhibits knotting and linking.  The mathematical theory of knots and links began in the mid-nineteenth century, and today its importance is recognized in diverse areas of physics, chemistry, biology and engineering. Until recently, the methods employed in this field have come from topology and algebra.  The two principal investigators have discovered tools from the field of symbolic dynamics that are novel and effective for studying knots and links.  Symbolic dynamics, which studies arrays of data, is central to information and communication theory and has important applications in the analysis of chaotic systems and the science of materials.

First, let G = SL(n,R), let Gamma  be an arithmetic subgroup of G, and let X be the symmetric space for G.  The spaces X/Gamma are one setting where automorphic forms can be  defined; they provide a topological approach to parts of the Langlands  conjectures.  For each Hecke operator T on the cohomology of X/Gamma,  MacPherson and McConnell have defined a cell complex W(T) which allows  one to find the operator by cellular techniques, i.e., using only a  finite amount of combinatorial data.  They will investigate W(T) and  extend the definition to more G.  In the second part, Ash and  McConnell are computing the cohomology of X/Gamma in degree five for  certain Gamma for SL(4).  The goal is to determine the cuspidal  classes and the Hecke action on them.  The third part concerns  Sheafhom, a suite of computer programs McConnell has developed.  Sheafhom provides models of chain complexes, spectral sequences,  sheaves, and other objects.  The largest application to date is its  algorithm for finding the intersection homology (IH) of toric  varieties in any perversity.  One goal is to compute the intersection  product on IH of toric varieties, with applications to convex  polytopes.  Sheafhom has also been used in the Ash-McConnell work.       A computer algebra system is a program for calculation with  algebra, as opposed to numbers.  Any program can find 2 + 2, but a  computer algebra system combines whole formulas: the input  (2x + 7) + (4x - 3) becomes 6x + 4 automatically.  This capacity is  more abstract, hence more flexible.  Excellent general-purpose systems,  like Maple or Mathematica, are available, but of course they don't have  everything that every mathematician needs.  In recent years, several  disciplines have been given their own special-purpose systems--  Cayley/Magma for algebraists, Pari for number theorists, and a dozen  others.  McConnell has written Sheafhom, a computer algebra system for  algebraic topology.  The program,  some 10,000 lines long, is written  in Lisp, one of the liveliest (and most efficient) programming  languages.  The goal is to apply Sheafhom to study convex polytopes.  Convex polyhedra are solid bodies with flat faces, like cubes, pyramids,  or hundred-faced diamonds.  A convex polytope is the same kind of body  in the fourth or higher dimension.  Since 1980, algebraic geometry has  become a major tool for studying polytopes.  This is surprising,  because algebraic geometry includes some of the most abstract  mathematics known, while polytopes, like crystals, are very concrete  objects.  Sheafhom will make possible some difficult computations in  algebraic topology and geometry; these will advance our understanding  of convex polytopes.  McConnell's project actually has two other  parts that are more loosely related to Sheafhom.  These are connected  with the Langlands conjectures, a very deep set of ideas that relates  number theory to other, more geometric parts of mathematics.  ***"

Efficient  triangulations lead to combinatorial methods that yield results  analogous to those obtained when a 3-manifold is known to have a rich  geometry (hyperbolic structure).  All 3-manifolds admit  triangulations, those which are least understood are precisely the  class which admit efficient triangulations; hence, this project  provides new methods to study the least understood cases of  3-manifolds.

Dehn called the space the  arithmetic field of the surface.  The space was used by Thurston in  his work on the compactification of the Teichmueller space.  It has  been known by many mathematicians that the space of isotopy classes  has an intrinsic modular structure.  Luo has used the modular  structure to reconstruct the Teichmueller space and the space of  measured laminations.  This has enabled him to derive that the space  of measured laminations is semi-real algebraic. He is currently  working on the reconstruction of the mapping class group of the  surface.

Although these invariants are quite effective in classifying knots and  3-manifolds, their topological nature remains mostly obscure.  The  purpose of this research is to study the topological origin of quantum  invariants by decomposing them into simpler pieces, called ""finite  type invariants,"" and trying to explain the nature of these pieces  individually.  This might be accomplished by using the tools of  quantum field theory, in particular, the asymptotic expansion of path  integrals through Feynman diagrams.  E. Witten has identified the  Jones polynomial and RT invariant as certain path integrals taken over  the classes of SU(2) connections on a 3-manifold.  This approach has  already led to a discovery of the Alexander polynomial and Milnor  linking numbers inside the Jones polynomial.  The simplest ""pieces"" of  the RT invariant were identified (at least, as a conjecture) with the  Chern-Simons invariant of flat connections, Reidemeister torsion and  SU(2) Casson invariant.  One hopes that more complicated topological  invariants, such as the Casson invariant of other Lie groups, will be  found among other pieces of the RT invariant.       A classification of knots is an open topological problem.  A knot  in topology is a closed rope (i.e., a circle) which is knotted.  Can a  particular knot be untangled by continuously deforming the rope  without cutting it?  How can one determine this just by looking at a  picture of the knot?  This problem may be solved if one finds enough  knot invariants.  A knot invariant is a number that can be calculated  by examining a picture of a knot.  The number should not change when a  knot is continuously deformed.  Thus if a knot invariant takes  different values on two knots, then these knots are different, because  they cannot  be deformed into one another.  For a long time the only  effective knot invariant was the Alexander polynomial.  A lot of new  invariants, such as the Jones polynomial, were discovered during the  last decade.  These invariants are quite effective in distinguishing  knots, but their origin is still a mystery, because their topological  interpretation is mostly missing.  The purpose of this project is to  try to fill this gap by using the tools of quantum field theory, such  as path integral and Feynman diagrams.  The relevance of quantum field  theory to low dimensional topology was discovered by E. Witten.  He  demonstrated that the Jones polynomial comes from a particle theory in  which knots appear as space-time trajectories of hypothetical  elementary particles.  The particles interact with each other in ways  that resemble the ""real life"" particles.  This approach has yielded  numerous mathematical conjectures that may lead to a better  understanding of the topological nature of the Jones polynomial and  ultimately to the classification of knots.  ***"

In the past year, a  serious technical problem in this theory has been overcome, so that it  now applies to all manifolds.  In collaboration with Lalonde and  Polterovich, McDuff is applying this improved theory to study  properties of the group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold that preserve  its symplectic structure.  This group has a subgroup of finite  codimension that is generated by Hamiltonian functions, but it is not  known in general whether this group is always closed in the full  group.  If it were, one might be able to formulate a topological  reason for a symplectomorphism to be generated by a function (rather  than a one-form).  Another question that McDuff is working on (in  collaboration with Abreu) is the extent to which the topological  structure of the group of symplectomorphisms changes as the underlying  symplectic structure changes.  A particularly simple version of this  problem appears when the underlying manifold is the product of two  two-dimensional spheres and one changes the relative size of the  spheres.  They have shown that there is an even-dimensional cohomology  class whose dimension jumps up by four each time the size of the  larger sphere increases by another unit.  They are working on  understanding the mechanism that produces this behavior.       A symplectic structure is a very basic kind of geometric  structure that underlies almost all the equations of classical and  quantum physics.  In the last fifteen years, new tools have been  developed that allow mathematicians for the first time to gain some  understanding of the global meaning of this kind of structure.  The  most significant developments of the past few years concern, on the  one hand, the elucidation of the structure of four-dimensional  symplectic spaces and, on the other, new understanding of the wa ys  that one can move around in a symplectic space.  Together with  Lalonde, McDuff completed the classification of a specially simple  kind of symplectic 4-manifold called a ruled surface and is in the  process of studying the structure of more complicated examples.  She  is also investigating the question of how much energy it takes to  achieve a particular movement of space, and to find ways of estimating  this energy on curved manifolds.  ***"

Three main areas arise as follows: (1) One could consider  ``braidings'' of a finite number of higher dimensional spheres (or suspensions)  in a fixed manifold as an analogue of the classical Artin braid group.  The  main examples here arise as the universal Lie algebra that satisfies the  Yang-Baxter relations of classical physics, which concerns collisions of  particles.  The homology of the attached function spaces is precisely the  universal enveloping algebras of these ``universal Yang-Baxter Lie algebras.''  The spaces under consideration are loop spaces of classical configuration  spaces as well as ``orbit configuration spaces'' as studied by M. Xicotencatl.  The loop space homology of many of these spaces is shown to be the universal  enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra that is defined in terms of the Yang-  Baxter or infinitesimal braid relations.  The underlying manifold can be a  homogeneous space or a manifold with a Euclidean factor.  In the case of  ``orbit configuration spaces,'' these same relations also appear in knot  invariants as studied by L. Kauffman.  (2) The intimate link between the  structure of certain choices of function spaces in homotopy theory and moduli  spaces of curves within classical algebraic geometry is studied.  The  connecting tissue is the link between Dehn twists and Whitehead products.  These connections are used to give homological calculations.  Here, the space  of maps from a fixed surface to a sphere is considered.  These spaces stably  split, while the stable summands are Thom complexes of bundles with base  given by certain moduli spaces of curves.  In the case of finite genus with  marked points, homological calculations are shown to be an analogue of cyclic  homology, while some specific calculations are carried out.  The plus  construction for the classifying space of th e stable mapping class group is  shown to split.  One factor gives the stable homotopy groups of spheres.  (3) Classical methods in combinatorial group theory are used to attack  problems on the growth of the torsion in the homotopy groups of certain  spaces.  Simplicial methods are used as well as techniques from classical  methods of W. Magnus on embedding groups as units in certain associative  algebras.  Here, the homotopy groups of double suspensions all of whose  homology is torsion are studied.  The main tool is an inverse limit of finite  p-groups.  This tower is an algebraic analog of the Goodwillie tower of the  identity; the groups at each stage are central extensions with centers at  each stage given by the mod-p reductions of modules Lie(n), a module of the  symmetric group on n letters of rank (n-1)! that has occurred ubiquitously in  homotopy theory.       Ordinary braidings of strings are at the foundation of these problems.  One could also imagine braiding other geometric objects such as planes,  spheres, or torii.  These braidings force symmetries that have occurred  previously in physics from considering collisions of particles and are known  as the Yang-Baxter relations.  The first part of this project is a study of  these symmetries for higher dimensional geometric objects.  Next consider the  surface of a doughnut with many holes removed.  In a second direction, the  ``smooth deformations'' of this surface are considered.  The main thrust here  is to analyze the ``holes'' in these spaces of ``smooth deformations'' as  they appear in many contexts in physics, string theory, geometry, algebraic  topology, and holomorphic maps.  A natural continuation is to understand how  spheres of large dimension move around in space provided only continuous  deformations are permitted.  This problem has been the key to others and is  one of the main problems in homotopy theory on which there has been  interesting progress.  These spheres move in much the same way that the hour  hand moves  around a clock.  The actual numbers are quite complicated, and  part of this project is to understand the uniform structure here.  ***"

The main question to be answered is for  which fundamental groups the higher dimensional techniques of surgery  and s-cobordism theorems work.  The existing techniques include  sophisticated constructions of Casson-handles that answer the question  in the affirmative for a large class of groups.  In addition, there is  a proposed nilpotent group theory method for locating obstructions for  free fundamental groups.  Both methods will also be applied to the  link homotopy classification of disjoint 2-spheres in 4-space as well  as to questions concerning concordance classes of knots and links in  3-space.       One of the most exciting mathematical discoveries in the last  decade is the fact that Euclidean n-space behaves very differently  depending on whether the dimension n equals or doesn't equal 4 (which  is the dimension we live in, allowing time as the fourth dimension).  More precisely, we have all learned calculus in one real variable, and  some of us went on to learn calculus in n variables, i.e., the theory  of smooth functions on Euclidean n-space.  But very few of us were  told that for n=4 there are (uncountably!) many such theories, whereas  for all other dimensions there is a unique one, namely the one we were  taught.  In mathematical terms, I am talking about the ""exotic""  structures on Euclidean 4-space, discovered by Donaldson, Freedman and  others around 1983.  This project deals with similar questions on more  complicated 4-dimensional manifolds (technically, those which have  nontrivial fundamental group).  One concrete difference from Euclidean  4-space is that in a general 4-manifold, not every vector-field  corresponds to a potential energy function.  ***"

Through the advent of the Jones  polynomial, quantum invariants and Vassiliev invariants, it transpired  that knots, 3-manifolds and other lower dimensional topological objects  could be studied extrinsically as combinatorial objects, with topological  equivalence as a kind of symmetry.  The investigator recognized the broader  roles these topological objects may play, and this fresh point of view  is reflected in the many topics studied in this project: the representation  varieties of the fundamental groups of homology 3-spheres over finite  fields and their relations with Ohtsuki's invariants of homology  3-spheres; the probabilistic interpretation of certain string link  invariants closely related to quantum invariants; integral and projective  geometry of Gauss integrals, the classification of Legendrian knots, the  study of various energy functionals with respect to the geometric  structures on knot spaces, and the topology of level sets of Gauss  integrals; and calculation of relations among (alternating) multiple zeta  numbers, using string links as devices.       Knots are fascinating objects.  When fastening a rope, the  distinction between a knot and a ""slip-knot"" (one that can be undone by  pulling) must have been recognized very early in human history.  However,  a mathematical study of knots was started only around the end of the  nineteenth century and has finally in recent years matured into a useful  scientific tool.  Nowadays, basic concepts in knot theory are crucial for  DNA biology and foundational physics, and they are related to many other  fields in mathematics.  On the other hand, easily pictured but difficult  questions in knot theory still remain beyond the reach of mathematical  techniques.  Two basic features of knot theory, the diversity of different  kinds of knots and the role played by symmetry in their classification,  may well provide hin ts and tools for many different kinds of scientific  research.  ***"

Friedlander will study algebraic cycles from two points  of view: the first is more topological and differential-geometric in  nature, whereas the second is more algebraic and is allied with the study  of motivic cohomology.  Particular attention will be given to relationships  with algebraic K-theory, long-standing problems in algebraic geometry, and  the challenge of producing concrete examples.  Moreover, the study of  representations of various Hopf algebras associated to algebraic groups  will continue.  Of special interest are the representations of infinitesimal  group schemes.  Stewart B. Priddy will study connections between stable  homotopy theory and the cohomology and representation theory of groups.  The goal is to develop a global point of view by working at the interface  of these fields, using insights from the stable homotopy theory of  classifying spaces.  One avenue of research is the study of the stable  type of classifying spaces of products of groups.  Another is the study  of the representation theory conjectures of Alperin and Broue', which  may be amenable to equivariant topological methods.  One of the principal  techniques is the use of stable decompositions of classifying spaces to  suggest concepts in cohomology of groups, as was the case with Swan groups.       Aspects of Friedlander's research relate to fundamental problems in  mathematics whose history can be traced back to the previous century.  Many central problems of algebraic geometry, especially those involving  algebraic cycles, have challenged generations of mathematicians.  New  techniques from topology and formal algebraic geometry hold promise of at  least partial solutions.  In a different mathematical arena, the classical  representation theory of algebraic groups is reflected by the representations  of related algebraic structures.  The interplay between the classical theory  and the latest techniques involving categorical constructions presents  opportunities for i mportant developments.  In contrast with Priddy's  emphasis, the field of algebraic topology has long sought, with much success,  to apply algebraic methods to the solution of geometric or topological  problems.  By reformulating topological problems in algebraic terms, one  is often able to answer a more tractable question.  In general, however,  there are many connections between these areas, which enables one to  reverse this procedure and bring topological methods to bear in algebra.  Priddy's project studies the interaction between topology and group theory,  with the aim of uncovering fundamental algebraic structures.  Powerful  symbolic manipulation techniques using high speed computers comprise part  of the project.  ***"

They were developed as a  result of an attempt to generalize simultaneously two such classical  objects; the incompressible surface and the taut foliation.  This  project involves studying the structure of essential laminations and  how they sit inside of a 3-manifold, to extract information about the  `laminar' 3-manifold.  The main goals that the investigator will  pursue are to show that every irreducible 3-manifold  homotopy-equivalent to a laminar manifold is homeomorphic to it, and  to show that laminar manifolds are finitely covered by Haken  manifolds.  He will also study taut foliations from the laminar point  of view, using this new point of view to study these older objects.  The goal is to find examples of manifolds that admit essential  laminations but which do not contain either of the two `parent'  objects.  An associated goal is to find a hyperbolic 3-manifold which  does not admit an essential lamination.       A 3-dimensional manifold is an object which looks like our  ordinary 3-dimensional space, if you don't look too far away from  where you are standing.  Such objects can behave very differently over  large distances, though; walking in a straight line, for example, can  bring you right back to where you started from (much like walking on  the surface of the spherical Earth).  3-manifold topology attempts to  describe this global structure.  In doing so, ideas are drawn from,  and applied to, many other branches of science; they have been applied  to chemistry, where they have helped to unlock some of the secrets of  DNA recombination, and they have been both drawn from and applied to  physics, in work aimed at understanding the basic building blocks of  the universe.  One technique that has proved fruitful in studying  3-manifolds is to think of the 3-manifold as a collection of surfaces  (called a foliation) stacked together (like the  pages of a book); then  one can use what is known about surfaces to explore the structure of  the 3-manifold.  The investigator plans to continue work aimed at  developing this approach.  ***"

The  project has three parts.  The first part is related to the  classification problem for these 4-manifolds.  While the recent  failure of the Minimal Conjecture shows that smooth 4-manifolds tend  to defy classification schemes, there are other related conjectures  like the 3/2 Conjecture and the Simple-type Conjecture, and the  investigator will try to disprove these conjectures as well.  In the second part, the investigator will continue his joint  work with John Morgan to study how Seiberg-Witten invariants change  along an h-cobordism.  This problem is related to the Simple-type  Conjecture and also to the third part of the project, in which the  investigator will study the relation between the combinatorial  presentations (Kirby calculus pictures) and Seiberg-Witten invariants  of simply-connected smooth closed 4-manifolds.  A long-term goal in  this direction is to find generalizations of the Seiberg-Witten  invariants.        The study of smooth structures of simply-connected 4-dimensional  manifolds was initiated in 1984 by Simon Donaldson.  In his ground  breaking work, Donaldson applied the Yang-Mills equation and the  corresponding Yang-Mills moduli spaces over the 4-manifolds.  The  corresponding Donaldson invariants were used to settle various  problems in 4-dimensional topology.  The Yang-Mills equation is a  partial differential equation that has special importance in  theoretical physics, and its use in the classification of smooth  4-manifolds revealed a surprising link between topology and  theoretical physics.  This link has been underlined by Seiberg and  Witten in 1994, when, using ideas coming from theoretical physics,  they discovered a pair of new partial differential equations and the  corresponding Seiberg-Witten invariants of smooth 4-manifolds.  ***"

Gromov.  These are groups which discretely approximate a geometry more  like that of the hyperbolic plane than the Euclidean plane.  It is  currently of interest to extend this well-developed theory of word  hyperbolic groups to the ``nonpositively curved'' setting.  Just as  word hyperbolic groups are a generalization of the classical  hyperbolic groups, finitely generated free groups, and certain small  cancellation groups, there should be a general class of nonpositively  curved groups that includes finitely generated free abelian groups,  more general small cancellation groups, and fundamental groups of  Riemannian manifolds of nonpositive curvature.  Recently, there have  been several proposed classes of nonpositively curved groups.  One  such class consists of groups that arise via geometric actions on  ``CAT(0)'' spaces.  These are spaces which enjoy many of the same  geometric properties of universal covers of Riemannian manifolds of  nonpositive curvature.  Both the Euclidean and hyperbolic planes are  examples of CAT(0) spaces.  The boundary of a CAT(0) space which  admits a geometric group action is an object of great interest in the  area.  Recently, several important problems in group theory have been  solved with the use of geometric methods.  For word hyperbolic groups,  the boundary has proven a useful tool.  Many of the theorems which  hold in that setting should have generalizations to the nonpositively  curved setting, and that is the point of view taken here.  It is  already known that replacing the phrase ``word hyperbolic'' with  ``CAT(0)'' in many of these theorems is not going to work, but finding  the right theorems is an important step in unifying the theory of  nonpositively curved groups, much like the theory of nonpositively  curved manifolds.       The basic idea of Geometric Group Theory is to study the  structure of  an infinite group G by studying ``geometric'' actions of  G on different geometries.  In this way, any such group is viewed as a  set of rigid motions of a geometry.  An example to keep in mind is  that of the Euclidean plane.  This is a geometry whose boundary can be  identified with the unit circle, where each point of the circle  represents a direction in the plane which heads out to infinity.  A  rigid motion in a straight line is known as a translation.  This space  (the plane) may be acted upon by translations in any direction, but  translations in two independent directions will suffice to give all of  them.  Thus two (commuting) copies of the group of integers can be  thought of as acting on the plane by translation.  In fact, this  geometric setup determines this group almost uniquely.  In general,  when a group acts geometrically on a geometry, there is a ``picture''  of the group inside the space created by following the image of one  point under all of the group elements.  Then the group, which started  out as an abstract mathematical object, can be studied by studying the  geometry of the space, where the problems are now geometric instead of  algebraic.  In the example above, the group consists of moves from one  square to another on an infinite chess board.  The collection of moves  may then be given a concrete geometric picture by indentifying each  square with its center, the totality of moves becoming a lattice that  discretely approximates the plane.  ***"

First, he will determine if some modifications of his recent solution (with P. Koszmider) of the well-known Arhangel'skii-Tall problem can be applied to other long-standing open problems concerning normality and paracompactness in locally nice spaces.  These problems include M.E. Rudin's question of whether or not every normal manifold must be collectionwise-Hausdorff, and S. Watson's question about the existence in ZFC of a perfectly normal locally compact non-paracompact space.  Second, two problems concerning closed mappings will be investigated, the first being the well-known open question about the preservation of the metalindelof property under closed or perfect maps, and the other a question about the existence of irreducible restrictions of closed mappings.  Finally, a set of other problems related to recent work of the principal investigator includes the question of the characterization of the Baire property in function spaces with the compact-open topology, of the existence of a completely regular connectification of metrizable spaces with no compact open sets, and problems about the behavior of the Lindelof property in product spaces.     Set-theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines which have common turn-of-the-century roots.  Set-theory provides a framework upon which all of mathematics can be based.  Objects of study in topology include familiar spaces such as the plane and ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space, and their subsets, as well as much more abstract spaces.  The pioneering set-theoretical work of  K. Goedel in the late 30's and P. Cohen in the 60's soon led to the realization that some long-standing topological questions could not be solved assuming only the standard axioms of set-theory.  The principal investigator's research lies substantially within the scope of this interesting interaction between the two fields, focusing especia lly on problems selected for their topological significance, but where knowledge of set-theory is likely to be useful in their solution.  The problems involve basic topological properties and constructions-normality, covering properties, product spaces, function spaces, etc.-which impact a large portion of the field of general topology, and have applications in other areas of mathematics as well.  The new techniques involved in the solution of these problems are likely to be applicable to a wide variety of other problems."

There are h-cobordisms (W; M, N) of simply-connected smooth 4-manifolds M  and N such that M and N are not diffeomorphic.  They are closed 4-manifolds  with the same non-trivial second homology over the reals, and the  non-triviality of the h-cobordism is detected by gauge invariants.  It was  observed by Hsiang et al.  Inv. Math. 123 (1996) 343-348  that the  cobordism W may be decomposed into two cobordisms, the first being a  trivial one and the second being a non-trivial relative h-cobordism  of contractible 4-manifolds bounded by the same 3-dimensional homology  sphere.  This means that all the non-triviality of W is concentrated  inside a contractible piece.  Because the gauge invariants heavily depend  on the non-triviality of the quadratic form of the second homology of M,  two questions need to be answered.  (A) How can one detect the  non-triviality of a cobordism (W; M, N) of contractible 4-manifolds  M, N (relative to the boundaries)?  In fact, there should be combinatorial  invariants related to the classical knot invariants to detect this  non-triviality, and, in particular, one should be able to describe  some explicit examples constructed from the explicit non-trivial  h-cobordisms of Akbulut.  (B) How do any such combinatorial invariants   relate to gauge theory.  Hsiang is seeking solutions to these two problems.  He has already found that (B) is related to Property P for 3-manifolds.       Geometric topology treats spaces known as manifolds that come in a  vast array of configurations and all different dimensions.  A manifold of  dimension n is referred to briefly as an n-manifold, and what the dimension  means is that an ant living on the manifold would think himself in  n-dimensional Euclidean space if he took only short excursions.  However,  he could learn otherwise on returning from a lengthy journey and finding  himself disoriented or constrained in some way.  Think of an ant on life  s upport that requires trailing an umbilicus behind him attached at the  other end to a base station.  Already in the 2-dimensional case, he will  discover if he travels widely enough that there are differences between  living on the surface of a sphere and living on the surface of a doughnut,  even if the sphere (or doughnut) is very large and appears to his myopic  gaze to be everywhere a flat Euclidean plane.  The 2-dimensional  possibilities have been understood since the 19th century, but the  possibilities become increasingly various and impossible to classify fully  as the dimension increases.  What is always surprising to the unitiate is  to learn that in spite of this dimensional complication, some of the most  intriguing problems, problems that have been solved for the higher  dimensions, remain unsolved for dimensions 3 or 4 or both, a fact of  importance to beings who live mostly in these dimensions and wish, for  example, to understand the physics of their cosmos.  The present project  takes note of the exciting new methods that have been introduced into  low-dimensional topology in recent years, first by Donaldson, and more  recently by Seiberg and Witten, the so-called gauge theoretic methods.  Then it asks some incisive questions about how these gauge invariants  relate to the vast arsenal of techniques with which algebraic topologists  had previously been equipped.  ***"

His recent work has been concerned with achieving a better   understanding of the global structure of homotopy theory.   This work combines two hitherto disjoint approaches, the ""chromatic  approach,"" and the ""calculus of functors"" approach.  In joint work with  M. Mahowald, the investigator examined the Goodwillie derivatives of  unstable homotopy theory and used them to prove a new result about  unstable homotopy of spheres.  In other work, the investigator   studied the Taylor polynomials (as opposed to derivatives)   of unstable homotopy theory and provided an explicit space-level  description of these.  One of the key ingredients of the investigator's   contribution to his joint work with Mahowald was a combinatorial   analysis of the poset of partitions of a finite set, which turned   out to have consequences for the chromatic filtration of spheres.  Further   investigation of the combinatorics involved has led the investigator  to discover seemingly new and mysterious recurrence patterns.  He   believes that some of the deep periodic phenomena in homotopy   theory can be studied via this combinatorial periodicity.   In very recent work, the investigator utilized this combinatorial   periodicity to construct certain ""self maps"" on the derivatives   of unstable homotopy theory, which imply, among other things, the   existence of finite complexes whose cohomology realizes certain   finite subalgebras of the Steenrod algebra.  The investigator believes that   these finite complexes will be useful for localization and   periodicity.       In the investigator's area of Algebraic Topology, he is interested in  how to analyze the space of continuous functions between two topological  spaces.  It turns out that an analogue of the theory of Taylor series can  be developed, and one can study the space of continuous maps via its  ""polynomial approximations"" (an idea due to T. Goodwillie).  The  investigato r combined this theory with more classical methods in topology,  and he used it (in joint work with M. Mahowald) to prove a new result on  the global structure of an important algebraic tool of the trade, the  so-called unstable homotopy of spheres.  He now intends to use the  aformentioned polynomial approximations to construct certain spaces with  interesting (cohomological) properties, spaces whose mere existence should  lead to further insights in topology.  His work has a strong combinatorial  flavor (specifically, one of the main gadgets in his work is the lattice  of partitions of a finite set), and he hopes that some of his results will  be of interest to combinatorialists.   ***"

The proof of this conjecture would be an  important step in proving Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture.  A  result of Cannon-Swenson reduced the conjecture to proving that a  particular sequence of shinglings of the visual sphere at infinity is  conformal.  In this setting, a result of Cannon-Floyd-Parry reduced  the two axioms of conformality to a single one that is weaker than  either of them.  This led to reducing the problem further to proving  that a finite collection of annuli have combinatorial moduli bounded  uniformly from 0 with respect to this sequence of shinglings.  A  promising approach to studying these shinglings is that of expansion  complexes and expansion maps.  Expansion complexes correspond to  horospheres in the hyperbolic case, and the expansion map corresponds  to shrinking to a smaller horosphere.  If the sequence of shinglings  is not conformal, expansion complexes based at different points should  show the infinitesimal distortions.  The identification of the  expansion complex with a subset of the sphere at infinity enables one  to relate expansion complexes based at different points, and so the  infinitesimal distortions may provide a substitute for a ""line field.""  Cubulated 3-manifolds are a good starting point for checking this.       A central question in low-dimensional geometry and topology is  the extent to which geometry dominates topology in dimension three.  Thurston conjectured that 3-manifolds (topological spaces that locally  look like Euclidean 3-space) can be naturally decomposed into pieces  that can be equipped with geometric structures.  If this  Geometrization Conjecture were true, it would greatly aid the study of  these spaces, since the rigidity of the geometry enables one to use  much more powerful too ls.  This project is part of a multi-pronged  approach to settling this conjecture in the dominant case of  negatively curved spaces.  Because of previous work of the principal  investigator and coauthors, the main object of study here is tiling  patterns on the plane and on the 2-sphere.  Given a tiling pattern  with finitely many model tiles and a finite rule for subdividing model  tiles, one can recursively subdivide the tiling pattern.  The problem  is to determine when there are geometric models for the tiles so that  under subdivision the shapes of the subtiles stay ""almost round"" (even  though they may have fractal boundaries).  These tiling problems can  be studied using discrete conformal geometry, and, in particular, can  be studied experimentally using circle packings.  The interplay  between the circle packing ideas and the subdivision ideas has been  very fruitful and suggests that the methods being developed here could  provide useful algorithmic techniques for studying geometrical tiling  problems.  ***"

The controlled topology objective is  to understand better the failure of approximate fibrations to form a  bundle theory because the formation of pullbacks is obstructed.  Hughes and others have made precise the sense in which approximate  fibrations are the normal structure in homotopically stratified sets.  This makes the pullback problem central in the study of these sets.  Much is already known through the work of Hughes, Williams, Taylor,  Weinberger and others, but a more satisfactory version may be  possible.  The other topic concerns machine computation in topological  field theories defined on 2-complexes, 3-manifolds, and smooth  4-manifolds.  The 2-complex case is completely implemented, and  explorations are well along for field theories coming from mod p  representations of Lie algebras, for p up to 13.  The representation  theory of quantum groups needed for 3-manifolds has been implemented,  but exploration of the field theories waits on a more complete  understanding of the 2-complex case.  Both 2-complexes and 3-manifolds  are considered test cases for the primary goal of the project, field  theories on 4-manifolds.  This, however, is still some years off.  Some work is also being done on topological questions on which field  theories might shed light: the ""Andrews-Curtis"" conjecture for  2-complexes, handlebody structures on 4-manifolds, and topological  isotopy of 4-manifolds.       The context for the first topic is the study of stratified sets.  Most of the geometric objects occurring in nature are stratified: built  up of layers that are manifolds.  The biggest challenge is to understand  how the strata fit together.  For most types of stratified sets  (smooth, piecewise-linear, analytic) this fitting-together is  described using a bundle theory.  It is complex and hard to use  because the objects are complicated, but is effective and  well-understood.  Top ological stratified objects took longer to  describe, because it turns out the fitting-together cannot be given in  terms of a bundle theory.  This has been extensively studied, but we  do not yet have a fully satisfactory understanding.  The field  theories in the second part of the project are also referred to as  ""topological quantum field theories.""  They are rather idiosyncratic  theories specialized to low dimensions.  The ones under study are  algebraic (as opposed to analytic) and are constructed using  representations of groups or Lie algebras, or their deformations.  These, particularly the 3-manifold versions, became popular about a  decade ago.  At the time, we seemed not to know enough either about  deformations of Lie algebras or about 3-manifolds to get significant  new information from one about the other.  A particular obstacle was  the inability to compute ""random"" invariants.  This project, now in  its eighth year, has numerical computation as a first goal.  This is  going well, but the raw output is not very revealing.  The principal  activity at present is finding ways to use numerical data to obtain a  global qualitative understanding of a theory.  ***"

These are functors from spaces (or spectra) to spaces (or spectra) and  they must preserve homotopy equivalences.  The tower is an inverse  limit of functors with the fibers between stages being equivariant  homology theories.  The tower does not necessarily recover the  original functor for all spaces or spectra but does for suitably  connected objects.  One way in which the investigator will study this  tower is by studying another tower that agrees with the Taylor tower  within the radius of convergence for a given functor but whose  defining characteristic at the n-th level is the universal degree n  construction as compared to the universal n-excisive construction  given by the Taylor tower.  He will also continue to study algebraic  K-theory by use of linearizing functors of exact categories to  spectra.  A functor F from exact categories to spaces or spectra is  said to satisfy ``additivity'' if F applied to the exact category of  short exact sequences of a category is naturally equivalent to the  two-fold product of F applied to the category given by the exact  functors that take kernel and cokernel of a short exact sequence.  There is a universal construction, called ``linearizing,'' which takes  an arbitrary functor from exact categories to spectra and produces a  new functor of exact categories that satisfies additivity.  This is  completely analogous to taking the ``derivative'' in the sense of  Goodwillie when reinterpreted with these new towers.  Algebraic  K-theory itself is the linearization of a free functor from exact  categories to spectra.  Topological Hochschild homology and  topological cyclic homology are also examples of linearizing a  functor, and the trace maps that connect these theories may be studied  from this point of view.  The investigator will be examining different  constructions for the study of algebraic K-theory obtained by  linearizing various types of functors.  The hope  is to obtain new  theories that one can use to study algebraic K-theory effectively.       An important tool for studying functions from the complex numbers  to itself is the Taylor series expansion of the function about a  point.  For a functor -- a kind of generalized function -- from spaces  to spaces, Tom Goodwillie has similarly defined a Taylor series  expansion of the functor about a space.  In standard analysis one must  assume a function has all its derivatives about a point to ensure that  the Taylor tower exists, and then one can be sure that this  approximation to the original function is accurate only within a  radius of convergence about the point.  Similarly, for functors of  spaces, one must make assumptions about the functor to ensure its  Taylor tower exists, and even when these are satisfied, one obtains  accurate estimates of the original functor only for spaces  sufficiently close to the space of expansion.  The investigator will  be examining a modification of Goodwillie's original definition for  the Taylor tower of functors from spaces to spaces that tends to agree  with his definition for spaces within the radius of convergence of a  point but differs in general.  Two advantages of this new tower are  that it is easier to define and that it can be applied to an even  greater variety of interesting situations.  One area to be explored  with this new technology is algebraic K-theory, which from this point  of view is simply the derivative of a particularly easy functor.  ***"

Complex  cobordism occupies a central place in stable homotopy theory, in part  due to the Nilpotence and Periodicity theorems of Hopkins, Devinatz  and Smith.  Quillen's theorem is of fundamental use, as it allows one  to use techniques from the study of formal groups to produce, and  calculate with, various cohomology theories based on complex  cobordism.  A problem of longstanding importance in equivariant theory  is to understand complex cobordism classes of G-manifolds (where G is  some Lie group).  This research will explore this question from the  point of view of formal group laws.  The goal is to use the methods  from Quillen's paper in the Advances to get a handle on equivariant  complex cobordism, and to link this with the notion of equivariant  formal group laws, preliminaries of which are set forth in Mike Cole's  University of Chicago thesis.       When is the set of positions of some mechanical system the  boundary of the set of positions of some other mechanical system?  As  a simple example, think of the circle around some point in the plane  as being the set of positions of a pendulum.  This is the boundary of  the set of positions of a pendulum of the same length, but with a  joint halfway along the rod joining the bob to the center (said joint  able to bend from 0 to 180 degrees).  This set of positions describes  a disk.  This question has a very beautiful and elegant answer in  terms of the algebraic topology of the manifold, given by the Fields  medal winning work of Rene Thom in the 1950s.  In certain cases, the  answer to this question turns out to be related to ""formal group  laws,"" a class of algebraic rules for adding two quantities, with  properties similar to, but not identicial to ordinary add ition.  This  research is directed at answering our original question when, in  addition, it is required that the set of positions of the mechanical  system be the boundary of the set of positions of some other  mechanical system in a way that respects some symmetries of the  original system.  Some of this is already known in principle in simple  cases, but formal group laws with additional symmetries will provide a  framework for the answer and may allow extensions beyond special  cases.  ***"

Given that the pseudo arc is very non-locally-connected, this class includes many pathological continua as well as all locally connected continua. The proposer has shown that it includes all non-separating homogeneous continua, Lelek has shown that it includes all chainable continua and Minc has shown that all non separating continua in this class have the fixed point property. Kato has shown that no chainable continuum admits an expansive homeomorphism. A natural question which arises is whether weakly chainable plane continua admit an expansive homeomorphism. We will establish connections between this problem and the structure of invariant continua of branched covering maps of the plane, including the structure of the boundary of invariant simply connected domains. We will make use of prime end techniques as well as results from continuum theory and dynamical systems. The problems in this proposal are related to the classification of homogeneous plane continua, the fixed point property of non-separating plane continua, and the topological structure of non-locally-connected Julia sets of complex polynomials.  Planar continua arise in many applications, most notably as invariant sets in dynamical systems. Dynamical systems is an area of mathematics which studies properties of mathematical models of systems which change over time. Invariant continua often determine the long term behavior of a dynamical system and are particularly of interest in case these systems exhibit chaotic behavior. The study of such continua has a long history dating back to the late 1800's. Despite significant advances during the last 80 years, several long-standing problems remain unresolved. In this proposal we will establish connections between some of these old problems and new ones which arise from other areas of mathematics. We will indicate possible solutions to th ese problems using a mixture of old ideas and new tools and techniques from adjacent mathematical fields. We will focus on the topological aspects of these problems although solutions may well have an impact on work in adjacent fields."

Both  aspects of the study lie at the intersection of geometry and topology,  on the one hand, and theoretical physics (quantum field theory and  string theory) on the other.  One aspect concerns gauge-theoretic  invariants of four-dimensional manifolds, in particular, the Donaldson  polynomial invariants and the Seiberg-Witten invariants.  Here the aim  is to understand the relation of these invariants to more classical  geometric descriptions of a four-manifold, for example, a handlebody  description.  The other aspect is the study of holomorphic vector  bundles over elliptically fibered manifolds and the relation of these  to families of K3 surfaces that arise in F-theory in mathematical  physics.  Here the aim is to establish mathematical results for both  sides of the putative F-theory duality and then to check that the  predictions of this duality do indeed hold.       There has been a resurgence in recent years of the interactions  between the areas of geometry and topology in mathematics and the areas  of quantum field theory and string theory in theoretical physics.  This  interaction has proved very fruitful for both disciplines -- the physics  brings new methods to the study of low dimensional spaces, and the  mathematics provides the framework in which the studies in theoretical  high-energy physics are done.  This project will investigate in more  detail two of these interactions.  One is the study of four-dimensional  spaces, using tools provided by theoretical physics.  These tools  have yielded much insight in the last few years, and there is much more  information about four-dimensional spaces that should be accessible  using these tools.  The other aspect of the project involves the  mathematics of a new physical theory.  This theory makes very precise  predictions about two kinds of mathematical objects that, on the face of it,  bear little relation to each other.  On the other hand, these mathemat ical  objects can be studied in their own right by purely mathematical tools  that have been developed independently of physics.  The results of the  mathematical analyses of these objects can be used to check the  predictions of the physical theory in much the same way as physical  experiments are used.  ***"

All surfaces in natural scenes are endowed with  texture.  In this project, the investigator develops new  algorithms to estimate shape (geometric characteristics of  surfaces) from texture in natural and synthetic scenes.  The new  geometric models use piecewise Riemannian foliations, in the  sense of differential topology, with additional structure.  Given  a 3D-textured surface, not necessarily piecewise smooth, one  constructs a foliation whose leaves form a one-parameter family  of 2D-textured and piecewise smooth mathematical surfaces  approximating the given object.  Together with an objective  function defined on their leaves, such 2D-textured foliations are  fundamental geometric objects that model 3D-textured surfaces in  the world.  One can use algorithms to recover shape from texture  for the piecewise smooth leaves, e.g. curvature and slant.  Several scene-based methods are explored to construct textured  foliations, ranging from analytic (e.g. Hamilton-Jacobi  equations) and topological techniques (e.g. integrable  distributions) to statistical estimation methods.  The  psychophysical experiments to test the theory and compare  different algorithms are explored with colleagues who are  neuroscience experimentalists.  In particular, the objective  function can be numerically approximated based on psychophysical  data.  The new models are applied to perception of symmetry.  The  problem of modeling computational strategies employed by the  visual cortex to estimate shape from texture, and their  comparison with the new computational algorithms, is pursues.  The  investigator outlines a concrete training program and research  collaboration with his senior colleagues in vision and  neuroscience at UC Berkeley in order to achieve the cognitive and  computational objectives of the project.       How do we see?  This simple question does not have a simple  answer.  Vision is a complex series of eve nts that begins when  light enters the eyes and ends with perception.  People are able  to discriminate between objects of different size, contrast and  color with precision.  They can estimate curvature and orientation  of surfaces with varying roughness and multitudes of texture, as  well as describe within short time intervals properties of  surfaces such as symmetry and similarity to other familiar  objects.  The human visual system easily outperforms any man-made  machine.  Decades of research in vision demonstrate the wisdom of  the following approach: Key insights generally come from models  that are well-suited for exploring a specific research question.  Geometric models coupled with computational techniques have  formed a cornerstone of modern theories of biological as well as  robot vision, and of their diverse applications.  In this project,  the principal investigator and his colleagues establish a new  link between advanced geometric theories in pure mathematics  (theory of foliations from differential topology) and visual  perception and estimation of shape of surfaces in natural and  synthetic environments.  Among applications of the theory, one  could mention: robot motion planning and navigation of manless  vehicles in rough terrain or unreachable environments; visual  shape estimation of images of materials obtained by atomic force  microscopy in scientific research and design of advanced  materials; long-term computerized inspection of surfaces subject  to ballistic deposition and erosion in environmental studies and  ecology; and computational inspection of large databases of  images from infrared radio astronomy in order to locate specific  features.  Just as the neurons in human visual system perform  their tasks in parallel, the above-mentioned theory lends itself  to parallel processing implementation."

In particular, the relationship is being studied between the surgical and  harmonic map approaches to rigidity problems.       A geometric object is rigid if it can't be deformed.  For example, a  sphere cannot be deformed without changing its curvature.

(The Euclidean plane has  zero curvature, the sphere has positive curvature, and the non-Euclidean  plane has negative curvature.)

While it is very easy for a non-mathematician to guess the dimension of a particular geometric object, it is fairly difficult to define the dimension in a formal, rigorous way. The first mathematical definition of dimension arises in linear algebra. From that definition one easily understands that the dimensions of the line, the plane, and the 3-space are respectively 1,2, and 3. Ever since the formation of topology as an offshoot of analysis, mathematicians attempted to define dimension in a non-algebraic way.  The most intuitive such definition is the so-called small inductive dimension ind(X) of a space X. Essentially, ind(X) at most n means that open sets U with boundary of dimension at most (n-1) form a basis of X. Extension dimension theory is a general theory of dimension in which spaces are not parametrized by natural numbers. Instead, they are parametrized by CW complexes. In this theory dim(X) being at most K means that K is an absolute extensor of X.  In particular, dim(X) is at most the n-dimensional sphere S(n) if and only if the covering dimension of X is at most n.  dim(X)=K means that K is minimal with respect to all L such that dim(X) is at most L. It turns out that extension dimension encompasses both the covering dimension and the cohomological dimension.  It is rich in interplay between geometry and algebra which, to the Principal Investigator, is the cornerstone of all mathematics. In the case of finite-dimensional compacta one has an associated algebraic object called the Bockstein algebra.  There is a dual theory to extension dimension which deals with CW complexes and in the case of countable CW complexes there is an associated algebraic object called the dual Bockstein algebra.  This project involves the study of 'dimension.'  The need to study objects of various dimensions is not unique to mathematics alone. The perception of the dimension of the basic object we live in, the Universe, has undergone signi ficant changes over time. In Newtonian mechanics, the Universe is assumed to be 3-dimensional; Einstein added one more dimension (time).  Currently theoretical physicists ponder various models of the Universe aimed at unifying gravity and quantum mechanics; in some models the Universe is of dimension 10 while in others its dimension is 26."

The first of these prongs is  an investigation, partially aided by computer, of geometric Dehn filling  spaces for 3-manifolds.  Geometric Dehn fillings interpolate between  manifolds with distinct topology.  A suitable variation of this idea  has the potential to connect all possible 3-manifolds and equip them  with geometric decompositions.  The second prong is an investigation  of the geometry of taut foliations and essential laminations and their  relationships to hyperbolic structures and other geometric structures.  This approach has the promise to give a common generalization of the  canonical decompositions of surface homeomorphisms developed by Thurston  in 1976, and the geometrization of Haken manifolds developed by Thurston  in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  Additional prongs of this project  involve contact structures, confoliations, and geometric group theory.  In addition, the project will explore connections of low-dimensional  geometry and topology to biology, particularly genetics.       Low-dimensional geometry and topology is a beautiful area of  mathematics that has undergone tremendous growth and transformation over  the last two decades.  Paralleling this internal development of the  subject, lagging slightly behind, has been the external development of  new connections and strengthened connections to other areas of mathematics  and of science.  Some of these connections are direct, like the  cosmological issue of the shape of our universe or the more down-to-earth  issue of the shapes of crystals.  Other connections are indirect, to  diverse topics such as databases, group theory, genetics, or computational  chemistry.  Any topic tha t can be formulated in a quantitative way can be  studied with geometric methods (alongside the more prevalent symbolic,  algebraic and analytic methods), so that in any particular case, the  powerful discoveries and tools of low-dimensional geometry and topology  have a reasonable chance to have a direct bearing.  The aim of this  project is further development of the tools of low-dimensional geometry  and topology to make them more portable, more powerful and more universal.  ***"

A combinatorial  version of Morse theory applied to cube complexes may be used to  analyze the finiteness properties of the kernels of right-angled Artin  groups.  Some of these kernels have remarkable finiteness properties.  A major goal of this project is to study the geometry and topology of  these kernels.  It is hoped that these groups contain examples which  distinguish between geometric and cohomological dimension, and  examples which distinguish between combable and automatic groups.  It  is also worth considering more general settings in which the Morse  theory arguments may be applied, and what information these ideas may  yield in the study of the coherency question for various classes of  groups.  Another interesting direction to investigate is whether the  Morse techniques may be combined with branched covering techniques to  produce examples of torsion-free groups that do not contain free  abelian subgroups of rank 2, and that are of type FP(n) but not  FP(n+1).       The main objects under investigation in this project are  piecewise euclidean cubical complexes.  These may be thought of as   constructed from regular euclidean squares and cubes, neatly stitched  together along their faces and edges.  Such complexes have symmetry  groups, which may be thought of as generalizations of the wallpaper  pattern groups, or of the 3-dimensional crystallographic groups one  encounters in the study of lattices in chemistry.  The main purpose of  this research is to examine subgroups of these symmetry groups.  One  technique is to introduce height functions on the cubical complexes  and to look at the subgroups consisting of all those symmetries that  preserve the `contour lines' or level sets of such functions.  These   constant-height slices often exhibit remarkable geometric patterns  that are far f rom obvious when one looks just at the ambient cubical  complex.  The subgroups of symmetries that preserve these slices have  very different algebraic and geometric properties from those one   encounters in the euclidean crystallographic world.  These examples  help deepen our understanding of the concept of geometric symmetry.   ***"

This has led to new results in  combinatorial topology as well as to simplifications of some existing  proofs.  One current goal is to develop a combinatorial theory of  vector bundles and connections that is suitable for studying both the  classical question of combinatorial formulae for characteristic  classes, as well as the new invariants of knots and 3- and 4-manifolds  defined via the theory of smooth vector bundles and connections.

A foliation represents the solution of a partial differential equation on a space, and the cohomology classes that detect a given foliation provide a concise numerical invariant measuring the (global) twisting of the solution set of the equation. The first cohomology class to be discovered in this way was the Godbillon-Vey invariant, a single class in dimension three that is an element of the classical de Rham cohomology group of the underlying space. (For codimension one foliations there are no other invariants.) This project is based on a fundamentally new method of computing cohomology that does not require the classical symmetries needed for de Rham cohomology. The ideas for this construction arise from work of Jean-Louis Loday of Strasbourg, France, and are referred to as Leibniz cohomology. The results of preliminary computations are striking. In the codimension one case alone, there are infinite families of invariants for foliations. They begin with the Godbillon-Vey invariant and then continue in dimensions 4n and 4n+3 (n any positive integer). Although the new classes result from a one-parameter variation of a foliation, it remains an open question to interpret their meaning in terms of physical properties. A more general topic of research in mathematics remains to classify space according to the criteria set forth by Riemann nearly 150 years ago. Much progress has been made in the past century, but the classification is not complete. As an unexpected and highly non-trivial invariant of space, Leibniz cohomology will be a new tool in this field. To aid in the interpretation of Leibniz cohomology, a construction for this invariant in terms of more familiar spaces would be helpful. It is auspicious that the formalism used to define the Leibniz groups appears quite naturally in quantum field theory. By work of V. Kac, the elements of a field theory form a classical Lie algebra---but only after a certain number of them are set to zero. If these elements are not set to zero, the original elements form a Leibniz algebra lacking the symmetries of a Lie algebra. The cohomology groups of this Leibniz algebra will be new invariants of quantum field theory. ***"

There has also evolved from this a rich geometric theory of the space of right cosets of the Moebius group in the group of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle (which is our model of a universal Teichmueller space) as well as a sensible universal mapping class group, which turns out to be isomorphic to the (Richard) Thompson group. There are also different and interesting applications of this universal theory to various seemingly disparate topics in algebraic number theory (such as Markov tuples, the Gauss product of quadratic forms, and Grothendieck's version of absolute Galois theory, for instance). Current research aims to develop these ideas further and pursue a deeper study of these connections. There are important and venerable questions in mathematics about the space T(S) of all possible geometric structures on a fixed two-dimensional surface S. Imagine taking a surface (like the surface of a balloon, for instance) and pricking a hole in it; the hole, i.e., the missing point, is called a puncture, and there are special techniques developed over the last decade or so for studying the space T(S) of geometric structures on a punctured surface S. Remarkably enough, various quantities in the string theory of particle physics are given by explicit geometric invariants of these spaces T(S) for punctured surfaces S. Moreover, these techniques lead to new insights about various classical mathematical constructions in number theory, and this project's research emphasis lies in these algebraic applications. ***"
