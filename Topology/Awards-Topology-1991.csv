The first part will build on the                           investigator's success (together with Henry King of the                         University of Maryland) in settling an old conjecture of John                   Nash.  The second part will focus on the construction of fake                   smooth structures on 4-manifolds, particularly their detection by               means of such new invariants as Floer homology and the still                    newer invariants of Turaev-Reshetikhin-Witten coming from quantum               groups.                                                                              Both parts of this project concern themselves with very                    natural objects which are ubiquitous in mathematics and                         mathematical physics.  Four-manifolds are cosmologically                        important, since we live in a manifold of three space dimensions                plus one time dimension."

The problems considered are handled by a variety of techniques,                 coming from differential topology (cutting and pasting,                         transversality, transformation groups), homotopy theory (homotopy               groups of spheres, plus construction, S-duality), and algebra                   (homological algebra, combinatorial group theory, symmetric                     forms).                                                                              Part 1 is an investigation of certain classes of higher-                   dimensional knots.  The first class consists of knots which are                 not determined by their complements.  Only recently has it been                 proved that such knots do not occur in 3-space.  On the other                   hand, the investigator has since shown that such knots do occur                 in at least a quarter of all higher dimensions.  He intends to                  find inequivalent knots with the same complement in the missing                 dimensions.  The second class consists of certain knots whose                   complements have cyclic fundamental group.  The classification of               such knots will be pursued by means of algebraic invariants                     associated to their complements.  The third class consists of                   knotted higher-genus surfaces in 4-space.  That this is a much                  richer collection than that of ordinary knotted 2-spheres will be               shown by an analysis of the  peripheral structure of the knot                   groups.                                                                              Part 2 concerns a special class of closed manifolds -- those               obtained by spinning lower-dimensional ones about framed                        submanifolds of spheres.  Using a generalized Pontrjagin-Thom                   construction, the investigator will carry out the homotopy                      classification of such manifolds in certain cases.  Applications                to the bordism classification of homology spheres will be given.                   Part 3 describes an ongoing program with S. Jekel for                        computing the homology of the classifying space for codimension-                one real analytic singular foliations.  The investigator outlines               the calculation of the homology of discrete groups of jets of                   local diffeomorphisms, and of some related nilpotent groups.                    In short, the investigator will apply himself on the one hand, to               some very concrete geometric problems concerning higher                         dimensional knots and symmetries of manifolds, and on the other                 hand, to enlarging the scope of algebraic tools for attacking                   such problems."

In particular, the investigator wishes to use 2-torsion                instanton invariants to study the result of taking connected sums               with S2 x S2.  Using the relation of these torsion invariants                   with the usual Donaldson invariants and using Z2-invariant                      theory, the investigator hopes to deduce universal relations for                certain Donaldson invariants.  He also plans to search for the                  proper setting for relative torsion invariants.

On the one hand, four-dimensional manifolds are                  cosmologically important, since we live in a manifold of three                  space dimensions and one time dimension.  On the other hand, and                more surprisingly, notions from quantum mechanics have led to new               topological invariants of manifolds."

One of the problems Thompson will work on               is the property-P conjecture.   A knot in the 3-sphere is said                  to have property P if no non-trivial surgery on the knot yields a               homotopy 3-sphere.  It has long been conjectured that all non-                  trivial knots in the 3-sphere have property P.  Gordon and Luecke               have recently shown that non-trivial surgery on a non-trivial                   knot cannot yield the 3-sphere itself.  There remains the                       possibility that one could do surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere                 and obtain a counter-example to the Poincare conjecture.  The                   suggested approach to this problem involves a generalization of                 work of Gabai on sutured manifolds, as well as considering the                  equivalent problem of whether one can do surgery on a knot in a                 fake 3-sphere and obtain S3.  In addition, recent work with                     Scharlemann has suggested several interesting questions about                   imbedded finite graphs in 3-manifolds.  Thompson will try to                    generalize their work characterizing unknotted planar graphs in                 S3 to arbitrary finite graphs in the 3-sphere.                                       These are fundamental questions about three-manifolds.  The                fact that they are open points up how much we still do not know                 about three-dimensional manifolds.  This is so despite the fact                 that we live in one, and so such topological questions might even               have cosmological significance."

It generalizes                   classical notions of Reidemeister torsion.  One goal is to find a               better understanding of the weak K-theory of the von Neumann                    algebra of G, where the invariant lives.  The principal                         investigator wants to show by computation that the invariant                    carries a lot of information in interesting cases, including                    homology 3-spheres, hyperbolic manifolds, crystallographic                      manifolds and symmetric spaces.  Another problem is to give an                  analytic interpretation in terms of the spectral theory of the                  Laplace operator.

An algebraic                  description was developed by the principal investigator and                     Andrew Ranicki.  It will be used to make explicit calculations,                 to prove vanishing results, which have geometric meaning and                    applications, and to establish a general signature formula for                  fibre bundles.                                                                       The first project is a joint project together with Professor               Melvin Rothenberg of the University of Chicago, the second with                 Professor Andrew Ranicki of the University of Edinburgh.  Both                  combine topology, analysis, and algebra in genuine synthesis.                   Their principal value may be generating new tools for                           understanding manifolds and their symmetries.  Manifolds are, of                course, very basic geometric objects and arise almost everywhere                one looks in mathematics and physics, often as solutions of                     systems of ordinary or differential equations."

Over the years the conference has managed to maintain                its traditional core of point set topology, general topology, and               continuum theory and at the same time expand its breadth.                       Dynamical systems was integrated into the conference in 1987 and                has become one of the central topics.  Low dimensional manifold                 topology has been included for somewhat longer.                                      This year there will be seven invited one-hour plenary                     addresses, one of which will be of a general nature to the                      university community.  In addition, there will be about twenty                  invited half-hour talks, parallel sessions of 15-minute                         contributed talks, and three or four problem sessions.  At least                one Japanese topologist will give an invited talk.  Hour talks                  will be given by Alan Dow (York University, Ontario, Canada), Lex               Oversteegen (University of Alabama), and Robion Kirby (University               of California at Berkeley).

Two words are equal if and                  only if after iteratively canceling consecutive occurrences of a                letter and its inverse the two words become the same.  Gromov                   initiated the study of a class of groups, called ""negatively                    curved,"" that share some of the computational ease of a free                    group.

In the first problem,                 the investigator will study certain third-order periodic                        phenomena in the stable homotopy groups of spheres.  This is a                  continuation of a general program for studying the global                       behavior of stable homotopy groups of spheres, as formulated by                 Miller, Revenel and Wilson.

Bascially, homotopy theory is a tool for investigating the                 topology of spheres in all dimensions and other such natural                    geometric objects.

The                       symmetry investigations will include questions about low-                       dimensional manifolds and the applications of surgery theory and                homotopy theory to problems involving higher-dimensional                        manifolds; much of the latter will involve symmetries whose                     singular sets have relatively large dimension and comparing the                 possible classifications of such actions with cases where the                   singular set dimension is relatively small.  All these problems                 will be studied by a combination of methods from algebraic and                  geometric topology, with input from stable and unstable homotopy                theory, the theory of surgery on manifolds, topological and                     differentiable transformation groups, and low-dimensional                       topological methods, including gauge theory.  The objective of                  the work is an improved understanding of some questions about the               existence of positively curved metrics and the existence and                    classification of certain symmetries; these questions have                      generally arisen in connection with recent advances in geometric                topology.                                                                            Manifolds are ubiquitons in mathematics, arising naturally                 as the solutions of systems of equations in higher dimensional                  spaces.  As to low-dimensional manifolds, we live in one,                       three-dimensional or four-dimensional, depending on whether the                 time dimension is considered as well as the three space                         dimensions.  More information about symmetries of manifolds,                    their curvature, and other properties is thus bound to be useful.                                                                                                                                           //"

A link in                a 3-dimensional manifold, M, is a collection of circles embedded                in M.  A knot is a link of one component.  The work this year                   will have two aspects:  (1) understanding when a non-hyperbolic                 manifold results from Dehn surgery on a knot with hyperbolic                    complement, (2) generalizing results about Dehn surgery on knots                to results about Dehn surgery on links with more than one                       component.

Cohen plans to pursue several projects involving                      algebraic topological questions arising in gauge theory.  One                   project, joint work with J.D.S. Jones, involves finding an                      explicit relationship between representations of braid groups and               families of elliptic operators coupled to SU(2) monopoles.                      Another project is to pursue joint work with Jones and G. Segal                 on Morse theory.  Given a Morse function on a compact manifold,                 they have described an explicit simplicial space decomposition of               the manifold using classifying space theory.  They plan to                      investigate the applicability and implications of these                         techniques to various infinite dimensional settings; for example,               the Chern-Simons functional and the Yang-Mills functional.                           Milgram plans to study the geometry of moduli spaces of                    holomorphic bundles, concentrating on SU(2)-instantons over S4                  regarded as equivalence classes of based holomorphic bundles on                 CP1 x CP1.  He also expects to continue his study of the geometry               and homology of sporadic groups and exceptional Lie groups.                     Finally, he hopes to work with R. Penner on the relations between               moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and representations of                        symmetric groups.                                                                    Mrowka plans to pursue three projects.  The first is to                    prove there are 4-manifolds homotopic to a K3 surface which do                  not admit any complex structures.  The second is to study the                   effect on the Donaldson polynomial of the existence of embedded                 S2's or T2's.  Finally, with K. Walker, he hopes to study gauge-                theoretic generalizations of the Casson invariant.                                   The connections between geometry and physics involved in                   this work are striking.  They work both ways.  While much of the                motivation for studying four-dimensional manifolds, Lie groups,                 and group representations may once have come from the hope of                   calculating things of interest to physicists, in recent years                   notions inspired by quantum physics have given rise repeatedly to               constructions of new topological invariants that answered                       questions the topologists could not answer before."

She has shown that a large class of                      minimal symplectic 4-manifolds (those containing ""nice""                         symplectically embedded 2-spheres) carry a unique symplectic                    structure in each cohomology class.  She intends to continue                    this work: for example, to see if she can extend the above result               to manifolds which contain a symplectically embedded surface of                 higher genus, or to see if she can find a 4-manifold which                      supports different symplectic and Kahler structures in the same                 cohomology class.  The class of symplectic 4-manifolds lies                     between the class of Kahler surfaces and the class of smooth 4-                 manifolds, and, if it turns out that symplectic 4-manifolds                     behave nicely enough, one might be able to use information on                   their structure to obtain information on the class of 4-manifolds               itself.                                                                              Professor Jones will continue his joint research with F. T.                Farrell.  One of their most recent results states that the                      surgery L-groups and the rational algebraic K-groups for the                    group ring ZG can be computed in a simple way from the L-groups                 and rational K-groups of group rings ZG', where G' is any                       virtually cyclic subgroup G' in G provided G is a co-compact                    discrete subgroup of a virtually connected Lie group.  In the                   next three years they hope to prove this same result for more                   general groups G.                                                                    Symplectic manifolds arise in the study of mechanics, both                 classical and quantum.  Lie groups are also ubiquitous in                       mechanics.  It would seem that mathematics and theoretical                      physics are not entirely distinct subjects at this level."

Of                  particular significance is a program for discovering the geometric              structure of stratified spaces.  The problem is to understand the               neighborhood of the singular set.  It is conjectured that such a                neighborhood has ""teardrop structure.""  A positive solution to this             conjecture would enable one to extend to stratified spaces many                 fundamental results previously known only for manifolds or for                  especially rigid stratifications.  Other applications include                   generalized Novikov conjectures, groups acting topologically on                 manifolds, and the improvement of maps between manifolds.  The                  central tool to be used in this research is the theory of manifold              approximate fibrations, previously classified by the principal                  investigator and his collaborators.  One aspect of this project is              to extend that work to the stratified setting.                                       Manifolds are the main object of study in topology.  They are              the spaces which are locally euclidean spaces.  The ultimate goal               is to classify manifolds and their symmetries.  Controlled topology             has become the most powerful new technique in the study of high-                dimensional manifolds since the development of surgery theory.                  Even more dramatically, controlled topology is showing its full                 force in the study of manifolds with singularities.  These                      stratified spaces include polyhedra, complex algebraic varieties,               orbit spaces of group actions on manifolds, and certain limits of               Riemannian manifolds."

There are three                  main areas of effort. The first is the application of                           classification and quantification techniques in knot theory to                  the analysis of enzyme-DNA three-dimensional structure and enzyme               mechanism. Mathematical models, such as the tangle model, will be               developed and perfected, the aim being to produce a mathematical                tool of use to the experimental molecular biologist. The                        mathematics used here is recent work in the theory of                           3-manifolds, and the biological input is experimental results                   obtained from the topological approach to enzymology. The second                area is the study of the topological entanglement of random                     chains in 3-space.  Random chain entanglement statistics are                    related to the conformational entropy of a polymer system in                    dilute solution.  Asymptotic entanglement (as the length goes to                infinity) is reasonably well understood; the fundamental problem                of scientific interest is the description and computation of                    entanglement at finite lengths.  Both rigorous mathematics and                  simulation techniques will be employed.   The third area is the                 topological description of spiral wave patterns in excitable                    media.     The methods of differential topology and obstruction                 theory will be used to provide necessary and sufficient                         conditions for the existence and time evolution of patterns on                  bounded orientable 3-manifolds.                                                      A central problem in molecular biology is to deal with                     long-chain DNA molecules. The way they fold, replicate, and                     recombine is intimately bound up with their functions. The                      behavior of long-chain polymers in solution is a more general                   form of the same questions. Important applications arise in                     genetic engineering, the design of drugs, and the development of                long-chain polymers for industrial and technological uses.  Knot                theory is a part of topology that studies exactly these kinds of                questions: how structures fold and recombine and replicate."

The principal investigator will continue his research on                   several open questions in set-theoretic topology.  One theme is                 normality and countable paracompactness versus paracompactness in               locally compact spaces.  Several longstanding problems in this area             remain unsettled, e.g., the Arhangel'skii-Tall problem (Are normal              locally compact metacompact spaces paracompact?) and Watson's                   problem (Is there a perfectly normal locally compact non-                       paracompact space in ZFC?)  Another problem has led to interesting              combinatorics involving ladder systems that will likely have                    further applications.  Other problems to be investigated include                the existence of Dowker filters, and questions of Watson and Cook               involving connectedness.  Possible methods of solution include set-             theoretic axioms and combinatorics, and forcing.  Solutions to the              problems would deepen our understanding of fundamental topological              properties and constructions, and would likely require new                      techniques applicable to a variety of other problems."

Mather, and William P.               Thurston), one postdoctoral associate (Lang-Fang Wu), and three                 advanced graduate students.  Their research topics are quite                    various.                                                                             Browder will study free actions of certain topological                     groups on finite-dimensional spaces.  He will also study fixed                  point theorems and regularity of minimal surfaces.                                   Hsiang will work on a number of problems related to the                    cyclotomic trace map, including the notorious Novikov conjecture                in L-theory as well as some more tractable ones.                                     Mather's research deals with area-preserving diffeomorphisms               of infinite cylinders.  There are several hard conjectures about                invariant curves under diffeomorphisms and their rotation                       numbers.                                                                             Thurston will work toward his famous geometrization                        conjecture for 3-manifolds.  In addition, he will work on                       automatic groups, self-similar tilings, one-dimensional real and                complex dynamical systems, and other topics.                                         Wu's research concerns the Ricci Flow equations on manifolds               and orbifolds.                                                                       All these topics are in the mainstream of research in                      topology.  It is appropriate to involve graduate students in                    their study.  For example, the geometrization conjecture of                     Thurston is a notoriously difficult problem.  It subsumes the                   Poincare Conjecture, which dates to the turn of the century.                    Nevertheless, pieces of it have been the stuff of numerous Ph.D                 theses by Thurston's students for more than a decade."

He will                           investigate the consequences for string theory, elliptic                        cohomology, algebraic K-theory, knot theory, and the problem of                 defining degree three, non-abelian, sheaf cohomology.                                The basic idea is to use a smooth version of Deligne                       cohomology, and the transgression to the free loop space.  This                 will be interpreted as a generalized holonomy map.  The category                will be constructed by deducing which geometric structure has a                 given gerb as its holonomy.  McLaughlin discovered the object                   representing the first Pontrjagin class in this way.                                 This work will give a new geometric insight into Deligne                   cohomology, as the objects constructed actually lie in this more                refined theory.  There will in turn, be consequences for                        algebraic K-theory, using Beilinson's regulator.  The very                      existence of the transgression raises the possibility of a deep                 relationship between Chen's iterated integrals and Deligne                      cohomology, refining the work of Getzler, Jones and Petrack.                    McLaughlin has obtained preliminary formulae in this direction,                 which emphasize the extraordinary role played by the cup product.                    This program offers a candidate for the geometric cocycle in               elliptic cohomology.  The object in question is a ""fake""                        infinite-dimensional vector bundle associated to a gerb.  It                    looks locally like a vector bundle but glues together in a                      different way.  This approach has the advantage of reconciling                  all the standard conjectures about elliptic cohomology and will                 be a priority in the proposed research.                                              This ""fake"" bundle can also be studied as a substitute for                 the string bundle on loop space, opening the way for a rigorous                 index theory of strings.  Finally, in the case of a three-                      manifold M, this object actually transgresses to give a new                     structure on the space of knots in M.  The implications for knot                theory will be fully investigated.                                                   The overall objective of this project is to unify several                  deep and currently disparate areas of topology.  This will be                   done by showing how analytic techniques employed in their study                 are different aspects of a common ancestor.  Applications are                   envisioned to the theory of knots and to other active areas of                  geometry and topology."

In turn,                 these topological properties can be used to answer fundamental                  questions about nonlinear problems.  Professor Damon has been                   developing topological analogues of the infinitesimal methods of                Mather for answering questions about the topological                            classification of singularities.  He has also discovered that the               methods used for these results are closely related to quite                     different questions concerning the topology of discriminants and                symmetry breaking problems in bifurcation theory.  He hopes to                  develop further results for topological equivalence questions, to               use recent developments to explore topology of discriminants and                symmetry breaking for compact Lie groups, and to investigate the                application of classification results for singularities of                      solutions of differential equations.

Some of the most interesting solutions to systems of equations,                 both ordinary and differential, are the singular ones.  In                      applications, it is often impossible to confine attention to the                regular solutions to problems, and knowledge about the nature of                singularities and about symmetry breaking is fraught with                       physical significance."

In its full                       generality, the solvability of this problem is still an open                    question, but for a large class of 3-manifolds, the corresponding               problem has been solved.  Typically, those algorithms which                     completely solve a Recognition Problem are slow (i.e., of                       exponential time-demand), while the fast (polynomial-time)                      algorithms give only partial results.

These problems involve independence and                          consistency results in axiomatic set theory.  This means that the               problem is to show that some particular statement cannot be                     proved from the usual axioms of set theory.                                          The main technique used is forcing.  The forcing method was                first invented by Paul J. Cohen in the sixties to show that the                 continuum hypothesis is independent of the usual axioms of set                  theory.

The second area is to                        investigate pathological or peculiar subsets of the real line.                       Understanding set theoretic properties of the real line has                obvious foundational significance.

Surgery                   theory is a fundamental tool in this area.  It is a construction                which, in certain circumstances, allows one to modify a manifold                by 'cutting and pasting', thereby changing the manifold's                       homotopy type.  The technique has many important applications.                  The study of the obstructions to doing surgery on a manifold has                become a subject in its own right, giving rise to various                       theories which model surgery in an algebraic setting.                                Poincare' spaces have the same algebraic topological                       properties as manifolds but are homotopy theoretic in nature.                   Since many of the applications of surgery theory on manifolds                   involve the use of Poincare' spaces, one would like to have a                   theory of Poincare' surgery.

The space in                   which we live is either a 3-dimensional or a 4-dimensional                      manifold, depending upon whether one includes or excludes the                   time dimension.  Improving and simplifying the technical tools                  for investigating properties of manifolds is thus a fundamental                 and important endeavor."

Among these results is the discovery of nonstandard                   smooth structures on real 4-space.  This project investigates three             problems related to 4-manifolds:  1) The Donaldson invariants of                manifolds; 2) the behavior at infinity of the 'fake' smooth                     structures on real 4-space; and 3) the explicit computation of                  several of Donaldson's invariants.                                                   This project lies at the interface of topology and physics.                A 4-manifold may be represented by 3 space coordinates and a time               coordinate.  It has recently been proven that the standard                      Euclidean smooth structure on 4-space when restricted to certain                subsets homeomorphic to 4-space gives a smooth structure which is               not diffeomorphic to the standard one.  Thus, there exist exotic 4-             dimensional manifolds.  This research concerns the geometric and                differential properties of these exotic 4-manifolds."

The problems which will be studied cover a large spectrum of                    questions, ranging from very specific problems concerning low-                  dimensional manifolds to general problems concerning the geometry               of positively curved higher dimensional manifolds.

Taking time                  into account, physical space becomes a four-dimensional manifold.               Whether it is globally Euclidean four-space or some other,                      possibly bounded, four-dimensional manifold is a deep question of               cosmology.  Answering this question is not a matter for                         mathematics alone, but exploring the various possibilities is an                important and properly mathematical matter."

The first project, with Menasco, aims at an                algorithmic solution to the link problem via the theory of                      braids.  If successful, work on the main theorem, which may be                  described as ""Markov's Theorem with stabilization,"" will                        establish the existence of an algorithmic solution to the knot                  problem by showing that there is a series of complexity-reducing                moves which take an arbitrary closed braid representative of a                  knot to one which has minimum complexity.  The implementation of                the algorithm will require, in addition, recognizing when certain               complexity-reducing moves are applicable.  The second project is                an investigation of the knot invariants of Vassiliev.  One goal                 is to estimate the number of Vassiliev invariants of order i, and               perhaps prove that this number grows without bound.  The third                  concerns John Moody's recent counterexample to the faithfulness                 of Burau representations and its relevance to the corresponding                 question for the Jones representations.  Birman hopes to identify               the kernel of the Burau representation.  The final project                      concerns understanding whether the collection of all Jones                      invariants can be faithful on knot and link types.                                   Morgan intends to work on three related areas of topology:                 (i) actions of groups on trees; (ii) computation of Donaldson                   invariants for algebraic surfaces, using algebraic geometry; and                (iii) computations of Donaldson invariants of 4-manifolds which                 are made of two pieces joined by a long cylindrical tube.  The                  first project, with R. Skora, concerns the classification of free               actions of groups on R-trees, and in particular, the question of                which groups act freely.  They have been studying groups which                  are certain types of non-trivial free products with amalgamation                or HNN-extensions.  They propose to expand this study to more                   general amalgams.  Projects (ii) and (iii) concern Donaldson's                  invariants for smooth 4-manifolds.  Project (ii) explores                       connections with algebraic geometry.  Morgan and R. Friedman have               partially computed these invariants for elliptic surfaces of                    general type and propose to extend their computations, especially               those for elliptic surfaces.  Project (iii) explores some purely                analytic, differential geometric questions, particularly, the ASD               connections of finite energy on infinite cylinders, in order to                 provide a link between embedded riemann surfaces in a 4-manifold                and the values of the Donaldson invariant.                                           These are projects in topology which interact heavily with                 other areas of mathematics, e.g., algebra, algebraic geometry,                  and even mathematical physics.  Progress could take many                        different forms, and it is encouraging to note the variety of                   interested parties."

This pairing is a ""lift"" to the real numbers of                the Abel-Jacobi homomorphism in Algebraic Geometry.  The initial                definition is by differential forms with suitable singularities                 (going back to Gauss in Euclidean 3-space).  The investigator                   studies an exactly analogous complex linking number (originally                 due to Beilinson and Bloch) called the (Archimedean) Height                     Pairing.  This pairing enters into their conjectures relating                   cycles and values of L-functions, but it has been possible to                   calculate it in extremely few cases.  The investigator will                     consider an equivalent construction of the pairings based on the                kernel of the heat operator.  It turns out that this new approach               is well-suited for obtaining concrete formulas in some cases,                   e.g., cycles introduced by B. Gross and C. Schoen involving                     correspondences on a product of three curves.  The investigator                 would like to use this approach in many more cases coming from                  Algebraic and Riemannian Geometry, and also to find relations                   with index theorems and with Quantum Field Theory.                                   Basically, the investigator and his student Bin Wang will                  attempt to make more accessible a previously defined invariant of               Riemannian manifolds.  Their approach will be two-fold.  First,                 they will explore an alternative to the former abstract                         definition, one which is rooted in geometric and physical                       concepts and so may provide more insight.  Second, they will use                this approach to calculate the invariant explicitly in more                     cases, again in the hope of assisting insight into its true                     meaning."

The commonality of method here is surprising.  A deep and                  highly evolved algebraic theory, K-theory, is to be brought to                  bear upon symmetry questions which are very far apart in                        appearance.  On the one hand are subtle topological questions                   about knots.  On the other hand are subtle combinatorial and                    statistical questions about infinite strings of symbols.

The investigator's               efforts have been directed to remedying this situation and have                 had some gratifying successes."

Their common theme centers on                      automorphism groups of various kinds of spaces.  Primarily these                spaces are manifolds of various dimensions, but also addressed                  here are issues concerning more general kinds of spaces, such as                trees or complexes.  What kinds of groups can effectively act on                such spaces?  What does the space tell one about the group?  This               leads to focusing on the groups themselves, and how they                        decompose, or how they can act on other simple spaces, for                      example, trees.  It is worthwhile to understand the topology of                 various possible classifying spaces for these groups, and what                  they look like at infinity.                                                          In addition to the principal investigator, R. D. Edwards,                  two faculty associates, Mladen Bestvina and Geoffrey Mess, and                  two advanced graduate students are involved.  The work of all                   participants focuses on abstract spaces and the application of                  algebraic methods to their classification and understanding.                    There has been an enormous amount of activity in all of these                   areas in recent years, and there is much opportunity for further                progress."

The first project is a continuation of joint work with R. Lee (Yale University) in which the investigations are focused on: (a) the least genus problem for embedded surfaces, (b) obstruction theory for embeddings, and (c) topological rigidity of simple embeddings. The second project concerns finite group actions on 4-manifolds, with emphasis on the question of smoothability and methods of classification. The third project concerns nonorientable 4-manifolds and their exotic smooth structures. Manifolds are very natural geometric objects, being the locally Euclidean ones. Answering questions about four- dimensional manifolds, in particular, may have cosmological significance, for we live in a manifold of three space dimensions and one time-dimension."

The principal task is to search for some satisfactory understanding of those ""exceptional"" Dehn surgeries which yield reducible or boundary reducible 3-manifolds. For the boundary reducibility problems, he will concentrate on the 1- bridge conjecture for surgeries on knots in handlebodies. For the reducibility problems, he will start by searching for more examples of exceptional Dehn surgeries, as this will hopefully lead to some intrinsic (probably even a complete) understanding of the reducibility of surgered manifolds. Also, he will study the cabling conjecture for surgeries on knots in 3-manifolds which contain a non-separating reducing sphere. Three-dimensional manifolds are very basic objects of geometric interest. They are spaces which have the local character of Euclidean 3-space but may be globally much more complicated. Examples in two-dimensions are easier to picture -- many surfaces are not the plane but would appear to be to ants crawling on them. Since we live in a 3-dimensional manifold, ignoring the time dimension, they are of cosmological interest as well, and there is a surprising amount not known about them."

Several well- known problems, mostly involving topological spaces in the classes of normal or normal locally compact spaces, will be studied by the investigators. It is expected that set-theoretic techniques such as forcing, infinite combinatorics and large cardinals will be the principle tools used in the eventual solution of these problems. Set theory lies at the foundations of mathematics in that all of mathematics can in principle be built up from set theory, albeit laboriously, by adding appropriate definitions, deriving consequences from the chosen axioms, and then compressing their statements by use of the definitions. Some topics lie closer to set theory, however, by virtue of needing fewer added definitions in this process. Classical set-theoretic topology is such a subject, really a very close neighbor, and so it shares some of the philosophical importance of set theory itself."

Integrals of monomials of Miller- Morita-Mumford classes over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces should be computable using intersection theory on an appropriate V- manifold compactification of moduli space; in particular, all the necessary ingredients seem to be in place for applying this scheme to the computation of Weil-Petersson volumes for once-punctured surfaces. There is also a ""universal"" analog of the decorated Teichmuller space, and essentially all of the classical structures extend to this setting; he hopes the study of this universal space will shed light on the classical theory. He furthermore hopes to compute the complex structure of moduli in his coordinates. Computer work will be pursued to derive the combinatorial structure of the moduli space of once-punctured surfaces of genus three, and he hopes explicitly to compute the homology of this spaces. Finally, a program has evolved for extending some of his work to the setting of closed surfaces. Teichmuller theory is a seventy year-old blend of algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and topology. As such, advances will interest a broad spectrum of mathematicians. Some also have a bearing on string theory, so some theoretical physicists have a stake in this research as well."
