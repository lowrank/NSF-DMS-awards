The conference will be held on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln during the period May 17 - May 21, 2009.  Groups are a useful mathematical tool which originated in the study of symmetry, including research on symmetries of crystal lattices in chemistry.  Many of the applications of work in semigroup theory also lie in the study of local (instead of global) symmetries of objects, as well as their use as an algebraic tool in computer science for studying the operation of finite state machines.  <br/><br/>The aim of this conference is to stimulate cooperative research among group theorists and semigroup theorists who are using related techniques.  Research in both group theory and semigroup theory has burgeoned in recent years, with many new tools and ideas connecting these areas to topology, geometry, dynamical systems, symbolic computation, and combinatorics.  The new methods developed in each of group theory and semigroup theory have great potential for further <br/>applications in both areas.  The conference will highlight recent developments in these fields, with a focus on asymptotic and algorithmic properties.  In addition to the dissemination of recent ideas on topics in group theory and semigroup theory, the conference will provide a setting for the participants to collaborate and establish connections with each other, bridging group theory and semigroup theory.  The conference will also help recent Ph.D.'s and graduate students to interact with leading researchers in the area and gain a broader knowledge of their research field.<br/><br/>"

Since 1961, topologists at the University of Georgia have organized and hosted a major two week long international topology  conference every 8 years. The 1961, 1969, 1977, 1985, 1993 and 2001 conferences came at times when fundamental new ideas were surfacing that set the direction of research in topology in the following years. Our conferences highlighted these ideas and focused attention on new promising directions of research. We aim to do the same with the 2009 conference, by highlighting exciting new developments, including advances in Heegaard Floer homology, contact and symplectic topology, broken Lefschetz fibrations, hyperbolic three-manifolds, applications of Ricci flow, quantum invariants of knots and links, and other new developments.<br/><br/>The purpose of the 2009 conference is to have the most important results obtained during the last few years in geometric topology and related geometry presented to a wide topological audience and to be a place for communication and interchange of new ideas. Our conference has historically generated great interest among established researchers, but also among graduate students and recent PhD's. We have always paid special attention to inviting young researchers in topology to speak. The combination of speakers and topics to be presented will offer students and fresh PhD's a great opportunity to listen to and interact with the leaders in the subject as well as with successful mathematicians at the beginning of their careers. We will publish a proceedings, similar to those published by Prentice-Hall in 1961, Markam in 1969,  Academic Press in 1977, Dekker in 1985, AMS and International Press in 1997, and AMS in 2003. Previous proceedings of the Georgia Topology Conference have been among the best of any conference proceedings. To continue the tradition, we will invite all speakers to submit articles, and we will enlist conference participants to help review submitted articles for the proceedings.<br/><br/>"

One of the primary ways the project will accomplish this is by using tools from symplectic geometry, gauge theory, and quantum algebra. Many of these tools come packaged as algebraic invariants e.g. Floer homology theories or combinatorial knot invariants.  A byproduct of the project will be a deepened understanding of the invariants themselves, clarifying  the relationships between them and the internal structure of their underlying theories. Specific goals include understanding  the knotted curves in the three-dimensional sphere on which a surgery procedure produces  simple manifolds, a general exploration of the knots which arise from algebraic curves in  projective surfaces, and understanding the extent of, and method by which, combinatorial invariants detect geometric objects e.g. whether Khovanov homology detects the unknot.<br/><br/><br/>The study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, and knotted curves and surfaces within them, is a central task to our understanding of both large and small scale aspects of the universe.  Determining the shape of the universe depends upon a mathematical understanding of the possible shapes that could occur and the properties these shapes have.  These properties are known as invariants, and the project furthers our understanding of space by the discovery of new invariants and the study of existing invariants.  In this pursuit it has been quite fruitful to examine the way in which curves and surfaces can be tied in knots.  This kind of knotting is not only relevant to understanding the shape of space, but has recently become significant in the study of DNA. Confined to a small space, long strands of DNA naturally become knotted, and certain processes depend upon an understanding of the complexity of these knots.  Applications of this project include effective ways of measuring different types of complexity of knots.<br/>"

The plan to attack to unsolved problems in 4-manifold theory is to  decompose 4-manifolds into basic, easy to understand, pieces, which are called Corks, Plugs and Palfs, and study these pieces by applying techniques from complex and symplectic manifold theory. Questions about knottedness and uniqueness of Corks are particularly important in this context. An immediate consequence of these techniques is the construction of exotic Stein manifolds. The P.I. also plans to work on certain classes of 7 and 8 dimensional manifolds (so called G2 and Spin(7) manifolds). By studying  the certain families of 3 and 4 dimensional submanifolds in them (so called associative and Cayley submanifolds) the P.I. hopes to get a global understanding of the gauge theories of low dimensional manifolds, and to construct a counting theory for these submanifolds (similar to Gromov-Witten counting theory of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds). Also intended is  to explain mirror duality in terms of G2 manifolds. Finally the P.I.  wants to continue working on the project of topological characterization of real algebraic sets. <br/><br/><br/>4-dimensional manifolds (spaces) appear to decompose into small basic pieces (particles) which we call ""Corks"" and ""Plugs"". These pieces determine the exotic structures of the underlying 4-manifold. One  can think of corks and plugs as freely moving particles in 4-manifolds like Fermions and Bosons in physics, or  little knobs on a wall to turn on and off; the ambient exotic lights in a room. The P.I. plans to study the structure of these Corks and Plugs. The P.I. also plans to study G2 and Spin(7) manifolds (certain 7 and 8 dimensional spaces), which are of current interest in physicists, because they play important role in the String theory and M-theory. The P.I. also plans to work on the problem of determining which topological spaces are algebraic sets. Making a topological space algebraic helps us to understand many of the properties of the space."

Another striking development is the proof by Qui and Scharlemann of the Gordon conjecture showing that the sum of two Heegaard splittings is stabilized if and only if one of the original Heegaard splittings was stabilized. Kroneheimer and Mrowka used the connection between contact structures on a 3-manifold and the induced symplectic structure on certain related 4-manifolds to prove Property $P$. Yi Ni used the connection between Heegaard Floer homology and sutured manifolds in his proof of the fibered knot conjecture. All of these results are very new and the techniques used are likely to open the doors to many other long standing problems in low dimensional topology. The goal of this conference is to disseminate these ideas, and in particular to introduce junior topologists to these new developments.<br/><br/>Low dimensional topology studies the structure of 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds. These are objects that locally look like 3 and 4 dimensional balls. Many physical objects of interest to other sciences can be studied via techniques stemming from low dimensional topology.   Examples of such objects are DNA molecules, proteins, and even our universe. Partly because of its wide applications low dimensional topology has attracted the attention of many mathematicians and new discoveries are being made at breathtaking pace. The goal of the proposed conference is to bring together leading researchers in low-dimensional topology and allow for an exchange of information and ideas."

The methods used to solve these problems include techniques from combinatorial topology, enumerative combinatorics and representation theory of finite groups.  The software packages GAP and Kenzo will be used to assist in the formulation of conjectures and the checking of results.<br/><br/>It has been known since antiquity that there are five regular convex polyhedra: the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron.  Each polyhedron has the property that all of its faces are of the same type: squares in the case of the cube, pentagons in the case of the dodecahedron and triangles in the other cases.  There are other examples of highly symmetric polyhedra in which there are two or more types of faces.  A familiar example is a soccer ball, which has 12 pentagonal faces and 20 hexagonal faces.  The proposed research considers higher dimensional symmetric polyhedra (called ``polytopes'') with more than one type of face, and studies how the topology of these objects changes when faces of a certain type are removed (to form a ``polytopal subcomplex'').  In the soccer ball example, one obtains 12 disconnected patches if the hexagonal faces are removed, and a two-dimensional surface with 12 two-dimensional holes if the pentagonal faces are removed.  After the faces are removed, the object retains all its original symmetry.  The proposed research will also consider homology representations, which describe the relationship between the symmetries of the object and the resulting holes."

In all three cases, the computations themselves are strongly related: there is a subtle interplay between the algebraic action of a finite group (be they automorphisms of a fixed formal group, the circle action on topological Hochschild homology, or the action of a Galois group) and the geometry of Thom spectra over the classifying spaces. In particular, our goals are threefold: (1) find a procedure to systematically determine the homotopy ring of the Hopkins-Miller higher real K-theory spectra EO_n(G) (this is joint with Hopkins and Ravenel), (2) better standing the Bokstedt-Hsiang-Madsen TR and TC machinery and the algebraic K-theory of basic chromatic spectra, and (3) use the standard techniques of algebraic topology to provide foundational computations in motivic homotopy.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of algebraic topology is to systematically build a connection between algebraic objects like numbers and topological objects like spaces. These connections are self-reinforcing: problems in algebra become problems in topology which are further refined into algebra, and much of modern algebraic topology relies heavily on the ways spaces themselves can be described more algebraically. This project exploits this connection in multiple ways. First, in trying to understand how to build spaces out of spheres, one encounters the problem of computing a large family of invariants: the homotopy groups of spheres. This has been a very active part of algebraic topology since the 1930s, and the first part of the project is to compute other, related rings which act as increasingly good approximations. Second, the recent developments allow a two-way interchange between classical questions about rings and structured spectra. In particular, this project seeks to better understand the algebraic objects using more geometrical constructions."

This project will use Lefschetz fibrations in conjunction with invariants coming from Floer homology to study several related questions. First, the PI has shown that several geometric operations on 4-manifolds can be realized as instances of monodromy substitutions in Lefschetz fibrations, coming from new relations in the mapping class group. The PI will pursue this line of inquiry with the goal of finding new constructions of exotic 4-manifolds. Second, the PI will use the technology of relative Ozsváth-Szabó invariants (developed in joint work of the PI and S. Jabuka) to produce new examples of contact 3-manifolds admitting infinitely many topologically equivalent but smoothly distinct Stein fillings, extending previous joint work. Next is the topological meaning of the Ozsváth-Szabó invariants themselves: for example, do the Ozsváth-Szabó invariants provide constraints on the sorts of Lefschetz structures supported by a given 4-manifold? Conversely, can one calculate the Ozsváth-Szabó invariants of a Lefschetz fibration from its monodromy representation? Finally, he will continue to develop the theory of perturbed Heegaard Floer homology, which will expand the utility of the Heegaard Floer ""package.""<br/><br/><br/>Since Einstein's description of mechanics and electrodynamics as inherently a four-dimensional theory, the observed universe has generally been conceived as a smooth four-dimensional manifold: that is, a four-dimensional analog of a smooth surface such as a plane or sphere. A fundamental question is then: what manifold is it? To pose a simplified analogy, the surface of the earth is generally ``flat'' when viewed by a casual observer, but it is a mistake to infer that it is planar. The universe is similarly ""mostly flat"" on an appropriate distance scale, but its global topology or ""shape"" is not known. A goal of the 4-manifold topologist, then, is to describe the list of possibilities for the underlying structure of the universe, in analogy with the relatively easy-to-understand list of possible surfaces from which a ""generally flat"" object like the surface of the earth can select (sphere, torus, etc.). Perhaps not coincidentally, the theory of smooth 4-dimensional manifolds is vastly more complicated than the analogous theory in any other dimension. Indeed, surprisingly little is known regarding important and basic existence and uniqueness questions for smooth 4-manifolds. The work supported by this grant will approach several of these questions by making use of a Lefschetz fibration (or similar geometric structure) on a 4-manifold, together with the invariants of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds provided by recently-developed mathematical tools that are based on ideas from gauge-theoretic physics."

The focus is on Schubert, Birkhoff and Richardson varieties, especially the study of singular loci and equivariant cohomology. For example, in earlier joint work with Sara Billey, Mitchell completely determined the smooth and rationally smooth Schubert varieties in an affine Grassmannian; now the goal is to extend these results to more general affine flag varieties, and to refine them by determining the singular loci. In earlier joint work with Luke Gutzwiller, Mitchell completely determined the homotopy type of Birhkhoff varieties. However, many interesting problems concerning their equivariant cohomology and associated Richardson varieties remain unsolved, and will be addressed in the new research program.<br/><br/>Mitchell's project lies at the interface of geometry, topology and combinatorics. Topology, a cousin of geometry but of much more recent origin, is concerned with properties of geometric objects that are invariant under continuous deformations. In recent years it has found surprising applications to physics, engineering (e.g. robotics), computer science and biology (e.g. structure of DNA). Combinatorics, or ``finite math'', is the branch of mathematics most directly applicable to computer technology. This project is concerned with the pure mathematics that forms the foundation of these applications. The key buzzword attached to the project is ``Schubert variety'', a concept impossible to explain in a short paragraph but having a distinguished history of a century and half within mathematics itself, and with applications beginning to be found in fields such as computer graphics and computer vision. Thus the goal of Mitchell's project is to improve our understanding of the geometry, topology and combinatorics of these remarkable ``Schubert varieties''."

The topological symmetry group of a graph embedded in 3-space is defined as the group of automorphisms of the graph which are induced by homeomorphisms of 3-space. Our first goal is to characterize which groups can occur as the topological symmetry group of a particular embedded graph or family of graphs. The second goal of our project concerns intrinsic properties of a graph -- properties of an embedded graph which do not depend on the particular embedding. For example, a graph which has the property that every embedding of it in 3-space contains a nontrivial link is said to be intrinsically linked, while one which has the property that every embedding of it contains a nontrivial knot is said to be intrinsically knotted. We have previously shown that for any natural number n there is a graph such that every embedding of it contains a link with n components such that every pair of components has linking number at least n, and every component is a knot with minimal crossing number at least n. However, there cannot exist a graph which has the property that every embedding of it contains at least one composite knot. We would now like to study for which measures of complexity of knots and links there are graphs which are arbitrarily intrinsically complex by that measure.<br/><br/><br/>A molecule can be represented as a graph in 3-dimensional space. Most molecules are rigid, and the geometry of their graphs determines many of their properties. However, some molecules can rotate around particular bonds, and others are large enough to be somewhat flexible. For these non-rigid molecules, their topology is important in predicting their behavior. The study of the topology of graphs embedded in 3-dimensional space is used in determining the symmetries of non-rigid molecules. In particular, while the group of rigid symmetries of a molecule (known as the point group) is useful for analyzing the symmetries of rigid molecules, a molecular structure which is not rigid may have symmetries which are not included in the point group. The topological symmetry group was created in order to classify the symmetries of non-rigid molecules. The main goal of our project is to characterize all topological symmetry groups. Understanding molecular symmetries has many important application in chemistry. Symmetry is used in interpreting results in crystallography, spectroscopy, and quantum chemistry, as well as in analyzing the electron structure of a molecule. Symmetry is also used in pharmacology and in designing new molecules and new types of reactions."

There are rank 2 Frobenius extensions that play an important role in such theories, and the Principal Investigator plans to use the techniques developed in the last few years in the area of  categorification to find new tangle and link homology theories that are related to rank n-Frobenius extensions for arbitrary n > 2. The project also aims to deepen the understanding of existing link homology theories, including the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies, and to improve the currently known categorifications of the colored Jones polynomial. The novelty of the proposed research lies in a new approach to link homologies via webs and foams and to their extension to cobordisms of knots and links. This new approach also motivates another goal of the project, namely that of constructing extended TQFTs defined on certain cobordisms with seams, also called foams.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research project concerns the theory of knots and links. This area has provided models and applications to DNA theory, molecular configurations and physics, and has gone through a significant development recently through categorifications of quantum invariants, giving rise to link homologies. The focus of the project  is to better perceive the existing link homology theories, to improve some of their features, as well as to find new homology and topological quantum field theories.  The Principal Investigator anticipates a better understanding of the quantum sl(n) invariants and of the interplay between knot theory and representation theory. The findings of the study should open new perspectives for applications of methods from the field of homological invariants of knots and links in various branches of mathematics and theoretical physics, including representation theory, category theory, and topological quantum field theory."

One of the main themes of their work is the connection between topologically defined invariants of such manifolds and their quantitative geometric invariants such as volume. This has involved interactions between very classical techniques in 3-manifold topology, some of which go back to Papakyriakopoulos's work in the 1950's, and more geometric methods such as the log(2k-1)-theorem of Anderson, Canary, Culler and Shalen, the work of Kojima and Miyamoto on hyperbolic manifolds with totally geodesic boundary, and the work of Agol, Dunfield, Storm and Thurston based on properties of the Ricci flow with surgeries. A second theme, which recently has grown out of the first, is the connection between the number-theoretic invariants of a manifold such as its trace field and quantitative geometric invariants such as its Margulis number. This aspect of the work depends on combining the earlier work with new group-theoretic observations, and has already brought into play such deep number-theoretic ingredients as the work of Siegel and Mahler on the unit equation in algebraic number fields.<br/><br/>Hyperbolic manifolds are geometric objects that arise in many branches of mathematics and in many applications of mathematics. The first hyperbolic manifold, called hyperbolic space, was discovered in the 19th century and settled---in the negative---the ancient problem of whether Euclid's fifth postulate could be deduced from his other postulates. Hyperbolic manifolds may be thought of as geometric objects which at small scales are indistinguishable from hyperbolic space, but whose large-scale behavior is more complicated. A major theme in modern geometry is the interaction between the quantitative properties of a geometric object, for example those defined in terms of distances, lengths, areas and volumes, and their ""topological""<br/>properties which are more qualitative and are unchanged when the object is deformed. In the case of hyperbolic manifolds, so much progress has been made in recent years in relating the quantitative and topological theories that they may be said to be completely unified at an abstract level. The present project involves making our understanding the connection in a more concrete way. Doing this turns out to involve deep ideas from many branches of mathematics.<br/>"

This is a classical topological problem and a special case of the general placement problem: Understand the embeddings of a space X in another space Y. There have been exciting new developments in the area of knot theory and 3-manifold topology in the last 25 years.<br/>From the Jones, Homflypt and Kauffman polynomials, quantum invariants of 3-manifolds, through, Vassiliev invariants, topological quantum field theories, to relations with gauge theory type invariants in 4-dimensional topology (e.g. Donaldson, Witten).  More recently, Khovanov introduced link homology as a generalization of the Jones polynomial to homology of chain complexes and Ozsvath and Szabo developed Heegaard-Floer homology, that lifts the Alexander polynomial.  These two significantly different theories are closely related and the dependencies are the object of intensive study. These ideas mark the beginning of a new era in knot theory that includes relationships with four-dimensional problems and the creation of new forms of algebraic topology relevant to knot theory. It is a remarkable fact that knot theory, while very special in its problematic form, involves ideas and techniques that involve and inform much of mathematics and theoretical physics. The subject has significant applications and relations with biology, physics, combinatorics, algebra and the theory of computation. We feel that a summer school on this subject is highly appropriate at this time, and we strive to be in the frontier of new developments in knot theory and its applications.<br/><br/>The project has  several aspects. It is specialized in its concentration on the theory of knots. Knot theory, while a very focused mathematical activity has wide ramification in other sciences, particularly in physics and in biology and chemistry. Knots themselves occur physically in weaving and in the use of ropes from ancient times to the present day. In recent times, it has been suggested that knotted structures occur in quantum fields at the nuclear level, and knots have occurred significantly in quantum gravity theories and in string theory. In molecular biology DNA molecules can become knotted, and enzymes to avoid knotting are crucial for the replication of DNA and hence for the maintenance of life itself. In chemistry, molecules and long chain polymers can be knotted. The purpose of this summer school and conference is to examine both the applications and the theory of knots at this time.  An ICTP Summer school and conference brings together participants from all over the world, third-world countries, women, minorities, and provides an opportunity for researchers and students to share their latest ideas and to collaborate with each other. The knowledge obtained on this occasion will be disseminated by participants throughout the world. All intensive short courses will be taught by experts, and lecture notes will be available online. The presentations include plenary talks by distinguished researchers, including at least 8 women, as well as short talks by other participants. We expect to publish conference proceedings containing cutting-edge research papers and lecture notes which will be suitable for research mathematicians, students, and readers in with background in other exact sciences, including biology, chemistry, computer science and physics.<br/>"

Central to our symposium, these fields have recently been related through their use of derived categories and categorification.  <br/>This includes the categorification of Khovanov and its many generalizations, the categorification of Donaldson-Thomas theory by Behrend and Joyce-Song and the derived categories of Pandharipande- Thomas theory. In addition, the program of Cautis and Kamnitzer shows categorification results in topology may be recast in some instances as isomorphisms of derived categories in algebraic geometry. The speakers at this symposium will announce accomplishments and also discuss new directions of research. Specifically, Renzo Cavalieri will discuss derived categories in GW and DT theories, Emille Davie will discuss applications to low dimensional topology, and Juan Ortiz- Navaro will discuss categorification, Khovanov homology and its generalizations.<br/><br/>This symposium will enable and encourage students and other scientists to pursue research in areas related to the interaction of quantum geometry and topology, provide the opportunity for scientists to interact and foster collaboration and new research, and disseminate knowledge to a wide and extraordinarily diverse audience. While the reasons for organizing a scienti&#64257;c symposium on topology and quantum geometry are many, there is additionally an acute need to do so for an audience of underrepresented minorities. There is at this time signi&#64257;cant underrepresentation of minorities in the mathematical sciences; this underrepresentation is evidently severe in both topology and quantum geometry and certainly the intersection of these subjects. There are very important questions that need to be addressed in these subjects, and it is necessary to attract a broad and diverse audience to work on these problems. Gromov-Witten theory and related fields have been extremely successful in solving outstanding problems, some over 100 years old, in several branches of mathematics and physics. Low dimensional topology is not only of basic importance in geometry and topology, but in several areas of applied mathematics as well, as highlighted in this symposium. It is predicted that underrepresented minorities will become the majority of United States Citizens in the not so distant future; as such, it is in the long term interest of topology and quantum geometry to have increased participation from members of these groups. Moreover, given the importance of these subjects to mathematics and science in general, it is in our national interest to work against the underrepresentation of minorities conducting research in these &#64257;elds.<br/>"

This move has turned out to be incredibly fruitful, both by providing invariants which shed new light on old questions as well as by raising new questions which have unexpected connections to other areas of mathematics and physics.

The problems discussed in this proposal find origin in the study of the connections between three-dimensional topology and symplectic topology of certain families of four-manifolds. The study of symplectic manifolds has become a core component of four dimensional topology, that might lead to a better understanding, and possibly a classification scheme, for four-manifolds. This research has origin in the attempt to determine which four-manifolds admitting a free circle action can be endowed with a symplectic form. In collaboration with Stefan Friedl we have solved this problem for the product case, and in the case where the canonical class of the symplectic structure is trivial. In both cases the result shows that the orbit space admits a fibration over the circle. The proof relates Seiberg-Witten theory in dimension four with various tools of three-manifold topology, as the study of twisted Alexander polynomials and their role in detecting fibrations. Refinement of these techniques will hopefully allow us to completely solve the problem. Other problems that will be the focus of this research concern the relation between twisted Alexander polynomials and topological properties of three-manifolds, as well as the investigation of other classes of four-manifolds that are closely connected with three-manifolds, as four-manifolds that fiber over the circle.<br/><br/>Low dimensional topology is an area of mathematics where the use of rigorous techniques sheds light, but is also enriched, by our ""visual"" perception and intuition of objects living in our three- (and four-) dimensional world. The prototype of this type of study, knot theory, originated more than a hundred year ago from the need to understand atoms. While the original models have proved too naive, the study of knots finds now more sophisticated applications in natural sciences and physics. Similarly, the study of symplectic manifolds finds in origin in physics, and its connections with theoretical physics has enriched both fields. My research aims at better understanding the connection between symplectic four-manifolds and the three-dimensional topology, and its results will hopefully motivate further research in these fields also by other scholars. Besides the intellectual merit in better understanding their connection, these subjects lend themselves very naturally for training purposes of students at both undergraduate and graduate level. Far-reaching courses on these subjected can be given with prerequisites limited to standard lower-division courses.

These metablocks allow for the more flexible notion of classifying space B<sub>F</sub>&Gamma; for families F of small subgroups of &Gamma;. This approach would hybridize the techniques of three isolated communities that have sprung up in the past 25 years: controlled surgery, surgery on 4-manifolds with small fundamental group, and assembly maps for families.<br/><br/>A manifold is a smooth shape, without any sharp edges or singularities. <br/>For example, a one-dimensional manifold is a curve, and a two-dimensional manifold is a surface. Three and four-dimensional manifolds occur in physics, such as general relativity. <br/>Higher-dimensional manifolds occur in string theory and also as configuration spaces for robot motion planning. The mathematical classification of manifolds is fundamental to understanding both the global structure of our universe and the hidden routes through which a closed physical system is connected to itself."

Specifically, we will study conjectures of Karoubi and Williams - the first, relating the integral homology groups of infinite orthogonal, symplectic and general linear groups, and the second relating homotopy fixed points of K-theory to hermitian K-theory. We will also study homotopy and devissage properties of higher Grothendieck-Witt groups when ""2 is not invertible"" which are essential in the calculation of hermitian K-groups of rings of integers in number fields. Finally, we will study higher Grothendieck-Witt groups in relation with certain invariants defined via A^1-homotopy theory.<br/><br/>Historically, cohomology theories attach to a geometric object such as the surface of the earth (whose topological properties don't change under small<br/>deformations) certain algebraic objects such as a set of numbers (which are rather rigid in nature). The study of the attached algebraic objects yields information about the original geometric object. The success of cohomology theories in topology lead algebraists to define cohomology theories in an algebraic context. These algebraic cohomology theories allow us to use our intuition from 3 space and our experience with working with real numbers to study systems polynomial equations in higher dimensions and in number systems (used e.g. in cryptography) where 1+1 could be 0. The theory investigated in this project, the theory of higher Grothendieck-Witt groups, is one such algebraic cohomology theory. Compared to its companion theories - algebraic K-theory, Witt-groups and L-groups - this theory is rather underdeveloped. For instance, virtually nothing is known in relation with number systems in which<br/>1+1 = 0. This project aims to close the gap in knowledge between the <br/>1+theory of<br/>higher Grothendieck-Witt groups and these companion theories."

The first section deals with coarse geometry and geometric group theory. The PI (together with D. Fisher and K. Whyte) has recently developed a new technique, ""coarse differentiation"", which can be viewed as a sort of differentiability substitute for quasi-isometries. Of course, conventional derivatives do not make sense for such maps, since they are not even defined on small scales; instead we must go to larger and larger scales. Using this technique, we were able to resolve three longstanding open problems in the field, namely proving the quasi-isometric rigidity of the three-dimensional solvable group Sol, exhibiting a transitive graph which is not quasi-isometric to any Cayley graph, and showing that the two lamplighter groups Z wreath product Z mod 2 and Z wreath product Z mod 3 are not quasi-isometric. We list some recent progress and other potential applications of the method, many of which are to problems which seemed completely out of reach before. The second section concerns the interrelated analytic study of billiards in rational polygons, moduli spaces of abelian and quadratic differentials, and the dynamics of the SL(2,R) action and the geodesic flow on these moduli spaces.  In recent work with M. Mirzakhani, the PI was able to resolve a twenty year old conjecture by V. Veech in this area. Some of the techniques are based on a loose analogy with flows on locally symmetric spaces.  Even though the moduli spaces of differentials are substantially different, the PI was and is involved in transferring some of the symmetric space techniques to this setting. We propose additional research in this direction. <br/><br/><br/>Some of the coarse geometry in the the first part of the proposal has unexpected connections to computer science, in particular the existence of efficient algorithms for finding ways to disconnect a graph by cutting as few edges as possible. In fact, some of our ideas were already used to solve problems in this field. Some natural phenomena are ""chaotic"" (i.e. unpredictable). These are often studied by statistical methods. Others are ""integrable"" (i.e. predictable and regular). Other phenomena fit somewhere in between. The polygonal billiard system, which is one of our main subjects of study in the second section of the proposal, is a good model of intermediate behavior. As such it has been studied extensively in physics as well, in particular in connection to ""quantum chaos""."

The second part of the project deals with generalizations of Lefschetz fibrations and symplectic structures on smooth four-manifolds. In this research, singularity theory and handlebody techniques are combined to obtain new results on generalized fibrations on smooth four-manifolds, and to establish a useful description of smooth four-manifolds in terms of broken Lefschetz fibrations and moves between them, analogous to handlebodies and Kirby moves. Determining which broken Lefschetz fibrations can or cannot support a smooth four-manifold with nontrivial Seiberg-Witten invariant, and investigating the diffeomorphism types of certain four-manifolds using broken Lefschetz fibrations associated to them are two other problems contained in this research.<br/><br/>Space and time combined, we live in a four dimensional world. The goal of this project is to better understand the intriguing nature of ""four-manifolds"", which are geometric objects locally modeled on space-time. There is an immense literature in theoretical physics related to the 'shape' of four-manifolds, and a great deal of mathematical research dedicated to this very subject. When considered with certain additional structures, four-manifolds exhibit numerous curious differences. For one, ""symplectic structures"", which appear in various equations in classical mechanics and string theory constitute a key theme of the proposed research. The ""Seiberg-Witten invariants"" that arise from differential equations in quantum field theory also play a key role.

The focus for the summer of 2009 is the recent solution of the Kervaire invariant problem by Michael Hopkins, Mike Hill, and Douglas Ravenel. The resolution of this problem, which arose in the early days of geometric topology, had to wait for some half century for the development of sufficiently powerful homotopy theoretic tools. The new solution brings into play methods from essentially the whole range of contemporary stable homotopy theory -- chromatic, equivariant, and motivic.<br/><br/>The classification of closed surfaces - the sphere, the torus, and so on - was accomplished in the nineteenth century.

During the last few years revolutionary new directions have opened for algebraic topology.  At the center is the theory of higher categories, which appear in diverse ways.  Hopkins and Lurie have been using the homotopy theory of infinity n-categories to classify topological quantum field theories.  They have already done this in dimension less than or equal to 2, and propose to pursue a program outlined by Lurie to extend this to all dimensions.  The terms of the classification represent a refinement of the Baez-Dolan cobordism hypothesis.  Barwick and Lurie propose to develop new approaches to infinity n-categories, better suited to the demands placed on the subject by the many new directions.  Lurie proposes a program using derived algebraic geometry to study the problem of lifting the affine algebraic group schemes to derived group schemes defined over the sphere spectrum.  Behrens, Lurie and Miller propose to study the Goodwillie tower in this context, as giving a functor from the infinity 2-category of infinity 1-categories, to the infinity 2-category of stable multicategories.  New directions in topology have also been created by significant computational advances.  Hopkins, Mike Hill and Doug Ravenel have made important progress computing the homotopy groups of the Hopkins-Miller cohomology theories associated to orbifold families of formal group laws.  These computations have very recently led to a solution of the longstanding ""Kervaire invariant"" problem.  There are many new directions opened up by this work.  The computations themselves are what mediates between classical and topological automorphic forms, and Behrens and Hopkins are planning on determining new rings of topological automorphic forms. Behrens and Hopkins are also working on the problem of determining the structures needed by a vector bundle in order that it be oriented in the theory of topological automorphic forms.  These orientations are fundamental to any geometric interpretation of these theories, and represent yet another interface with the theory of infinity n-categories.<br/><br/><br/>In broad strokes, the work in this proposal represents deep progress and new directions on the oldest problem in algebraic topology: how to count the number of solutions to a system of equations.  When the number of equations is equal to the number of unknowns, the answer to the problem is known as the ""degree,"" and many of the triumphs of the subject in the 1920's and early 1930's result from a clear understanding of the degree.

Moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, and their symmetries, the mapping class groups, are fundamental objects of interest in many branches of mathematics. Recently, techniques from coarse geometry have been applied to these spaces, and using these results Joseph Maher has shown that a random walk on the mapping class group gives rise to a pseudo-Anosov element with asymptotic probability one. This project involves extending this to obtain further information about the mapping class group, for example, investigating whether random walks on this group make linear progress in the complex of curves. Such results may have applications to the study of 3-manifolds, as every 3-manifold has a Heegaard splitting, determined by a gluing map, which is an element of the mapping class group. One aim of this project is to show that the volume of the resulting manifold grows linearly with the length of the random walk. Other goals of this project include attempting to extend the results for random walks to other counting problems, both in the mapping class group and in Teichmuller space, and to more general classes of weakly relatively hyperbolic groups.<br/><br/><br/>The space of all possible shapes a surface may have, called the moduli space of the surface, is a fundamental object of interest in many parts of mathematics, and its structure is closely related to its symmetries, which are described by the mapping class group.

The study of surfaces and the mapping class group is also useful in the study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, which are important, as they are spaces which are locally modelled on the visible dimensions of the universe in which we live, which has three spatial dimensions, plus one time dimension.<br/>"

The conference will  be held on the UC Davis campus in September  2009. The main theme of the conference is to illuminate the particular type of interaction which characterizes the past 40 years of developments in algebra and topology, including the most recent results in contemporary mathematics. The topics to be discussed in the conference will include the current exciting developments in symplectic field theory, representations of infinite- dimensional Lie algebras, and topological quantum field theory, as well as the recent achievements in the topological applications of cohomology of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, characteristic classes of foliations, contact homology, Chekanov- Eliashberg differential graded algebra, and Legendrian knot theory. The most important goal of the conference is to provide an opportunity for a diverse group of mathematicians including postdoctoral researchers, those with traditionally underrepresented background, graduate students, and faculty from primary undergraduate institutions, to meet and discuss mathematics with the invited leading experts of the field. To facilitate the discussions, the organizers will make every effort to bring the diverse audience to the conference, and request the speakers to prepare their talks aimed at the level  at which a second-year graduate student can understand.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The conference will bring three generations of researchers together, and foster scientific interactions across the generation, providing an opportunity to  exchange ideas and to initiate new collaborations among participants. The younger generation can learn the newly established results, new perspectives, and possible future directions of research specifically addressed to them from the leading experts. The founders of the theories will inject how their discoveries were made and what was their vision back then. Expository talks can connect this vision with the current developments, and provide to the audience a sense of strong current and flow of mathematics. The participants will devote one session to compiling a list of open problems in the area that are  most likely to shape the research in the near future. The conference will also include components for dissemination of results as well as outreach to local high school students and the general public. The Scientific Advisory Board will form an editorial board for the conference proceedings volume to be published. Reflecting the tone of the conference, the authors will be encouraged to provide expository articles, survey papers, and research papers readable to graduate students. The talks presented at the conference will be placed on the Conference Website by the local organizers. The outreach activity  will comprise an expository talk by a distinguished speaker in an evening session during the conference. This talk will be an integrated component of the year-long outreach activity of the Department of Mathematics, UC Davis, which brings as many as 400 local high school students and general public to the event."

Since then, these theories have led to many dramatic discoveries, including the resolution of the Arnold conjecture in symplectic geometry and Gordon's conjecture on lens space surgeries, but their structure remains somewhat mysterious.  The focus of this project is on better understanding the structure of certain Floer homology theories.  One particular goal is to continue to develop Lipshitz-Ozsvath-Thurston's theory of ""bordered Floer homology,"" an effort to axiomatize Heegaard Floer homology by a type of second-order degeneration.  Another goal is to construct a ""Floer homotopy type"" for Lagrangian intersection Floer homology, an idea suggested by Cohen-Jones-Segal and carried out in other contexts by Manolescu, Kronheimer-Manolescu, and Sarkar.  A third goal is to associate maps on knot Floer homology to knot cobordisms, hopefully leading to deep structural results about 3- and 4-dimensional Heegaard Floer theory.<br/><br/><br/>Most of mathematics falls into one of two categories.  One category studies continuous problems, like fluid flow or minimal surface (bubble) formation, often through partial differential equations.  Another studies more rigid, algebraic problems like hidden symmetries of real world objects (e.g., mosaics or particle physics theories) or mathematical objects (like groups and fields).  Some of the most striking mathematics sits at the intersection of the two types, using algebraic methods to study qualitative properties of continuous systems which are quantitatively intractable.  One powerful example of this method is Floer homology, which uses algebraic structures like chain complexes, Hochschild homology, and topological field theories to study certain families of partial differential equations coming from physics.  Floer theory then re-interprets the results to answer questions in topology (large-scale or qualitative geometry).  This project will extend several Floer homology theories by considering even deeper algebraic and topological structure to obtain stronger geometric results."

One of the reasons this approach is useful is that the conformal map  encodes the geometry of the boundary of U.  We  propose to use an alternative to this analytic approach which makes it easier to apply such techniques in the topological setting and certain limit cases where the analytic techniques do not work. It can be shown that  conformal external rays  can be replaced by metrically defined external rays  which leads to the same  prime end theory as in the conformal case. Moreover, the conformal map  can be replaced by a metrically defined partition of   U into disjoint convex  sets, which also captures the geometry of the boundary of U. This approach has already been used to obtain additional information about a possible minimal counter example to the plane fixed point problem and to show that all positively oriented maps of the plane, which include all holomorphic maps, must have a fixed point in any non-separating invariant sub-continuum. This approach was also critical  in showing that every isotopy of a plane continuum,starting at the identity, can be extended to an isotopy of the entire plane. (Standard Caratheodory kernel convergence is insufficient to establish this result.) We plan to use these results to  attack the following problems: does every  map of the plane fix a point in any non-separating invariant sub-continuum and is every homogeneous tree-like plane continuum a pseudo arc? Our approach makes extensive use of the notion of a geometric lamination of the unit disk.<br/><br/>Complicated dynamical systems are often studied by analyzing the behavior of a system near periodic points. The study of the existence of such points  naturally leads to the notion of a fixed point.  The study of the existence of fixed points is  an old and well established branch of mathematics. In this project we  propose to study the existence of fixed points under  maps of the plane onto itself."

During the last few years revolutionary new directions have opened for algebraic topology.  At the center is the theory of higher categories, which appear in diverse ways.  Hopkins and Lurie have been using the homotopy theory of infinity n-categories to classify topological quantum field theories.  They have already done this in dimension less than or equal to 2, and propose to pursue a program outlined by Lurie to extend this to all dimensions.  The terms of the classification represent a refinement of the Baez-Dolan cobordism hypothesis.  Barwick and Lurie propose to develop new approaches to infinity n-categories, better suited to the demands placed on the subject by the many new directions.  Lurie proposes a program using derived algebraic geometry to study the problem of lifting the affine algebraic group schemes to derived group schemes defined over the sphere spectrum.  Behrens, Lurie and Miller propose to study the Goodwillie tower in this context, as giving a functor from the infinity 2-category of infinity 1-categories, to the infinity 2-category of stable multicategories.  New directions in topology have also been created by significant computational advances.  Hopkins, Mike Hill and Doug Ravenel have made important progress computing the homotopy groups of the Hopkins-Miller cohomology theories associated to orbifold families of formal group laws.  These computations have very recently led to a solution of the longstanding ""Kervaire invariant"" problem.  There are many new directions opened up by this work.  The computations themselves are what mediates between classical and topological automorphic forms, and Behrens and Hopkins are planning on determining new rings of topological automorphic forms. Behrens and Hopkins are also working on the problem of determining the structures needed by a vector bundle in order that it be oriented in the theory of topological automorphic forms.  These orientations are fundamental to any geometric interpretation of these theories, and represent yet another interface with the theory of infinity n-categories.<br/><br/><br/>In broad strokes, the work in this proposal represents deep progress and new directions on the oldest problem in algebraic topology: how to count the number of solutions to a system of equations.  When the number of equations is equal to the number of unknowns, the answer to the problem is known as the ""degree,"" and many of the triumphs of the subject in the 1920's and early 1930's result from a clear understanding of the degree.  In the mid 1930's, Pontryagin introduced new topological methods in case the number of equations is smaller than the number of unknowns.

For example, the Jones polynomial is one such invariant. In the case of the general linear group and the standard representation the PI and Joel Kamnitzer categorify these invariants, meaning that to each knot they assign a (bi-graded) homology group whose Euler characteristic is the original invariant. This is analogous to the way (singular) homology of topological spaces ""categorifies"" the Euler characteristic. Their construction involves studying the (derived) category of coherent sheaves on certain flag-like varieties. All this parallels the earlier pioneering work of Khovanov and Rozansky who discovered such categorifications using algebraic and combinatorial constructions. Using the algebraic geometric approach the investigator and his colleagues have a conjecture for how to categorify some of the remaining Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. Checking, for instance, invariance under Reidemeister move 2 involves proving that certain integral transforms between (derived) categories are equivalences.<br/>The existence of such equivalences, which include Seidel-Thomas spherical twists, is a lively area of research which is interesting in itself.<br/><br/>The simplest example of a knot is obtained by taking a tangled-up shoe lace and glueing the ends together. A fundamental question in low-dimensional topology is to determine when two such knots are different (you are allowed to move the knots around without cutting them). One way to do this is to assign a number (an invariant) to each knot so that if two knots are assigned different numbers then they must be different. How to assign such numbers is a deep problem which is related to various areas of mathematics in surprising ways. For example, the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are obtained from representation theory (which is the study of matrices). There are also constructions of such invariants using algebra and others that are inspired by physics and string theory. The proposed research suggests yet another approach using algebraic geometry (which is the study of systems of polynomial equations). This approach may extend, unify and shed more light on the other constructions.<br/>"

These complexes shed light on many of the P.I.'s pet problems on genus, rank and stabilization of Heegaard splittings.<br/><br/>The P.I. pursues research in the area of low-dimensional topology, specifically 3-manifolds.  The project builds on the cross-fertilization of low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory.  The P.I. maintains several national and international collaborations with mathematicians in the United States, Germany and Israel. The P.I. aims to involve graduate and undergraduate students in some aspects of the project."

Such a surface has an associated disk complex that is either empty, or is non-contractible. Topologically minimal surfaces generalize other well known classes, such as incompressible surfaces and strongly irreducible Heegaard splittings. They also generalize critical surfaces, a class that was instrumental in the PI's solutions  to a conjecture of Gordon's and to the Stabilization Conjecture.  Future work concerns the application of topologically minimal surfaces to understand the persistence of the set of Heegaard surfaces after Dehn filling. A second project is to apply a relative version of the theory to study knots and links with multiple bridge presentations.  Finally, the study of topologically minimal surfaces has itself generated many natural questions that reveal information about the topology of 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>Just as the surface of the Earth seems like a plane to those confined to local observations, a 3-manifold is an object that is locally indistinguishable from 3-dimensional Euclidean space, such as our universe. A classical way to study 3-manifolds is to utilize surfaces they contain that are non-trivial in some suitable sense. Topological minimality is a very general notion of non-triviality for such surfaces that was introduced by the PI to solve several problems in topology. These surfaces are the analogue of geometrically minimal surfaces, such as soap films. The PI will both develop the theory of topologically minimal surfaces further and use it to study the ambiguity inherent in various common constructions of 3-manifolds."

In particular, the existence of a model manifold for a hyperbolic 3-manifold M that is uniformly bi-Lipschitz to M has foregrounded the extent to which many problems in the study of closed and finite volume hyperbolic 3- manifolds can be understood in terms of combinatorial structures associated to surfaces.  Likewise, large-scale questions in the geometry of Teichmüller space have come into relief in terms of a new understanding of these combinatorics: the asymptotic geometry of geodesics in various metrics has been reconstituted and understood in a new language, yet the structure of the classical Weil-Petersson metric from this point of view remains largely unclear and tantalizingly open.  Our proposed research will demonstrate how model manifolds serve as building blocks for hyperbolic structures on closed manifolds via Heegaard splittings, to develop control on the synthetic geometry and dynamics of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmüller space via the complex of curves, and to continue to reveal applications of the model manifolds to the topology of deformation spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>The idea of a ""coarse model"" in geometry proposes that one might sacrifice a certain degree of precision in the interest of capturing more large-scale structure.  Frequently a coarse model plays a similar role to DNA in biology: it can determine fine features of a space despite its apparently coarse nature.  In a recent result of the P.I.  <br/>with R. Canary and Y. Minsky, such models were used to classify all `constantly negatively curved,' or `hyperbolic' three-dimensional spaces of infinite volume that are `tame' in a certain sense.  The classification result solved a long-standing conjecture of William Thurston, and opened the door to developing a more detailed and complete picture of geometries on manifolds previously considered understood.  After Perelman's solution to Thurston's geometrization conjecture and the famous Poincaré conjecture, the groundwork is in place for a fundamental investigation of algebraic, geometric and topological properties of all spaces of 3-dimensions and how these properties interrelate.<br/>"

Schwartz will continue to develop the theory, exploring connections to self-similar tilings, limit sets of discrete groups, and renormalization.  Schwartz also plans to continue studying irrational polygonal billiards, with a focus on the Triangular Billiards Problem, which asks if every triangular shaped billiard table has a periodic billiard path.  Finally, Schwartz plans to study basic geometric iterations such as those defined by iterated barycentric subdivision.<br/><br/>The common theme in Schwartz's proposed research is the analysis of what happens when a simple geometric construction is repeated over and over again. For example, in outer billiards, a toy model for planetary motion, a point (the satellite) moves around the outside of a convex planar shape (the planet) according to a simple geometric rule. Resolving a 50 year old question about this system, Schwartz found examples of convex shapes, and starting positions for the point, such that the point wanders unboundedly far away from the shape while following the rules of the game. One might say that these shapes are examples of planets whose satellites can wander off into space. Iterated geometric constructions such as outer billiards are intellectually appealing and scientifically important because their simple definitions sometimes lead to extremely rich and mysterious behavior, as do analogous systems in the natural sciences."

This proposal will focus on studying a specific type of geometry in high dimensions, namely hyperbolic geometry.  Traditionally, approaching this subject was difficult without a powerful computer.

In the simplest picture available, the blown-up 4-manifold X is the union of two 4-manifolds X_1 and X_2, each bounding a fibered 3-manifold Y, where X_1 is a Lefschetz fibration over a disc, and X_2 is essentially standard. This proposal focuses on computational and qualitative consequences of this  escription.

So far, we have a very limited knowledge of what those rules are, and understanding them better is the focus for this project. Recent developments have shown that we can build all 4- dimensional spaces (technically, smooth, compact 4-dimensional manifolds) from simple but highly structured building blocks. This project will study how the known characteristics (invariants) for 4- dimensional manifolds can be understood in terms of those building blocks by invoking methods from another part of geometry that evolved from physics, symplectic topology.  One aim is to elucidate what geometric information the invariants capture. Another is to seek genuinely new invariants. One can hope to do so by using the known invariants as a template; but that will require a deep understanding of how those invariants arise from the building blocks."

The PI intends to work on questions related to this<br/>circle of ideas.<br/><br/>Geometry is the study of properties of spaces equipped with some<br/>additional structure, usually of a metric nature (i.e. allowing<br/>one to measure distances in the space). In the field of topology,<br/>one forgets about the precise underlying distance, and only<br/>retain the notion of points in the space being ""close<br/>together"". As such, topology is often referred to as ""rubber<br/>geometry"": one can stretch and deform spaces without changing<br/>their underlying topology. In topology, manifolds are the spaces<br/>of most interest. These are spaces which, on the small scale,<br/>look like Euclidean space, but on the large scale, can be<br/>curved. A basic question lies in finding ways to detect when two<br/>manifolds are different from each other. This is usually done by<br/>associating certain invariants to manifolds: if the invariants<br/>are different, then the manifolds are different. One family of<br/>invariants which is particularly useful in high-dimensional<br/>topology are the algebraic K-theory invariants. In general, these<br/>invariants are quite hard to compute. The PI plans to develop<br/>methods for computing these invariants, in the special case where<br/>the manifold has some nice underlying geometry.

Gromov's conjecture says that the universal cover of closed n-manifold which admits a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature has the macroscopic dimension less or equal to n-2. This project suggests a development of the macroscopic dimension theory and its comparison with the asymptotic dimension.<br/>The ultimate goal is to prove Gromov's conjecture.<br/><br/>The notion of dimension plays an important role in almost all areas of mathematics and sciences. When one studies an unknown object like our universe, or the configuration space of robot's motion, or the set of solution of some equation, etc., one of the first parameters he/she would like to know is dimension of the object. The intuitive idea of dimension has been adjusted rigorously to many areas of research. The project does dimension theory of the large scale world. If completed it will make a breakthrough on some old  famous problems in Geometry and Topology.<br/><br/>"

Adams<br/><br/>This grant is to fund the first ever Undergraduate Knot Theory<br/>Conference to take place at Denison University in summer,<br/>2009. Over the last few decades, there has been a dramatic<br/>increase in the involvement of undergraduates in mathematical<br/>research. Knot theory particularly lends itself to this endeavor<br/>since it is highly pictorial, one can easily stated open<br/>problems, and students can get actively involved with examples<br/>from the first day. A variety of Research Experience for<br/>Undergraduate (REU) summer programs have pursued research on this<br/>topic. Moreover, there have been various workshops funded by NSF<br/>and the MAA that have helped undergraduate faculty to pursue<br/>research with students in knot theory.<br/><br/>This conference will bring together a variety of mathematicians<br/>at various stages in their careers: undergraduates who are either<br/>interested or have already done research in knot theory, graduate<br/>students with undergraduate knot theory experience, faculty<br/>members interested in working with undergraduates on knot theory<br/>research, and four senior researchers in the field who will give<br/>plenary lectures.  There will be a wide range of talks by the<br/>other participants, some on research and some expository.  As a<br/>centerpiece, we will have a collective problem session to give<br/>participants numerous ideas for future research directions.  This<br/>conference will provide an opportunity for students to experience<br/>a mathematics research conference that is specifically designed<br/>and directed toward them.  Moreover, the conference will<br/>establish a supportive network of students and faculty with an<br/>interest in knot theory research, thus furthering the involvement<br/>of students in the field of mathematics.<br/><br/>http://www.denison.edu/academics/departments/mathcs/unknot<br/><br/>"

The<br/>central idea is to replace the algebraic K-theory of the ring of<br/>integers in the latter subject with Waldhausen's K-theory of the<br/>sphere spectrum. This would explain the appearance of zeta-values<br/>at odd positive integers in both the theory of motives, and as values<br/>of Igusa's Reidemeister invariants in differential topology.<br/><br/> Certain values of Riemann's zeta function are widely conjectured to be <br/>transcendental. These numbers have recently been shown [through work of<br/>Connes, Kreimer, and Marcolli] to play a central and unexpected role<br/>in the theoretical basis for the renormalization techniques fundamental<br/>to perturbative quantum field theory, but WHY they should be so important<br/>is quite mysterious. However, these same numbers are of fundamental<br/>importance in other parts of mathematics, eg in arithmetic algebraic<br/>geometry and in differential topology. Their role in algebraic geometry<br/>has been rationalized by the development of a theory of `motives', and it<br/>seems likely that some version of these ideas can be extended to<br/>differential topology as well. The deep links between topological quantum<br/>field theories and differential topology suggest that this<br/>will lead to a new level of understanding of the geometric foundations<br/>of phyics.<br/>"

The objectives are to improve<br/>the recruitment of undergraduates into graduate studies in<br/>mathematics, and the training of graduate students and<br/>postdoctoral fellows, by establishing a strong, coherent<br/>interdisciplinary group in the above areas.  These areas are<br/>coherent in that they have at their center problems and methods<br/>from mathematical physics, such as the count of pseudoholomorphic<br/>curves to calculate Seiberg-Witten and Heegaard-Floer invariants<br/>of 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, or the use of Ricci flow for<br/>understanding smooth manifolds, or the use of mathematical<br/>notions of quantum field theories to describe interesting<br/>algebraic topology, like elliptic cohomology.<br/><br/>A major difficulty for young people entering research in<br/>mathematics today is the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of<br/>the subject and the range of technical tools required.<br/>Traditional seminar formats are becoming less effective at<br/>training.  We will work with the existing strong programs of the<br/>mathematics department to create a series of new and restructured<br/>activities, ranging from the undergraduate level to advanced<br/>research.  These will include undergraduate research seminars<br/>during the school year led by graduate students under the<br/>supervision of senior faculty, undergraduate and graduate summer<br/>workshops, elementary level graduate student seminars, a hot<br/>topic seminar, and a weekly joint research seminar in which<br/>each research talk is preceded by a background lecture.<br/><br/>The areas of geometry, topology and operator algebras covered in<br/>this proposal are central to mathematics and mathematical<br/>physics.  UC Berkeley has an exceptional group of faculty in this<br/>area, and a long history of successfully training graduate and<br/>undergraduate students.  However, these subjects have grown more<br/>and more interdisciplinary requiring graduate students to know<br/>much more than in the past, and more guidance is required of<br/>senior mathematicians.  To improve the training of graduate<br/>students and postdocs, they should also improve the quality of<br/>research that they produce.  The cross-group interaction will<br/>facilitate a number of interdisciplinary research projects that<br/>we intend to pursue, including: Elliptic cohomology and quantum<br/>field theory, K-theory and topological field theories,<br/>Semi-infinite aspect of elliptic cohomology, and Four-dimensional<br/>field theories.<br/>"

Now in its seventh year, the University of Wisconsin will be hosting the conference in 2009. The plenary speakers will be John Baez from UC-Riverside and a distinguished geometer. In addition, 27 talks by graduate students, run in parallel sessions, will be delivered. The grant is primarily to provide travel assistance for participants and speakers.<br/>The conference will run two days and provide ample opportunities for informal discussions and new introductions to occur. Historically, these conferences have provided an excellent opportunity for positive support and fruitful collaborations to begin. The result has often been to increase students' success rate both in school and during the critical transition soon after finishing the doctorate. Because of the traditionally high participation rate among usually under represented demographics at these conferences combined with the conferences effectiveness as an aid to students during a critical transition period, partially supporting the approximately 160 participants is an effective investment in the science.<br/><br/>The Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference is a two-day event in which graduate students from across the country meet to share their work, gain experience presenting at conferences, and hear from some of the most distinguished geometry and topology professors in the nation. Now in its seventh year, the conference draws around 160 graduate students from across the United States. The University of Wisconsin--Madison will be hosting the conference in 2009, with grant funds primarily aimed at providing travel assistance for participants. The conference consists of twenty-seven talks given by graduate students, in addition to two plenary talks by visiting professors; this year the plenary talks are given by John Baez from UC-Riverside and a distinguished geometer. Through its unique combination of research and expository talks, the Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference creates a supportive environment to encourage future researchers and to allow them to make contacts amongst one-another that can lead to future collaboration. Additionally, the experience of presenting at a conference allows speakers to refine their speaking skills and grow into more effective communicators. The conference also encourages communication among different geographic regions.<br/>Participants come from very diverse schools all across the country and include graduate students at all years of study with a high participation rate among usually under represented demographics."

The proposed format of the conference is designed to foster the development of undergraduate and graduate student participants with an interest in algebraic topology, by giving them access to leading researchers in the field.  The subject matter of the conference is interrelated to many different branches of mathematics, and the conference therefore has the potential to bring about new collaborations and discoveries to groups of researchers in the mathematical sciences.

Topics where these areas have converged include the study of the homotopy theory classifying spaces of compact Lie groups, fusion systems, and local-global themes in group theory.

The organizers expect around 100 participants at the conference, a significant number of whom will be early in their careers. As the interaction between the disciplines represented in the conference is relatively new, it should be very attractive to young researchers, who will be exposed to a variety of approaches by their attendance.<br/>"

The fundamental questions concern understanding the dichotomy between the assumption that infinite sequences have converging subsequences or that the space contains a copy of the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers. One of main projects is to answer Efimov's question of whether it is consistent that one or the other must be true in each compact space. Another is to complete our project of determining if there is a small upper bound to the natural notion called the sequential order of a compact (sequential) space. The structure of the remainder of the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers, known as N*, and continuing an important line of investigation following Shelah's breakthrough result on self-homeomorphisms, the behavior of continuous maps with that as the domain, will be investigated. Given the current state of knowledge, it is quite interesting that most of these questions remain unresolved in models of the celebrated Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA) and forcing extensions of models in which this axiom holds. This project will be adding to the toolbox of techniques and results in this central area of study.  Unquestionably, there is a huge literature on the structure of N* and we will continue our project of investigating the analogous questions that naturally arise about an equally fundamental space, R* for the real number (half-) line R. There is a fundamental difference that arises from the fact that this space is a continuum and possible applications to topological dynamics provide additional motivation. <br/>"

Algorithms will be central, not only in their traditional role in the invention and analysis of numerical methods, but also as fundamental theoretical tools for mathematical experimentation and discovery, as proof techniques, and as models of computability and tractability.  By assembling a large, broad group of participants, ranging from established mathematicians and computer scientists to graduate students, the program will transform our knowledge of computational mathematics well into the future.<br/><br/>The Fields Institute in Toronto will host this timely six-month program, capitalizing on rapidly evolving networks of international expertise linking mathematics and computation; NSF funding will support participation of junior U.S. researchers and graduate students.  The impact of constantly increasing computational power on applied mathematics, science and engineering, motivated by new applications such as encryption, data mining, and web search, has inevitably led to the study of the computational tools themselves, creating and reinvigorating a rich spectrum of mathematical disciplines broadly represented at this special semester.  The program involves three one-week focus workshops, special lecture series and graduate courses (delivered in particular by two distinguished U.S. female computer scientists, Eva Tardos and Lenore Blum), diverse senior and junior researchers and postdoctoral fellows making long- and short-term visits and engaging in day-to-day interaction, and extensive efforts to disseminate the emerging new science.
