No Boundaries: Groups in Algebra, Geometry, and Topology is a conference that highlights the significant impact of the field of geometric group theory on several related mathematical fields.  The conference also aims to promote further fundamental discoveries in geometric group theory and the related fields.  This conference will expose attendees to the highest caliber of mathematics, presented by some of the field's best expositors. Through the recorded videos, mathematicians at a wide variety of institutions will gain valuable exposure to these ideas. The organizers expect that the conference will serve as inspiration for a new generation of researchers to develop both depth and breadth in their work.<br/><br/>The aims of the conference are to highlight current mathematical advances at the various interfaces of geometric group theory, low-dimensional topology, representation theory, dynamics, number theory, and algebraic geometry; examples include the development of the theory of representation stability and the resolution of many long-standing conjectures in the theory of 3-manifold topology and the theory of mapping class group groups.  There will be plenary lectures by top experts in a variety of related fields. The conference will have several sessions of lightning talks, affording junior researchers a high-profile stage in which to present their results, and ample time to discuss their work with experts during breaks. The conference will also feature a problem session, the output of which will shape the direction of research in these areas for years to come.

Topological phases of matter, the importance of which has been recognized by scientific awards that include the 2016 Nobel prize in physics, exhibit many-body quantum entanglement. This makes such materials prime candidates for use in a quantum computer.  Topological quantum computation is maturing at the forefront of the second quantum revolution as a primary application of topological phases of matter. The theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution remains under development, but it appears clear that algebras and their representations will play a role analogous to that played by group theory in the first quantum revolution. This focused research group aims to formulate the theoretical foundations of topological quantum computation, leading to an eventual theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution. It is anticipated that the results of the research will guide and accelerate the construction of a topological quantum computer. A working topological quantum computer will fundamentally transform the landscape of information science and technology. The project includes participation by graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The goal of topological quantum computation is the construction of a useful quantum computer based on braiding anyons. The hardware of an anyonic quantum computer will be a topological phase of matter that harbors non-abelian anyons. A physical system is in a topological phase if at low energies some physical quantities are topologically invariant. Topological properties are non-local, yet can manifest themselves through local geometric properties. The success of topological quantum computation hinges on controlling topological phases and understanding their computational power. This research addresses the mathematical, physical, and computational aspects of topological quantum computation. The projects include classification of super-modular categories, vector-valued modular forms for modular categories, extension of modular categories to three dimensions, simulation of conformal field theories, topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries and symmetry defects, and universality of topological computing models. The research has potential impacts ranging from new understanding of vertex operator algebras to the development of useful quantum computers. One specific goal is a structure theory of modular categories analogous to that of finite groups. Such a theory would lead to a structure theory of two-dimensional topological phases of matter."

Topology studies the mathematical properties of ""spaces,"" from the physical 3-dimensional space and 4-dimensional space-time in which we carry out our daily lives, to much more abstract spaces such as the space of all possible configurations of a robot or all possible solutions to an equation. This conference will bring together about two hundred topologists from around the world to share state of the art knowledge, hear talks from a select group of internationally renowned experts on the most important research results of the past eight years, and develop new collaborations. This conference has a history of showcasing groundbreaking work and inspiring many generations of topologists, and this year's iteration will continue that tradition. This grant will support travel expenses for graduate students, early career researchers and speakers.<br/><br/>The purpose of the 2017 conference is to have the most important results obtained during the last few years in geometric topology and related geometry presented to a wide topological audience,including a large number of students and recent PhD's, and to introduce young mathematicians to the techniques underlying these results. The topics will highlight exciting new developments including advances in hyperbolic three-manifolds, mapping class groups, symplectic rigidity and flexibility, contact topology, and invariants of knots, three-manifolds, and four-manifolds. Historically this meeting has generated tremendous interest among graduate students and recent PhD's.  Special attention is given to inviting young researchers in topology to speak. The combination of speakers and topics to be presented will offer students and fresh Ph.D.s a great opportunity to listen to and interact with the leaders in the subject as well as with successful mathematicians at the beginning of their careers. To complement the research talks, a series of expository lectures are scheduled that will introduce young mathematicians to the major themes of the conference.  Previous proceedings of the Georgia Topology Conference have been among the best of any conference proceedings. Continuing with the tradition, all of the speakers will be invited to submit articles and conference participants will be enlisted to help review submitted articles for the proceedings.The conference website is at: https://research.franklin.uga.edu/topology/content/2017-georgia-international-topology-conference"

Smooth topology uses the tools of calculus to understand and classify these spaces; intriguingly, different dimensions behave very differently when looked at through the lens of calculus. Most surprisingly, foundational problems have been solved in dimensions less than and greater than four, but stubbornly resist attack in the space-time in which we actually live. This project brings together a group of researchers, with a diverse set of skills and experience, to help tackle these fundamental problems in smooth four-dimensional topology, by utilizing a key new idea about how to decompose (trisect) four-dimensional spaces into elementary building blocks. In particular, the study of trisections allows exporting many successful ideas from three-dimensional topology to four-dimensional topology. Along with the study of four-dimensional spaces in their own right, the investigators will also study the ways in which lower-dimensional spaces can be embedded in dimension four, in analogy with the study of knots as embeddings of circles in three-dimensional space. Using these tools and analogies, this focused research group aims to develop new ways to distinguish four-dimensional objects, new four-dimensional constructions, and new applications of four-dimensional results to topology and geometry in other settings and dimensions.<br/><br/>The smooth topology of four-dimensional manifolds remains one of the greatest mysteries in topology, as evidenced by open questions such as the Poincare and Schoenflies conjectures, which have been solved in all dimensions other than four.  This focused research group aims to breathe new life into this important field of study by exploiting a striking new perspective on four-manifolds: Every four-manifold decomposes into three simple pieces, and this trisection is unique up to a natural stabilization. The setup exactly parallels the three-dimensional theory of Heegaard splittings, setting the table for an interesting and valuable exchange of ideas between dimensions three and four.  Many extremely rich theories have been developed over the last few decades in low-dimensional topology, such as contact topology, Heegaard Floer homology, Heegaard splittings and bridge splittings, Khovanov homology, Dehn surgery, curve complexes, and thin position. These ideas now have the potential to interact with the theory of trisections. The focus of this project is the development of these connections into a comprehensive theory that solves important problems in four-dimensional topology."

Algebraic topology associates algebraic invariants to spaces, moving the problem of understanding spaces (up to continuous deformation), to the more tractable world of algebra. At the heart of this project is the problem of understanding some of these invariants when the space in question is considered with the additional data of its symmetries. For example, instead of just considering a sphere, we can try to build in the additional data of the symmetry which maps each point to its antipodal point; or instead of considering a plane, we can consider a plane together with all the rigid motions of the plane that fix a square centered at its origin. The particular invariants considered in this project are algebraic K-theory and A-theory: deep invariants that have very significant connections to problems in number theory and geometry. Their versatility, however, requires sophisticated topological and categorical constructions. Part of this project is concerned with completing some necessary foundational work that allows these constructions to encode the extra data of symmetries, and part of it is concerned with using newly developed tools to rigorously define and study these theories, while keeping track of symmetries. There is also an educational component to the proposal-the PI plans to start a Directed Reading Program at the Johns Hopkins University, modeled on the one at the University of Chicago. The goal is to provide mentorship to undergraduates by pairing them with graduate students for reading courses, and in the process encourage interested students to pursue graduate work in mathematics.<br/><br/>Building on the PI's previous work on equivariant algebraic K-theory, the PI will develop an equivariant version of A-theory that is related to equivariant pseudo-isotopies and h-cobordisms of G-manifolds. Th project fits into a long-term research program of the project team aimed at establishing a chain of homotopy-theoretic constructions that relate the geometric behavior of compact G-manifolds to that of their underlying equivariant homotopy types. In current work, the project team has defined an equivariant A-theory spectrum, and the next step is to show that it fits into an equivariant stable parametrized h-cobordism theorem. In a related project with collaborators, the PI plans to study an equivariant version of the additivity theorem for Waldhausen G-categories. Nonequivariantly, K-theory is universal with respect to the additivity theorem, and equivariantly one can hope for a similar characterization. Progress has been slow in equivariant K and A-theory partly because adequate foundations were not in place. Equivariant infinite loop space theory, the machinery which turns suitable categories with G-action into G-spectra, has seen a lot of development in the last few years, and, motivated by the need for a solid foundation for equivariant algebraic K and A-theory, the PI, together with collaborators, is completing a series of projects on equivariant infinite loop space theory. This work not only produces new results (some of which have been anticipated for about 35 years), but they also consolidate work in important areas where the literature is fragmented and in need of clarification. They should provide some of the tools for the projects proposed above, as well as some related ones. In a different direction, the PI and collaborators have defined and are studying a spectral character map that generalizes the classical character map from representation theory. Lastly, the PI plans to study motivic Galois extensions."

This geometry comes from projecting points in a higher dimensional space along lines to a lower dimensional projective space. Unlike Euclidean geometry, this geometry has no well-defined notions of distance or angle. Its only meaningful geometric notion is incidence (for example, intersections of lines and inclusion of points in lines). In principle, this inability to measure distance initially seems like a drawback; however, in practice it provides a unified framework for studying seemingly disparate and incongruous geometries simultaneously. For example, projective space has pieces that serve as models for the familiar Euclidean geometry, the non-Euclidean spherical and hyperbolic geometries, and other exotic geometries, such as de Sitter and anti de Sitter space, that are of interest in modern physics. Recently, there has been increased interest in properly convex domains, which are interesting pieces of projective space that share many properties with hyperbolic space but enjoy interesting deformation properties absent in the hyperbolic setting. A primary focus of this project is to produce more of these properly convex examples and to understand their geometric, dynamic, and algebraic properties in a systematic fashion.  Due to built-in connections with perspective and computer vision, many of the low dimensional examples under study in this project can be effectively visualized and rendered with the aid of a computer to produce vibrant dynamic graphics. This feature will allow the involvement of students with limited mathematical background in portions of the research as well as conveying the spirit of many of the important results to the broader non-mathematical community. <br/><br/>Properly convex domains are subsets of projective space that are disjoint from a projective hyperplane and convex in the affine space produced by removing such a hyperplane from projective space. Hyperbolic space serves as the prime example of a properly convex domain via the Klein model. Properly convex domains and their quotients by discrete groups share many properties with hyperbolic space and hyperbolic orbifolds. A main point of this proposal is to understand how familiar concepts in hyperbolic geometry manifest themselves in properly convex geometry. Three main aims of the project are 1) developing a properly convex theory of Dehn surgery that can be used to produce examples of closed properly convex manifolds from non-compact ones, 2) investigating how dynamic properties of the fundamental group of a projective manifold manifest themselves geometrically, in analogy with geometric finiteness for hyperbolic manifolds, and 3) using properly convex structures to produce subgroups of the special linear group with interesting algebraic properties (such as thinness). In addition to the obvious potential to better understand geometric and dynamical aspects of properly convex manifolds, this project should also yield a deeper understanding of hyperbolic geometry by elucidating which geometric features of hyperbolic geometry are consequences of uniform negative curvature and which are consequences of more general geometric structure."

One of the central questions of algebraic topology is to classify all of the possible mappings of a sphere of a given dimension onto a sphere of different dimension. More recently, this question has received attention in other contexts: when the spheres are considered in the realm of algebraic geometry, or when the spheres have specified symmetries which must be preserved by the mappings in question. Even more recently, greater understanding of how these various contexts impact each other has emerged. The PI will endeavor to expand the range in which these questions are understood, especially in the setting of spheres with a twofold symmetry. Another component of the project focuses on an invariant known as K-theory, which lies at the interface of topology and algebra. The PI will develop a version of K-theory which is simultaneously equipped with symmetries and multiplications.<br/><br/>The PI will continue his joint work with Dan Isaksen on computations in the motivic and C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups of spheres. The computation of motivic stable homotopy groups over C is fairly similar to that of classical stable homotopy groups. From there, the Bockstein spectral sequence recovers the motivic stable homotopy groups over R. Finally, accounting for the ""negative cone"" in the C2-equivariant homology of a point leads to the equivariant stable homotopy groups. In a different direction the PI, together with May, Merling, and Osorno, will continue to investigate the presentation of G-spectra as spectral Mackey functors. A centerpiece of this theory is an equivariant infinite loop space machine with good multiplicative properties. A number of tools that figure centrally in applications, such as equivariantly commutative multiplications, norm maps, and geometric fixed points, are not well understood in this model of G-spectra."

Besides increasing advocacy and administrative service on such issues, this goal is pursued by means of weekly community building and career development meetings, an annual mentoring retreat, and the development of equity training modules for faculty.  <br/> <br/>The symplectic category and pseudoholomorphic quilt invariants introduced by the PI provide a general framework for studying questions relating the symplectic category to others, e.g. categories of sheaves involved in mirror symmetry (thus encoding relations between symplectic and algebraic geometry), or cobordism categories involved in topological field theories (thus in particular constructing invariants of 3- and 4-manifolds). One core goal of the research is to extend the categorical structures to general symplectic manifolds with the help of analysis for singular quilts and more refined algebraic structures - both motivated by capturing obstructions arising from novel figure eight bubbles. This extension can be summarized in a notion of A-infinity-2-category which in particular contains all Fukaya A-infinity-categories of symplectic manifolds. The proposal's aim is a fully rigorous and accessible construction of this category. Another goal is to establish an abstract construction principle for topological invariants via the symplectic category and algebraic tools for relating them to each other as well as gauge theoretic invariants. This provides a unified understanding for both Ozsvath-Szabo's Heegard-Floer theory and its relation to Seiberg-Witten invariants, as well as conjectural symplectic versions of Donaldson invariants and instanton Floer homology. In addition, it can help systematize future constructions and proofs of relationships between such invariants. The proposal also aims to apply this conceptual framework in some concrete situations. In particular, it addresses Atiyah-Floer type conjectures in dimension 3 - solidifying a guiding vision for the field - and extends them to dimension 4 - providing a vision for future developments.  More concretely, this last part aims at establishing symplectic analogues of both Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten 4-manifold invariants, which are expected to be more amenable to calculations. Finally, the project aims to solidify and provide accessible expositions of the differential-topological foundations for regularizations of moduli spaces of elliptic PDEs. After finalizing the blueprint for rigorous Kuranishi-type regularizations, the focus will lie on increasing access to the polyfold technology. In particular, a group of junior researchers is being involved in efforts to build a toolbox (such as fiber products and equivariant transversality) and sample applications from equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants via the Arnold conjecture to Fukaya categories."

This is a continuation of a previously supported regional conference series in algebraic topology that meets three times per year and rotates between universities in the Midwest and Great Lakes areas. The next two meetings are at Wayne State University (October 2017) and Northwestern University (Winter 2018). The Midwest Topology Seminar has been running continuously since the early 1970s, with at least one of the yearly meetings held in Chicago, the hub of the network. Algebraic topology has always been broadly construed to include homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, geometric group theory, and high dimensional manifolds; more recently the series has explored connections to algebraic geometry, representation theory, number theory, low-dimensional manifolds, and mathematical physics.<br/><br/>The Midwest Topology Seminar is a long-standing, reliable, low-key, and low-cost way for participants to keep up with the field. The Midwest is a traditional and continuing center of algebraic topology; hence there is a strong source of local speakers. Programs are augmented with featured speakers from around the country. The audiences are always large and diversified, drawing faculty and graduate students from a broad range of institutions. The Midwest Topology Seminar serves as a nexus for a vibrant community of research mathematicians, optimizing the distribution of new ideas through the field, especially among early career research mathematicians and mathematicians away from the traditional centers of research. This award supports travel expenses for approximately fifteen participants to each meeting.  Support goes to graduate students and also to research mathematicians with limited funds from other sources. Conference web site is at www.math.wayne.edu/~rrb/MTS/"

They will advise graduate students on projects related to the main objectives of the grant.  The outreach component is to organize several workshops and conferences aimed at developing communication and collaborative research between participants of the project, establishing scientific connections with other mathematicians, as well as fostering broader applications of this work.<br/><br/>In 1999, Turaev introduced Homotopy Quantum Field Theories (HQFTs), which are generalizations of Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) studied by Schwartz, Witten, and Atiyah.  HQFTs produce topological invariants of manifolds furnished with extra data that add supplementary topology/geometry to the context of TQFTs.  Most of the theory of quantum invariants and HQFTs involves monoidal categories which have certain additional properties like being semi-simple.  In various collaborations started in 2005,   the team members developed a theory of re-normalized Quantum Invariants that derives non-trivial topological invariants from non-semi-simple categories.  In this project the principal investigators will further use renormalization to develop non-trivial HQFTs, based on the examples coming from the theory of unrestricted quantum group.  These new HQFTs should share the strength and the new features of the re-normalized Quantum Invariants.  The principal investigators will further search for a physical interpretation of these new invariants."

An important part of three-dimensional topology is also the study of knots, or in other words, loops embedded in some tangled way in three-manifolds. The solution of a well-known problem known as Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture has established that three-manifolds, and complements of knots in them, decompose into pieces that admit explicit geometries. One of the most common and most interesting geometries that appear in this setting is hyperbolic geometry.  In practice, three-manifolds are often given in terms of combinatorial topological descriptions and it is both natural and important to seek for ways to deduce geometric information from these descriptions. One of the ways that topologists have been approaching the study of three-manifolds is through the construction and study of objects called invariants. In the last few decades, ideas that originated in quantum physics have led mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of subtle and powerful invariants of knots and three-manifolds.  Understanding the connections of topological and combinatorial quantities and invariants to detailed geometric structures, arising from Thurston's picture, is a central and important goal of low dimensional topology.  The main theme of this project is to establish such connections and to explore their ramifications and applications to topology  as well as other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>The project aims to establish intrinsic connections between geometry and topological descriptions, properties, and quantum invariants of links and three-manifolds.

The idea of noncommutative geometry is to study geometry using noncommutative algebras, which are mathematical objects that have operations of addition and multiplication; however, the multiplication may not be commutative: xy does not have to equal yx. The purpose of the project is to investigate a set of mathematical problems motivated by physics. More specifically, the motivation derives from a combination of ideas from quantum mechanics, string theory, and classical areas of mathematics such as algebra and geometry.  The interdisciplinary nature of the research promotes further interaction between these fields. The project provides excellent opportunities for the investigator to work with young scientists and to exchange ideas with colleagues from other countries to promote scientific collaborations.<br/><br/>In noncommutative geometry, one studies geometry via algebras of functions on noncommutative manifolds. On such a noncommutative manifold, the relevant objects are no longer points in a space, but rather a noncommutative associative algebra, or a differential graded commutative algebra.  An important class of noncommutative manifolds can be obtained as deformations of commutative algebras.  The theory of deformation quantization lies on the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics. The mathematical structures of the two theories are very different.  Quantization, roughly speaking, is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative associative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. This project will focus on the study of homotopy algebra structures in noncommutative geometry using tools from deformation quantization and Lie groupoid and Lie algebroid theory.  The problems include exploring the Duflo and Todd type class, establishing a Kontsevich-Duflo type theorem, and studying Tsygan noncommutative calculi in a general framework in terms of Lie algebroids."

In special cases, gauge theory is believed to underlie the mathematical description of the universe; for example, the standard model for particle physics is a gauge theory in four dimensions.  The subject also has deep links with many areas of mathematics, including partial differential equations, representation theory, algebraic geometry, differential geometry and topology. However, most research in gauge theory and almost all applications so far have focused on dimensions two, three and four.   In this project, the PI intends to push the boundary of our understanding of gauge theory in higher dimensions.  The PI's results are expected to have wide implications for geometric analysis, because the fundamental system of equations that define gauge theory (the Yang-Mills equations) poses additional challenges, in terms of controlling the solutions, that are not present in lower dimensions.  The PI's work will also have impact through integrated research and training, as the PI plans to involve undergraduates in research opportunities related to his project.<br/><br/>The PI's research project consists of three parts.  The first part of the project will extend this dictionary between gauge theory and complex algebraic geometry to the context of Hermitian-Yang Mills connections with singularities, and specifically understand the fine structure at the singularities in terms of the complex algebraic geometry of the corresponding reflexive sheaves. In the second part of this project, the PI will develop a deformation theory for a certain class of Yang-Mills connections called G2-instantons with one-dimensional singular set, and use this to construct concrete examples of singular G2-instantons from algebro-geometric input. The third part of the PI's research project will further explore the role that generalized Seiberg-Witten equations (specifically the ones discovered in joint work of Andriy Haydys and the PI) play in gauge theory in higher dimensions.  As alluded to above, the main obstacle to progress in gauge theory in higher dimension is our lack of understanding of the non-compactness issues arising from the fact that the Yang-Mills equations become super-critical starting in dimension five and leading to the formation of non-removable singularities and bubbling phenomena.  <br/>"

Smooth topology uses the tools of calculus to understand and classify these spaces; intriguingly, different dimensions behave very differently when looked at through the lens of calculus. Most surprisingly, foundational problems have been solved in dimensions less than and greater than four, but stubbornly resist attack in the space-time in which we actually live. This project brings together a group of researchers, with a diverse set of skills and experience, to help tackle these fundamental problems in smooth four-dimensional topology, by utilizing a key new idea about how to decompose (trisect) four-dimensional spaces into elementary building blocks. In particular, the study of trisections allows exporting many successful ideas from three-dimensional topology to four-dimensional topology. Along with the study of four-dimensional spaces in their own right, the investigators will also study the ways in which lower-dimensional spaces can be embedded in dimension four, in analogy with the study of knots as embeddings of circles in three-dimensional space. Using these tools and analogies, this focused research group aims to develop new ways to distinguish four-dimensional objects, new four-dimensional constructions, and new applications of four-dimensional results to topology and geometry in other settings and dimensions.<br/><br/>The smooth topology of four-dimensional manifolds remains one of the greatest mysteries in topology, as evidenced by open questions such as the Poincare and Schoenflies conjectures, which have been solved in all dimensions other than four.  This focused research group aims to breathe new life into this important field of study by exploiting a striking new perspective on four-manifolds: Every four-manifold decomposes into three simple pieces, and this trisection is unique up to a natural stabilization. The setup exactly parallels the three-dimensional theory of Heegaard splittings, setting the table for an interesting and valuable exchange of ideas between dimensions three and four.  Many extremely rich theories have been developed over the last few decades in low-dimensional topology, such as contact topology, Heegaard Floer homology, Heegaard splittings and bridge splittings, Khovanov homology, Dehn surgery, curve complexes, and thin position. These ideas now have the potential to interact with the theory of trisections. The focus of this project is the development of these connections into a comprehensive theory that solves important problems in four-dimensional topology."

A theme central to the project is deepening our understanding of 4-dimensional aspects of ""knotting,"" an area which attempts to understand and quantify the method by which strings become tangled and knotted in space. In addition to a fundamental role that knot theory plays in topology, its has deep interactions with many seemingly unconnected areas of mathematics and physics, and even to areas such as polymer science and biology. One of the primary aims of the project is to understand both how knots evolve over time and the surfaces that they bound in 4-dimensional space. Imagine a movie in which a piece of string freely moves in space, becoming more or less tangled over time. Further, imagine that at some frames in the movie more drastic phenomena occur such as the appearance or disappearance of a new loop of string or the gluing of two segments of the string together. Such a movie is called a ""cobordism,"" and using this idea one can treat knotted pieces of string in much the same way that we treat numbers; namely, one can add and subtract knots in an algebraic way. Understanding this arithmetic turns out to have deep implications for the study of 4-dimensional space, one of the most difficult and least understood areas of mathematics.  Primary goals in this vein include understanding knotted curves whose cobordisms arise from complex polynomials and probing the aforementioned algebraic structures using tools inspired by mathematical physics.   In addition to its mathematical goals, the project will contribute to the organization of conferences and workshops, and provide critical support for students.<br/><br/>Knot theory and its 4-dimensional aspects play a fundamental role throughout the project and can be viewed as its primary focus.  Specific goals include determining the faithfulness of geometric maps between concordance and cobordism groups, topological characterizations of knots that bound complex curves in Stein domains, and the development of algebraic tools to facilitate computations of subtle invariant of knots, tangles, and 3-manifolds defined by way of Lagrangian Floer homology and non-abelian gauge theory.  The project crosses boundaries between topology, analysis, algebra, and combinatorics, and uses techniques from homological algebra, gauge theory, knot theory, contact geometry, and the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds."

The classical physics describes the universe we live in as a 3-manifold. Hyperbolic geometry is a (non-Euclidean) geometric model satisfying Euclid's first four postulates but not the fifth (the parallel postulate). It turns out that hyperbolic geometry is much more important than Euclidean geometry for 3-manifolds. Thurston's and Perelman's works imply that ""most"" 3-manifolds have a hyperbolic geometric structure (i.e., they are hyperbolic 3-manifolds). These hyperbolic 3-manifolds can be described by so-called discrete groups of two-by-two matrices, and their covering spaces correspond to subgroups of these discrete groups. Although subgroups of the matrix groups may seem easy to understand, various properties of covering spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are actually quite mysterious. The PI plans to investigate covering spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds by various geometric and algebraic methods.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to investigate finite covers of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and to use finite covers of fibered hyperbolic 3-manifolds to study finite covers of pseudo-Anosov maps.

The first topic is about the asymptotic behavior of topological invariants of finite covers of 3-manifolds (e.g., the Seifert volume, the size of homological torsion). The second topic is to use finite covers of hyperbolic 3-manifolds to study finite covers of pseudo-Anosov maps (e.g., the virtual homological spectral radii of pseudo-Anosov maps).

This is an asymmetric Finsler metric defined on Teichmuller spaces, using the hyperbolic lengths of geodesic laminations on a surface and Lipschitz maps between surfaces, as opposed to using measured foliations and quasiconformal maps which give rise to the Teichmuller metric. This metric was introduced by Thurston over thirty years ago but it has not been studied extensively until recently. It has a distinctive and rich structure that is already apparent in two-dimensional Teichmuller space. In this case, the PI and her collaborators have developed a clear picture of the infinitesimal and coarse geometry of this metric.

Conference speakers and participants from outside of the United States will be supported by the German national research foundation (DFG) through the grants SFB-1085 and SPP-1786.<br/><br/>In the past fifteen years, we have seen the rapid development of the field of derived algebraic geometry. Because it draws threads and inspiration from algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, algebraic K-theory, and even mathematical physics, this field has attracted a large number of early-career researchers. This conference will bring together international experts from algebraic topology, homotopy theory, derived algebraic geometry, and related areas, and the focus of the conference will be current work and emerging ideas in the field, using the existence and applications of dualities as a theme.  Throughout algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, the existence of a theory of duality reveals deep structure about the objects under study. Basic examples include Poincare duality for manifolds or Serre duality for varieties, but these are expressions of much more general phenomena best studied in the derived setting.  There has been significant recent progress in derived algebraic geometry, in both theory and computations. It is the aim of this conference both to consolidate these advances and to promote new research directions.<br/><br/>Conference webpage:<br/>http://www-cgi.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/MAT/sfb-higher-invariants/index.php/SpringSchool2017"

The Young Topologists Meeting (YTM) is an annual European conference focused on the work of graduate students and young researchers in topology that brings in participants from all over the world. At the YTM, junior topologists present their work to a large international audience, and also attend mini-courses taught by senior topologists. The conference provides opportunities for the participants to meet new colleagues and mentors, to learn about current progress of researchers in their fields, and to form research collaborations. Its open and supportive atmosphere encourages young mathematicians, including those from underrepresented groups, to pursue research careers in topology.<br/><br/>The YTM is an annual event, first started in 2007, which traditionally alternates between Copenhagen, Denmark and Lausanne, Switzerland until 2017 when it will be hosted in Stockholm, Sweden. The conference features parallel sessions of contributed talks by graduate students and young researchers, covering a broad spectrum of topics in topology. In addition to these talks, there will be mini-courses by two senior topologists, focusing in particular on techniques that expose underlying structure and connections in algebraic topology and in general on new applications, avenues of research, and open problems. This year the mini-courses will be on group homology and stability (""Topology interacting with number theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry"") and on the comparison of the differential graded world and spectra (""The equivalence of differential graded modules and HZ-module spectra, applications, and generalizations"").

The first meeting will take place at the University of Arkansas, in Fayetteville, Arkansas on April 27-29, 2017.  The fall meeting will be held at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma in fall of 2017.  A key objective of the Redbud Conference series is to increase interaction and collaboration between geometers and topologists in the EPSCoR states of Arkansas and Oklahoma.  These meetings continue the series of Redbud Conferences held twice per year beginning in Fall 2011 on a rotating basis at the University of Arkansas, Oklahoma State University, and the University of Oklahoma.  The mathematical focus of the spring meeting in 2017 is geometric group theory and low dimensional topology.  The opening day of the spring meeting is a graduate student workshop featuring three talks of an expository nature delivered by speakers from the conference.  This gives graduate students from the Arkansas-Oklahoma region the opportunity to interact with the larger mathematical community.  The fall meeting is intended to showcase the work of graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and junior faculty from the region.  <br/><br/>The specific focus of each meetings is as follows.  The spring meeting will feature ten talks on geometric group theory and low dimensional topology.  These are areas of intense research that utilize the interaction between the dynamics of group actions and the geometry of the spaces they act on to understand algebraic structure.  Specific topics to be included are the outer automorphism group of a free group or a right-angled Artin group, the mapping class group of a surface and hyperbolic geometry.  The fall meeting will feature five talks primarily by early-career mathematicians on a range of topics in topology and geometric group theory, based around the research interests of faculty at the three schools.   The organizers will post notes and/or slides from the talks on the conference website. The conference website is comp.uark.edu/~mattclay/Redbud/"

A ""geometric structure"" means a set of coordinate systems where the coordinates live in a space with a ""classical geometry:"" examples include Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, projective geometry, affine geometry or conformal geometry. Since the mid 19th century, considerations of symmetry emphasize the viewpoint that a classical geometry is just the study of properties which are unchanged under the transitive action of a Lie group.  Closely related is the importance of symmetry in modern physics, and many of objects in this investigation have physical motivations. Classification of geometric structures on a fixed topology means putting the more rigid geometric measurements on a loosely organized collection of points, which is the topology.  A simple example is the fact that the sphere cannot support  Euclidean geometry.  This is just the mathematical abstraction of the fact that there is no metrically accurate world atlas. At least one page of the world atlas will distort distance.   On the other hand the torus (the surface of a doughnut, bagel or inner tube) does admit Euclidean structures. In fact the different ways of putting Euclidean geometry on a torus has a rich geometry of its own. Technology plays a key tool both in this investigation and its dissemination to the public. Many mathematicians are involved in this project, including colleagues, postdocs, graduate students, undergraduate students and even high school students. The objects of study are often two- and three-dimensional and can be visualized with the use of computers. All the software developed in the project is publicly available and invites further education and experimentation in this research project.<br/><br/><br/>While the traditional methods of classification of geometric  structures involve a quotient space, frequently the moduli spaces are pathological. Simple examples lead to quotients of nice spaces by chaotic group actions. The PI adopts the viewpoint that classification of geometric structures is really a  dynamical system. Many well known interesting dynamical systems arise from this context. In particular the extension of the Teichmuller geodesic flow  to the universal character variety over the  Riemann moduli space has rich dynamics, impacting low-dimensional geometry, topology and mathematical physics.  The PI will study this dynamical system as the fusion of  the well-developed subject of Teichmuller dynamics and his previous work on mapping class group dynamics on character varieties and  moduli spaces of geometric structures."

A triangulation is a subdivision of a surface into triangles. Analogously, we subdivide a three-dimensional space into tetrahedra, and higher dimensional spaces into similar higher dimensional geometric shapes. Triangulations are one of the most effective ways to describe topological objects, particularly for use with computers. There are many ways to triangulate a topological object, each of which may be better or worse for a particular purpose. However, different triangulations can be related to each other by sequences of simple, local moves. One of the central goals of this NSF funded project is to better understand how useful properties of triangulations change as we alter them by these moves. Another goal centers on mathematical visualization to aid in research, pedagogy and outreach. This includes finding effective ways to visualize mathematical objects using new technologies, including 3D printing, virtual, and augmented reality. The PI has developed an undergraduate course integrating 3D design skills with the mathematics needed to produce 3D printed objects. He plans to extend this pedagogical method to other subjects in quantitative science. With colleagues, the PI is planning to write a resource book to help others create and teach mathematics with 3D printing. Outreach activities to the broader community will include expository papers, public talks, YouTube videos, open-source visualization apps, and collaboration with mathematics museums.<br/> <br/>In this NSF funded project, together with his collaborators, the PI aims to study classes of triangulations, including triangulations with essential edges or angle structures, 1-efficient, geometric or veering triangulations: relations between these classes and topological and geometric invariants, methods of constructing triangulations in these classes, and the structure of subgraphs of the Pachner graph of triangulations corresponding to these classes. Another aim is to generalize properties and results from three-dimensional to four-dimensional triangulations. The methods used will be largely combinatorial, and accessible to beginning graduate and undergraduate students. One visualization project is to find canonical 3D geometric representations of topological objects, so that models can be 3D printed. Subjects include Seifert surfaces, fibrations of knot complements, and conformally correct tilings of surfaces. Algebraic descriptions and discrete optimization processes will be used to generate geometry. Other projects in 3D printing include study and construction of interesting linkages and other mechanisms. Previous work in implementing virtual reality simulations of 3D hyperbolic geometry, and the product of 2D hyperbolic geometry with the line, has already been successful in inspiring mathematicians, physicists, and members of the public. The PI plans to extend this work to the other Thurston geometries and beyond, aid other researchers in visualizing objects they are interested in within these geometries, and construct engaging interactive experiences to make these geometries more accessible to the public. Finally, the PI aims to implement interactive topological simulations, for example to allow a user to physically manipulate a virtual sphere that behaves as in the context of sphere eversion."

Since the space we inhabit is three-dimensional, this field has wide-ranging applications, from understanding the possible shapes of the universe to describing the knotting of polymers and DNA molecules. Understanding the properties of three-dimensional spaces requires an array of sophisticated tools from a range of disciplines within mathematics, including algebraic topology, geometry, analysis, and representation theory. Each tool for studying three-dimensional spaces carries with it a notion of which spaces are ""simple"" and which are ""complicated."" The primary goal of this project is to explore the relationship between different tools used to describe three-dimensional spaces and the corresponding notions of simplicity. Ultimately the investigator hopes to consolidate and deepen our knowledge of these spaces and to build bridges between a variety of mathematical fields.<br/><br/>A key technical tool to be used in this investigation is bordered Heegaard Floer homology, a version of Heegaard Floer homology for 3-manifolds with boundary. In particular, the project centers on developing a new geometric interpretation of bordered Heegaard Floer invariants; this is a concrete realization of a deep connection between bordered Heegaard Floer homology and certain Fukaya categories. In the case of torus boundary, the invariants may be interpreted as decorated immersed curves in the boundary torus. This framework greatly simplifies computations and leads to proofs of interesting gluing results. This will be applied to the classification of L-spaces (3-manifolds that are ""simple"" with respect to Heegaard Floer homology). As one application, the investigator seeks to confirm a conjecture equating three measures of simplicity for 3-manifolds: being an L-space, having non-left-orderable fundamental group, and not admitting a co-orientable taut foliation. Other goals of the project include restricting the possible decompositions of L-space knots and relating Heegaard Floer homology to the complexity of the Jaco-Shalen-Johannson decomposition."

The immense size of the graph can make it hard to study, but in some situations one can get around this by randomly choosing a vertex (say, a house) and then analyzing only the part of the graph that lies near that vertex. If one so samples the graph enough times, useful information can be deduced about it without ever dealing with the whole graph in its entirety. In this NSF funded CAREER project, the PI will apply a similar philosophy to the study of more general geometric shapes: by randomly sampling the geometry at different points, conclusions about global structure can be derived. Early-career mathematicians, such as undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs, will be heavily involved in the project. With the help of other leading researchers, the PI will run two summer schools and three small research groups with the aim of exposing young mathematicians to newly developing fields. The PI will also continue to advise graduate students, to sponsor undergraduate research, and will complete his online book ""Geometry in Two Dimensions,"" which presents a modern, rigorous introduction to Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry without many of the usual prerequisites.<br/><br/>Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, proved by Perelman in 2003, states that every closed, orientable three dimensional manifold M can be cut into pieces, each of which admits one of eight types of homogenous metrics. Of these pieces, only the hyperbolic three-manifolds have not been classified. The Geometrization Theorem also includes topological conditions that characterize when M itself admits a hyperbolic metric. Mostow's Rigidity Theorem implies that any such hyperbolic metric is unique up to isometry, so it is natural to try to extract concrete geometric information about it from the topology of M. This program is referred to as effective geometrization, and has been studied by the PI, Brock, Canary, Minsky, Namazi, Souto, among many others. Much of this project can be considered as part of this program. Measure theory plays a central role in many of the projects proposed. Adapting a notion of local convergence from graph theory to Riemannian geometry, the PI will bring new measure theoretic insight to the growth of rank, Heegaard genus and Betti numbers, drawing inspiration from the fields of measurable group theory, graph limits, and foliations."

Despite its classical origins, this research area has recently experienced an explosion of progress centered on the study of quantum invariants defined using geometric objects known as holomorphic curves.  These quantum invariants have appeared not only in geometric analysis but also in low-dimensional topology, which studies three-dimensional space as well as four-dimensional space-time, and in certain models in high-energy physics.  The investigator will study fundamental questions about these quantum invariants, including their behavior under mathematical operations known as surgery and symmetry reduction.   Applications will be of interest in topology and physics. The investigator will also continue his outreach activities for middle-school geometry teachers.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project studies the behavior of quantum invariants such as the Fukaya category and quantum K-theory under operations such as flips, blow-ups, and symplectic reduction.  In the first part of the project, the investigator will construct generators of the Fukaya category associated to surgeries on the symplectic manifold that arise naturally as the symplectic structure is varied.   Each of these gives rise to a collection of objects in the Fukaya category, and conjecturally a factor in the quantum cohomology.  The main technique here involves the Abouzaid-Ganatra generation criterion and a restricted version of symplectic field theory for the Fukaya category developed using stabilizing divisors.  In the second part of the project, the investigator and collaborators will construct a homotopy version of Kirwan's map from the quasimap Fukaya category of a Hamiltonian group action to the Fukaya category of the symplectic quotient.  This study will have applications to the disk potentials of Lagrangians in symplectic quotients.   In a third collaborative project, the investigator will study the behavior of K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants under wall-crossing and aims to prove that the potentials are unchanged, generically, in the case of crepant birational transformations associated to variation of symplectic quotient."

For example, to understand a high dimensional geometric object, one can study the various ways that object fibers (i.e., can be build out of simpler, lower dimensional pieces which are arranged in a predictable way). Even if a complete understanding of the object may be out of reach, one can attempt to comprehend its properties ""on average."" In this project, the PI seeks to apply similar principles to the study of geometrically significant groups via their action on naturally associated spaces. This pursuit brings to bear methods from geometry, topology, dynamics, and group theory, and seeks to not only understand these objects in an abstract sense, but to produce tractable models which allow for quantitative understanding.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will carry out projects that investigate the geometry and topology of hyperbolic bundles as well as  study geometrically motivated counting problems in finitely generated groups. In the classical setting of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle, this project builds on a program to study the extent to which the veering triangulation (a certain combinatorial construction) effectively encodes the manifold's geometry and topology. Inspired by the elegant nature of these triangulations, the PI will construct a canonical ideal simplicial complex in the setting of free-by-cyclic groups; a setting where a single topological object controlling the group's algebraic decompositions is currently lacking. Finally, the PI will study the ""typical"" geometry of fibered manifolds, free-by-cyclic groups, and representations of hyperbolic groups. A common thread throughout these investigations will be to demonstrate the extent to which negative curvature features are persistent and, in the appropriate sense, generic."

These groups roughly correspond to regular affine tilings, i.e., tilings where all the tiles have the same shape up to an affine transformation. These groups also admit an interpretation in differential geometry as flat affine manifolds. The special case where these groups preserve a Euclidean metric, which in the language of tilings means that all the tiles have the same shape in an ordinary sense, has been very well-known for over a century: this is basically the subject of classical crystallography. In the general case, there is a much larger variety of these groups; and the question of their classification also leads to some fascinating questions in the theory of Lie groups and their representations.<br/><br/>The first part of the project consists in working on a conjecture that would give, for every semisimple real Lie group G and irreducible representation V thereof, a necessary and sufficient criterion for the existence of a subgroup Gamma in the group of affine automorphisms of V with linear part in G, such that Gamma has linear part Zariski-dense in G, is free nonabelian and acts properly discontinuously on V. The second part of the project consists in translating this abstract algebraic criterion into a simple condition on the highest restricted weight of the representation, and thus completely classifying Zariski-closures of such subgroups. The last part of the proposal consists in gaining a better understanding of these groups: for instance, constructing whenever possible a fundamental domain corresponding to their proper action on the affine space; going beyond proving existence or non-existence of such groups, by looking for results that classify all such groups for a given Zariski closure; and trying to link them with free groups acting properly on other homogeneous spaces."

Topology is the qualitative study of space and its connectedness. Its importance was recognized at the turn of the last century by the French mathematician Poincare, during his investigation of the laws of motion that govern the movement of a three-body system such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according to Newton's laws.  In the past twenty years, topology has seen applications in questions such as the knotting of and proteins DNA, and in modern theories of high-energy physics.  The topology of three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to those of higher dimension, is of particular subtlety. Graph theory also has a long history. It is the mathematical theory of networks and their connections, and sees application in many aspects computer science, algorithms and optimization. By viewing networks as embedded in three-dimensional space, this project aims to use techniques from topology to study questions in graph theory. The topological techniques will be drawn from many sources, but particularly from gauge theory, a field having its origins in fundamental physics. The project will deepen our understanding of topology and its interaction with other areas of mathematics and science. At the same time, the project will train graduate students and disseminate results to researchers in the area.<br/><br/>The project activity will be in the following specific areas. In collaboration with T. S. Mrowka, the PI will develop properties of an instanton homology for spatial trivalent graphs. This instanton homology was constructed in previous work using a gauge theory related to representations of the fundamental group of the graph's complement in the group of rotations, SO(3). The PI will investigate the dimension of the SO(3) instanton homology for general planar trivalent graphs. It is expected that the dimension is always related to the number of three-edge-colorings of the graph. As a stepping stone towards the proof, an variant of the instanton homlogy will be constructed using the larger group SU(3), and fixed-point theory will be used to compare the two versions. If the previous two goals are achieved, it will follow from this and other work that every bridgeless, planar trivalent graph admits at least one three-edge-coloring, a major result in the field, as it is equivalent to the four-color theorem, which is the statement that the regions of any planar map can be colored using only four colors. The four-color theorem has been proved previously only with computer assistance, and it is hoped that this project might therefore lead the way to the first human-readable proof."

It has connections to fields ranging from data analysis to physics.  The PI's research specifically focuses on the algebra used to study spaces that have interesting symmetries.  This type of structure has become increasingly important in recent developments in algebraic topology but is still comparatively poorly understood. The PI's work will advance state-of-the-art knowledge in this area of pure mathematics. Her research program is centered on developing the rich algebraic structures that arise in this context and using these to construct and analyze both classical and new algebro-topological deformation invariants of spaces with symmetries.  Additionally, the funds from this grant will assist the PI in her outreach activities designed to promote women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics, including her work with the newly formed Vanderbilt Women in Math group.<br/><br/>The PI plans to conduct research in equivariant stable homotopy theory. This area is primarily concerned with extracting features of spaces that are invariant under deformations and symmetries. Recent developments in homotopy theory have highlighted the importance of equivariance, as well as the many ways in which equivariance is remains poorly understood. Equivariant homotopy theory is key to modern computations in algebraic K-theory and in results in nonequivariant homotopy theory, such as the recent solution to the Kervaire invariant one problem. The PI's research program will develop new tools for extending these kinds of calculations as well as deepening our overall picture of the surprising ways in which symmetry manifests itself in homotopical considerations. A primary component of her work will be establishing methods of constructing cohomology theories with group actions from algebraic data in order to provide new and improved tools for further research in the field. Her work will also focus on developing algebraic structures inherent in equivariant cohomology theories with commutative ring structures. This work will provide calculational tools for use in a variety questions in homotopy theory.  Additionally, the PI will investigate a new cohomology theory for coalgebras, including its connections to equivariant cohomology theories arising from algebras. The overall goals of these avenues of research are to advance state-of-the-art knowledge in homotopy theory and more concretely in group actions in a homotopy theoretic context."

A major challenge in this area is that the fundamental notion of ""higher infinity-category"" is schematic, and thus technical developments rely upon explicit models, each of which can be quite complicated to specify. The PI will conduct three interwoven projects that advance the model-independent foundations for higher infinity-category theory, generalizing known results from the quasi-categorical model for infinity-categories to other models while simultaneously simplifying several technical proofs, as is often the case when one employs a judiciously chosen abstraction. The PI plans to co-write a book to make the model-independent foundations of infinity-category theory accessible to novices and present the new proof techniques developed in this program. The PI has written two books already, both of which are freely available online, and has a record of innovative pedagogy and conference organization. The PI will pursue further educational initiatives, developing a new discursive introduction to mathematical proof for undergraduates, expanding her work on campus as a departmental diversity representative, and facilitating a conversation on professional norms within the mathematics community through a conference followed by an edited volume of essays.<br/><br/>The first proposed project, joint with Verity, proves that all infinity-categorical notions are ""model-independent."" Hence any theorem proven with the aid of any model of infinity-categories will apply to them all. Together with Verity, the PI has introduced the notion of an infinity-cosmos, a universe in which (higher) infinity-categories live as objects, and has shown that the theory of infinity-categories can be developed from these axioms. This work describes a ""synthetic"" approach to the theory of infinity-categories in contrast to prior ""analytic"" approaches. A second proposed project, joint with Shulman, will develop a parallel synthetic theory of infinity-categories in homotopy type theory, a new univalent foundations for mathematics that conjecturally expresses the internal logic of an infinity-topos. The third proposed project, again joint with Verity, is to generalize from infinity-categories to higher infinity-categories by investigating the various infinity-cosmoi whose objects are complicial sets, a particularly economical model of higher infinity-categories that the PI suspects will ultimately lead to a model-independent theory."

This workshop aims to introduce aspiring mathematicians in the fields of symplectic and contact geometry and from many institutions to vibrant areas of research, fostering collaboration, forming strong research ties between young researchers, and thus promoting future collaboration and research.  The workshop is specifically designed to encourage the development of a diverse group of researchers in the fields of symplectic and contact geometry. It is a week-long intensive workshop, in which all activities occur under one roof. The lectures are delivered by the graduate student participants with the help of three mentors: Roger Casals (MIT), Laura Starkston (Stanford), and Steven Sivek (Bonn), who are emerging expert researchers in the field. This setup enhances communication skills, encourages active involvement or the participants and forging new collaborations.<br/><br/>The topic of the 2017 workshop is symplectic fillings of contact manifolds, a topic with both a rich history and lots of new ideas that are currently being developed.  One major aspect of the modern understanding of symplectic fillings is via an ever-growing dichotomy in symplectic and contact geometry: flexibility versus rigidity. Some fillings can be flexible, in which case they are completely determined up to isomorphism by differential-topological data; otherwise, there is a hope that some count of J-holomorphic curves implies that the symplectic geometry is more nuanced than the underlying differential topology. One goal of the workshop is to form bridges between these two different perspectives. Notes from the lectures and further information will be available on the  website https://kylerec.wordpress.com/"

Smooth topology uses the tools of calculus to understand and classify these spaces; intriguingly, different dimensions behave very differently when looked at through the lens of calculus. Most surprisingly, foundational problems have been solved in dimensions less than and greater than four, but stubbornly resist attack in the space-time in which we actually live. This project brings together a group of researchers, with a diverse set of skills and experience, to help tackle these fundamental problems in smooth four-dimensional topology, by utilizing a key new idea about how to decompose (trisect) four-dimensional spaces into elementary building blocks. In particular, the study of trisections allows exporting many successful ideas from three-dimensional topology to four-dimensional topology. Along with the study of four-dimensional spaces in their own right, the investigators will also study the ways in which lower-dimensional spaces can be embedded in dimension four, in analogy with the study of knots as embeddings of circles in three-dimensional space.

The setup exactly parallels the three-dimensional theory of Heegaard splittings, setting the table for an interesting and valuable exchange of ideas between dimensions three and four.  Many extremely rich theories have been developed over the last few decades in low-dimensional topology, such as contact topology, Heegaard Floer homology, Heegaard splittings and bridge splittings, Khovanov homology, Dehn surgery, curve complexes, and thin position. These ideas now have the potential to interact with the theory of trisections. The focus of this project is the development of these connections into a comprehensive theory that solves important problems in four-dimensional topology."

The three-day conference will be held annually in April at Eastern Illinois University, with the 2017 event scheduled for the weekend of April 7 through 9. This discipline-specific conference is intended to draw participants at every stage of their mathematical careers, with particular focus on both early-career graduate students and undergraduates. A meeting of this type brings together researchers from the academically young to the well-established, yet offers a more narrow research focus than is typically found at undergraduate-inclusive conferences. This narrow focus serves to promote more meaningful contact in the context of mathematical research. The conference is intended to fuel young mathematicians' interest in research mathematics, promote inter- and intra-generational research ties, and demonstrate how undergraduates can be incorporated into research programs in these fields.<br/><br/>Three established speakers and three early-career speakers are invited by the organizing committee; these speakers are chosen both for their eminence in their respective fields and their ability to provide meaningful introductions to complex topics for audiences with a wide range of mathematical backgrounds. Invitations for submissions by graduate students and undergraduate students will be issued annually. Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by subject-specific committees composed of faculty at Eastern Illinois University. Up to 6 graduate students and 15 undergraduates will be invited to make presentations, either as talks or in poster sessions. In addition to the talks and poster sessions, the conference provides opportunities for less formal interaction, including social events on Friday and Saturday nights. Our increased focus on incorporating undergraduates into professional life will include panel discussions from funded graduate students and early-career mathematicians covering important but seldom-discussed aspects of attending graduate school and pursuing an academic career in mathematics.<br/><br/>More information is available at the conference website:<br/>https://ux1.eiu.edu/~gdt/"

Since the space we inhabit is three-dimensional, this field has wide-ranging applications, from understanding the possible shapes of the universe to describing the knotting of polymers and DNA molecules. Understanding the properties of three-dimensional spaces requires an array of sophisticated tools from a range of disciplines within mathematics, including algebraic topology, geometry, analysis, and representation theory. Each tool for studying three-dimensional spaces carries with it a notion of which spaces are ""simple"" and which are ""complicated."" The primary goal of this project is to explore the relationship between different tools used to describe three-dimensional spaces and the corresponding notions of simplicity. Ultimately the investigator hopes to consolidate and deepen our knowledge of these spaces and to build bridges between a variety of mathematical fields.<br/><br/>A key technical tool to be used in this investigation is bordered Heegaard Floer homology, a version of Heegaard Floer homology for 3-manifolds with boundary. In particular, the project centers on developing a new geometric interpretation of bordered Heegaard Floer invariants; this is a concrete realization of a deep connection between bordered Heegaard Floer homology and certain Fukaya categories. In the case of torus boundary, the invariants may be interpreted as decorated immersed curves in the boundary torus. This framework greatly simplifies computations and leads to proofs of interesting gluing results. This will be applied to the classification of L-spaces (3-manifolds that are ""simple"" with respect to Heegaard Floer homology). As one application, the investigator seeks to confirm a conjecture equating three measures of simplicity for 3-manifolds: being an L-space, having non-left-orderable fundamental group, and not admitting a co-orientable taut foliation. Other goals of the project include restricting the possible decompositions of L-space knots and relating Heegaard Floer homology to the complexity of the Jaco-Shalen-Johannson decomposition."

The PI's particular area of expertise is in Heegaard Floer homology, a collection of invariants for 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, which has been one of the most fruitful areas of research in low-dimensional topology since the early 2000s. These tools bring together several different fields of mathematics, including representation theory, differential geometry, and analysis, and the PI hopes to elucidate the connections between these different areas and expand the discourse among researchers in these fields.<br/><br/>The specific goals of the project are (1) to make progress on a variety of concrete problems in 4-manifold topology, including knot concordance, exotic smooth structures, and embeddings of non-orientable surfaces; (2) to understand the relationship between the Heegaard Floer homology of a 3-manifold and topological properties such as the existence of incompressible surfaces, taut foliations, and left-orderings on the fundamental group; (3) to establish relationships between the knot invariants arising from gauge theory and symplectic geometry and those coming from representation theory and quantum algebra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the past few decades, it has become an exciting and fundamental area of mathematical research, due in part to close connections with many other parts of mathematics as well as physics. Symplectic geometry has had especially striking recent applications to low-dimensional topology, the mathematical study of three- and four-dimensional spaces. The Principal Investigator will pursue one particularly promising technique along these lines, in the setting of the theory of knots, or loops of string that are tied together at their ends. This technique has proven to be of interest to the physics community, providing tantalizing clues of an as-yet-undiscovered framework that combines portions of mathematics (in particular, symplectic geometry) and theoretical physics (in particular, string theory, which provides a model for the fundamental forces that shape the universe). The present project will work to uncover this framework, facilitating the exchange of ideas between mathematics and physics. As part of this project, the Principal Investigator will also promote the training of future mathematicians, running research programs and mathematical competitions for both undergraduate students and local high school students.<br/><br/>The unifying approach to symplectic geometry in this project is provided by holomorphic curves. Since pioneering work by Gromov in the 1980s, holomorphic curves have become a central tool in symplectic geometry, combining powerful analytical and geometric techniques with a computable combinatorial flavor. The research supported by this award applies holomorphic curves to the setting of knots. Previous work by the Principal Investigator and collaborators led to the development of knot contact homology, a powerful knot invariant in the spirit of Symplectic Field Theory, which has evolved into a subject that has many unexpected and intriguing connections to various areas of mathematics and physics. Recent results have opened the door to a detailed exploration of these connections, which will be carried out in this project. Within symplectic geometry, knot contact homology motivates a close study of a new type of Floer theory (partially wrapped Floer homology); in knot theory, it is conjecturally related to topological concepts like Seifert genus and concordance; in topological string theory, it is conjectured to be determined by a certain Calabi-Yau manifold that has been the object of much study in recent years. Besides tackling these conjectures, the Principal Investigator will pursue a related project, following on a recently discovered connection between constructible sheaves (from algebraic geometry) on one side, and holomorphic curves on the other. This project will develop this connection, in particular working to define an analogue of the Fukaya category for contact manifolds and applying this to facilitate computations in Fukaya categories and mirror symmetry."

Formally, a group is simply a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies two axioms formalizing the concept of undoing the operation. Mathematicians are concerned both with the overarching abstract algebraic structures that arise from these rules, and with concrete examples that have natural significance, such as the set of rigid motions of the plane, the configurations of a Rubik's cube, or the symmetries of a polyhedron. Here free groups, which have a particularly simple algebraic structure in which there is the minimal possible cancellation, play an essential role as building blocks from which many other groups are built. Free group extensions are a basic example of this sort of construction. Yet, despite being built from well-understood pieces, free group extensions remain rather mysterious. This project will investigate dynamical, algebraic, and geometric aspects of free group extensions and combine these perspectives to illuminate the broad structure of these groups. This expands on the investigator's prior work with collaborators exploring and relating the different ways a given group may be built as a free-by-cyclic group, as well as work on the coarse negative curvature of certain free group extensions.<br/><br/>This project will focus on aspects of geometry, topology, algebra, and dynamics in the context of free group automorphisms and surface homeomorphisms. The investigator will continue his work with collaborators analyzing splittings of free-by-cyclic groups via the dynamics of certain semi-flows on 2-complexes. A main goal is to tie together all the monodromies of the different splittings via a uniformized action of the entire group on a tree and to use this to define canonical algebraic invariants and relate all the Cannon-Thurston maps to each other. In addition to strengthening these connections, the project will work to prove that the property of having a fully irreducible monodromy is shared by either all or none of the splittings of the group. Continuing his work with a collaborator, the investigator will study the geometry of general free group extensions and work to characterize Gromov hyperbolicity and establish rigidity results for this class of groups. With regard to the study of surface homeomorphisms, the investigator will work with collaborators to show that all small-dilatation pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms have the simple structure predicted by the symmetry conjecture. Finally, the investigator will study large-scale geometric and dynamical properties of the Teichmuller space of a surface with an aim towards calculating expected thinness of triangles and lattice point asymptotics for natural sets of surface homeomorphisms."

Topology and geometry are central areas of mathematics that have been the focus of active research for centuries. Topology concerns the mathematical properties of spaces ranging from the physical, like the surface of a doughnut, to the abstract, like the space of configurations of robots in a factory or the space of functions that satisfy a differential equation. Geometry concerns abstract or concrete notions distance or length, such as the amount of energy to move between two configurations of robots. Topology and geometry enjoy particularly rich interactions in low dimensions, and these connections have been a source of profound discoveries in both fields. The main objective of the conference is to bring together leading experts who have made substantial contributions in low-dimensional topology and geometry and to provide a platform to present recent results and propose future directions of research. The conference is organized in conjunction with the 32nd Shanks Lecture, which will be delivered by Professor Ian Agol (University of California, Berkeley). This award provides opportunities for mathematicians from underrepresented groups and researchers that are early in their career or lack other sources of travel support to attend and participate in the conference.<br/><br/>The conference will focus on important developments in low-dimensional topology and geometry, with emphasis on the powerful negative curvature and combinatorial techniques that have driven many recent advances. Topics will include, but are not limited to, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, mapping class groups, the geometry and topology of curves on surfaces, surface bundles, Gromov-hyperbolic simplicial complexes, and CAT(0) cube complexes. The activities will include nineteen keynote talks and the Shanks lecture, with ample time for questions and discussion. The combination of topics and speakers will attract numerous participants and will afford students and recent PhDs an excellent opportunity to interact with and learn from leaders in these fields.

The workshop will foster collaboration and exchange of ideas among researchers throughout the field of algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics that stands at the intersection of several fundamental areas of research. This workshop's invited speakers reflect the diversity of current work in the area and include researchers at a variety of career stages in order to best capture a cross-section of the field today.  The workshop will help establish ties between the growing community of topologists in the south, including Kentucky, Georgia and at Vanderbilt, with the long-standing community of researchers in the Midwest.  These types of research connections are the building blocks for progress in mathematical research. Participants with established or emerging research programs will have a forum to publicize their work and more junior participants will have the opportunity to integrate into the wider topology community. The schedule of the conference is designed with breaks to encourage collaborations and informal mathematical interactions among the participants.  Such opportunities are especially important for mathematicians early in their career.  Incorporating young mathematicians and members of underrepresented groups into the scientific discourse is key to building a truly representative community of mathematicians. <br/><br/>The conference speakers represent a range of research in the field, from computations via chromatic homotopy theory to foundational development to algebraic and topological K-theory.  Bringing together mathematicians from these areas will facilitate collaborations between Midwestern and Southern algebraic topologists working across the spectrum of homotopy theory today.  Additionally, the speakers' research includes several areas of homotopy theory that have fruitful connections to other areas of pure mathematics, such as geometric group theory and dynamics. This workshop will serve to publicize these connections to researchers in Tennessee and surrounding states, where there has historically been little homotopy theory.  Thus, a conference at Vanderbilt showcasing the range of present homotopical research will allow the establishment of mathematical ties both within the discipline and to other fields.

Set theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines, with common historical roots, and they serve as essential tools in many areas of mathematics. Set theoretic applications to topology have invigorated both fields since the proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis fifty years ago, and the synergy between them continues to invigorate the field of set-theoretic topology. Techniques developed to solve central questions in the field were instrumental in the development of the method of forcing, combinatorial set theory, and Ramsey theory. Set-theoretical techniques are also fundamental in recent work on the structure of non-separable Banach spaces and the study of rings of continuous functions and topological vector spaces. Quite naturally, set-theoretic topology also is close to logic and has much in common with finite combinatorics and theoretical computer science in its study of partial orders, Boolean algebra, and continuous lattices.<br/><br/>This conference will feature both three plenary talks and eighteen contributed research talks, as well as a session on open problems.

In this project the principal investigators aim to create new algebraic and geometric tools helping to formulate ideas and methods of quantum physics in a precise mathematical way.  Specifically, the team will combine its members' past experience and achievements to construct new Topological Quantum Field Theories for manifolds with additional structures. Inspired by Witten's Chern-Simons theory and invariants of 3-manifolds that are known now as Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants, the principal investigators will explore their new Field Theories with the objective to find physical definitions for the resulting topological invariants of manifolds.  This work is stimulated by several fundamental examples and will open the door to new research avenues in algebra, topology, geometry, mathematical physics, and related areas of mathematics. The broader impacts of the project belong to two main categories: mentoring and outreach.  The members of the research team are currently mentoring a total of twelve PhD students.  They will advise graduate students on projects related to the main objectives of the grant.  The outreach component is to organize several workshops and conferences aimed at developing communication and collaborative research between participants of the project, establishing scientific connections with other mathematicians, as well as fostering broader applications of this work.<br/><br/>In 1999, Turaev introduced Homotopy Quantum Field Theories (HQFTs), which are generalizations of Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) studied by Schwartz, Witten, and Atiyah.  HQFTs produce topological invariants of manifolds furnished with extra data that add supplementary topology/geometry to the context of TQFTs.  Most of the theory of quantum invariants and HQFTs involves monoidal categories which have certain additional properties like being semi-simple.  In various collaborations started in 2005,   the team members developed a theory of re-normalized Quantum Invariants that derives non-trivial topological invariants from non-semi-simple categories.  In this project the principal investigators will further use renormalization to develop non-trivial HQFTs, based on the examples coming from the theory of unrestricted quantum group.  These new HQFTs should share the strength and the new features of the re-normalized Quantum Invariants.  The principal investigators will further search for a physical interpretation of these new invariants."

Homology theory has applications in as disparate areas of mathematics as algebraic topology, number theory, mathematical physics, data science, and even economics where it is used to show the existence of Nash equilibria. Homology is useful only to the extent to which one can calculate it. Oftentimes the spaces that one is interested in come in natural infinite families. An interesting phenomenon that simplifies homology calculations for many of these families is homological stability.  Examples of spaces exhibiting homological stability are ubiquitous in group theory, low dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory. This research project aims to broaden and deepen understanding of homological stability.<br/><br/>This project involves the study of homological stability as well as some generalizations, representation stability, coefficient dependent homological stability, and secondary stability. Representation stability concerns the controlled growth of the homology groups of spaces with group actions. Coefficient dependent homological stability involves studying sequences of spaces where the integral homology does not stabilize but some patterns exist if one works with mod p or p-local coefficients. Secondary stability entails exploring stability patterns in the unstable homology groups of spaces exhibiting various forms of stability. The first two generalizations broaden the class of spaces that fall under the scope of homological stability. In contrast, secondary stability significantly increases the amount of information that one can extract from a sequence of spaces using stability techniques.

The principal investigator will study various naturally-occurring topological objects from the perspective of algebraic geometry. A fundamental goal of the project is to place mathematical concepts in reach of computational methods. The investigator plans to use recent theoretical advances in algebraic geometry and topology in order to develop calculational tools to explore a relationship between quantum field theory and the elusive notion of elliptic object. <br/><br/>Generalized cohomology theories are arguably the most useful and important tool in modern algebraic topology. In addition to ordinary cohomology, examples such as K-theory, elliptic cohomology, and complex cobordism admit surprisingly close connections to algebraic geometry via the theory of formal groups. While the formal groups associated to ordinary cohomology and K-theory are additive and multiplicative, respectively, elliptic curves carry much more complicated group structures (in fact, their relative intractability has been exploited in real world applications such as public key cryptography). The advantage of formal groups that arise from global geometric objects, such as the multiplicative group or elliptic curves, is that their corresponding cohomology theories are very highly structured. For instance, K-theory is structurally similar to ordinary representation theory, whereas the analogous ""elliptic representation theory,"" while related to diverse fields such as arithmetic geometry and mathematical physics, remains a mystery. Important work over the past few decades has led to a construction of a universal elliptic cohomology theory, a topological refinement of the classical theory of modular forms. Exploiting its structure allows one to associate to a topological stack an algebro-geometric object over the moduli stack of elliptic curves. While the derived ring of functions on this object is technically the elliptic cohomology of the original topological object, elliptic curves are not affine objects, meaning that this passage from geometry to algebra loses significant information. The more fundamental structure is that which exists on the algebro-geometric level itself, before affinization, and one retains considerably more conceptual and calculational control by manipulating these objects directly. An interesting twist is that, while there is no a priori understanding of elliptic cohomology classes (in stark contrast to K-theory, where cocycles correspond to formal differences of vector bundles), it may be possible to gain insight into this fundamentally important problem by interpreting calculations in several key examples."

In the early 2000s, Ozsvath and Szabo developed a package of powerful invariants for knots and 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, generally known as Heegaard-Floer homology. Heegaard-Floer homology has since taken a major place in low-dimensional topology, and has helped obtain a lot of new results and settle numerous old conjectures. The PI and her collaborator have developed a new algebraic technique for studying the variant for knots (knot Floer homology), by cutting a knot into pieces called tangles, and studying the individual pieces and their gluing. This NSF funded project seeks to develop further this new tool called tangle Floer homology, and use it to study knot theory problems and to better understand the relation between various knot invariants. The PI will aim to involve undergraduate and graduate students in aspects of the project that have combinatorial and computational nature, and will continue to promote mathematics to a broader audience.  <br/> <br/>Specific components of the project are to: 1) fully develop the ''minus"" version of tangle Floer homology and introduce new concordance invariants, as well as extend tangle Floer homology to integer coefficients; 2) understand and develop the connections between knot Floer homology and quantum algebra, in order to relate existing knot invariants as well as obtain new ones; 3) use tangle Floer homology to carry out computations in knot Floer homology and to study problems on knot and link concordance, mutation, string links, and periodic knots."

The mathematical system that describes the motion of a pendulum is a dynamical system. Another example is fluid dynamics, which for instance, is used to study the flow of air over an airplane wing. Often, the structure of a phase space has implications for the dynamical systems that it supports. For example, any flow on the sphere has a stationary point, which means that the corresponding dynamical system has a state that never changes. This project is concerned with the obverse of this idea: What does a flow on a space say about the space itself? The spaces we consider are 3-dimensional, like the space surrounding us; the flows are used as a tool to ""flatten"" the space into simpler 1- and 2-dimensional spaces, where the geometric structure of the original space is reflected in the symmetries of these flattened spaces. In addition to its implications within mathematics, this project has applications to applied dynamics, where the flattened spaces can be used to understand the stability of fluid flows.<br/> <br/>Quasigeodesic and pseudo-Anosov flows are product covered, which means that the orbit space in the universal cover is a topological plane. This plane has a natural circle at infinity, with an action of the fundamental group, which reflects the large-scale dynamics of the flow and the geometry of the manifold. This project uses techniques from dynamics, 3-manifolds, geometric group theory, and classical analysis situs to understand the relationship between a flow, its underlying manifold, and the circle at infinity. In particular, it aims to prove Calegari's conjecture that every quasigeodesic flow may be deformed into a pseudo-Anosov flow, characterize the circle actions that come from such flows, and use flows to understand cubulations and essential surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds."

In particular, one of the most fundamental and notoriously difficult questions in algebraic geometry is whether solutions exist at all. Motivic homotopy theory is a relatively new approach to such questions, and it has already helped solve many open problems in the past twenty years. It borrows many ideas and techniques from a different field of mathematics, topology, and successfully applies them to algebraic geometry in unexpected ways. Following this trend, this project aims to bring several fruitful ideas from topology to the world of algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This project consists of two parts. In the first part, the PI will develop equivariant motivic homotopy theory from the point of view of parametrized homotopy theory. In the second part, the PI will study highly structured commutative algebras in motivic homotopy theory and hopes to address the problem of recognizing motivic loop spaces. More specifically, the PI will lay solid foundations for equivariant motivic homotopy theory by constructing Grothendieck's six-functor formalism for fiberwise homotopy theory over algebraic stacks. The mere existence of this formalism has interesting consequences for classical invariants of stacks, like algebraic K-theory; it can also be used to construct new well-behaved cohomological invariants of algebraic stacks, and to better understand the relations between them. In the second part of this project, the PI will introduce a motivic refinement of the notion of E_infinity ring and show that many classical cohomological invariants of algebraic varieties possess this refined multiplicative structure. The PI will also introduce the related notion of motivic E_infinity space and investigate their role in a potential recognition principle for infinite motivic loop spaces. To achieve these goals, the PI will use existing as well as new methods from equivariant algebraic geometry, ordinary motivic homotopy theory, classical algebraic topology, and higher category theory."

In another direction, the mathematical subject of algebraic geometry studies spaces described by polynomial equations and has applications in a wide range of fields, including statistics, control theory, and computer science.

Similarly, for a complex surface singularity its link is a three-manifold. The investigator will the study the interactions between the algebraic properties of these curves and surfaces, and the Heegaard-Floer homology of their links. The second framework is less direct. The investigator and collaborators have conjectured that the Khovanov-Rozansky homology of links can be computed by studying the algebraic and geometric properties of the Hilbert scheme of points (the configuration space of points in four-dimensional space).

This particular project concerns the ways that different shapes can be related to one another, and applies some of the ideas and intuition of calculus to the study of these connections. Calculus (as taught to undergraduates across the country) is fundamentally about approximation. In this project the PI will study how complicated shapes can be approximated in a useful way by those that are simpler and easier to work with. A systematic understanding of these approximations will help us describe the structure of some of the new shapes that are appearing in modern applications of topology.<br/><br/>More technically, the focus of this project is the calculus of homotopy functors developed by Goodwillie. The underlying idea is to approximate an object of interest (say the value of some functor) using other simpler functors that satisfy a polynomial condition. A major component of this project is to understand, in various different situations, how the analogue of the Taylor series (a ""Taylor tower"" in topology) can be assembled from its components. From this general theory this project aims at several avenues of application. One is to the calculation of the Taylor towers corresponding to various versions of algebraic K-theory, viewed as functors from ring spectra to spectra. Another is to chromatic homotopy theory, specifically to study of the Bousfield-Kuhn functor, and to algebraic K-theory in a K(n)-local setting.  This project will also support the PI's efforts to promote mathematics and math education at Amherst College.

Medieval artisans decorated the walls of the Alhambra palace with beautiful depictions of planar symmetries also known, in modern language, as 2-dimensional crystallographic groups. There is great power in abstraction, and the study of symmetry leaped forward in the mid 19th century when mathematicians formulated the abstract concept of a group. These advances enabled a flowering of applications to science, such as the use of 3-dimensional crystallographic groups to explore the atomic structure of crystalline arrays. Modern geometric group theory is a vast abstraction of the study of crystallographic groups. The research accomplished under this award will advance our understanding of geometric group theory by focusing on a class of groups at the current frontier of knowledge, namely the automorphism and outer automorphism groups of free groups. These groups encode symmetries and other relations amongst networks which mathematicians call graphs. Work under this award will involve construction of new models of relations and symmetries amongst graphs, leading to the discovery and proof of new theorems in geometric group theory. Some of this work will be carried out by graduate students under the advisement of the principal investigator, and mathematical monographs aimed at beginning graduate students will be produced to aid in their training and for use by the broader mathematical community.<br/><br/>Research activity under this award (expected to be joint work with Michael Handel of CUNY) will focus on studying the large scale geometry of the groups Aut(F) and Out(F), the automorphism and outer automorphism groups of a free group F of finite rank. In large scale geometry one studies a group by its actions on various geometries, focusing not on small scale features of those geometries, but instead on differences and commonalities of large scale features. Under this award Aut(F) and Out(F) will be studied by developing hierarchy theories for these groups, in analogy to hierarchy theories used so successfully to study the large scale geometry of mapping class groups of surfaces. Constructing a hierarchy theory requires, at a minimum, actions of the group and various of its subgroups on hyperbolic geodesic metric spaces. Some things are known already about a hierarchy for Out(F), including actions representing the top of a hierarchy. But there remain many large gaps in our knowledge of this topic. To plug gaps in the middle of an Out(F) hierarchy, one strategy to be pursued under this award will be constructing actions representing the top of Aut(A) hierarchies for free factors A of F. Another strategy will be constructing actions that encode Dehn twist behavior, needed to plug gaps at the bottom of an Out(F) hierarchy. Medium term applications are expected to reveal geometric properties of word and conjugacy problems for Out(F). Longer term applications may include shedding light on deep conjectures about finite asymptotic dimension and quasi-isometric rigidity of Out(F). Graduate work done under this award is expected to extend hierarchy methods beyond outer automorphism groups of free groups to include broader categories of outer automorphism groups."

The mapping class group encodes the symmetries of two-dimensional surfaces like the surface of a donut or the earth.  Arithmetic groups encode symmetries of special kinds of structures that arise when studying natural numbers (i.e. 1, 2, 3,...). For mysterious reasons, these groups share many fundamental properties. The investigator will study these shared properties with a focus on the ""cohomology"" of the groups, which in some sense is a measure of higher-dimensional ""holes"" that exist in them.  The investigator will also run a mathematical summer program for disadvantaged high-school students from the Houston public schools."

For example, to understand a high dimensional geometric object, one can study the various ways that object fibers (i.e., can be build out of simpler, lower dimensional pieces which are arranged in a predictable way). Even if a complete understanding of the object may be out of reach, one can attempt to comprehend its properties ""on average."" In this project, the PI seeks to apply similar principles to the study of geometrically significant groups via their action on naturally associated spaces. This pursuit brings to bear methods from geometry, topology, dynamics, and group theory, and seeks to not only understand these objects in an abstract sense, but to produce tractable models which allow for quantitative understanding.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will carry out projects that investigate the geometry and topology of hyperbolic bundles as well as  study geometrically motivated counting problems in finitely generated groups. In the classical setting of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle, this project builds on a program to study the extent to which the veering triangulation (a certain combinatorial construction) effectively encodes the manifold's geometry and topology. Inspired by the elegant nature of these triangulations, the PI will construct a canonical ideal simplicial complex in the setting of free-by-cyclic groups; a setting where a single topological object controlling the group's algebraic decompositions is currently lacking. Finally, the PI will study the ""typical"" geometry of fibered manifolds, free-by-cyclic groups, and representations of hyperbolic groups. A common thread throughout these investigations will be to demonstrate the extent to which negative curvature features are persistent and, in the appropriate sense, generic."

For example, topology can be used to measure how biological processes change the shape of our DNA.   Surprisingly, these shape changes can be analyzed through three- and four-dimensional manifolds, fundamental shapes in topology that appear throughout mathematics and physics.  This leads to the fundamental problem of trying to completely understand and classify these three- and four-dimensional manifolds.  While we understand many aspects of three-dimensional objects, in dimension four we are still mostly in the dark.  One effective tool for studying these objects is called Floer homology, which comes from solving powerful equations from physics.  In this project, the PI will use Floer homology to study the complexity of these shapes by analyzing the configurations of knotted loops and surfaces inside of them.  The potential outcome of this project will be to strengthen connections between knots and three-/four-dimensional manifolds while discovering new structure in the topology of four-dimensional manifolds.  This project will then be disseminated to the public through a collaboration with Black Box Dance Theater, a North Carolina non-profit dance company.  By way of dance performances and public workshops, this will present to the public the fundamental notions of topology used in the proposed project.  This joint project will also work to improve public perception of mathematics and enhance connections between STEM and the arts.<br/><br/>Knots can be used to produce new three- and four-manifolds by an operation called Dehn surgery, where one removes a tubular neighborhood and reglues via a homeomorphism.  Many invariants and tools in low-dimensional topology, especially Floer homology, are particularly well-behaved under Dehn surgery, and the PI will use these tools to improve our understanding of three- and four-manifolds and further their connections with knot theory.  Three major goals of this project are to: 1) construct homology three-spheres which cannot be obtained by Dehn surgery on a two-component link, 2) find new constraints on the algebraic topology of four-manifolds admitting symplectic structures, and 3) further explore the algebraic structure of the concordance group of knots in homology spheres modulo concordance in homology cobordisms.  Two potential outcomes would be a better understanding of the complexity of four-manifolds with boundary measured in terms of their handlebody structures and a stronger connection between properties of a knot and the topology of its Dehn surgeries."

In particular, the symmetries of a given problem are often described by families of matrices, which are called Lie groups. More recently, the needs of quantum physics and statistical mechanics have led to the development of deformations of Lie groups, which are called quantum groups. In the last two decades of the Twentieth Century great breakthroughs in topology were obtained through the introduction of techniques from  non-euclidean  (hyperbolic) geometry, which is based on the Lie group of 2-by-2 matrices with determinant 1. At about the same time, the development of quantum groups provided new tools to analyze the knotting of curves in 3-dimensional space, with the quantum group arising from deformations of 2-by-2 matrices playing a particularly important role. The projects investigates various problems where these groups interact with the geometry of spaces of dimension 2 and 3. In particular, it takes advantage of the insights developed for 2-by-2 matrices to address higher dimensional groups, involving n-by-n matrices. <br/> <br/>Many classical problems in mathematics and in mathematical physics can be expressed in terms of homomorphisms from fundamental groups of surfaces to Lie groups, such as groups of matrices. For instance, the great breakthroughs of hyperbolic geometry that occurred in the decades surrounding the year 2000 have involved the analysis of such homomorphisms valued  in the special linear group SL_2. Similarly, the quantum invariants of knots and low-dimensional manifolds that were developed at about the same time are based on the deformations of Lie groups called quantum groups. In particular, the Jones polynomial invariant of knots can be expressed in terms of the quantum group U_q(sl_2) deforming the Lie group SL_2. The thrust of the research is to build on the insights developed for these low-dimensional Lie groups in order to address higher rank Lie groups and quantum groups. The project is focused on the character varieties that consist of homomorphisms from surface groups to Lie groups. Its two main themes build on the interaction between two different areas of mathematics.  The first topic deals with the geometric and dynamic properties of the so-called Hitchin homomorphisms, valued in a split real algebraic group such as the special linear group, and on the moduli spaces of such homomorphisms. The PI and his students will study the Poisson geometry of the space of Hitchin homomorphisms, will investigate Hitchin homomorphisms from the point of view of spectral networks, and will study the group actions on affine buildings that arise as degenerations of such homomorphisms.  The second theme studies the skein algebras that occur in the theory of quantum invariants of knots based on the quantum group U_q(sl_n), and their algebraic properties when the quantum parameter is a root of unity.  The PI will investigate the extension to this general case of the ""miraculous cancellations"" that he discovered in earlier work  for U_q(sl_2). The project includes a series of separate problems that can accommodate the doctoral work of graduate students, while enhancing the postdoctoral experience of the junior faculty in the research group of the PI. The visual aspects of the project lend themselves to the involvement of undergraduate students, as well as to outreach aimed at making mathematics exciting for K-12 and undergraduate students."

Smooth topology uses the tools of calculus to understand and classify these spaces; intriguingly, different dimensions behave very differently when looked at through the lens of calculus. Most surprisingly, foundational problems have been solved in dimensions less than and greater than four, but stubbornly resist attack in the space-time in which we actually live. This project brings together a group of researchers, with a diverse set of skills and experience, to help tackle these fundamental problems in smooth four-dimensional topology, by utilizing a key new idea about how to decompose (trisect) four-dimensional spaces into elementary building blocks. In particular, the study of trisections allows exporting many successful ideas from three-dimensional topology to four-dimensional topology. Along with the study of four-dimensional spaces in their own right, the investigators will also study the ways in which lower-dimensional spaces can be embedded in dimension four, in analogy with the study of knots as embeddings of circles in three-dimensional space. Using these tools and analogies, this focused research group aims to develop new ways to distinguish four-dimensional objects, new four-dimensional constructions, and new applications of four-dimensional results to topology and geometry in other settings and dimensions.<br/><br/>The smooth topology of four-dimensional manifolds remains one of the greatest mysteries in topology, as evidenced by open questions such as the Poincare and Schoenflies conjectures, which have been solved in all dimensions other than four.  This focused research group aims to breathe new life into this important field of study by exploiting a striking new perspective on four-manifolds: Every four-manifold decomposes into three simple pieces, and this trisection is unique up to a natural stabilization. The setup exactly parallels the three-dimensional theory of Heegaard splittings, setting the table for an interesting and valuable exchange of ideas between dimensions three and four.  Many extremely rich theories have been developed over the last few decades in low-dimensional topology, such as contact topology, Heegaard Floer homology, Heegaard splittings and bridge splittings, Khovanov homology, Dehn surgery, curve complexes, and thin position. These ideas now have the potential to interact with the theory of trisections. The focus of this project is the development of these connections into a comprehensive theory that solves important problems in four-dimensional topology."

Geometric group theory is an active mathematical field that concerns the interplay between groups (algebraic structures capturing symmetries) and geometry and topology (the quantitative and qualitative studies of spaces).  Most of the conference participants will be graduate students and early-career mathematicians.  The conference will allow them to learn about new developments in the field, to communicate their research results, and to spark new research collaborations.  Geometric group theory enjoys a growing diversity, which this conference aims to promote further through the selection of the speakers and other participants.  <br/><br/>Funds will cover travel and local housing expenses of 15 US-based conference participants, including some speakers.   The conference is the sixth iteration of the ""Young Geometric Group Theory"" meetings, which have been held every year since 2012. It will have three main types of events: mini-courses given by five established experts in the field, informal discussion sessions, and research talks given by junior researchers in geometric group theory.  The mini-courses will allow graduate students and postdocs to learn cutting-edge methods in geometric group theory both from their peers and from experts. The talks publicize the work of junior researchers and provide feedback.  The selection of mini-courses and speakers will reflect various current key directions of research in geometric group theory, including group homology and stability, non C^*-exact groups, and geometric structures, compactifications of representation varieties and non-archimedean geometry.

This field has brought about unprecedented interaction between mathematics and theoretical physics. It has been extremely successful and well studied in 3-dimensions. However, since we live in 4-dimensions (including time), a full theory of quantum gravity requires an extension of these tools to 4-dimensions. An emerging mathematical philosophy known as ""categorification"" provides an avenue to uncover a hidden layer in mathematical structures, revealing a richer and more robust theory capable of describing more complex phenomenon.  This project will use the perspective of categorification to enhance one of the most successful theories in 3-dimensions to a full 4-dimensional theory.<br/><br/>This collaboration will harness the interplay between low-dimensional geometry, representation theory, and higher-dimensional gauge theory. Through this coordinated effort the PIs will make substantial progress on the problem of categorifying 3-manifold invariants. The PIs will capitalize on recent breakthroughs in theoretical physics and higher representation theory that have created new possibilities for significant progress on this problem.  Among the techniques to be employed include:  fivebrane compactifications to provide a universal description of various old and new homological invariants of 3-manifolds, the use of infinity categories for defining tensor products of higher representations of quantum groups, and the theory of Hopfological algebra for categorifications at roots of unity, as well as recent work on odd link homology theory and categorifications of Habiro's universal invariant."
