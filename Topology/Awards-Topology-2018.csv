In the context of the Mathematics Department, and more precisely, this Research Training Group project, the Principal Investigators (who have a broad expertise in Geometry and its connections with Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Topology, and Algebraic Number Theory) together with other faculty members, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students intend to focus on building communities which will impact, at all stages of the academic pipeline, the number and readiness of people entering the U.S. mathematical workforce (both academic and industrial), and bolstering in particular the representation of women and underrepresented minorities in the mathematical sciences. Moreover, structures put in place will see a vertical community of women mathematicians, a vertical community of mathematicians from low-income households and underrepresented minority groups, a community of young scholars who will pursue research careers in industry,  and a horizontal community of strong junior and senior math majors.<br/><br/>The RTG Senior Faculty will use their research expertise and previous experience to mentor research of junior mathematicians centered on Geometry. Reflecting the strongly collaborative relationship of the team, contributions will come from perspectives not only within but also across the disciplines of Analysis and PDE, Geometric Analysis, Geometric Topology, Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Number Theory. To that end, vertical integration of postdocs and students will allow collaborative research projects, and this will be aided by developing an expository writing seminar in the mathematical sciences for freshmen as an alternative entry point into mathematical thinking, as well as organize conferences of RTG programs to share ideas, the highlights of which will be stored in a public written record. The log-cabin conferences and undergraduate conferences will give participants the opportunity to disseminate their research and grow collaborative networks. There will be opportunities for summer internships in local industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic K-theory is an invariant which can be applied to study basic objects from several fields of mathematics. In particular, algebraic K-theory can be used to study properties of fundamental objects in algebra, called rings. Although higher algebraic K-theory was defined more than 40 years ago, computational progress has been slow. Even for many basic rings the K-theory groups still aren't known today. Despite the difficulties, interest in K-theory computations remains strong. Algebraic K-groups have significant applications to algebraic geometry, number theory, topology, and other mathematical areas. Many of these applications are quite surprising, and the role of algebraic K-theory across mathematical fields drives a great interest in the subject. In recent years, advances in the field of algebraic topology have made it possible to study questions in algebraic K-theory which were previously thought to be inaccessible. A goal of this project is to use tools from algebraic topology to not only produce new algebraic K-theory computations, but also to develop the framework and theory to facilitate future study of algebraic K-theory and related invariants. In addition to the mathematics research goals, the project also includes work in undergraduate and graduate education, undergraduate research, conference organization, and efforts to increase the participation of women and underrepresented groups in mathematics.  <br/><br/><br/>This project uses the tools of equivariant stable homotopy to study algebraic K-theory and related invariants. Algebraic K-theory is an invariant of a ring which is generally very difficult to compute. However, there is a homotopy theoretic approach to K-theory computations that has been quite fruitful. Despite the fact that algebraic K-theory is not itself an equivariant object, the tools of equivariant stable homotopy theory have proven very useful for K-theory computations. This project explores the intricate relationship between equivariant homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, and related invariants such as topological Hochschild homology. The project will produce new K-theory computations as well as deepening our understanding of the invariants and tools used to make such computations. Further, this research will provide important foundations, structures, and examples for further work in equivariant stable homotopy theory. Specific research goals of the project are organized into three broader objectives: One, use recent results and new methods from equivariant stable homotopy theory to compute algebraic K-theory groups which were previously inaccessible. Two, develop the theory around related invariants such as topological Hochschild homology and topological coHochschild homology. Three, define and study equivariant algebraic structures that arise in K-theory computations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The field intertwines rigid geometric problems, such as studying periodic orbits or counting curves passing through a given point, with flexible cut-and-paste constructions. Part of the research conducted in this proposal is the development of a combinatorial description of these structures in terms of a diagrammatic calculus, and its applications to these rigid geometric problems. This provides an accessible source of new examples and computations, and establishes the ground for strictly higher-dimensional constructions. Due to its combinatorial nature, this line of research is naturally conducive to participation from undergraduate students and young researchers. Another part of this project uses techniques that combine known elements from algebraic geometry and geometric topology with new ideas from contact and symplectic topology, and the outcome of the proposed research contributes to each of these central fields of mathematical research. <br/><br/>The first part of this project is the development of a Legendrian calculus in the front projection, including higher-dimensional Reidemeister moves, Legendrian handle-slides and criteria for the existence of loose charts. By further establishing a relation with bi-Lefschetz fibrations, this tool will provide effective combinatorial criteria for (sub)flexibility of Weinstein structures and the computation of algebraic invariants such as the Legendrian contact differential graded algebra and the wrapped Fukaya category. This combines ideas from affine algebraic geometry and higher-dimensional contact surgery theory. The second part of this research project focuses on the detection of tightness and over-twistedness of higher-dimensional models, including bordered Legendrian open books and small neighborhoods of over-twisted models. The project will use pseudoholomorphic techniques adapted to each problem in combination with new ideas coming from the study of Legendrian submanifolds, including the study of Legendrian cobordisms and their relation to Weinstein cobordisms. In both these projects the study of compatible open books in special position have a role, and a general existence theorem will be studied with asymptotically holomorphic techniques. In addition, the project will include the study of a flexible class of Engel structures, completely determined by formal homotopy class, and related h-principles."

Resources on chromatic homotopy theory are sparse and these videos will also help increase the accessibility of the field. <br/><br/>Chromatic homotopy theory is a deep and difficult branch of homotopy theory which has undergone significant computational and conceptual advances in the recent past. These advances often involve ideas at the interplay of algebraic geometry, number theory, higher category theory, and even quantum field theory. The primary scientific aim of this conference is to survey some of these connections and their impact on the field today. The research of the invited speakers is on the forefront of new developments in the field. Most of them are early career mathematicians whose work is influencing the discipline in new and innovative ways. The workshop preceding the conference will consist of a mini-course covering some of the background necessary for younger participants to fully benefit from the conference.

In prior work, the PI and his collaborators discovered surprising patterns linking particles moving in space with how collections of numbers factor into primes. This National Science Foundation funded project aims to give a conceptual explanation for these links, which will hopefully shed light both on problems in topology and problems in algebra and number theory.<br/><br/>The PI will further study homological densities, first introduced in joint work of the PI with Benson Farb and Melanie Wood.  Homological densities provide a new topological invariant, suggested by a natural extension of Weil's ""number field/function field"" dictionary, and demonstrating previously unrecognized relationships between configuration spaces of manifolds and spaces of 0-cycles (generalizing configuration spaces).  The PI plans to carry out four key prongs of research: 1) construct topological objects (i.e. spaces or rational homotopy types) such that the limiting homological densities are intrinsic invariants of these objects; 2) provide a topological mechanism responsible for the coincidences observed by the PI, Farb and Wood, which would explain the efficacy of the heuristics from arithmetic; 3) use the knowledge gained from 1) and 2) to formulate a topological analogue of a zeta function, for which the densities above are special values; and 4) extend the above coincidences from spaces of 0-cycles to spaces of divisors. The PI proposes that factorization homology should provide a unified approach to the first three problems, and that the evidence gained from these should inform the approach to the fourth. The PI also plans to investigate spaces of divisors following the principle articulated by Ellenberg, Venkatesh, and Westerland in their proof of the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics for function fields. With Farb, the PI has shown that a strong form of their principle holds for configuration spaces. He proposes to extend this to spaces of divisors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a five-day research and professional development workshop for graduate students in the fields of geometric group theory, geometry, and topology, designed to expose them to a wide range of current research, and to help build their communication, networking, and problem-sharing skills. Approximately sixty students will participate, guided by ten mentors, who come from a wide range of career stages and research backgrounds within this field. The conference provides essential training for the next generation of scientists, giving the participants many tools that will help them to succeed as scientists at the highest levels in graduate school and beyond. The professional development and research sides of the workshop run in tandem, with mentors giving guidance in both areas. The workshop emphasizes important career skills for mathematicians that are typically not taught in graduate school, including networking and etiquette, the job and grant application process, effective communication and research skills, and a panel discussion on career paths. The guidance is intended to be particularly beneficial to students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Mathematical topics presented at TSW will cover a broad range within geometry and topology, including contact and symplectic topology, three-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry, group actions, and complex dynamics. The research talks will model good communication and will also introduce research areas and relevant problems to students who are embarking on a research career. For many of the students, the TSW is the first conference at which they are presenting their own results; the workshop is designed to facilitate this experience. For instance, the first professional development session is an introduction to conferences and how best to benefit from them. The goal is to build confidence and research potential among students. The skills addressed here can be especially beneficial to students from minority groups, as indicated from responses from participants in previous iterations of the program. The panel discussion on career paths involves mathematicians from organizations such as NSA, Amazon, Google, and private high schools. Effective communication is a major theme: two evening sessions are devoted to workshop presentations in small groups; the final presentations are videotaped and critiqued by those in attendance.

There are many ways to attempt to manage this problem but many of them are based on not remembering some of the differences between our examples.  One way to do this is to define a function, an invariant, that assigns some simpler information, say a number, to each of our examples.  This by itself doesn't help make progress since there maybe no special pattern to the function and it may distinguish between too many examples.  We can make this work much better by imposing conditions on these functions. One of the most important options is to ask that for a function that can determined by its values on smaller pieces. This perspective is very powerful and informs approaches to many topological invariants, but important invariants associated to fixed point theory have escaped its reach.  The goal of this project is to rectify this and use the tools that prioritize this additivity to further develop fixed point invariants.  The project also supports the PI's work with the socioeconomically diverse graduate student population at the University of Kentucky.  The PI has worked to build a community where students can identify difficulties, feel comfortable asking questions, and learn to effectively advocate for themselves. <br/><br/>The additivity of the Euler characteristic is one of the most important properties of this very important invariant. One way to capture this additivity is to observe that the Euler characteristic can be understood as the image of a class in algebraic K-theory. Classically, the generalizations of the Euler characteristic that relate to topological fixed point theory ignored the significance of additivity. The work in this project seeks to rectify this omission. Previous results suggest two to approaches to this goal. The first recognizes that the Reidemeister trace, a refinement of the Euler characteristic that gives a converse to the Lefschetz fixed point theorem, takes values in topological Hochschild homology. Topological Hochschild homology receives a map from topological restriction homology and it seems likely that the Reidemeister trace will lift through this map to a topologically meaningful class in topological restriction homology. An alternative approach is to start with the question of understanding K-theory of endomorphisms of modules over E-infinity ring spectra. From here the goal is to describe connections between the cyclotomic trace and trace in bicategories and symmetric monodial categories.  In all of this work it also important to ground the results in topological meaning - to verify that classes constructed in these various groups are invariants associated to interesting questions. For example, these constructions should start by giving interesting invariants for periodic points and possibly extend to invariants for dynamical systems. This perspective also fits within a longer term goal of use fixed point theory as a test case for new methods of producing additive invariants that arise from wrong-way-maps or transfers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Any group can be described as the symmetries of some object, where the group operation comes from combining symmetries.  In this and many other ways, groups are deeply related to geometric and topological spaces, and are spaces in their own right.  Geometric group theory grows out of this insight.  The research in this project centers on subgroups of mapping class groups, which are infinite groups arising from symmetries of topological surfaces.  Their subgroups include all right-angled Artin groups, which are themselves fundamental objects.  For example, notice that order never matters in addition, always matters in concatenation (a songbird is not a birdsong), and only sometimes matters in multiplication (no between ordinary numbers, yes between the matrices of linear algebra).  Right-angled Artin groups include and interpolate between the first two extremes.  Both mapping class groups and right-angled Artin groups are important in geometric group theory, and rich enough that their study has applications to larger families of groups, as well as to low-dimensional manifolds.  As fundamental mathematics, work in geometric group theory has potential for practical benefits to society.  The work of geometric group theorists, building road maps for groups, has had ramifications to cryptography, which is based on the difficulty of retracing one's steps.  In addition, right-angled Artin groups are relevant to any algorithmic task in which order matters between some steps and not between others, a well-documented example being robot motion planning. <br/><br/>This project is a geometrically-oriented investigation of three interrelated families of subgroups of mapping class groups: right-angled Artin groups, normal subgroups, and 'convex cocompact' or 'stable' subgroups. The goal of the project is to advance knowledge both specific to mapping class groups and relevant to geometric group theory overall. Among normal subgroups, the project aims to understand the spectrum from free, infinite-rank normal subgroups (whose group of automorphisms is large as possible), to normal subgroups with automorphism group consisting of the mapping class group itself (that is, as small as possible), with right-angled Artin groups appearing as normal subgroups between these two extremes.  Objects with automorphism group equal to the mapping class group can be considered geometric models for the mapping class group. This work aims to further elucidate what such geometric models may be. The project also aims to advance the study of convex cocompact subgroups of the mapping class group, and their generalizations to other kinds of groups, including right-angled Artin groups, and more generally, groups acting on CAT(0) spaces.  The approaches to be employed rely on group actions on various interesting spaces, including CAT(0) cube complexes, curve complexes of surfaces, projection complexes, and ""rotating family"" machinery within groups acting on hyperbolic spaces. The latter two are axiomatic constructions, so that results about mapping class subgroups acting on these complexes readily translate to more general settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The former is the language in which many physical theories are formulated, while the latter studies the shapes of three- and four-dimensional spaces. It is common to apply knowledge of geometry to predict the behavior of physical systems. For example, it is straightforward to predict the sound of a drum from its shape. The opposite approach is sometimes also feasible; in particular, the study of differential equations originating from gauge theories can lead to very deep insights about the topology of spaces. In recent ground-breaking work, Ciprian Manolescu disproved the almost hundred-year-old Triangulation conjecture, which roughly asserted that in higher dimensions, every space can be cut into very simple pieces. The main goal of this project is to use the PI's recently developed computational techniques to understand in greater detail several properties of the object studied by Manolescu, called the three-dimensional homology cobordism group.<br/><br/>This project has two main goals. First, to explore the properties of Pin(2)-monopole Floer homology, a package of invariants of three-manifolds defined in analogy to Manolescu's construction within the Morse-theoretic framework of Kronheimer and Mrowka. The Pin(2)-symmetry is reflected in an extremely rich A-infinity structure on these invariants, and we will focus on understanding the higher operations and their implications for natural topological operations such as connected sums.

Low-dimensional topology is the study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, which are the dimensions that are substantially least understood. One-and two-dimensional spaces are ""small"" enough that nothing interesting can happen; five-dimensional spaces are ""large"" enough that interesting things have room to become uninteresting. A major question in low-dimensional topology is the structure of the homology cobordism groups, groups of three-dimensional spaces with many algebraic features in common with the three-dimensional sphere. This group has deep connections to the substantial difference between the topological and smooth categories in four-dimensions, and to structural issues in higher dimensional topology. In the past thirty years, substantial progress on this and other central topological questions has been made using invariants from gauge theory (which deals with solutions of partial differential equations from physics) and Floer theory (which deals with rigid curves in spaces with a notion of area). This project will use tools from Floer theory to study the homology cobordism groups and other topological questions, and to undertake new theoretical work in Floer theory that will produce useful tools for low-dimensional topology. In parallel to the research component, the project includes plans to further the PI's mentoring and outreach efforts, with a focus on increasing the accessibility of mathematics at early stages and on building pedagogical and mentorship skills in young researchers.  These plans include an extending Michigan State University's existing undergraduate research program, running mathematics day camps for middle school students, and arranging for workshops for building academic communication skills. <br/><br/><br/>The tools of this project are equivariant versions of invariants from Floer theory. The first part of the project uses an equivariant version of the three-manifold invariant Heegaard Floer homology constructed by the Principal Investigator and C. Manolescu, which gives new invariants of homology cobordism. The Principal Investigator plans to construct a refinement of this theory, in analogy with work done in parallel gauge-theoretic invariants, and use it to address questions of torsion and indivisibility of elements in the homology cobordism group. The second part of the project focuses on Lagrangian Floer homology, the symplectic geometry construction underlying Heegaard Floer homology and many other topological invariants. Equivariant versions of Lagrangian Floer cohomology that incorporate the information of a Z/2Z-symmetry have been extensively and fruitfully developed in the past six years, including by the Principal Investigator. However, the literature lacks an analogous theory for Z/pZ-symmetries. With R. Lipshitz and S. Sarkar, the Principal Investigator plans to construct one, and to use it to study many situations in low-dimensional topology that possess natural symmetries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A surface is a two-dimensional space, in other words, a two-dimensional version of the world we live in.  Surfaces come in many shapes (for instance the surface of a ball is different from the surface of a doughnut) and they arise in many varied contexts, from physics to robotics to data analysis to quantum field theory.  The symmetries of a surface form a beautiful and rich theory that has been the focus of intense study over the past century.  The close connection between those symmetries and hyperbolic geometry facilitates the investigation of some questions that are not obviously geometric, such as algorithms for working with these groups.<br/><br/>The mapping class group of a surface is the group of homotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the surface.  Among other things, the mapping class group encodes the outer automorphism group of the surface fundamental group, the (orbifold) fundamental group of the moduli space of the surface, and the isomorphism types of surface bundles over arbitrary spaces.  The mapping class group also has connections to many, many areas of mathematics, including dynamics, group theory, number theory, quantum field theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry, just to name a few. Goals of this research program include these: (1) Establish a quadratic-time algorithm for the conjugacy problem in the mapping class group.  Work done under prior NSF support developed a quadratic-time algorithm for the Nielsen-Thurston type of a mapping class, and an extension of that theory is expected to give similar speed for the conjugacy problem. (2) Understand polynomials from the point of view of mapping class groups, including a new approach to the question of which branched covers of surfaces come from polynomials. (3) Describe the structure of an arbitrary normal subgroup of the mapping class group.

Two principal concepts from the theory of quantum fields are those of locality and duality. Locality generalizes the idea that there should not be so-called action at a distance in a complete quantum theory of nature. Duality occurs in two seemingly different quantum theories being fundamentally the same. The present project develops mathematical formulations of locality and duality in terms of a new theory of factorization homology. Factorization homology provides a mathematical means of articulating a physical theory on all of space-time in terms of physics in very small subregions, within which physics can be simplified in terms of combinatorics and higher-dimensional graph theory.<br/><br/><br/>This project develops the theory of factorization homology for variants of higher categories, and applications thereof to mathematical physics and differential topology. This theory can be thought of as the study of sheaves on moduli spaces of stratifications. One goal is to use factorization homology with adjoints to prove the cobordism hypothesis of Baez--Dolan and Lurie, which asserts that topological quantum field theories in the sense of Atiyah's axioms are uniquely determined by their value on a point. This would show that such a topological quantum field theory on space-time X comes from a sheaf on the moduli space of stratifications of X, and thus that the notion of locality can be understood in terms of the topology of such moduli spaces. A second goal is to show that this moduli space of stratifications of a manifold X satisfies an infinite-dimensional form of Poincar? duality.  This would then give rise to a duality among topological physical theories on X, once expressed as sheaves on the aforementioned moduli space. This duality is a form of Koszul duality for topological physical theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among all spaces, the spheres are the most fundamental and beautiful objects. A central question in homotopy theory and algebraic topology - the computation of homotopy groups of spheres - is to understand how spheres can be mapped to other spheres, in different dimensions, and to understand how different maps can or cannot be deformed to each other. This topological question is not just a fundamental question on fundamental mathematical objects, but it also has deep connections and interactions to other subjects in mathematics. It has been a major research question since 1950's. For example, Kervaire and Milnor established a connection to the question on how many ways one could do calculus on spheres - smooth structures on spheres; Kervaire and Browder built a connection to the question on how one could or could not do surgeries to higher dimensional spaces to turn them into spheres - the Kervaire invariant problem. Moreover, a summand of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, the image of J, is closely related to the Bernoulli numbers; Quillen and Goerss, Hopkins, Miller, Lurie established a connection to the moduli stack of formal groups. More recently, Hill, Hopkins, Ravenel, Voevodsky, Morel, Isaksen and others established connections between equivariant homotopy theory and motivic homotopy theory. The goal of this project is to deepen the existing connections, as well as discovering new connections by pushing further the limit of existing ones.<br/><br/><br/>This research concentrates on computations of stable homotopy groups of spheres, with interactions among motivic, equivariant and chromatic homotopy theory, and applications to problems in differential topology, such as uniqueness of smooth structure on spheres and the Kervaire invariant problem. More specifically, in current and ongoing projects with Isaksen and Wang, the Principle Investigator (PI) develops new computational tools in motivic homotopy theory, with connection to chromatic homotopy theory, which computes 40 more new stems of classical stable homotopy groups of sphere within two years. The PI will deepen the new connection between motivic homotopy theory and chromatic homotopy theory, carry out more computations of stable stems in the next a few years, and use the computations to attack the last unsolved case of the Kervaire invariant problem in dimension 126. The PI will also explore connections between real motivic homotopy theory and C2 equivariant homotopy theory, following ongoing work of Behrens, Dugger, Guillou and Isaksen. The goal is to prove structural theorems in this direction, as well as providing concrete computational results. In ongoing projects with Hill, Shi and Wang, the PI will also apply equivariant techniques, such as the slice spectral sequences that are developed by Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, to do computations in heights greater than 2 in chromatic homotopy theory and to understand its connection to stable homotopy groups of spheres.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concept also encompasses the notion of a space-time in the theory of relativity, as well as phase spaces, configuration spaces, and other useful structures in physics. While empirical physics is dedicated to measuring the precise features (e.g. shape, size, etc.) of our universe, the question of what possible features could the universe have, subject to certain laws, is a mathematical one. The data comprising the answer to such a question is called a moduli space; it is a topological space whose points are the possible geometric manifolds of a certain type and whose topology organizes those geometric manifolds into families whose features vary continuously. This project addresses important questions about many different classes of low-dimensional geometric manifolds and their moduli. The main focus is the study of manifolds modeled on real projective geometry and affine geometry, two classical geometries with just the right amount of symmetry to allow for large interesting moduli spaces with mysterious but tractable behavior.<br/><br/>This project weaves together ideas from a cross-section of mathematics and physics, including geometry, topology, group theory, dynamics, and relativity. A recently introduced notion of convex cocompactness for discrete subgroups of the real projective general linear group acting on projective space extends the definition of classical convex cocompact Kleinian groups and other examples, but is general enough to describe large open regions in the space of finitely generated discrete groups that were left unexplored by other methods.  A connection has been identified between this notion and Labourie's notion of Anosov subgroup, and the convex cocompact subgroups studied here involve many interesting deformation space for non-hyperbolic discrete subgroups. Another line of work studies Margulis spacetimes as geometric limits of anti de Sitter spacetimes, with consequences for geometry, topology, and deformation theory.  Connections between hyperbolic and anti de Sitter geometry in dimension three are particularly promising.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic topology associates algebraic invariants to spaces, moving the problem of understanding spaces (up to continuous deformation), to the more tractable world of algebra. At the heart of this project is the problem of understanding some of these invariants when the space in question is considered with the additional data of its symmetries. For example, instead of just considering a sphere, we can try to build in the additional data of the symmetry which maps each point to its antipodal point; or instead of considering a plane, we can consider a plane together with all the rigid motions of the plane that fix a square centered at its origin. The particular invariants considered in this project are algebraic K-theory and A-theory: deep invariants that have very significant connections to problems in number theory and geometry. Their versatility, however, requires sophisticated topological and categorical constructions. Part of this project is concerned with completing some necessary foundational work that allows these constructions to encode the extra data of symmetries, and part of it is concerned with using newly developed tools to rigorously define and study these theories, while keeping track of symmetries. There is also an educational component to the proposal-the PI plans to start a Directed Reading Program at the Johns Hopkins University, modeled on the one at the University of Chicago. The goal is to provide mentorship to undergraduates by pairing them with graduate students for reading courses, and in the process encourage interested students to pursue graduate work in mathematics.<br/><br/>Building on the PI's previous work on equivariant algebraic K-theory, the PI will develop an equivariant version of A-theory that is related to equivariant pseudo-isotopies and h-cobordisms of G-manifolds. Th project fits into a long-term research program of the project team aimed at establishing a chain of homotopy-theoretic constructions that relate the geometric behavior of compact G-manifolds to that of their underlying equivariant homotopy types. In current work, the project team has defined an equivariant A-theory spectrum, and the next step is to show that it fits into an equivariant stable parametrized h-cobordism theorem. In a related project with collaborators, the PI plans to study an equivariant version of the additivity theorem for Waldhausen G-categories. Nonequivariantly, K-theory is universal with respect to the additivity theorem, and equivariantly one can hope for a similar characterization. Progress has been slow in equivariant K and A-theory partly because adequate foundations were not in place. Equivariant infinite loop space theory, the machinery which turns suitable categories with G-action into G-spectra, has seen a lot of development in the last few years, and, motivated by the need for a solid foundation for equivariant algebraic K and A-theory, the PI, together with collaborators, is completing a series of projects on equivariant infinite loop space theory. This work not only produces new results (some of which have been anticipated for about 35 years), but they also consolidate work in important areas where the literature is fragmented and in need of clarification. They should provide some of the tools for the projects proposed above, as well as some related ones. In a different direction, the PI and collaborators have defined and are studying a spectral character map that generalizes the classical character map from representation theory. Lastly, the PI plans to study motivic Galois extensions."

In the last few years certain constructive techniques have emerged for the study of problems in smooth four-dimensional topology, in the form of trisections; the theory of trisections is attracting considerable interest among topologists and contains the potential to uncover new structure or properties of four-manifolds in a manner similar to the handle calculus due to Akbulut and Kirby in the 1970s. The central goal of this conference is to bring together researchers on various sides of the potential connection between gauge theory and trisections, with the hope of stimulating further progress on central problems in the field: these include the relationship between trisections and gauge-theoretic invariants of four-manifolds and surfaces they contain, the generalized Property R conjecture for links, and the Andrews-Curtis conjecture.

The purpose of this project is to use the incredible power of modern mathematics in order to shed new light on this question.<br/><br/>One of the main themes in understanding polynomials is to determine the minimal number of parameters R(n) to which the solution of a general degree n polynomial can be reduced.

Hilbert's 13th Problem (and related conjectures) posits some specific lower bounds on R(n), but until now no nontrivial lower bound has been shown.

Mathematicians have divided the study of spaces into two parts: qualitative questions (like whether a space has a hole in it), which is the field of topology, and quantitative questions (like the diameter of the hole), which is the field of geometry. Most, though not all, applications require quantitative answers, but before one can start on quantitative answers---the geometry---one needs to understand the qualitative behavior---low-dimensional topology, the focus of this National Science Foundation funded project. Indeed, in four-dimensions, even many of the most basic topological questions remain unanswered---questions about how many different simple spaces there are, how spaces can be cut up into simpler pieces, and what kinds of surfaces one can fit in given four-dimensional spaces. By using relations with other parts of mathematics and high-energy physics, this proposal seeks to advance human understanding by developing tools to answer some of these basic questions.<br/> <br/>This project, which focuses on applications of symplectic topology, algebraic topology, and representation theory to low-dimensional topology, has four interrelated goals. The first goal is to extend Lipshitz-Ozsvth-Thurston's ""bordered Heegaard Floer homology"" invariant of three-manifolds with boundary from the ""hat"" variant to the richer ""minus"" variant, for three-manifolds with torus boundary. The second goal is to prove a higher naturality result for Heegaard Floer homology, giving a functor from an appropriate quasi-category of decorated cobordisms to the quasi-category of chain complexes. The third goal is to prove new localization results relating the Heegaard Floer homology of a space with the Heegaard Floer homology of its branched covers. The fourth is to extend Lipshitz-Sarkar's stable homotopy refinement of Khovanov homology to cobordisms between knots and to other variants of Khovanov homology, including Lee homology. These tools are expected to have applications to concordance, homology cobordism, and other problems at the interface of three- and four-dimensional topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is applicable whenever one is interested in studying qualitative aspects of a system, emergent properties of a statistical ensemble of structures, or whenever there might be imprecision in the specification of the state of a system. In recent years the methods of homotopy theory have found use in fields as diverse as condensed matter physics and the foundations of mathematics.  This project aims to bolster these relationships with new tools from algebraic topology, and to apply them to these and other areas of mathematics and science.  There are applications of this work to condensed matter physics, classical algebraic geometry, algebraic topology and categorical logic.<br/><br/>The scope of this project involves several interrelated areas of study.  One of these, on algebraic vector bundles, depicts a new interface between complex analysis and algebraic topology, and is intended to get at the obstruction to topological vector bundles having algebraic structures.  Another explores the prospect of investigating the aggregate of all models of a given physical system, with the idea that the phases of physically measurable quantities occur as topological invariants of the space of models.  The two principal investigators will continue their joint work on strict units in chromatic homotopy theory.  This project has produced many striking analogies between chromatic homotopy theory and higher category theory.  Six further projects involve new stuctures in homotopy theory and its applications.  One investigates new formulas and expressions of duality in chromatic homotopy theory, another explores the ""transchromatic"" version of the hierarchy of limits expressed by the principal investigator's earlier work on ""ambidexterity,"" and a third offers a new explanation for the ubiquity of Lie algebras occurring in stable homotopy theory.  Other projects involve applications of homotopy theory to categorical logic, to the characterization of higher categories of interest in mathematical physics, and to a new construction of the famous de Rham-Witt complex used in number theory and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Work of William Thurston brought the geometry of such spaces more clearly into view as a central feature to explore. The triumph of this approach was Perelman's proof of Thurston's geometrization conjecture, that each three-dimensional manifold could be naturally broken up into pieces, each with a uniform geometry. The study of these geometries is frequently reduced, via a notion of rigidity, to considering simple combinatorial structures arising from loops on surfaces. The proposed research will explore how these structures predict volume, diameter, length and other aspects of the geometry, relating to notions from quantum physics.<br/><br/>A longstanding connection between volume of hyperbolic three-manifolds and Weil-Petersson distance relied on a combinatorial comparison via the pants graph which organizes maximal multicurves on a surface, yet other connections were known to arise from work of Witten via renormalized volume. Recent work of Schlenker made this connection explicit in the context of quasi-Fuchsian manifolds, and PI's proposed work will develop this idea further to explicitly relate fibered 3-manifolds and translation distiance. More generally, a primary project in the proposed research is to solidify and extend the connection between combinatorics and geometry in closed manifolds, and to continue to investigate the structure of deformation spaces of Kleinian groups with these tools. As an example of the power of these techniques, bi-Lipschitz models for 'random' Heegaard splittings provide a full solution (with Rivin and Souto) to the conjecture of Dunfield and Thurston that random Heegaard splittings are almost surely hyperbolic and their volume grows linearly. Finally, the PI will pursue projects with Minsky, and with Modami, Leininger and Rafi on the role of combinatorics in the geometry of geodesics in the Weil-Petersson metric, investigating disparities between Teichmuller and Weil-Petersson geodesics in terms of unique ergodicity."

Our perception of such objects, either with our eyes, or through the results of scanners, is determined by their shapes, which are themselves characterized by the geometry of their surfaces.  We are currently experiencing an explosion of discrete geometric data on shapes of objects obtained from scanners, cameras, imaging systems, sensors, satellites, and even cell phones. There is an urgent need for this geometric data to be processed automatically, for shape matching, shape comparison, and shape recognition. This need arises in areas such as facial recognition, identifying and classifying fossilized bones, distinguishing fractures in bones, diagnosing tumors and anomalies in organs, and measuring changes over time in brain images.  Creating a mathematical theory and developing algorithms to recognize and to align such geometric shapes are therefore major research challenges that have far-reaching implications. Deep mathematical theories in geometry and analysis that were developed over the past centuries are now finding applications in this field of shape matching. This project explores fundamental issues in this exciting area, which is on the cusp of seeing major advances. It does so by using the theory of conformal, harmonic, and isometric mappings to align surfaces. While these theories have been extensively studied in a mathematical context, their adaptation to computational algorithms is still under development. This project develops a cohesive and comprehensive theoretical framework for this emerging discipline along with concrete connections to scientific applications. It plans to implement and make publicly available a collection of software that will offer new tools and will open new lines of inquiry to scientists in biology, medicine, anthropology and other fields where the analysis of shape plays a central role.<br/><br/>The surfaces in our three-dimensional world can be described mathematically as two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Study of the geometric structures on such surfaces is a central topic in mathematical areas such as topology and differential geometry. It leads to classical theories of conformal geometry, moduli spaces, harmonic and conformal maps, and Riemann surfaces. These fields are now being applied to study surfaces of bones, brain cortices, proteins and other bio-molecules. When viewing an object with a laser, or radar, or CAT scan, we obtain a discrete representation of such a surface. Classical theories are inadequate for processing this real world data. This project will develop discrete counterparts of conformal and harmonic maps of surfaces, explore their existence, uniqueness, and diffeomorphism properties, and establish the convergence of the discrete theory to the classical smooth theory. It will also create and implement algorithms that incorporate this theory to create usable software for scientists and other practitioners. In this way, this project will bridge the gap between the mathematical theories of geometry and topology and the application of such ideas to algorithmic analysis of shape data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, topology plays an essential role in formulating modern theories in physics. Perhaps more surprisingly, tools from modern physics, more specifically quantum filed theory, have yielded significant progresses in low dimensional topology. This National Science Foundation funded project promotes systematic application of ideas in physics to topology and vice versa.

Furthermore, the resulting invariant, often called symplectic instanton Floer homology, is isomorphic to instanton Floer homology. The PI and his collaborators will develop tools in symplectic topology which can be used to construct new types of symplectic instanton Floer homology. They will also use a certain partial differential equation, called the mixed equation, to address various versions of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture. Another goal of this project is to prove the existence of non-trivial representations of knot groups into the special unitary group SU(N). An outcome of this project would be to give gauge theoretical proofs of the Smith conjecture and the Covering Conjecture. The final goal of this project is to employ instanton Floer homology in the study of the homology cobordism group. The PI recently constructed a family of new invariants for the homology cobordism group using Yang-Mills gauge theory. The PI will apply these invariants to better understand the structure of the homology cobordism group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have seven primary host universities: Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at Austin, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas Christian University and The University of Texas at Arlington.<br/><br/>By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. In so doing, the conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research as well as offering a venue for regional scholars and early career researchers. This stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a project to foster research opportunities for select junior faculty at these institutions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The permanent web page for the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~tgtc/archive/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to employ powerful computational techniques to calculate invariants on a large scale, make these algorithms and their output available to the community, and use computational resources to empirically arrive at and test conjectures. The investigators plan to develop new algorithms that will expand existing databases of knot invariants and may lead to resolving old open problems, thus also broadening the potential for applications throughout the sciences, from molecular biology to quantum physics. Mathematical tools for studying knots generally fall into two categories: geometric and algebraic.  The project will rely on large-scale computations to analyze connections between these two points of view, harnessing the data collected to attack questions that have so far remained intractable.  In addition, the project intends to make deep questions in the field accessible to students by developing new combinatorial and exploratory techniques.  The investigators will actively engage students in impactful research, directly addressing known pipeline gaps in the field of mathematics.<br/><br/>The research goals of this project include: (1) approaching the meridional rank conjecture from a computational perspective, with the aim of verifying the conjecture for all tabulated knots and extracting theoretical results from these empirical findings; (2) designing an efficient algorithm to compute bridge numbers for large classes of knots by combining techniques for finding lower and upper bounds for these numbers from knot diagrams;  (3) computing homotopy ribbon obstructions for slice knots using Kjuchukova's invariants and developing algorithms to test potential counterexamples to the slice-ribbon conjecture; (4) constructing four-manifolds as branched covers of the sphere with knots as singularities on the branching sets; classifying these branched covers and studying, with the help of trisections, the smooth structures on the four-manifolds constructed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference provides an international forum for the dissemination and discussion of recent important advances in low-dimensional topology and geometry. This is a large and active area of research in pure mathematics, whose basic goal is to understand the structure of mathematical objects known as manifolds, which arise naturally in modeling many scientific phenomena. Manifolds are ""spaces"" whose small-scale structure depends only on the number of degrees of freedom, called the dimension: for example, on a small scale a 1-dimensional manifold looks just like a line, a 2-dimensional manifold looks just like a flat plane, a 3-dimensional manifold looks like a region of the space in which we live, and so on. Although all manifolds of a given dimension are the same on a small scale, their large-scale structures can be very different and quite complicated; many mathematical techniques have been developed to investigate this. ""Low-dimensional"" means dimensions 3 and 4, which are of special interest: we live in a manifold that has three dimensions if we consider only the spatial universe, but four dimensions if time is included as well. The conference brings together experts and emerging researchers to report on recent results and explore future directions. This award enables young mathematicians from the U.S., graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, to participate. A particular effort will be made to support diversity by encouraging the attendance of women and other groups that are traditionally underrepresented in mathematics.<br/><br/>The conference focuses on the many different geometric and topological techniques that have recently been developed to study 3-dimensional manifolds. It is now known that 3-manifolds possess rigid geometric structures, and recent related developments have brought new insights not only to low-dimensional topology but also to neighboring fields. Meanwhile, new homology theories, having their origins both in quantum physics and in gauge theory, have led to dramatic progress on old questions in knot theory and 3-and 4-dimensional topology. Despite these advances on several fronts, relatively little is known about the interplay between analysis, geometry, and algebraic invariants in dimension 3. The conference highlights ongoing research focused on finding direct connections between these several aspects of 3-dimensional topology. The meeting brings together experts and early-career mathematicians working on the new invariants of 3-manifolds, on geometric group theory applied to 3-manifolds, and on more classical geometric and topological techniques. <br/><br/>The website for the conference is cirget.uqam.ca/boyerfest//en<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A foliation looks locally like a decomposition of the manifold as a union of parallel submanifolds of lower dimensions. Such geometric structures naturally arise in physics and geology. And in mathematics the depth and breadth of foliated objects made mathematicians use tools from many different branches of mathematics including differential geometry, homotopy theory, noncommutative geometry, ergodic theory and dynamical systems. The PI intends to use new tools from homotopy theory to investigate the relation between foliations and diffeomorphism groups.<br/><br/>The existence and classification of foliations and the implication of such structures on the global topology of manifolds have been extensively studied in the past five decades. However, there are still many mysteries, perhaps the most important of which in the homotopy theory of foliation is the Haefliger conjecture. Haefliger asked whether all plane fields on a manifold whose dimensions are roughly less than the half of the dimension of the manifold are integrable up to homotopy. It was shown by Mather and Thurston that the homotopy theory of foliations is naturally related to the homological invariants of the diffeomorphism groups made discrete.  But the group homologies of diffeomorphism groups as discrete groups tend to be very large and are poorly understood. On the other hand diffeomorphism group with the Whitney topology is better understood, in particular, Galatius and Randal-Williams' program developed new tools to study the classifying space of these groups with the Whitney topology. The PI's plan is to combine the new homotopy theoretical methods that stem from the evolving field of the moduli space of manifolds with the classical foliation theory to study homological invariants of diffeomorphism groups made discrete.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These workshops, all part of the semester program on Homotopy Harnessing Higher Structures are ""Higher Structures in Homotopy Theory"" (July 2-6, 2018), ""Equivariant and Motivic Homotopy Theory"" (August 13-17, 2018), ""Derived Algebraic Geometry and Chromatic Homotopy Theory"" (September 24-28, 2018), and ""Manifolds"" (December 3-7, 2018). The last fifteen years have seen a renaissance for algebraic topology.  Old problems have been solved using new methods, new methods led to new ideas, new ideas to new problems, and new problems to new theorems. In each case, there was enormous progress after the introduction and the study of higher structures. The larger program at the Newton Institute will assess what has been done, highlight what is working well, develop the field, give instructional and research workshops, and provide a meeting place for researchers at  all levels of the various branches of the field. There will be mathematicians in residence, but the larger community will be incorporated through the four workshops.<br/><br/><br/>This award will be used solely to support the workshop participation of US graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty without other significant support. The direct impact of NSF funding will be the raining and career development of up to 30 junior researchers, who will gain the opportunity to participate in a major program at the Newton Institute, which is  a major international nexus in mathematics. A secondary impact is to further develop collaboration between emerging research groups in algebraic topology and derived algebraic geometry in the US and Europe. Each of the four workshops has a different emphasis and flavor. The first, on higher structures, is focused on the foundations and applications of foundations, and is expressly aimed at researchers new to the field. The second, on equivariant and motivic homotopy theory, is set to be a major research conference on a vital and extremely active area in the field. The third, on derived algebraic geometry and chromatic homotopy theory, is a blend of an emerging topic and a classical area; younger researchers have been important in this new mixture of fields. Finally, the algebraic topology of manifolds has become an intellectual crossroads for homotopy theory, derived geometry, and mathematical physics; this workshop is intended as cross-disciplinary dialog celebrating a wealth of developments.

For example, work of Riemann on curved spaces later provided the mathematical language necessary for Einstein's theory of general relativity, which explains gravity in terms of curved spacetime. The broad framework, in which gravity is a paramount example, is known as field theory. Other key examples include the gauge field theories governing the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, which required physicists to use (and develop for themselves) non-trivial mathematical ideas from geometry, topology, and modern algebra. In fact, a systematic and rigorous mathematical framework that fully integrates these insights of physics is currently not available. This project aims to improve the situation by placing these field-theoretic ideas and techniques into the emerging subject of derived differential geometry, in particular, by developing a novel approach to derived differential geometry tailored with this application in mind. The Principal Investigators hope this effort will lead to a new language which facilitates communication between mathematicians and physicists.  They will explore the wealth of derived geometric objects that theoretical physics offers, focusing on connections with gauge theories.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators will develop foundations for derived differential geometry (DDG) custom-tailored for field theory and will work out concrete applications of this framework. On one hand, their approach will be similar to that of Toen-Vezzosi for derived algebraic geometry, allowing one to easily adapt their theory, tools, and techniques, specifically the theory of shifted symplectic and Poisson structures. On the other hand, with D. Roytenberg and R. Grady, they will incorporate a locally ringed approach to DDG, rooted in dg-manifolds and thus making it easy to import examples from physics. As a continual test and guide for developing our framework, they will carefully construct and investigate the derived critical locus of the Chern-Simons action functional, which can be thought of as a derived enhancement of the character varieties of 3-manifolds. With P. Teichner, the PIs will use this derived stack to relate quantum groups to the perturbative quantization of Chern-Simons theory. Finally, with R. Grady and B. Williams, the PIs will pursue a higher categorical analogue of work by Gelfand-Fuks-Kazhdan, Bott-Segal, and Haefliger, providing a natural home for invariants of smooth manifolds equipped with local structures, such as foliations, as well as for the anomalies to quantizing nonlinear sigma-models.

They often appear as the set of symmetries of a geometric object, for example, of 3-dimensional space, a molecule or a crystal. Oftentimes, the set of symmetries themselves, i.e., the group, has a natural topological structure. That is, one can speak of one symmetry being close to another, as in the case of two rotations of 3-dimensional space being close if they differ by a small angle. These latter groups are called topological transformation groups and are trivially related to geometry via the geometric object of which they are the set of symmetries. However, other topological groups are not so easily viewed as coming from geometry. This is, for example, the case for the systems of solutions to many differential equations which form a group under addition called a Banach space. However, one of the principal ideas of the present project is that all topological groups have natural intrinsic geometric structure which is defined jointly by their topological and algebraic structure. Moreover, this geometric structure can in many cases provide significant insight into the structure of the group by blotting out finer details that obscure the global or large scale properties of the group.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to investigate the coarse geometry of topological and, in particular, Polish groups. In earlier research, the PI has established and investigated a natural coarse structure that every topological group is equipped with and which coincides with that traditionally studied on finitely generated or locally compact groups, Banach spaces or even homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds. Particularly interesting subclasses to be studied are the Polish groups of bounded geometry for which the geometric structure theory is well-advanced. Several interesting questions on the extent of this class of groups remain open, for example, whether every Polish group of bounded geometry is coarsely equivalent to a locally compact group. The research program is by nature interdisciplinary. While its origins lie in descriptive set theory, the main examples of groups to be studied arise in various disciplines of mathematics, including functional analysis, logic, and geometric and differential topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The solutions to such systems give rise to algebraic varieties, which are fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry.  Algebraic topology is the study of systematically attaching algebraic invariants (numbers or abstract algebraic structures) to spaces; such invariants do not depend on the way a space is pulled or twisted (without tearing it).  It is natural to try to analyze algebraic varieties using the tools of algebraic topology.  However, when algebraic varieties do not have obvious ""spatial structure,"" such as when they arise in arithmetic settings, then a new approach is required.  The project under consideration seeks to analyze algebraic invariants of algebraic varieties using a new framework.  This theory allows one to apply the full power of techniques of algebraic topology to objects of interest in algebraic geometry -- one may treat spaces having complicated arithmetic structure, but a priori limited geometric structure, in essentially the same way as more classical spaces.

The goal of algebraic topology is to systematically build a connection between algebraic objects like numbers and geometric objects like spaces. This connection allows a two-way flow of information, with algebraic invariants distinguishing spaces and topological methods informing algebraic problems. Starting from foundational work of Quillen, algebraic and algebraic geometry data like formal groups gives rise to new invariants for spaces with striking properties. This project combines this classical thread with much more recent developments coming from equivariant algebraic topology. ""Equivariant algebraic topology"" remembers a collection of symmetries inherent in a space as part of the data, systematically grouping spaces with the same symmetries, and the numbers and invariants produced must reflect this. This extra structure provides more nuanced computations, giving more information about how the classically described invariants change under symmetries. Equivariant algebraic topology has experience a renaissance recently dues to the solution by the PI, Hopkins, and Ravenel to the Kervaire Invariant One problem, one of the oldest outstanding problems in algebraic topology. The solution introduced a host of new constructions and techniques that have striking ramifications in classical and equivariant algebraic topology, and the problems in this project focus on unpacking some of these new constructions and describing what they mean for algebraic topology in general. Many of the projects focus on diversity in STEM. The PI is currently developing tools to help others build a conference series for graduate students and develop their own conferences for younger researchers to attract them to a field. The PI is also in discussions with an HBCU about building more direct connections between their students and the PI's institutions, starting with electronic seminars to introduce students to active researchers in algebraic topology. The goal of these collaborations is to have more students from underrepresented groups enter and succeed in graduate programs in algebraic topology. Finally, the PI has developed and continues to refine a First Year seminar on ""Women in Math.""  The seminar connects students with female mathematicians, allowing the students the opportunity to hear about their research and experience.<br/><br/>Modern stable homotopy theory heavily utilizes the fact that the stable homotopy category behaves like a derived category of modules. The ground ring here is the sphere spectrum, and computing its homotopy groups is one of the overarching themes in the subject. The problem can be approached by first looking p-locally, and we can pass to the p-local stable homotopy category. Here algebraic geometry provides a further refinement via the theory of formal groups, a cornerstone of algebraic topology.  The current approach to understanding monochromatic homotopy is via certain homotopy fixed points computations. Computing the homotopy groups of fixed points and homotopy fixed points is very difficult in general. One of the most exciting new tools developed to solve the Kervaire problem is a general slice filtration, a method which directly computes homotopy groups of fixed points. For Real Landweber exact theories, this is an extremely efficient tool. For larger groups, computations are still tractable but much more mysterious. In all cases, many of the conceptual tools from non-equivariant homotopy are not available. Many of the techniques developed for stable equivariant homotopy can also be applied unstably.

Since its founding in 1997, the primary activity of the Southwest Center is the Arizona Winter School (AWS), an annual meeting which has become a prominent national event and provides high-level training and research experience for graduate students in arithmetic geometry and related areas. The AWS is organized around a different central topic each year and features a set of courses and accompanying research projects carefully designed and delivered by leading and emerging experts.  The result is a unique fusion of traditional mathematics conference and intensive research workshop: the speakers organize courses of four or five lectures, provide lecture notes in advance, and propose research projects for graduate students to work on during the meeting. Nightly working sessions on these projects and on separate problem sets are run by the speakers and postdoctoral fellows. On the last day, students present their findings to the participants of the meeting. The result is a particularly intense and focused five days of mathematical activity for everyone involved.  At the AWS, connections among peers are formed, and mentoring relationships between students and senior researchers are developed. Subsequent collaborations between participants at all levels are the norm. Students make concrete strides toward becoming research mathematicians, post-doctoral assistants gain valuable mentoring experience in their academic careers, and faculty develop new interests and see new connections that lead to important published results. The Southwest Center website shares reusable content from the Winter Schools, including lecture notes, project descriptions, and audio and video of lectures (both live-streamed and permanently archived). Through these thorough records, the dialogues begun at the AWS are extended to the greater community, and the efforts of the AWS participants are made freely and indefinitely available to all. More information about the upcoming and past Arizona Winter School programs can be found at the Southwest Center's website: http://swc.math.arizona.edu/<br/><br/>The 2019 AWS will be held on the topic of Topology and Arithmetic, exploring the boundary of higher homotopy theory and arithmetic geometry. The development and maturation of higher category/homotopy theory is one of the most significant achievements in topology in the last decade, and has recently found striking applications to number theory and arithmetic geometry. The earliest applications were to topological quantum field theories, cobordisms, and elliptic cohomology; even here, the interaction between generalized cohomology theories and formal groups yielded results of interest to arithmetic geometry (especially, the elucidation of the geometry of Lubin--Tate and Gross--Hopkins moduli spaces of formal groups). More recent progress abounds. Gaitsgory--Lurie study Tamagawa numbers (a fundamental invariant of algebraic groups over global fields) via topological techniques. Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze establish the existence of a weight filtration on topological Hochschild homology whose graded pieces are related both to classical cohomology theories (de Rham, crystalline) and to integral p-adic Hodge theory. Work of Wickelgren and others develop arithmetic aspects of A1-homotopy theory, extending some enumerative problems from the complex numbers to other fields. The 2019 Winter School will focus on exposition of applications and connections to arithmetic geometry, rather than the development of a general theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a well-timed and ambitious program to bring together specialists as well as beginning researchers to study objects known as L2 invariants and their applications. These invariants draw on many areas of mathematics, such as Algebra, Analysis, Geometry and Topology, and in turn provide extremely useful tools to study unsolved problems in these areas. The objective of the program is two-fold: to train a new generation of leading researchers, and to facilitate advanced research. In order to achieve these goals, the program will begin with a two-week long introductory school aimed at early career researchers, such as graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, followed by several week-long advanced courses, and end with a closing workshop. Throughout, it will include weakly research and study seminars. Priority for funding is given to early career researchers.<br/> <br/>Historically, the theory of L2-invariants has its origin in the works of M. Atiyah, in which he proposed an extension of the Atiyah-Singer index theory of elliptic differential operators on compact manifolds to the non-compact case. The modern definition of these invariants is more algebraic and uses the language of CW-complexes. The analogue of the first L2-Betti number in positive characteristic, the p-gradient, was introduced by M. Lackenby in his study of hyperbolic 3-manifold groups. The study of L2-invariants is linked to topology, geometry, global analysis, operator theory, ring theory, group theory and K-theory. This program aims to reunite leading specialists in these areas in an exciting research environment at the ICMAT. It is a great opportunity to train young researchers in an area which has been successful in addressing important problems, such as the Baum-Connes conjecture and the Hanna Neumann conjecture, and is an important source of tools and ideas for attacking intriguing open problems in many areas of mathematics.

In two dimensions, this is a relatively simple question which was addressed in the early part of the 20th century.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the area of mathematics known as Representation Theory had applications to this goal in dimension three.  In the late 1990s the program of categorification, which encompasses various areas of mathematics, was introduced to tackle this question in dimension four. This National Science Foundation funded collaborative project aims to further this already deep connection between the two fundamental fields of mathematics. <br/><br/>Soon after quantum groups were introduced in the 1980s, certain knot invariants, such as the Jones polynomial, were constructed from these objects.  Specializing the parameter of a quantum group to a root of unity led to invariants of three-dimensional manifolds.  Categorification is an interdisciplinary area of research which seeks to ""upgrade"" certain structures in mathematics such as replacing numbers with vector spaces and vector spaces with categories.  A link homology discovered in the 1990s categorified the Jones polynomial.  This led a surge in research in categorifying various aspects of quantum groups and their representations at a generic value of the quantum parameter.  In order to categorify three-manifold invariants coming from quantum groups, one must try to understand categorified quantum groups at a root of unity.  The subject of hopfological algebra was outlined in the early 2000s to accomplish this goal.  Quantum groups at roots of unity are associative algebras defined over rings of cyclotomic polynomials.  Such rings are categorified by stable categories of modules over truncated polynomial algebras.  The investigators will look for module categories over these stable categories in order to try to categorify the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity including knot and three-manifold invariants.  In order to categorify the associated 3-dimensional TQFT, one must work over a slightly larger ring where certain integers are inverted.  This ring has been categorified recently and the investigators will attempt to incorporate this structure into categorical representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology is the study of mathematical spaces up to elastic stretching, and knot theory is the study of how loops can be embedded into topological spaces. Knot theory and low-dimensional topology address important problems in physics, chemistry, and biology. In addition to its research goals, this project has an educational focus. Several of the proposed research projects are intended for collaboration with undergraduate students. This project also aims to make knot theory accessible to a broad audience via mentoring and outreach programs involving audiences that are not typically exposed to research mathematics.<br/><br/>Connecting combinatorial information describing a topological object with the underlying topology or geometry is a common theme throughout topology. Despite being defined in a combinatorial manner, alternating knots and links are now known to have topological descriptions. These topological descriptions led to a recognition algorithm for alternating knots as well as a new proof of a fundamental theorem concerning alternating links. In this project, the PI plans to expand these techniques to several classes of links that generalize alternating links, including quasi-alternating links, almost alternating links, links of Turaev genus one, and links with simple alternating tangle decompositions. The Jones polynomial and Khovanov homology of links in these classes will also be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the questions posed by geometers and topologists have to do with the nature of three-dimensional spaces sitting in a four-dimensional space, and with the restrictions that the global properties of larger space places on such sub-spaces. The research in this National Science Foundation funded project uses modern tools of analysis and geometry to shed light on the local nature of such subspaces, including new methods for showing that singularities in such spaces cannot be smoothed. Related analytical techniques will be used to explore the global topology of four-dimensional spaces, including an investigation of their symmetries.<br/><br/>Daniel Ruberman will carry out research in geometric topology, using Seiberg-Witten gauge theory, Heegaard-Floer homology, and more traditional topological techniques. The first parts of the project, joint with Jianfeng Lin and Nikolai Saveliev, are concerned with the smooth topology of four-manifolds that homologically resemble a product of a three-dimensional manifold with a circle. Central questions concern the interpretation of the classical Rohlin invariant and multi-signature invariants in terms of gauge theory; solutions of the main problems will decide the existence of manifolds predicted by high dimensional surgery theory. The PI will work with Adam Levine on embeddings of punctured three-manifolds in four-space, using refined techniques from Heegaard Floer theory to find obstructions.  An ongoing project with David Auckly, Hee Jung Kim, and Paul Melvin is concerned with the topology of the diffeomorphism group of a four-dimensional manifold and how it is affected by stabilization of the manifold. Finally, the PI will work with Saveliev and Demetre Kazaras on a new technique to obstruct the existence of positive scalar curvature cobordisms between even-dimensional manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alternatively, we can create a dual surface, where we make new triangles with a vertex for each of the original ones, and sides corresponding to the touching data of the original triangles. Poincar's amazing theorem from 1895 tells us that the dual shape is deformable to the original, regardless of the way cuts were done. Since its discovery, this duality result has been improved on and generalized in many different areas of mathematics. In homotopy theory one not only studies objects up to deformations, but also keeps track of deformations between them as well as coherence data, all in a streamlined way. Along with its recent augmentation into derived algebraic geometry, homotopy theory has become a unifying ground for numerous mathematical concepts, including duality.  <br/><br/><br/>The PI will work with her collaborators to explore two duality contexts in which homotopical and arithmetic information are intertwined. One of those involves establishing a homotopical extension of a classical result of Poitou and Tate about duality in the cohomology of number fields, as well as investigating the implications of such an extension to questions in arithmetic. The other involves understanding duality for some of the basic objects in so-called chromatic homotopy theory, whereby one organizes structural and computational information in homotopy according to periodicity properties. This would be a homotopical enhancement of a cohomological duality property of the chromatic Galois groups known as Morava stabilizer groups, and is based on seminal work of Gross and Hopkins. Both of these project goals may involve further developing the foundations for profinite group actions on profinite objects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, work of Riemann on curved spaces later provided the mathematical language necessary for Einstein's theory of general relativity, which explains gravity in terms of curved spacetime. The broad framework, in which gravity is a paramount example, is known as field theory. Other key examples include the gauge field theories governing the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, which required physicists to use (and develop for themselves) non-trivial mathematical ideas from geometry, topology, and modern algebra. In fact, a systematic and rigorous mathematical framework that fully integrates these insights of physics is currently not available. This project aims to improve the situation by placing these field-theoretic ideas and techniques into the emerging subject of derived differential geometry, in particular, by developing a novel approach to derived differential geometry tailored with this application in mind. The Principal Investigators hope this effort will lead to a new language which facilitates communication between mathematicians and physicists.  They will explore the wealth of derived geometric objects that theoretical physics offers, focusing on connections with gauge theories.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigators will develop foundations for derived differential geometry (DDG) custom-tailored for field theory and will work out concrete applications of this framework. On one hand, their approach will be similar to that of Toen-Vezzosi for derived algebraic geometry, allowing one to easily adapt their theory, tools, and techniques, specifically the theory of shifted symplectic and Poisson structures. On the other hand, with D. Roytenberg and R. Grady, they will incorporate a locally ringed approach to DDG, rooted in dg-manifolds and thus making it easy to import examples from physics. As a continual test and guide for developing our framework, they will carefully construct and investigate the derived critical locus of the Chern-Simons action functional, which can be thought of as a derived enhancement of the character varieties of 3-manifolds. With P. Teichner, the PIs will use this derived stack to relate quantum groups to the perturbative quantization of Chern-Simons theory. Finally, with R. Grady and B. Williams, the PIs will pursue a higher categorical analogue of work by Gelfand-Fuks-Kazhdan, Bott-Segal, and Haefliger, providing a natural home for invariants of smooth manifolds equipped with local structures, such as foliations, as well as for the anomalies to quantizing nonlinear sigma-models.

Since its inception in 1980s there were discovered many new connections of symplectic topology with other areas of Mathematics and Physics. The primary techniques used in the subject go back to Gromov's theory of holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds and its many ramifications, such as Floer homology, Fukaya categories and Symplectic Field Theory. However, there remains  a large class of open problems where holomorphic curve techniques seems not to be sufficient for proving expected results. The current project attempts to develop alternative techniques, or in case they do not exist to develop new methods of  construction  which could show that everything which is not prohibited by holomorphic curve techniques  can indeed happen. In particular, it provides a reformulation of symplectic topology of affine symplectic manifolds  as   differential topology of  singular spaces  with a certain well defined list of singularities. This approach can bring new tools from  differential to symplectic topology.<br/><br/>Weinstein symplectic manifolds recently  moved to the forefront of the development of symplectic and contact topology. Building on recent developments, both on the rigid and flexible side of symplectic topology of Weinstein manifolds,  the  project is designed to advance several central problems of the theory, such as symplectic topology of Lagrangian submanifolds.  Among the  main objectives of the project are: exploration of  techniques for simplification of singularities of Lagrangian skeleta of Weinstein manifolds, and in particular for  proving exploration of methods for attacking the regularity conjecture for exact Lagrangian submanifolds of Weinstein manifolds; exploration of  a new approach to singularity theory: h-principle without pre-conditions; further exploration of flexibility phenomena  for Weinstein manifolds and their Lagrangian submanifolds; and further development of Symplectic Field Theory. The project is designed to bridge the gap between the negative results establishing limits for possible symplectic constructions, and positive results involving the advanced symplectic constructions on the frontier of possibilities. The new methods  developed for the arborealization project may find applications elsewhere in singularity theory. The work on the project will involve several graduate students and postdocs and there will be written a graduate student level book devoted to new advances in symplectic flexibility.  The obtained results and developed methods may find applications in other areas of mathematics and theoretical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two principal concepts from the theory of quantum fields are those of locality and duality. Locality generalizes the idea that there should not be so-called action at a distance in a complete quantum theory of nature. Duality occurs in two seemingly different quantum theories being fundamentally the same. The present project develops mathematical formulations of locality and duality in terms of a new theory of factorization homology. Factorization homology provides a mathematical means of articulating a physical theory on all of space-time in terms of physics in very small subregions, within which physics can be simplified in terms of combinatorics and higher-dimensional graph theory.<br/><br/><br/>This project develops the theory of factorization homology for variants of higher categories, and applications thereof to mathematical physics and differential topology. This theory can be thought of as the study of sheaves on moduli spaces of stratifications. One goal is to use factorization homology with adjoints to prove the cobordism hypothesis of Baez--Dolan and Lurie, which asserts that topological quantum field theories in the sense of Atiyah's axioms are uniquely determined by their value on a point. This would show that such a topological quantum field theory on space-time X comes from a sheaf on the moduli space of stratifications of X, and thus that the notion of locality can be understood in terms of the topology of such moduli spaces. A second goal is to show that this moduli space of stratifications of a manifold X satisfies an infinite-dimensional form of Poincar? duality.  This would then give rise to a duality among topological physical theories on X, once expressed as sheaves on the aforementioned moduli space. This duality is a form of Koszul duality for topological physical theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the long-term behavior of models is an important scientific endeavor. In dynamical systems, a research sub-area in mathematics, one studies such mathematical models and attempts to understand their long-term behavior as well as consequences of changes in parameters. A standard approach to studying complicated mathematical models is to perturb them to simpler models and to show that certain conclusions for the simpler models are also valid for the more complicated models. Research funded by this award will contribute to the solution of three main problems that address basic aspects of dynamical systems and offer insights for the creation of new models.<br/> <br/>Many mathematical models are based on homogeneous spaces. In recent work, the investigator and his collaborators provided a complete classification of homogeneous plane continua, solving a problem that dates back to the 1920s. In this project these techniques will be exploited to address classification of all one-dimensional homogeneous continua. Parameter spaces are in general extremely complicated and very little is known about them. Thurston showed that the parameter space of complex polynomials of degree two can be modeled by the space of degree two invariant laminations. This combinatorial model is simpler than the Mandelbrot set and is completely described. Every complex polynomial of degree two corresponds to a single point in this combinatorial model and its location in the combinatorial model determines the topological dynamics of the polynomial. In another direction, the investigator will focus on understanding the topology and geometry of the spaces of invariant laminations of higher degrees, which is the first step in extending Thurston's work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The significant interaction between these areas has recently begun with ""applied"" algebraic topology, finding a wide range of applications in sensor networks, bioinformatics, computational chemistry, manifold learning, linguistics, and cosmology. This is due to the fact that many of the data set handled by applied topologists are based on a random sample from a larger population or contain different types of errors. Failure to capture the stochastic nature of topological data can result in a serious misunderstanding of the topology of the system. For example, the layer of extraneous topologies triggered by heavy-tailed errors, as a phenomena analogous to that of audio crackle in temporal signal analysis, will make it very hard to recover an underlying topology of the system. Another example includes topology on non-Euclidean spaces, especially those negatively curved. One good motivation for this study lies in its tree-like structure as a result of negative curvature. By virtue of this structure, the resulting non-Euclidean model can potentially be employed for analyses of various complex networks in physics, computer science, and cosmology. Combining topological concepts with the notion of randomness, this projects aims to properly understand random topology of the system. <br/> <br/>This project addresses research questions on random algebraic topology. Despite its recent development, most of the studies on random algebraic topology do not pay sufficient attentions to how heaviness or lightness of the tail of probability distributions affects the topology. One of the main focuses is on topological crackle - the layered structure of topological elements, typically caused by a heavy-tailed distribution. Although topological crackle has been recognized, at least empirically, in the statistical manifold learning, this project investigates it thoroughly from a probabilistic viewpoint. In light of the involvement of heavy-tailed distributions, extreme value theory (EVT) will be selected as a main tool for this study. Relying on EVT, the PI aims to establish a theoretical foundation for a graphical descriptor of the birth and death of topological cycles, called persistence diagram. One of the main focuses is on the random configuration of points in the persistence diagram by regarding them as a random closed set and discussing their asymptotics in terms of the Fell topology. As the second main topic, the project attempts to investigate random topology on the negatively curved non-Euclidean space. The PI mainly deals with a theoretical question: How do the parameters of the hyperbolic space, including its negative curvature, characterize the random topology? As expected, new phenomena will be uncovered that are never seen in the usual Euclidean setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes different combinations of symmetries might have the same overall effect, leading to ""relations"".  Abstractly, a group may be specified with a finite list of ""generators"" and relations among the generators, collectively called a presentation.  An important question in mathematics is whether two presentations define the same or similar groups.

Central to the fields of geometry and topology is the study of surfaces, for example the surface of a spherical solid like a planet, or the surface of a donut or of a more complicated three dimensional solid. A key objective in Teichmuller theory is to understand all possible geometric forms that a fixed type of surface can admit. For example, an astrophysicist might be interested in cataloging all possible topographies of a hypothetical planet. The possibilities are countless: there could be hilly or mountainous terrains, highlands, valleys of varying elevations, and so forth. Miraculously, Teichmuller theory gives a way to package the entire plethora of possible topographies into one geometric object which can then be studied. The practical applications of Teichmuller theory and of its mathematical relatives abound, from computer visualization and graphics design, to evolutionary biology and genetics, and to many other important disciplines in between.<br/><br/>In more technical detail, the principal investigator proposes a three part plan for studying Teichmuller and hyperbolic geometry, the mapping class group, and more general classes of finitely generated groups and metric spaces. First, the PI plans to develop dynamical and combinatorial tools for studying the Teichmuller space, the mapping class group, and hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and to use these tools to analyze fundamental questions at the intersection of combinatorics and dynamics, such as lattice point counting problems, and the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds from a combinatorial perspective. For example, the PI plans to demonstrate relationships between the curve complex of a surface S and the geometry of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over S, in such a way that is sensitive to the topology of the underlying surface S.  Next, the PI will generalize and extend these tools to other groups and spaces, such as the outer automorphism group of the free group and the Outer space; for instance, the PI will initiate a study of metrics on moduli spaces of graphs that are inspired by the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space. Finally, the PI plans to pose analogs of counting and other types of dynamical problems in a wider class of groups and of spaces, and use the generalized tools to attack these questions in their respective contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This subject is also closely related to knot theory, that is focused on studying the shapes of knotted circles in three-dimensional spaces.  Low dimensional topology and knot theory have various implications in physics (quantum theory), cosmology (the shape of the universe), chemistry (molecular knots) and biology (knotting of DNA and DNA-protein interactions). This project aims to study the shapes of three- and four-dimensional spaces and configurations of knotted circles and surfaces in them using an invariant defined by the PI and her collaborator. In another direction, the PI investigates the relationship between different invariants for knotted circles.

For example, Eftekhary and the PI defined tangle Floer homology as a generalization of (minus) Heegaard Floer homology. In one direction, this project aims to (1) study embeddings of graphs and homology cobordism group of homology cylinders using tangle Floer homology and (2) introduce invariants for concordances and Seifert surfaces, and get bounds for unknotting number using cobordism maps for tangle Floer homology.

An important mathematical problem is to determine the extent to which what is observed determines the shape of an object. More generally - what mathematical features of a shape can one determine from the observables?  The principal investigator will study both concrete and abstract problems of this nature.  For example, suppose a particle is enclosed in a polygon and is traveling in a straight line, bouncing off any side it encounters. The shape of the polygon could be inferred by observing the sequences of sides encountered by the particle. The principal investigator will study the extent to which the shape of the region is determined by these observables.

Using these approaches will also allow one to develop problem solving techniques and methods that could find applications in concrete settings.<br/><br/>The principal investigator will investigate a variety of problems, each of which is connected, either directly or indirectly, to surfaces through geometry, group theory, and dynamics. The research activities are organized into four themes. (1) Studying the large-scale geometry of surface bundles.  The goal is to determine hyperbolicity properties of surface bundles from the geometric data of their associated monodromy representation to the mapping class group.  (2) Probing geometric and dynamical properties of free-by-cyclic groups from the cross section of flows on 2-complexes, and pursuing a fruitful analogy with fundamental groups of surface bundles over the circle. (3) Analyzing singular Euclidean metrics on surfaces and understanding the extent to which the limited data encoded by the support of its associated Liouville current determines the geometry of the metric. This is directly related to studying the extent to which the symbolic dynamics of billiards in polygons determines the shape of the polygon. (4) Studying the geometry at infinity of spaces of structures on a surface, specifically the Teichmueller space, the curve complex, and variants of these spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A graph is a set of points called vertices and curves between the points called edges.  A spatial graph is a graph that is sitting in three-space.  A spatial graph can be very complicated and knotted.  Spatial graph theory is a recent field which grew out of knot theory, the study of knotted circles in three-space.  In addition to contributing to our understanding of connections between spatial graphs and their surrounding three-space, this project has direct applications to biological questions.  Knot theory has become important within the life sciences, in the field of DNA Topology.  Most of the DNA that is worked with in laboratories is in small circular molecules that are called plasmids.  Circular DNA also appears in nature.  Plasmids can naturally be modeled with knots.  With every cell division the DNA is copied in a process called replication.  This is a complicated process that involves a number of enzymes.  After replication the two new plasmids are linked (or catenated) and sometimes knotted.  The reason for knotting is not completely understood.  In the middle of replication DNA forms the more complicated structures, that of a knotted graph, this is an area of DNA topology that has yet to be investigated by mathematicians.  This project will have immediate contributions to our biological understanding of DNA replication.  <br/><br/><br/>In particular, the PI will focus on three main projects centering around spatial graphs:  First, the PI will study a number of aspects of Legendrian graphs.  Central results in contact geometry use Legendrian graphs in their proofs. Thus this opens an exciting new area with great potential. These projects will increase the overall understanding of Legendrian graphs, further increasing their potential to use Legendrian graphs as a tool to understand 3-manifolds, and potentially distinguish contact structures.  Second, the PI will develop new invariants and better understand existing invariants of spatial graphs and knots, including graph Floer homology.  Third, the PI will begin classification of unknotting number one theta-graphs to understand unknotting in DNA replication intermediates."

Negatively curved spaces locally look like the surface of a saddle (in every pair of directions). While this might be hard to visualize, spaces with this property are quite prevalent, both in mathematics, and in nature. For these spaces, there is a tight link between the geometry of the space and the topology (qualitative aspects of the shape) of the space. There is also a natural associated dynamical system, which records how a particle inside the space will move, and which exhibits hyperbolic behavior - extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. For example, if you put a marble on a saddle and see how it rolls, then two nearby marbles can roll in very different directions. Again, hyperbolicity is a very common type of behavior for dynamical systems. This research proposes to study how the geometry, topology, and dynamics of these spaces interact and influence each other.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to work on a series of projects that are loosely centered around the notion of non-positive curvature. These projects fall into three broad categories.  (1) Branched coverings: the PI plans to systematically study branched covers of non-positively curved (or negatively curved) locally symmetric manifolds, ramified over a codimension two totally geodesic submanifold. The main goal is to understand whether or not these covers support Riemannian non-positive (or negative) curvature metrics.  (2) Complex geometry: the PI plans to study several questions concerning complex manifolds.  He plans to create new closed negatively curved Kaehler manifolds. He wants to investigate the topology of the space of almost complex, complex, and Kaehler structures on a manifold.  He also wants to give high dimensional examples of almost complex manifolds that do not support complex structures.  (3) Geometry/topology problems: the PI wants to show that hyperbolizations always produce spaces whose fundamental groups are linear. He would like to study the Singer conjecture for Gromov-Thurston manifolds. He is interested in studying non-arithmetic lattices in SO(n; 1), particularly the structure of totally geodesic submanifolds inside nonarithmetic hyperbolic manifolds.

The investigators plan to develop new algorithms that will expand existing databases of knot invariants and may lead to resolving old open problems, thus also broadening the potential for applications throughout the sciences, from molecular biology to quantum physics. Mathematical tools for studying knots generally fall into two categories: geometric and algebraic.  The project will rely on large-scale computations to analyze connections between these two points of view, harnessing the data collected to attack questions that have so far remained intractable.  In addition, the project intends to make deep questions in the field accessible to students by developing new combinatorial and exploratory techniques.

In Euclidean geometry, we study objects such as circles and rectangles. A circle is highly symmetric; for example, any rotation about the center of the circle preserves the circle. A rectangle, though still symmetric in some ways, has less symmetry than the circle; its two sides may have different lengths. In low-dimensional topology we study more complicated objects or spaces of two, three, and four dimensions. A central aim of this National Science Foundation funded project is to understand these spaces through symmetries. Topological objects arise naturally in other fields, including biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering.  At times, the best way to understand one is via its relationship with another through what is known as a ""covering map"". A second project is to analyze covering maps. A challenge in studying more intricate three or four dimensional spaces is that one cannot always visualize or draw these even using a computer. It is therefore helpful to break them into building blocks. One of the projects is to do so with objects called hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  In addition to the mathematical research, the PI has demonstrated a strong dedication to outreach, mentoring, and advocating for underrepresented individuals in the STEM disciplines. With the NSF travel funds she will continue to engage in opportunities inside and outside the academia directed at promoting mathematical research and education. <br/><br/><br/>The focus of this research project is to understand the finite degree covering spaces, the group of symmetries, and the combinatorics of hyperbolic manifolds in low dimensions. The PI plans to tackle the following projects during the funding period: (1) making effective the Virtually Haken Theorem, (2) quantifying separability properties to determine whether or not the fundamental groups of three-manifolds and the mapping class groups of closed surfaces are linear, (3) exploring infinite-type surfaces, their mapping class groups, and the actions of these groups on hyperbolic complexes, and (4) giving a combinatorial characterization for hyperbolic three-manifolds.

The workshop will be organized by Kim Ruane (Tufts University) in collaboration with Michah Sageev (Technion) and Daniel Wise (McGill University).  Infinite groups arise in the study of topological spaces and in geometry.  The fundamental group of a topological space is an algebraic object associated to the space which essentially describes the number and structure of any ""holes"" that are there.  In geometry, we can study the symmetries or rigid motions of the space - these also form a group.  In Algebraic Topology and in Geometric Group Theory, there is an exchange of information whereby the algebra informs the topology or geometry and vice versa.  In mathematics, one often attempts to understand all objects of a particular type as follows: first understand some fundamental concrete examples and then try to show that a generic one of these objects is either the same as one of the fundamental examples or only differs from it in a way that can be easily described.  <br/><br/>In the setting of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the Haken manifolds are those that contain a 2-sided incompressible surface.  In the 1960's, Haken showed that if such a surface was there, then the original 3-manifold can be completely described by gluing together finitely many thickened up surfaces in a particular way.  One of the biggest problems left open in 3-manifold topology after the Geometrization Conjecture was proved by Perelman was the Virtual Haken Conjecture.  This basically asserts that any compact hyperbolic 3-manifold is either Haken or is closely related to one that is Haken. This was recently shown to be true by the award winning work of Ian Agol.  A key piece of the puzzle was to show that the fundamental group of any hyperbolic 3-manifold can almost be realized as a group of symmetries of a nonpositively curved cube complex.  This is a theorem in Geometric Group Theory which has significant consequences in geometry, topology and in group theory.  The role of nonpositive curvature cannot be overstated and so our workshop aims to explore this connection further.  The theme of the workshop is algebraic, geometric and analytical aspects of groups that act on CAT(0) spaces by isometries. CAT(0) spaces were introduced by Gromov in the 1980's as a generalization of Riemannian manifolds of nonpositive sectional curvature and encompass a rich class of metric spaces that are not manifolds.  Classical examples of these spaces include symmetric spaces of non-compact type, Euclidean and hyperbolic buildings, as well as finite Cartesian products of these. Many examples admit proper group actions, and these groups are often arithmetic in the classical case. Simplicial trees are the simplest examples of CAT(0) spaces and the Bass-Serre theory of groups acting on trees is an important early chapter of geometric group theory. CAT(0) cube complexes are a natural high dimensional generalization of simplicial trees.  These cube complexes are now famous for their central role in the recent solution of the Virtual Haken Conjecture for hyperbolic 3-manifolds mentioned above.  The workshop aims to bring together junior and senior people working in the area to discuss further open problem concerning these metric spaces as well as competing forms of non-metric combinatorial nonpositive curvature.<br/><br/>Workshop Website:  http://cms-math.net.technion.ac.il/nonpositively-curved-groups-on-the-mediterranean/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It features twelve research lectures, as well as a problem session and a panel discussion on graduate programs and careers in mathematics in the U.S. and Europe. The topic, namely, the large-scale geometry of three- and four-dimensional spaces, is a key area of basic research in pure mathematics, with a highly international research community. All completed research in the area is publicly available through peer-reviewed journals, and most is freely available world-wide on arXiv.org. Conferences such as this facilitate in-person discussions and collaborations between geographically disparate research groups, and U.S. participation is essential to maintain leadership in the field. The meeting also serves as an opportunity to identify and potentially recruit top young researchers from other nations.<br/> <br/>The topics of Floer-theoretic invariants, concordance, smooth four-dimensional topology, and contact topology have become inextricably entwined in modern mathematics. There continues to be dramatic progress in these areas. One area of recent progress, stemming from the disproof of the hundred-year-old Triangulation Conjecture, is using equivariant Floer theory to study problems in concordance and homology cobordism. These techniques have made accessible questions about homology cobordism that seemed far out of reach ten years ago. Another active area, targeted by the conference, is the topological meaning of Floer homology. Related to concordance is the topology of smooth, closed 4-manifolds, in which recent progress includes both beautiful new obstructions and constructions. In a related direction but in the contact category, the last five years have also seen breakthroughs in understanding Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian knots, via Floer theory, contact topology, and open books.
