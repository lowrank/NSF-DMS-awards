Suciu, will study  topological invariants of the complement of an arrangement of  hyperplanes in complex n-space, and their relationship to  combinatorial invariants of the intersection lattice of the  arrangement.  This project, continuing work with Daniel C. Cohen,  draws on a variety of techniques from algebraic topology, group  theory, algebraic geometry, computational algebra (Groebner basis),  and combinatorics (oriented matroids).  The starting point of the  investigation is a presentation of the fundamental group that  closely reflects the topology of the complement.  From this  presentation, computable algebraic objects are derived: Chen  groups, Alexander invariants, characteristic varieties, etc.  Some  of these topological invariants can be computed directly from the  lattice, but some probably require more subtle information, to be  extracted from the underlying matroid.  Under certain hypotheses,  this approach permits the computation of the cohomology of the  complement, with coefficients in a local system determined by a  linear representation of the fundamental group.  Such computations  have applications in the theory of singularities (Milnor fibrations  of non-isolated singularities, monodromies of complex plane  curves), theory of braids (generalized Burau and Gassner  representations), differential equations (Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov  equations, hypergeometric functions), and low-dimensional topology.       In its simplest manifestation, an arrangement is merely a  collection of lines in the plane.  These lines cut the real plane  into pieces, and understanding the topology of the complement is an  elementary exercise, which amounts to counting those pieces.  In  the case of lines in the complex plane (or, for that matter,  hyperplanes in complex n-space), the complement is of one piece.   But, unlike a disk, for example, this does not mean that it can be  drawn back over itself until it shrinks down to a single poi nt: An  algebraic invariant that measures this failure is the fundamental  group, which, roughly speaking, consists of those loops that can  not be shrunk in the complement.  A particularly important example  is the braid arrangement of ""diagonal"" hyperplanes in complex  n-space.  In that case, loops in the complement can be viewed as  braids (strings of wire weaving around each other, without backing  up), and the fundamental group can be identified with the (pure)  braid group.  For arbitrary arrangements, the identification of the  fundamental group is more complicated, but it can be done in an  algorithmic way, using the theory of braids.  This theory, in turn,  is intricately connected with the theory of knots and links in  3-space, with its wealth of algebraic and combinatorial invariants,  and its varied applications to biology, chemistry, and physics.  ***"

In  particular, the investigators are engaged in the completion of  computational details and the construction of examples of the  ""Tornado Formula"" of Crane and Frenkel, a construction of 4D TQFT's  from initial data given by a ""Hopf category,"" and the examination  of a fully bicategorical generalization of the Crane/Yetter  invariant.  The investigators have already shown that any 3D (resp.  4D) TQFT with physically reasonable factorization properties (which  should be satisfied by the ""full  Donaldson/Floer and  Seiberg/Witten theories) has an associated monoidal category and  (internal) Hopf algebra (resp. monoidal bicategory) and formal Hopf  category object therein) and are studying how general this  phenomenon is.  It is the investigators' hope that  algebraic/combinatorial constructions for invariants sensitive to  PL (equiv. smooth) structure on 4-manifolds may be found in the  course of the project.  Several related lines of research--  constructions of ""quantum"" invariants of 2-knots and Seifert  surfaces, and the study of the HOMFLY and Kauffman skein categories  with a view to finding new initial data for the construction of  TQFT's--are also being pursued.        Topological quantum field theories are a lively new area of  research into the structure of spaces of dimensions 3 and 4.

This project will contribute to  the unfolding of the rich algebraic structures implicit in spaces  of the dimension(s) in which we live.

One part is a  continuation of joint work with Mladen Bestvina and Mark Feighn  concerning three problems.  The first is a characterization of  subgroups of polynomial growth outer automorphisms. The second is  to extend their proof of the Tits Alternative by showing that all  virtually solvable subgroups of the outer automorphism group are  virtually abelian.  The third is to show that the mapping torus of  an outer automorphism is coherent.  The goal of the other part of  the project is to use combinatorial group theory methods,  especially folding, to analyze a dynamically defined partial order  on conjugacy classes in the mapping class group of a punctured  disk.       Two fields of mathematics interact in this project: dynamical  systems and combinatorial group theory, the latter, perhaps  surprisingly, contributing a powerful method for studying the  former.  In dynamical systems, the focus is on the long-term  patterns that occur in a changing, or evolving system, for example  a system of orbiting planets and their sun.  Combinatorial group  theory is the study of algebraic objects called groups using  topological and combinatorial methods.  One part of the project  examines an important family of two-dimensional dynamical systems  known as pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms and uses a tool from  combinatorial group theory called ""folding"" to analyze the  relationship between various members of this family.  Another part  of the project relates to a group whose elements are the algebraic  analogs of the pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms.  While most research  in this area is derived from geometry, in this project the  principal investigator will add dynamical systems techniques in  order to investigate this group in greater detail.  ***"

The objective  is to enhance our understanding of fundamental problems in both  subjects, including the K-theory of fields and rings of integers,  the nature of homotopy inverse limits, and the generating  hypothesis in stable homotopy theory.  (1) Mitchell will work on  the homotopy theoretic aspects of algebraic K-theory, focusing on  questions relating to the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures for rings  of algebraic integers.  In particular, he will study further the  cohomology of the general linear group of such rings of integers.   (2) The principal aim of Goerss's research is to address the  question of computing homotopy inverse limits in general and in the  particular case of homotopy fixed points for the type of group  action that arises in algebraic K-theory.  Secondary to this main  project is a study of certain types of Hopf algebras, and a study  of the question of recovering homotopy invariants of a space from  its cochains.  (3) Devinatz will work on the chromatic point of  view in stable homotopy theory.  In particular, he is interested in  the circle of ideas surrounding Hopkins's chromatic splitting  conjecture and in its relevance to the generating hypothesis.       More basically, the projects of Mitchell, Goerss, and Devinatz  all involve the relationship between the field of algebra --  especially the theory of numbers -- and the more ""geometric"" field  of homotopy theory, which may be defined as the study of phenomena  that remain unchanged under continuous deformations.  Mitchell  plans to interpret number theoretic invariants in terms of homotopy  theory and then to use the techniques of homotopy theory to gain  new insights into number theory.  These insights might be difficult  to obtain using only algebraic techniques.  Goerss will be working  on a number of projects.  One involves developing techniques in  homotopy theory which should p rove useful in Mitchell's program.  Another of Goerss's projects turns the flow around -- namely, he  will attempt to understand certain homotopy invariants in a  completely algebraic way.  Devinatz will also use algebra to gain  insights into homotopy theory.  In Devinatz's project, the  algebraic framework is better understood; however, the algebra  involved is rather complicated.  Devinatz must therefore try to  extract enough information from the algebra to provide the desired  homotopy theoretic information.  All three investigators are also  interested in providing more expository accounts of the circle of  ideas surrounding their work; these accounts should make it easier  for graduate students to enter and master the field.  ***"

The principal investigator (working jointly with  U. Oertel) has proved a ""Lamination Theorem"" which says that for a  compact cell-complex X, exactly one of two alternatives holds:  either X is negatively curved in the sense of Gromov, or there is  a 2-dimensional lamination mapping to X with certain properties,  namely the lamination has a transverse measure of Euler  characteristic zero, and the map from the universal cover of a leaf  to X is least area.  The primary aim of this project is to use the  Lamination Theorem to investigate the ""weak hyperbolization  conjecture"" for a 3-manifold M, which says that M is negatively  curved in the sense of Gromov if and only if the fundamental group  of M has no Z+Z subgroup.  The strong form of this conjecture has  been one of the greatest challenges in 3-manifold theory.  The weak  conjecture should be a significant step in proving the strong  conjecture, in light of recent work of Cannon on characterizing  hyperbolic 3-manifold groups, and work of Gabai on the topological  rigidity problem for hyperbolic manifolds; if these various  projects can be completed, then the hyperbolization conjecture  would be proved.  This research project is also concerned with  several other topics, in particular: understanding properties of  automatic and biautomatic groups; the geometric group theory of  mapping class groups; constructions of and properties of  pseudo-Anosov flows on 3-manifolds.       Group theory, the mathematical study of symmetry invented by  E. Galois in the 1700's, has for much of its history been a subject  of abstract algebra, despite its geometric origins.  Starting with  work of M. Gromov, J. Cannon, W. Thurston and others in the 1970's  and 1980's, the newly emergent field of geometric group theory has  returned group theory to its origins.  The basic problem, proposed  by Gromov in his 1983 address to the International Congress of  Math ematics, is to take a ""group"" (an abstractly described  collection of symmetries) and to understand its geometry.  As a  particular case of Gromov's program, suppose that S is a  3-dimensional space, much like the space that we inhabit, and  suppose that G is a certain group of symmetries of S; in this  situation Thurston conjectured in the late 1970's that the geometry  of G should fall into a list of specific classes.  In most cases  Thurston's conjecture says that G should have ""hyperbolic""  geometry, a type of geometry that describes how 3-dimensional space  fits into 4-dimensional space-time in relativity theory.  The main  thrust of the current research project is an attempt to prove  Thurston's ""hyperbolization conjecture.""  Recent work of D. Gabai,  J. Cannon, and the investigator wih U. Oertel suggests a three-step  approach to proving the hyperbolization conjecture, and this  project is concerned with one step, the so-called ""weak  hyperbolization conjecture.""  While this is an ambitious project,  the investigator expects it to be productive; if it is completely  successful, and if the other two steps are finished as the work of  Cannon and of Gabai suggests, then the hyperbolization conjecture  will be proved.  ***"

Take the special case  where the variety with action is a representation.  It is still  an open question whether there are non-trivial equivariant vector  bundles over representations.  The answer depends on the group,  and there are many groups for which the answer is unknown.  The  project will extend the list of groups where the answer is known  and, when non-trivial vector bundles exist, it is intended to  develop a conceptual lower bound for the isomorphism classes of  bundles with base a representation.  Such results will have  applications for algebraic actions on affine space.  The other  object of study is the Abyhankar-Moh Problem: Let f be a  polynomial in n complex variables for which f=1 is isomorphic to  complex (n-1)-space.  Is there an automorphism of affine n-space  which when composed with f, is a linear function?  The answer is  known for n=2 and unknown for higher n.       Here is a little motivation and a layman's description of  one of the above problems, the Abyhankar-Moh Problem.  It fits  into one of the main problem areas of pure and applied  mathematics.  Given two functions of n variables, when can one be  transformed into the other by a change of variables (automorphism  of n-space)? To explain what this means and motivate the problem,  consider the two functions of two variables x and y: f(x,y)=x and  h(x,y)=x+yy.  The set of points where f(x,y)=1, i.e. x=1, and the  set of points where h(x,y)=1, i.e. x+yy=1, both represent an  infinite wire in the x,y-plane.  The first is a line, and the  second is the parabola x+yy=1.  The fact that each of these two  sets represents an infinite wire in the plane is expressed  mathematically by the fact that there is a change of coordinates  in the plane which transforms f into h.   The change of  coordinates x'=x+yy, y'=y transforms f to h, as one sees  from f(x',y')=f(x+yy,y)=x+yy=h(x,y).  An electrician who had to  sever a connection by cutting the wires would in each case have  one wire to cut.  Contrast that to the set defined by  g(x,y)=xx=1.  That set consists of two infinite wires represented  by the lines x=1 and x=-1.  In this case an electrician wishing  to sever the connection represented by the set g(x,y)=1 would  have to cut two wires; so the situations are not physically the  same.  This is explained mathematically by the fact that there is  no change of coordinates of two-space which transforms f (or h)  to g.  The Abyhankar-Moh Problem fits into this setting.  In  these terms the problem is expressed as: Given two functions f  and h of n variables with the property that the sets f=1 and h=1  are ``isomorphic'' to (n-1)-space, is there a change of  coordinates of n-space which transforms f to h?  The above  discussion illustrates the case n=2, and the answer is known to  be ""yes"" in that case, but it is unknown for other values of n.  ***"

These geometries are all generalizations of the geometry of the hyperbolic plane, yet they lack totally geodesic hypersurfaces making it difficult to build fundamental polyhedra - one can construct discrete automorphism groups directly from fundamental polyhedra. A related topic dealing with representation spaces of surface groups is also contained in the proposal: these spaces can be identified with moduli spaces of holomorphic vector bundles over Riemann surfaces, hence have ramifications in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.    Hyperbolic geometry is the oldest known non-Euclidean geometry, and possesses many interesting properties not encountered in Euclidean geometry. Discrete automorphism groups are closely related to regular polyhedra, and finding them in a non-Euclidean geometry can often be difficult. Collections of these groups are also related to certain gauge theories arising in mathematical physics."

This  includes work on the structure of the Jones polynomial, on  Vassiliev invariants, and on connections with quantum field theory  and molecular biology, as well as techniques and conjectures about  the use of functional integration in topology.       In the last decade, knot theory has encountered an awakening  through the infusion of a remarkable collection of techniques from  mathematical physics and a series of interrelationships with  molecular biology, chemistry, and theoretical physics.  The  principal investigator is one of the key figures in the inception  of this relationship with physics (statistical mechanics) via his  introduction of the use of state summation models for polynomial  invariants of knots and links.  In a state summation model the knot  is regarded as a miniature physical system, and topological  properties of the knot are seen as averages of physical  interactions.  These models have grown to encompass techniques from  quantum field theory and have been useful in topology and its  applications to the study of molecular interactions in biology and  chemistry.  In topology these techniques apply to the structure of  three- and four-dimensional spaces as well as to knots.  This means  that these techniques are essential to the architecture of three-  dimensional structures - from molecules to networks of  communication, from atoms to galaxies.  All fields of science are  based on the structure of space.  What is particular to this  project's topological study is that it articulates the topological  components in large networks of which knots are the principal  example.  Such networks are the basis of significant structures  such as RNA and DNA, where topology is the key to interaction.       In fact, the introduction of topology in these subjects is,  from the  viewpoint of this principal investigator, just the  beginning of a larger interplay, where topology is seen as the  basis for studying the recursive and circular architectures of  complex systems.  A galaxy, a society, an organism and a physical  system all have in common the stability that arises through closed  systems of circular interactions.  Such interactions have  traditionally been treated via cybernetics and computer modeling.   These topological investigations add a new dimension to cybernetics  and complex systems, providing new questions and a host of new  problems.  All these issues are treated in the new book ""Knots and  Applications,"" edited and contributed to by the principal  investigator.  ***"

During the 1980's, remarkable progress was made toward  a global understanding of stable homotopy theory, showing that some  major features arise chromatically from an interplay of periodic  phenomena arranged in a hierarchy.  This project is part of an  effort to develop a similar understanding in unstable homotopy  theory.  In recent work, Bousfield introduced a hierarchy of  localizations, called the vn-periodizations for positive integers  n, which serve to resolve a given space into a chromatic tower with  monochromatic fibres.  He will work to understand these  vn-periodizations of spaces as well as the closely related  homological localizations.  He has already established strong links  between v1-periodizations and K-homology localizations of spaces,  leading to solutions of old problems concerning the K-theory of  iterated loop spaces.       Geometric objects or spaces play a central role in  mathematics, arising for instance from the solution sets of systems  of equations.  Beyond their usual measurements, such spaces have  deeper properties which persist even after drastic deformations.  These properties begin almost trivially with the number of separate  components and the number of holes but become tremendously rich and  informative in higher dimensions.  The field of homotopy theory is  devoted to their study using powerful algebraic and geometric  techniques.  Various periodic phenomena in homotopy theory have  been discovered since the 1950's, and an exciting ""chromatic""  approach to the subject was developed in the 1980's, allowing  resolutions of confusingly complicated phenomena into much simpler  periodic parts.  This approach was originally restricted to certain  simpler phenomena known as stable phenomena, but it is now being  extended to a full, fascinating, important range of unstable  homotopy theoretic phenome na.  ***"

Using the new algebraic result that an inverse limit of  connected free Lie algebras is free, methods of rational homotopy  theory can be applied.  Deeper results seem to be obtainable using  the geometric methods of Pontrjagin and Thom.  Ravenel is studying  problems in stable homotopy theory related to the telescope  conjecture.  This appears to be the best approach to understanding  the stable homotopy groups of finite complexes, which is one of the  oldest problems in algebraic topology.       In more general terms, algebraic topology is the study of  geometric problems (often in more than 3 dimensions) in their  qualitative rather than quantitative aspects, classifying and  counting structures rather than measuring their sizes.  For example  an essential difference between a 2-dimensional plane and a  3-dimensional space is that removing a line separates the former  but not the latter into two separate pieces.  Topologists have  devised methods called homotopy and homology for keeping track of  such properties systematically in very complicated geometric  objects (objects than can arise, for example, as the spaces of  solutions to sytems of ordinary or differential equations).   Neisendorfer and Ravenel's research is concerned with refining and  extending these methods.  ***"

This idea, borrowed from  algebra and number theory, has resulted in new questions being  raised.  For example, what does it mean for a topological space to  be a Lie group at a particular prime p?  One can answer with a  reformulation that combines the group structure on G and the  topological structure on G into a single classifying space, BG.   Further abstraction of the properties true for all BG leads to the  definition of a p-compact group which is a suitable homotopical  analogue of a Lie group at the prime p.  Remarkably, these  p-compact groups possess analogues of standard Lie theoretical  constructions such as maximal tori, Weyl groups, and root systems.   The goal is to use these structures to produce a classification  that is similar in spirit to the classification of compact  connected Lie groups, but different in detail.  A by-product would  be the complete solution to the Steenrod question (1961) of which  spaces have mod-p cohomology algebras that are finitely generated  polynomial rings.       Algebraic topology studies geometric objects by abstracting  more tractable algebraic information.  One rich source of such data  is the group of symmetries of a geometric configuration.  These so-  called Lie groups, after the 19th century analyst and geometer,  Sophus Lie, have had profound applications in algebra, physics, and  number theory.  One advantage of algebraic topology and homotopy  theory is that its natural tools, such as homology and homotopy  groups, are impervious to small deformations or changes in the  geometric structure under study.  The goal of this work is to  create a classification of the homotopical analogues of Lie groups  by the study of the algebraic topology of their classifying spaces.  ***"

He is continuing his work on  topological Andre-Quillen homology and its relation to unstable  homotopy theory.  He is also investigating the properties of a  construction on A-infinity ring spectra that is analogous to the  center of a ring in algebra; this seems likely to have applications  to a question posed by Mahowald, Ravenel and Shick in their work on  the telescope conjecture.  He intends to do some calculations with  cyclotomic homology (a construction that was defined by Bokstedt,  Goodwillie, Hsiang and Madsen, which has important applications in  algebraic K-theory).  He is investigating the question of whether  the wedge of the even suspensions of a complex-oriented E-infinity  ring is again an E-infinity ring, and some consequences that this  property would have.  He intends to work on several problems which  relate homotopy theory to C*-algebras.  He is investigating some  old questions posed by Adams-Wilkerson and Atiyah involving the  relationship between Adams operations and Steenrod operations in  the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence.  He is seeking a better  understanding of the Morava K-theory of extended powers.       Topology is the study of certain properties that shapes can  have that do not depend on detailed measurement (the well-known  example is that a doughnut and a coffee cup are the same to a  topologist, because one can be stretched to look exactly like the  other).  Algebraic topology is a method for describing shapes by  means of certain kinds of calculation.  For example, the surfaces  of the doughnut and the coffee cup could be divided into  non-overlapping triangles, and one could then calculate the number  of triangles plus the number of vertices minus the number of edges;  the result would be the same in both cases, and this fact shows (by  means of a nontrivial theorem) that one shape can be stretched into  the other.  In order to get more info rmation from these  calculations, one incorporates them into the framework of abstract  algebra by relating them to groups or rings.  One of the most  interesting trends in the subject in the last decade has been to  bring in abstract algebra at an earlier stage of the process by  relating the shapes themselves to groups or rings; that is what the  phrase ""A-infinity ring spectrum"" refers to.  The main purpose of  this project is to continue the development of this idea.  ***"

Recently the investigator has constructed a category of spectra  with a symmetric monoidal smash product.  The construction is  elementary and will provide an introduction to spectra which will  not scare away the novice.  The strict associativity of the smash  product means that many other definitions regarding spectra can be  greatly simplified.  For example, one can easily discuss ring  spectra, commutative ring spectra, module spectra.  The  investigator is using this new definition of ring spectra in the   study of topological Hochschild homology and topological cyclic  homology.       Spectra have been developed over the last thirty years as a  bridge between the geometric problems that the algebraic topologist  studies and the algebraic techniques which he uses.  The earliest  examples were given by Rene Thom in his work on the cobordism  classification of manifolds, where he showed that manifolds, the  geometric objects common to mathematics and physics, are classified  up to cobordism by certain spectra.  Over the years, as one needed  spectra having more and more properties, many different  constructions have been given.  These constructions have became  increasingly complicated, until only a few experts could understand  them.  However, recently the investigator has found a much easier  way to construct spectra that nonetheless have all the properties  one needs for the applications.  This makes the field far more  accessible, especially to graduate students, and should lead to  much fuller appreciation of this powerful tool.  ***"

The manifolds in question are of two types. The first are manifolds equipped with a natural map to the circle. Special properties of these manifolds have been investigated for the past three decades, but finally controlled topology (in a parametrized incarnation) reveals the possibility of a grand unified theory for all the previously investigated phenomena. The point of view of this project is to assemble all manifolds which map to a circle into one large space. The controlled topology can be used to factor this space into various geometrically and algebraically significant components. The techniques suggest that a study of the space of all manifolds which map to a fixed manifold of nonpositive curvature would lead to new phenomena. The point here is that the circle is the simplest manifold of nonpositive curvature. The second type of manifolds under consideration are those equipped with a group of symmetries. When this group acts on the manifold, there results an ""orbit space"" which is, in fact, a stratified space. The stratification presents a decomposition of the orbit space into manifold pieces. Since the orbit space is not itself a manifold, geometric methods cannot be applied until it is understood how the manifold pieces fit together. One of the most important aspects of the project is the uncovering of the geometric structure used to join together the manifold pieces. This structure is not only subject to classification and quantification, but can also be applied for the development of new geometric tools for studying stratified spaces. The structure on the neighborhoods of the strata is a bundle in the category of controlled topology. Thus, controlled topology becomes the vehicle for transforming and applying classical manifold techniques to study these more intricate manifolds with singularities.  Manifolds are geometric objects that locally resemble balls in a suitable Euc lidean space. A sphere or a doughnut can serve as a  familiar example of a low dimensional manifold. High dimensional manifolds are not nearly so esoteric and unphysical as one might at first believe, since dimensions correspond to degrees of freedom.  Accordingly, solutions to ordinary and/or differential equations describing   physical systems of many particles have three dimensions for each particle, and frequently relevant qualitative behavior of the system (as opposed to detailed quantitative behavior) is captured by the   topology.  Such properties of planetary orbits as being closed, instead of receding to infinity like those of some comets, are topological properties.  Portions of this project deal with decompositions or stratifications of manifolds obtained by considering orbits and the reconstruction of the manifold from manifold pieces.  ***"

The first attempts to resolve problems within high  dimensional geometric topology by studying the algebraic K-theory  of group rings, generally the group rings of fundamental groups of  the manifolds involved.  K-theory turns out to be useful in  studying the homeomorphism classification within a given homotopy  type.  The second will use an analogue of the techniques used in  these geometric problems to study the algebraic K-theory of fields,  specifically the descent problem for fields with topologically  cyclic absolute Galois group.       Topology concerns itself with properties of spaces (curves,  surfaces, and higher dimensional analogues) which do not change  under deformations.  Informally, one thinks of stretching or  shrinking part or all of the space.  For instance, if one thinks of  the capital letter ""A"" as a space, one could print it with  different fonts, and although the results would change (the size,  as well as the slant of the character, or the height of the  horizontal line within the character), it would not change  topologically, since the one figure could be stretched or bent into  the other.  Humans are able to recognize visually the fact that  these figures are topologically the same, since we are easily able  to read text written in either font.  This notion of equivalence is  referred to as ""homeomorphism.""  There is an even stronger notion  of equivalence referred to as ""homotopy equivalence,"" which, for  instance, allows arcs not only to be stretched but to be compressed  into points.  Thus the capital letter ""H"" is homotopy equivalent  but not homeomorphic to the capital letter ""X,"" since one can  obtain ""X"" from ""H"" by compressing the horizontal line to a point.   However, capital ""O"" is not homotopy equivalent to ""I,"" since the  ""O"" contains a loop while the ""I"" does not.  Homotopy equivalence  is typically an easier relation to determine than homeomorphism.   This proje ct concerns itself with the problem of classifying up to  homeomorphism spaces which are already homotopy equivalent, for a  certain family of ""homotopy types.""  Surprisingly, although this  problem seems entirely geometric, the techniques required use  heavily abstract algebra.  This interplay between algebra and  geometry is one of the most exciting areas in mathematics today.  ***"

For very  complicated smooth objects (even those of more than three  dimensions), the effect of the curvature of the object on heat  diffusion within it is fairly well understood.

Techniques involving inverse limits,  accessibility, and prime end structure will be studied.  He is  seeking characterizations of when various inverse limits can be  embedded in the plane and when homeomorphisms of continua can be  extended to homeomorphisms of the plane.  He is also  investigating continua with the property that all of their  nondegenerate proper subcontinua are equivalently embedded, or  which admit rigid embeddings in the plane, and various  homogeneous embeddings in real 3-space.  Determining the  existence of an indecomposable continuum which is almost  homogeneously embedded in the plane will be important in the  study of dynamics.  Questions relating embeddings and extensions  of maps to computation of Hausdorff dimension and to attractors  and cofrontiers are among dynamic topics related to this  project.       Lewis hopes to narrow the currently large gap between known  theorems and existing examples in the theory of continua by  broadening the base of the theory and looking for generic classes  of examples and construction techniques.  Recent work in discrete  dynamics indicates that considerations of embeddings and  extensions of maps are crucial in identifying which sets can be  attractors or closures of orbits, how sensitive dynamic  properties are to perturbation, and what type dynamics is  possible or even generic.  These investigations should yield more  information about the continua themselves and new ways of  approaching problems which until now have proven slow to yield to  attacks.  Possibilities for new approaches lie in the areas of  decompositions, homogeneity, characterizations of spaces, and  investigations of subcontinua.  ***"

The investigator  studies a particular case of curvature: spaces of non-positive  curvature, in the riemannian case and in the PL (piecewise linear)  case. He also studies some problems concerning riemannian and PL  rigidity (in the non-positively curved case); the relation between  riemannian and PL non-positively curved geometry; and how the  topology could determine the curvature: which spaces admit a  non-positively curved geometry.       A space with non-positively curved geometry is a space on  which, essentially, an object, as it moves away from an observer,  seems to decrease in size at a rate equal to or faster than the  rate in the ""real world"" (euclidean geometry).  In general,  geometry determines some properties about the (global) shape of the  space.

Kent Orr investigates the homological  and geometrical properties of the fundamental group and its  transfinite lower central series.

Understanding the local geometry of  such spaces is equivalent to understanding when polyhedra with  piecewise spherical metrics are ""large"" (i.e., satisfy the CAT(1)  inequality).  This project attempts to answer a number of questions  concerning ""large"" piecewise spherical polyhedra, as well as the  related question of when a negatively curved Riemannian manifold  supports a piecewise hyperbolic CAT(0) metric (with B.

The field of geometric group theory has, historically,  involved ideas from several areas of mathematics -- topology,  combinatorics, and group theory.  The recent introduction of  techniques patterned on differential geometry has led to exciting  new developments in the field as well as new applications to  problems in topology.  One of these techniques, a version of  ""nonpositive curvature"" for topological metric spaces, has played  a major role in these developments.

Topologically, complex curves in the  unit ball in complex 2-space are simply represented as  quasipositive surfaces, which are combinatorially defined and  readily manipulable.  Earlier, Dr. Rudolph combined quasipositivity  with results from gauge theory to obtain estimates showing that  many knots are much more complicated (in certain specific senses)  than classical knot invariants can detect; he is now working to  extend such estimates (using results from monopole theory).  Other  work in progress includes development of skein theory for  Legendrian knots, an attack on a question of Harer about fibered  links (are they all stably Hopf-plumbed?), and (with Michel  Boileau) a study of Stein-fillable 3-manifolds.       Knots and links are superficially simple objects which turn up  in contexts as diverse as physics, theoretical meteorology, and  biology.  Mathematically, a rich source of knots is the theory of  equations in a small number of variables (the simplest mathematical  link, which looks like two rings in a piece of chain, comes from  the simple equation xy = 0).  Knot theory--the study of aspects of  the geometry of knots and links which are insensitive to continuous  deformations--has always had a lot to give to, and take from, the  qualitative side of the theory of equations.  Quasipositive knot  theory takes advantage of extra structure in certain equations to  obtain stronger results about their associated knots; potential  applications range from quantum gravity to unraveling the molecular  structure of DNA.  ***"

The  significance of the proposed activity is that it provides the  Hochschild complex with very rich algebraic structures extending  the bilinear cup product and bracket that define a Gerstenhaber  algebra structure on the Hochschild cohomology.  Those new  structures involve higher multilinear products and brackets.  More  precisely, the structure extending the bracket is expected to be  similar to the homotopy Lie algebra structure, which plays a very  important role in different branches of physics and mathematics.   Such structures have been used by Stasheff and May in their study  of loop spaces, Beilinson and Ginzburg and Hinich and Schechtman in  the study of deformation theory of algebraic varieties and vector  bundles, and by Kontsevich in his study of knot invariants.   Physicists Witten and Zwiebach have effectively used the homotopy  Lie structure in string theory.  The conjecture itself may be  reformulated as the existence of a canonical string theory  associated to every associative algebra.       The conjecture indicates deep connections between algebra and  complex analysis.  Connections between different branches of  mathematics are known to create a lot of excitement and lead to  most important discoveries in mathematics.  The best recent example  may be the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, which establishes a bridge  between number theory and analysis.  The recent work of Wiles  towards the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture has had many important  implications, including his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  ***"

Both  components involve close scrutiny of continuous functions on  these objects, with severe restrictions imposed on the point  preimages.  The first comprises the final aspects of a  far-reaching effort to characterize manifolds topologically;  primarily it calls for determination of an appropriate geometric  notion of general position to fulfill the role played by the  Disjoint Disks Property in the characterization of high  dimensional manifolds.  The second arises because recent results  in the piecewise linear category make it reasonable to expect  discovery of widespread additional conditions under which one  quickly and easily detects an approximate fibration;  specifically, it seems that for many n-manifolds  N , any map  from an (n+k)-manifold onto a reasonable space  X  with each  point preimage homotopy equivalent to  N  will be an approximate  fibration.  Interest in this class stems from andtrades upon  computable relationships among domain, range, and typical fiber.   New tools are sought for this effort, geometric ones in the first  case, to distinguish genuine manifolds from pretenders, and  algebraic ones in the second case, both to improve the  recognition criteria and to expand the applications.       The projected research activity focuses on manifolds, a  foundational project in that these objects are central to so much  mathematics.  One aim is to characterize low-dimensional  manifolds, which would crown the far-reaching effort to  characterize manifolds topologically, with complete success  recently achieved in dimensions greater than 4, and hopes for  related success in the two remaining dimensions of interest.  A  second aim is to characterize certain nicely structured  functions, approximate fibrations, defined on manifolds.  This  effort appears promising now because several resu lts from the  past two years make it reasonable to expect discovery of  additional, useful conditions under which one could quickly  detect this class of functions.  The resultant ease and variety  of computations about the various objects at hand would be a  significant benefit.  New tools are sought for each of these  efforts, geometric ones in the first case, to distinguish genuine  manifolds from pretenders, and algebraic ones in the second case,  to provide additional relationships among domain, range, and  fiber of the functions under consideration and thereby to expand  the applications.  ***"

These techniques exploit  multirelative connectivity estimates to describe continuous  functors of various types in terms of special values; for example,  a functor of topological spaces might be recovered from its values  at highly connected spaces, or a functor of subspaces of a  manifold, from its values at zero-dimensional subspaces, or a  functor of real inner product spaces, from its values at  high-dimensional spaces.  The project is to refine and combine  these techniques and to apply them to various questions in  differential topology.       Each 'functorial calculus' mentioned above is so called  because of a not-entirely-fanciful resemblance to the ordinary  'functional calculus' of Newton and Leibniz.  Sometimes a fact  about numbers is best proved by placing it in a context where a  number is part of a huge family of numbers -- a numerical function.  Properties of the function then lead, by general theorems of  calculus that may seem a bit magical on first encountering them, to  a computation of the number.  So it is here: sometimes a fact about  some geometrically defined object is best proved by placing it in   a context where the object is part of a huge family of such objects  -- a functor -- and using some magic of a more modern kind.  This  analogy may convey something of the flavor of the research; the  content is harder to convey, because most of the 'geometric'  objects in question are connected to everyday reality only by  rather long chains of abstract ideas.  (Despite the intervention of  similar long chains of abstract ideas, however, one finds that the  'objects' physicists study predict real physical phenomena with  uncanny precision.)  ***"

The problem of  distinguishing non-hyperbolic automatic groups has several  interesting aspects.  There is a notion of angle between pairs of  subgroups  A,B  of a group G,  which involves the smallest length  of an expression  aba'b'a""b""... which is reduced and gives the  identity element of G.  This leads to interesting algorithmic  questions; in the case of free groups this relates to the Loop  Theorem.  Another algorithmic question about ""inner rank"" is  related to questions about surfaces in 3-manifolds.       Groups arise in all branches of mathematics, as sets of  symmetries, i.e. transformations which preserve structure.  The  investigator hopes to understand various properties of groups, the  classification of types of groups, and the use of group theory to  connect mathematical areas.  In geometry and topology, groups  naturally arise as subgroups of matrix groups and the fundamental  groups of spaces.  The fundamental group as defined by Poincare is  the basic ingredient in the classification of three-dimensional  manifolds, and major problems are group-theoretic.  This is  especially true in dimension three.  There is also an intrinsic  large-scale geometry inherent in an abstract group, which has led  to the recent interest in what are known as hyperbolic groups.   This leads in turn to algorithmic problems and to formal language  theory and will some day be of interest and use to computer  scientists.  The project has identified some problem areas as  described above, ""angle,"" ""inner rank,"" and so on, which are of  interest in the interaction of algebra and geometry; some progress  in these areas has been made; they are becoming active areas of  research, in particular, by the investigator and his Ph.D.  students.  ***"

One of  Cooper's projects is to utilize the relationship between finite  foliations and geometrically finite surfaces in hyperbolic  3-manifolds.  Another is to continue developing the properties of  the A-polynomial for knots that arise from representation theory.  A third involves the theory of buildings applied to representations  of the braid group.  Long's specific projects concern the study of  finite foliations and the resulting dynamical systems, as well as  the application of these ideas to hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  He also  is working on problems in algebraic geometry and the use of the  degree conjecture to prove Property P, and on the finite  dimensional linear representations of the braid groups.   Scharlemann's main interest is the stabilization problem for  Heegaard splittings.  Success would have important implications for  the general classification problem for 3-manifolds.  There are  connections to knot theory as well, via the notion of ""tunnel  number"" for a knot.       One of the most basic observations about the world around us,  apparent almost from our birth, is that it is 3-dimensional.  So it  is of interest to understand spaces with precisely this property:   anyone living in the space would see their world as 3-dimensional.   Such spaces are called ""3-manifolds,"" and this project aims to  increase our understanding of them.   3-manifolds support  interesting phenomena.  One of these phenomena is ""knotting,"" in  which an intrinsically simple object like a garden-hose (or a DNA  string) can be maneuvered so that its positioning in space is quite  complex.  More generally, objects like chemical molecules, usually  thought of abstractly as ""graphs"" (much like tinkertoy models), can  be put into a 3-manifold in extraordinarily complex ways if one  thinks of the ""sticks"" as made of rubber which can be knotted and  interweaved.  Tools which are being developed to understand  3-manifolds help us und erstand knotting and, conversely,  understanding knotting (a second principal aim of the project)  helps us to understand 3-manifolds.  For example, the ""Heegaard  splittings"" mentioned above refer to a technique in which all the  complexity of a general 3-manifold is absorbed into a thick graph.   Then information about the graph gives information about the  3-manifolds.  A more disciplined type of knotting, called braiding,  occurs, for example, in the trajectories of fluid or plasma flow in  a Tokomak-type torus.  Since this knotting is more disciplined,  more tools are available for understanding and classifying such  knotting.  Hence the interest in braid theory and its connections  to dynamical systems.  ***"

One of the fundamental tools in these two  fields has been the notion of measured geodesic laminations.  The  space of measured geodesic laminations is a certain completion of  the space of simple closed curves on a surface.  Bonahon has  developed a differential calculus on this space of measured  geodesic laminations and is applying his techniques to study  3-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds.  For instance, this has enabled  him to analyze the degree of differentiability by which the  geometry of the convex core of a hyperbolic 3-manifold varies as a  function of the hyperbolic metric.  He is currently working on the  problem of classifying hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds up to  isometry.       Many problems in topology, geometry and mathematical physics  involve the consideration of all simple closed curves on a surface.  Here, a surface can be something as simple as a plane from which we  have removed a finite number of points (to be thought of as  obstacles); a simple closed curve is a curve in the plane which  avoids the obstacles, ends at the same point where it started, and  does not cut itself in between.  The problem is to understand when  it is possible to deform one such curve into another without  crossing the obstacles.  This is analogous to considering all  possible ways to wrap a string around a certain number of vertical  pegs.  To study these curves, it is useful to go one step higher in  abstraction by considering `generalized curves' which occur as  limits of curves.  This is a typical process in mathematics,  analogous to the one by which, to understand all rational numbers  (such as 2/3 or 47/23), one has to consider all real numbers (such  as pi or square root of 2).  Bonahon is developing a differential  calculus on the space of generalized curves, analogous to the  classical calculus on the space of real numbers.  This enables him  to compute derivatives for certain natu ral functions on the space  of simple closed curves and to obtain estimates on their  variations.  ***"

Recently Cohen, Jones, and Segal have defined an  underlying notion of Floer homotopy type, which can be interpreted  as the `universal deformation' of this topological field theory to  what physicists call a theory of two-dimensional topological  gravity.  This Floer homotopy type is a rather mysterious  MU-algebra spectrum.  In this project the investigator constructs  a conjectural model for it, and he probes some of the ways in which  it provides an understanding of the constructions of string  physicists from a homotopy-theoretical point of view.  The whole  subject has profound implications for the future of homotopy theory  and global analysis.       The theory of mechanics developed in the ninteenth century was  based on 'principles of least action': a ray of light, for example,  follows the path which minimizes its time of flight.  The physicist  Richard Feynman reinterpreted these ideas in terms of a theory of  integration over the space of all possible paths; his ideas are now  fundamental to our understanding of quantum mechanics.   Unfortunately, the theory of such Feynman path integrals has never  been made rigorous; indeed, it is now known that no naive  generalization of the classical theory of integration can form an  adequate basis for the integrals which arise in modern physics.  In  geometry, however, it has become clear recently that ideas from the  theory of Feynman integrals can be used to solve classical problems  of pure mathematics, and there is evidence that many geometric  problems are in some sense 'tame' enough so that an analogue of the  theory of Feynman integrals can be established rigorously.   Although restricted in many ways, these geometrical test questions  provide very clear and extremely important data for understanding  the 'dyna mical' problems of direct interest to physics, and they  are our best guide to a consistent theory of Feynman integrals.  In  this project the investigator sketches a conjectural description,  in terms of algebraic topology, for a rather lapge class of  topological field theories, which arise from the application of  Feynman integral techniques to the geometry of complex manifolds.  ***"

According to the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture, a spin manifold admits a metric of positive scalar curvature if and only if an `index' obstruction vanishes. This conjecture has been proved (by the principal investigator and his coauthors) for spin manifolds whose fundamental groups have periodic cohomology. Moreover, a ""stable version"" of this conjecture has been proved for manifolds with finite fundamental groups (in the ""stable version"" one allows the manifold to be replaced by its product with sufficiently many copies of the ""Bott-manifold,"" an eight-dimensional spin manifold that represents the periodicity element in real K-theory). The principal investigator works on proving the ""stable"" conjecture for all spin manifolds whose fundamental groups satisfy the Baum-Connes conjecture. Moreover, he suspects that the Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture does not hold in general, and tries to find new ""unstable"" obstructions to the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics. Concerning positive Ricci curvature, the investigator is pursuing a proof of his conjecture that the existence of a positive Ricci curvature metric on a spin manifold with vanishing first Pontryagin class implies the vanishing of its Witten genus. This involves a ""Weitzenboeck formula "" for the Dirac operator on the free loop space of this manifold. These projects fit in the general framework of trying to relate the topology of a manifold (qualitative information about its global shape) and its geometry (quantitative information about its local shape). For 2-dimensional manifolds (like the surface of a ball or a tire), a nice classification has been known for a long time: Two such surfaces have the same topology (i.e., they can be deformed into each other if we think of them as being made of thin rubber) if and only if they have the same number of ""holes"" (the surface of a ball has no holes, the surface of a tire or a cup has one hole, and a pretzel has two holes). Moreover, if a surface has ""positive curvature"" in the sense that the angle sum in each triangle whose edges are geodesics (shortest curves) is larger than 180 degrees, then this surface has the same topology as the surface of a ball. It is a major goal of modern day mathematics to generalize these results to higher dimensional manifolds (e.g., our universe is a manifold of dimension 3, Einstein's space-time has dimension 4, and manifolds of dimension 10, resp. 26, play a crucial role in the theoretical physics of the attempted unification of the four fundamental forces). ***"

The geodesic spaces which are the universal covering spaces for finitely presented groups are of primary interest. Essentialy this project is an attempt to find groups whose boundary has dimensions of different kinds that disagree. Such a group for integral cohomological and covering dimensions would give a counter-example to some form of the Novikov conjecture. First he plans to construct and investigate groups whose boundaries have rational cohomological dimension and covering dimension that are different. The phenomenon first was observed by Bestvina-Mess. While cohomology groups of the sphere at infinity have a relation to the Novikov conjecture, cohomology groups of the tangent sphere of a geodesic space are relevant to the Hilbert-Smith conjecture. These two spheres are connected by a map, called the geodesic contruction map. It turns out that the geodesic contruction map can raise dimension even in the case of Coxeter groups. That phenomenon is relevant to the old problem in Group Theory: Does geometric dimension of a group coincide with the cohomological dimension? The corresponding problem for topological spaces was solved negatively by the investigator. One of the most basic of topological properties is the notion of dimension. For very common spaces such as spheres and planes, the dimension is clear. However, when one attempts to formulate a general definition that will apply to a much wider class of spaces, some of them quite complicated, the ""obvious"" notion of dimension turns out to be elusive. In fact some spaces, the so-called fractal spaces, have a natural dimension that is not even a whole number. One is left with several alternative definitions, all of which agree for uncomplicated spaces, but which may differ in general. To understand the notion of dimension fully, one should understand when the differen t definitions can be expected to agree and when they may not. The investigator is exploring several of the outstanding conjectures and problems along these lines. ***"

One of its goals is to express some classical index theorems, especially those involving the Euler and signature operators, as homotopy theoretic statements, and then to study the higher-order information provided by this reinterpretation. The researchers are also investigating geometric questions about surfaces in four-dimensional manifolds, as well as algebraic issues surrounding the action of permutation groups on the homology of configuration spaces. Finally, they are working towards a classification of p-compact groups (i.e. ""homotopy Lie groups"") as well as towards a more complete understanding of how topology and number theory are mixed together by the constructions of algebraic K-theory. The general theme of the project is the study of some remarkable and exciting connections between geometry (the science of topological spaces, that is, of higher-dimensional shapes) and algebra (the science of equations and numbers). The connections go both ways. For instance, deciding whether or not it is possible to use the methods of calculus on a particular topological space turns out to involve solving some fairly subtle equations. On the other hand, the collection of all solutions to an equation can often be assembled in one way or another into a topological space. The investigators are looking at some particular aspects of the interplay between geometry and algebra, and they expect that taking a dual point of view will lead to major advances in both areas. ***"

Cappell. He will be investigating the problem of fitting a boundary onto a stratified space with a tame end. He will also be using these to attack the Quinn Rigidity Conjecture (ICM, 1986). He wishes to take the new ""continuous control"" K-theory and use it to create a Surgery theory which is adapted to these problems. He is also including 4-dimensional smooth manifolds in his project (Gauge Theory). In this project Connolly will be attempting to show that: Arithmetic Groups are Topologically Rigid. In less epigrammatic terms, this means that the extreme symmetry exhibited by some of the fundamental geometries of nature (these geometries are called Locally Symmetric Spaces by mathematicians and physicists), should eventually be shown to be based on purely topological properties of their fundamental groups. In highly oversimplified terms, it means that anything that is vaguely like a torus (or a Klein bottle) should be topologically equivalent to a torus (or a Klein bottle). An example of a topological equivalence is given by a circle and ellipse; they are not congruent figures in the sense of Euclidean geometry, but they are topologically equivalent, because a little stretching of the one produces the other. ***"
