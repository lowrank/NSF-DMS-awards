One is to work on and<br/>eventually prove the following conjecture of Deligne: There exists the<br/>(natural) structure of an algebra over a chain operad of the little<br/>disks operad on the Hochschild complex of any associative algebra.<br/>The other objective is to study holomorphic line bundles over the<br/>moduli space of algebraic curves with a holomorphic disk and prove the<br/>analogue of Borel-Weil-Bott Theorem for this space, considered as<br/>homogeneous space for the Virasoro algebra.  The significance of the<br/>project on Deligne's Conjecture consists in studying presumably deep<br/>connections between one complex variable and associative algebras.<br/>The proof of Deligne's Conjecture will also further simplify the proof<br/>of the existence of a deformation quantization of a Poisson manifold,<br/>originally proved by Kontsevich and simplified by Tamarkin.  The<br/>completion of the Borel-Weil-Bott part of the project will establish<br/>important relationship between the geometry of the moduli space and<br/>the representation theory of the Virasoro algebra.<br/>     The structure of an algebra over a chain operad indicates, usually<br/>explicitly, the presence of a ``homotopy something'' algebra, an<br/>algebra with certain identities, such as associativity, satisfied in<br/>only an approximate way known as ``up to homotopy.''  Such structures<br/>have been used by Stasheff and May in their study of loop spaces,<br/>Beilinson and Ginzburg and Hinich and Schechtman in the study of<br/>deformation theory of algebraic varieties and vector bundles over<br/>them, and by Kontsevich toward knot invariants.  Witten and Zwiebach<br/>have effectively used the homotopy Lie structure in string theory.<br/>Deligne's Conjecture may be reformulated as the existence of a certain<br/>string theory associated to every associative algebra.  Thus, the<br/>proof of the conjecture will create ground for considerable progress<br/>in studying applications of algebra to geometry and theoretical<br/>physics.  The significance of the moduli space part of the project is<br/>in extending the fundamental relationship between the geometry of a<br/>homogeneous space and the representation theory of a semisimple Lie<br/>group to the case of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces and the<br/>Virasoro algebra, respectively.  As in the classical case, the<br/>completion of this project would contribute mutually to the two<br/>subjects: the geometry of the moduli space and the representation<br/>theory of the Virasoro algebra.  Both subjects are much more<br/>complicated and less studied than those in the classical situation.<br/>The project aims to advance the general understanding of each.  In<br/>general, the study of the geometry and topology of moduli spaces has<br/>recently become very important, as moduli spaces play now a<br/>significant role in four-dimensional topology (Donaldson and<br/>Seiberg-Witten invariants), knot theory (Vassiliev invariants),<br/>higher-dimensional topology (Gromov-Witten invariants), and<br/>deformation quantization (Kontsevich's quantization of Poisson<br/>manifolds).  Moreover, although moduli spaces have been classical<br/>objects of algebraic geometry (since the seminal work of P. Deligne<br/>and D. Mumford), their topology has not been understood yet and has<br/>presented a challenge for algebraic geometers for the last twenty<br/>years.  Thus unraveling the topology of moduli spaces seems to be very<br/>important for progress in both topology and geometry.<br/>***<br/><br/>"

Stern<br/><br/>Abstract:<br/>The recent constructions of smooth 4 dimensional manifolds by the PI and R. Fintushel have shown out that there are many more smooth 4-manifolds than previously expected. These examples also indicate that the current technologies, i.e. the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants, are insufficient to provide a classification of smooth 4-manifolds. The goal of this research is to develop new constructions of smooth 4 manifolds in the hope that a general picture begins to emerge.  To begin, there is a conjectured classification (up to blow-up) of (simply-connected) symplectic 4-manifolds; namely they are the fiber sums of holomorphic Lefschetz pencils along holomorphic submanifolds. Surprisingly, most of the new constructions of symplectic 4-manifolds can be shown to be obtained in this manner. The veracity of this conjecture will be the focus of the first part of this proposed research. A very effective method, introduced by the PI and R. Fintushel, which retains the homeomorphism type of a smooth 4-manifold X which contains a homologically essential torus with trivial normal bundle but alters its diffeomorphism type is the ""knot surgery construction"". Here, given a knot K in the 3-sphere, there results a 4-manifold X(K) homeomorphic to X with the following properties: 1) X(unknot)=X, and  2) if X(K) is diffeomorphic to X(J), then the Alexander polynomials of J and K are the same. The second part of this proposal is to better understand the role that the isotopy classes of knots play in this knot construction.   <br/><br/>With time included, our world is four dimensional, but the large-scale structure of our four-dimensional space is still unknown. The underlying mathematical issue is to provide a complete list of four-dimensional manifolds; i.e. objects which are locally modeled on Euclidean 4-space. This turns out to be an important unsolved problem in mathematics. Strangely enough, manifolds of dimension larger than 4 are very well understood; yet it is the dimension in which we live and operate that provides major mathematical challenges. Using difficult techniques from analysis, geometry, and topology, the PI and R. Fintushel have developed surgery techniques and workable topological strategies for counting solutions to differential equations (the Yang-Mills and Seiberg Witten equations) which effectively distinguish four-dimensional manifolds. Prior NSF supported research allowed for the construction of an unexpectedly large number of four-manifolds which provided counterexamples to all the conjecture classification schemes. This project will more closely examine these techniques and create new constructions in the hope that a general picture begins to emerge.  <br/>"

Canary    <br/><br/>Abstract:    Professor Canary proposes to study deformation spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. In his first project, he will will study the global topology of the space AH(M) of hyperbolic 3-manifolds homotopy  equivalent to a fixed compact 3-manifold M.  The components of its interior are enumerated by topological data and each component is parameterized by analytic data. In the case that M has incompressible boundary, Anderson, Canary and McCullough have given a complete characterization of when two components of the interior have intersecting closures. Canary proposes to further investigate the topology of the intersection locus and thus develop a better understanding of the space. This study of AH(M) is analogous,  via the Sullivan dictionary, to the study of the Mandelbrot set in  complex dynamics. Canary also proposes to study boundaries of quasiconformal deformation spaces of geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifolds, as well as the structure of arbitrary geometric limits of surface groups.  <br/><br/>Canary studies the relationship between the topology and the geometry of a 3-manifold. A 3-manifold is a mathematical space such that about any point there is a region which looks like a region in 3-dimensional space. A Riemannian metric is a way of measuring distances and angles in a 3-manifold. Once one has a Riemannian metric on a manifold one can talk about its geometry.  For example, the world we live in is a 3-manifold with a Riemannian metric. A hyperbolic metric is an especially nice type of Riemannian metric, which has been extensively studied by topologists and geometers since it was first discovered in the nineteenth century. Recently, physicists have been discussing models for the geometry of our universe which have hyperbolic metrics. The choice of metric for one's model of the universe is related to the issue of whether our universe is expanding or contracting. Much of Canary's research involves the study of spaces of different hyperbolic metrics on the same topological manifold.  <br/>"

Birman<br/><br/>We propose to investigate several problems relating to knots and to3-manifolds:  (1) We hope to find new invariants of Legendrian and transverse knots in 3-space, using the standard contact structure.  Every transverse knot can be represented as a closed braid, and we begin by seeking an appropriate modification of the classical Markov theorem for transverse knots.  We hope to extend the work of Eliashberg and Fraser, which shows that transverse knots are determined by their knot type and Bennequin number, to a wider class of knots. After that we hope to study knots for which we conjecture that their theorem fails.  We have candidates.   (2) We propose to study the complexity of the problem of recognizing the unknot algorithmically. We conjecture the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm. (3) We propose to study invariants of Heegaard splittings of closed, orientable 3-manifolds which arise through representations of the mapping class group of a surface onto various(initially  finite) groups.  One such collection of groups arises through the work of Wright and the related work of Masbaum on the Reshitikhan-Turaev representations of the mapping class group.   <br/><br/>The planet earth is an example of a 2-dimensional manifold.   If you stand at any 2 points on the earth (which, to a mathematician, is to be thought of as having no geographical features and being perfectly round and smooth), then your surroundings look identical at the 2 points, and give you no hint of the global topology.  A major leap in thinking about the earth occurred when it was learned that in fact the earth is round, i.e. it is a 2-dimensional manifold, in particular it is a 2-sphere.  But if we add one more dimension, we are in the position of people before Columbus made his discovery:  A `neighborhood of one point looks just like a neighborhood of another, and we have no idea of the global picture.  All we know is that the world is a 3-dimensional manifold.  It could be a3-dimensional sphere, but there are many other possibilities too, and the existence of black holes suggests a very complicated structure.  The work is this proposal studies the most accessible examples of 3-dimensionalmanifolds, namely the space which remains when one removes a knotted circle from a 3-dimensional sphere.  Knots are incredibly complicated objects, and understanding them is very basic to 3-manifold geometry and topology.  By finding ways to recognize individual knots algorithmically, and by finding partial ways to tell them apart, mathematicians gain insight into deep questions about topology.  We will also study other3-dimensional manifolds by cutting them apart into two handlebodies which are pasted together along a so-called Heegaard surface.<br/>"

That is, the basic building blocks are considered<br/>up to ambient isotopy (not homotopy or homology).  For example, one<br/>starts from knots in 3-manifolds, surfaces in 4-manifolds, etc.  This<br/>is a far-reaching program.  Until now, one has been limited to 3-manifolds,<br/>with only a glance towards 4-manifolds.  The principal objects of the<br/>theory are skein modules.  One of the simplest skein modules is a<br/>quantization of the first homology group of a manifold.  In general,<br/>skein modules of 3-manifolds are quotients of free modules over ambient<br/>isotopy classes of links by properly chosen local (skein) relations.<br/>The situation is somewhat reminiscent of that of ``classical'' algebraic<br/>topology 100 years ago (before Poincare's fundamental paper ``Analysis<br/>Situs,'' in 1895.  Even three years ago one was able to compute only a<br/>few isolated examples, with the hope that the theory would rise in the<br/>future to a beautiful and powerful theory (the only exception was the<br/>Turaev-Przytycki construction of the Hopf algebra on the third skein<br/>module of the product of a surface and the interval).  The situation<br/>has started to change in the last three years, and most of the progress<br/>concerns the Kauffman bracket skein module and its relation to character<br/>varieties of the fundamental group of a 3-manifold and the hyperbolic<br/>structure on a manifold.<br/>     Topology, as foreseen by Leibniz in 1679, is the art of analyzing<br/>geometrical figures taking into account their position only; it does not<br/>take magnitudes into consideration (Leibniz called this art ``geometry<br/>situs'').  In more modern language, topology describes spaces up to<br/>stretching and bending (but cutting and pasting is not allowed).  Because<br/>of their flexibility, topological spaces are hard to analyze.  In his<br/>fundamental paper of 1895, Analysis Situs, Henri Poincare associated<br/>topological spaces with algebraic objects that are invariant under space<br/>deformation (he called his objects homology and homotopy groups).  The<br/>field of algebraic topology arose from the work of Poincare.  Knot theory<br/>is the oldest branch of topology, first considered by A. Vandermonde in<br/>1771.  It studies the position of a circle (say a piece of rope with ends<br/>glued together) in space.  Knot theory also has its roots in physics.<br/>W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) proposed, in 1867, a theory of vortex atoms:<br/>that atoms were knotted tubes of ether.  It was an aim of his friend P.G.<br/>Tait to describe the physical and chemical properties of particles in<br/>terms of the properties of related knots.  Although the vortex theory<br/>was soon rejected, knot theory quickly developed to become an independent<br/>branch of topology.  By the 1970's, some thought knot theory was out ot<br/>steam.  Thus it came as a surprise when in 1984 Vaughan Jones discovered<br/>new algebraic invariants of knots (i.e., Jones polynomials).  Jones'<br/>work was a breakthrough, providing solutions to old conjectures.  In the<br/>same spirit as Leibniz, one would call the branch of mathematics that has<br/>its roots in Jones' construction, and Drinfeld's work on quantum groups,<br/>``algebra situs.''  It encompasses the theory of quantum invariants of<br/>knots and 3-manifolds, algebraic topology based on knots, q-deformations,<br/>quantum groups, and overlaps with algebraic geometry, non-commutative<br/>geometry, and statistical mechanics.<br/>***<br/><br/>"

This is a topic of intrinsic interest, which Culler and Shalen believe is also related to some of the most difficult unsolved problems in 3-manifold theory.  Their program for applying results about essential surfaces in knot exteriors to 3-manifold theory have led Culler and Shalen to a number of questions about the character variety of a hyperbolic knot group, which they propose to work on.  These ideas also lead to an approach to the very broad problem of giving a quantitative version of Thurston's Dehn surgery theorem; this can be seen as the problem underlying most of the existent work on Dehn surgery.  The character variety has a distinguished 1-dimensional irreducible component X which is the one that contains the character of the representation that determines the hyperbolic structure on the knot. One question which will be addressed by Culler and Shalen is that of determining properties that distinguish surfaces associated to ideal points of the main component of the character variety from other essential surfaces in the knot exterior.  Another question involves the relationship between the hyperbolic volume of the knot complement and properties of a certain factor of the A-polynomial, this factor being the defining equation of a plane curve closely related to X.  There is a general notion of hyperbolic volume which applies to a representation whose character lies on X.  A third question is that of understanding what properties of an essential surface associated to an ideal point of X guarantee that this generalized volume tends to 0 at the ideal point.  Yet another relevant question is that of understanding how often it happens that the curve X is invariant under complex conjugation, and what it means, in terms of the topology of the 3-manfiold, for this to  happen.  In a somewhat different direction, Culler and Shalen have developed methods for relating the boundary slopes and the genera of essential surfaces in certain situations.  They are proposing to develop extensions of this theory.  Their techniques in this area may be relevant to the general question of whether every knot in a homotopy sphere has at least one nonzero integer boundary slope.<br/><br/>A fundamental problem in many areas of mathematics is to classify all examples of a certain type of mathematical object.  The objects of study in this proposal are 3-manifolds, which are mathematical models of 3-dimensional spaces.  Since our universe is a 3-dimensional space, the classification of 3-manifolds is directly related to our understanding of nature itself.  The classification problem for 3-manifolds is far from solved, but the work of many mathematicians over the last 20 years has at least produced a conjectural answer.  The work supported by this problem forms part of the effort to verify the conjectured geometric classification of 3-manifolds.  <br/>"

The ancient Greeks<br/>understood symmetries of Platonic solids, e.g., a cube or a<br/>dodecahedron.  Platonic solids are positively curved, and they have a<br/>finite number of symmetries.  At the opposite end of the spectrum are<br/>negatively curved objects, such as the Lobachevsky hyperbolic plane<br/>(featured frequently in Escher paintings), and these typically have<br/>infinitely many symmetries.  Consequently, the structure of these<br/>symmetries is both more interesting and harder to understand.  The<br/>symmetries of an object form a ``group.''  One way to measure the<br/>``size'' of a group, even when the group is infinite, is to talk about<br/>its ``dimension.''  For example, the dimension of the group of<br/>symmetries of the hyperbolic plane, depicted in the Escher drawing<br/>mentioned above, is two, reflecting the nature of the plane.  In<br/>general, the concept of dimension depends on the background choice of<br/>numbering system (coefficient ring).  The project will study this<br/>dependence.  Yet another part of the project is the study of polygons.<br/>These seemingly simple objects in the Euclidean plane and space become<br/>increasingly more complex as one considers more complicated spaces.

A Euclidean triangle is<br/>determined by its three side-lengths.  To construct such a triangle it<br/>is enough to satisfy three ``triangle inequalities.''  These properties<br/>no longer hold in more general spaces, which makes study of polygons<br/>there much more interesting and complicated.<br/>***<br/><br/>"

Gordon  <br/><br/>Abstract: The focus of Professor Gordon's project is the study of Dehn filling on 3-manifolds, and in particular the program to obtain the optimal bounds on the distances between the various kinds of non-hyperbolic fillings on hyperbolic manifolds.  Many of these bounds are now known,   the only remaining cases being (1) reducible fillings on complements  of (hyperbolic) knots in the 3-sphere; (2) toroidal fillings on knots  in lens spaces; and (3) the case where one of the fillings is a small Seifert fiber space.  Professor Gordon will continue to investigate these questions, as well as other problems concerning Dehn fillings.  A special effort will be made to attack the Cabling Conjecture, which asserts that no fillings of type (1) above exist.   <br/><br/>The area of mathematics which forms the context of Professor Gordon's project is 3-dimensional topology, the general goal of which is to understand the structure of 3-manifolds. These are objects that are locally like ordinary 3-dimensional space, but whose global structure may be quite complicated.  Since we live in a 3-manifold, one might say that 3-dimensional topology aims to describe what the mathematical possibilities are for our spatial universe.  This aim is still not realized, although there is tantalizing evidence that such a description might ultimately be possible.  One very interesting application of the mathematical theory of 3-dimensional manifolds is the ""circles in the sky"" project, in which, in two years' time, certain observations will be made from a satellite, on the basis of which an attempt will be made to mathematically determine the geometric structure of the universe.   An important aspect of 3-dimensional topology is the theory of knots - a knot being a closed loop embedded in some tangled fashion in 3-dimensional space - and one of the main ways in which knot theory relates to the general theory of 3-manifolds is through Dehn surgery, a process in which a solid tube around a knot is removed from space and sewn back in differently, giving a new 3-manifold.  Much effort has been devoted over the last few years to investigating this construction.  Although the impetus for this effort is the desire to further our understanding of 3-dimensional topology, it is interesting to note that a theorem about Dehn surgery, the Cyclic Surgery Theorem, has recently been used to determine the topological action of  certain enzymes on strands of DNA.  <br/>"

In Kleinian groups Minsky plans to continue work on Thurston's Ending LaminationConjecture, which states that a hyperbolic 3-manifold is uniquely determined by its topological type and a list of invariants that describe the asymptotic geometry of its ends.  Consequences of this conjecture are a rigidity theorem for Kleinian group actions on the sphere, and a description of parameter spaces of isomorphic Kleinian groups.  In collaboration with H. Masur and B. Farb, Minsky plans to consider the question of quasi-isometric rigidity of the mapping class group of a surface, which says that all quasi-isometries of this group must in fact respect its group structure up to a bounded error.  A common tool to both sets of questions is the ""complex of curves"" on a surface, which is a simplicial complex encoding the combinatorial structure of the set of isotopy classes of simple curves on the surface. Masur and Minsky have previously established a hyperbolicity property for this complex, with applications to the conjugacy problem for mapping class groups.  Minsky has found explicit connections between geometric properties of this complex and those of Kleinian representations of surface groups, and this work should have applications to the ending lamination problem. Jointly with R. Canary and J. Brock, he will also investigate the structure of geometric limits of Kleinian groups, which can be quite intricate. A good description of the set of all geometric limits is an important tool for obtaining uniform estimates on individual groups.<br/><br/>The interactions between geometry, topology and dynamics have been a beautiful and powerful feature of mathematics and physics for more than a hundred years. Dynamics is the study of time-evolution of mathematical or physical systems, whereas geometry and topology involve ""static"" objects such as surfaces or higher-dimensional analogues, often the background for a dynamical process.  Henri Poincare already knew that the standard round sphere, the setting of classical analysis and geometry, functioned also as a ""horizon at infinity"" for an exotic non-Euclidean geometry that we now call Hyperbolic space. Dynamical properties of transformations of the sphere translate to geometric properties of rigid motions of this space, and give rise to families of symmetric tilings whose structure we can study by geometric and topological methods.  The complexity of these systems can constrain them so much that a combinatorial (or topological) description suffices to determine them uniquely, and this is what we call rigidity. This phenomenon occurs in many guises throughout geometry and dynamics, and is relevant to issues such as classification of systems, mapping out regions of stability and instability, deformation and bifurcation of families of systems, and probabilistic properties such as ergodicity, all of which have significance in both pure and applied mathematics.  The particular aspects studied in this project are typical in some ways and special in others.  A better understanding of them promises to shed light on other parts of the field, both by way of examples and by the formulation of organizing principles.<br/>"

Bruce Hughes<br/><br/>Abstract: This project applies techniques from controlled topology to solve problems in three broad areas: stratified spaces, nonpositively curved manifolds, and ends of complexes.  An important tool developed previously by the principal investigator is the theory of manifold approximate fibrations.  It will be used to attack several problems.  A stratification presents a decomposition of the space into manifold pieces. Since the space need not be a manifold itself, geometric methods cannot be applied until it is understood how the manifold pieces fit together.  One of the most important aspects of this project is the uncovering of the geometric structure used to join together the manifold pieces. This structure is not only subject to classification and quantification, but can also be applied for the development of new geometric tools for studying stratified spaces. The structure on the neighborhoods of the strata is a bundle theory, namely manifold stratified approximate fibrations, in the category of controlled topology. Thus, controlled topology becomes the vehicle for transforming and applying classical manifold techniques to study these more intricate manifolds with singularities.  In addition to stratified spaces, both manifolds of nonpositive curvature and ends of complexes lead to controlled topology and approximate fibrations. The geometry of nonpositively curved manifolds give boundedness in their universal covers which can then be converted into controlled information. Ends of complexes lead to obstructions for the existence of approximate fibrations near infinity. This is then related to the topology of stratified spaces near the singularities.<br/><br/>Topology's ultimate goal is to classify manifolds, the spaces which are locally homeomorphic to euclidean spaces.  Controlled topology has become the most powerful new technique toward achieving this goal regarding high-dimensional manifolds since the development of surgery theory.  Even more dramatically, controlled topology is showing its full force in the study of stratified spaces, or manifolds with singularities.  In controlled topology, the objects of study come equipped with a map to a metric space, called the control space. The classical topics of topology (e.g., homotopy equivalences, h-cobordisms, and ends) are studied with sizing estimates measured in the control space (so that classical topology is recovered when the control space is a point).  Problems in many different areas of mathematics lead to questions about manifolds with singularities. It is expected that the research proposed here will give new and useful tools for dealing with such spaces.<br/>"

In this way, group-theoretic problems are translated into geometric problems and all the techniques of geometry can then be utilized.  A standard technique in geometry is to study the asymptotics of a space by compactifying it - i.e.  putting a boundary on the space.  Word hyperbolic groups are a class of groups for which this idea has proven to be incredibly useful.  This is a class of groups obtained by assuming a negative curvature condition on the geometry.  It is currently of interest to extend this well-developed theory of word hyperbolic groups to the ``nonpositively curved'' setting.  There have been several proposed classes of nonpositively curved groups.  One such class consists of groups that arise as a set of rigid motions of a CAT(0) space, groups referred to here as ``CAT(0) groups"".  The boundary of a CAT(0) space on which group G acts as well as the action of G on this boundary will be the main objects of interest in this proposal.  For word hyperbolic groups, studying the boundary and the action of the group on the boundary has yielded many theorems about the group.  Many of the theorems that hold in that setting should have generalizations to the nonpositively curved setting and that is the point of view taken here.  It is already known that replacing the phrase ""word hyperbolic"" with CAT(0) in many of these theorems is not going to work, but finding the correct theorems is an important step in unifying the theory of nonpositively curved groups much like the theory of nonpositively curved manifolds.  The dynamics of the action of a CAT(0)group on the boundary of the space has hardly been used to answer any questions from the geometric group theory point of view.  Questions about the group and subgroups of the group should translate into questions about this action, much like in the word hyperbolic setting.<br/><br/>A group is one of the most fundamental objects in mathematics.  The set of whole numbers under addition is an example of a group that everyone is familiar with.  Also, the set of rigid motions of a geometric object forms a group and in fact, the mathematical properties of this group often characterize the geometric object.  For example, knots are geometric objects which have recently seen beautiful applications in the study of DNA since the strands of DNA in our body are often knotted.  Being able to tell the difference between two different knots is an important idea in these applications.  There is a natural group associated to a knot which completely determines the knot.  These knot groups are groups of the type we are interested in here.<br/>"

The Dynamical  Systems session will include the application of tools from continuum  theory to this subject.  A goal of the session on Topological Groups is  to discuss the new methods in this area used in solving problems in  functional analysis and stochastic processes.  Topological vector spaces  and rings of continuous functions will be the principal areas of the  Topological Algebraic Structures session.  The fifth special session,  Asymmetric Topology/Topology and Computer Science, will be devoted mostly  to applications of techniques from topology to computer science.  Talks  in this session will be on such topics as domain theory and semantics of  programming languages, and digital topology and computer visualization.   In addition to the special sessions two workshops will be given.  The  Dynamics and Topology of Entire Functions workshop will describe how  Cantor bouquets, indecomposable continua, explosion points, and a  topological kneading invariant play a principal role in determining the  dynamics of certain maps, while the workshop on Topological Groups will  discuss projective limits and balanced groups.  <br/><br/>The Summer Conference series on General Topology and its Applications began in 1984 at the City College of New York with 35 participants and 13 talks; the 13th such Conference, in Mexico City, June 1998, was the third held abroad; it had about 150 participants from across the United States and 27 other countries, and featured 110 talks. The reason for this growth is in the recent history of general topology. This field studies generalized shapes and limits, and was developed to solve problems elsewhere in mathematics. After a time of concentration on problems internal to it, the emphasis in topology is again turning toward applications to other areas. Almost half our invited speakers work outside topology, but apply it; so participants gain new research ideas and connections between other fields and topology.  Here is an  example relating topology and computer science: Exact computation of real  numbers is impossible as long as only finite amounts of information can  be stored. But using topology the set of real numbers and some other such  important examples can be shown to have ""approximation models"" that allow  arbitrarily accurate computation of their elements, an essential for all  sensitive calculations such as those used for weather prediction and  space flight.  Joint work by Conference participants, including some  which took place at our Conferences, led to proof that an object has an  approximation model precisely if it is a ""Polish space"". This is  particularly satisfying since Polish spaces are among the first objects  discovered by topologists, and have been studied for almost a century<br/>"

Wise<br/><br/>Abstract:  <br/><br/>The investigator will study the relationship between negative curvature and residual finiteness. The former is a geometric property which has a substantial impact on topology, and the latter is a purely algebraic property. However, the investigator has recently developed a surprising connection between these seemingly unrelated notions. The investigator will show that in many important cases, negatively curved spaces have residually finite fundamental groups. Similar methods will often yield the more dramatic result that quasiconvex subgroups are separable in the profinite topology. One important consequence of this work will be to demonstrate that certain hyperbolic link complements have the property that their immersed incompressible surfaces lift to embeddings in finite covers. A fundamental problem in topology is to classify the different types of 3-manifolds. When a 3-manifold contains an embedded incompressible surface, this classification can be achieved. More generally, if a 3-manifold has a finite cover containing an embedded surface, then this classification can be achieved. Residual finiteness and the related property of separability, are crucial ingredients needed to produce these finite covers. The aim of this project is to add these ingredients to the arsenal of low-dimensional topologists and geometers.  <br/><br/>Nearly all scientific thought concerns itself with discovering and understanding patterns. Symmetry is one of the most fundamental types of patterns. The study of symmetry ranges from the Platonic solids of the ancient Greeks to the groups occurring in modern particle physics.  A ""group"" is the complete set of symmetries of a geometric object. The symmetries of the object help us to understand its shape and nature.  For example, a ball has infinitely many symmetries, belonging to two classes: ""rotational"" symmetries, obtained by rotating the ball through any axis running through its center (just as our earth is now rotating), and ""bilateral"" symmetries, obtained by reflecting the ball through planes passing through its center (the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth are interchanged when we reflect through the equatorial plane). The easiest groups of symmetries to understand are finite groups of symmetries, such as the group of eight symmetries of a square. Sometimes an infinite group can be `collapsed' into a finite group. This collapse is similar to the projection of a shadow, and by examining enough of these shadows, one can glean information about the original infinite group. The investigator will study various infinite groups of symmetries that arise in conjunction with certain topological and geometric objects (3-manifolds and negatively curved spaces), which have recently been the focus of major study. The investigator will demonstrate that these infinite groups have sufficiently many finite shadows. This will elucidate the structure of these infinite groups and in turn will lead to a better understanding of the original geometric objects.         <br/>"

This is a major piece of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, which states that the interior of every compact 3-manifold has a canonical decomposition into geometric pieces.  Previous work of the investigator and his collaborators has reduced the conjecture to a difficult problem (proving conformality) about recursive tilings of the 2-sphere. The recursive structures of the tilings come from subdivision rules. From a subdivision rule one can define a branched surface and a self-map of this branched surface. A major aim is to prove that conformality of a tiling family is equivalent to the existence of a fixed point on the induced map of the Teichmueller space of the branched surface, and then to understand when this map has a fixed point. In the special case that the branched surface is a 2-sphere, this is essentially what is done in proving Thurston's classification theorem for critically finite branched maps of the 2-sphere. A second aim is to understand further this connection between conformal subdivision rules and rational maps. A third aim is to develop the theory of twisted face pairing 3-manifolds. This theory arose as a source of examples for testing the conjecture, but it has other potential applications in geometric group theory and 3-manifold topology.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with recursive families of tilings of the plane and the 2-sphere. Each family is determined by an initial tiling and a subdivision rule which are encoded by a finite amount of combinatorial information. A key problem is to determine when the limiting tiles, which may have fractal boundaries, stay ""almost round"". In special cases these families of tilings correspond to rational maps (quotients of polynomials with complex coefficients) on the 2-sphere. Through this correspondence, work of Thurston on the topological classification of rational maps suggests a promising approach to answering this problem. A principal aim of the project is to follow this approach to completion. If successful, the project would be a major step in proving Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, which states that 3-dimensional spaces (more precisely, compact 3-manifolds) can be naturally decomposed into geometric pieces.

Goodwillie and M. Weiss) to study the unstable<br/>homotopy of such spaces as spheres and classifying spaces of compact<br/>Lie groups.  Calculus of functors allows one to introduce certain<br/>``derivatives'' of homotopy groups.  If one understands these<br/>derivatives well, one can use them to recover a lot of information<br/>about unstable homotopy theory (this is analogous to the fact that if<br/>one knows all the derivatives of an ordinary function at a point, one<br/>can often recover a lot of information about the function by means of<br/>Taylor series).  The derivatives are really objects of stable homotopy<br/>theory, and they normally come equipped with interesting symmetries of<br/>certain classical groups, such as the symmetric or orthogonal groups<br/>(division by the action of the symmetric group corresponds to division<br/>by n! in ordinary Taylor series).  Thus calculus allows one to reduce<br/>questions about unstable homotopy theory to questions about<br/>equivariant stable homotopy theory.  This does not yield an effective<br/>method for calculating homotopy groups (there probably is no such<br/>method), but it does allow one to make interesting qualitative<br/>statements about the global structure of homotopy theory.  Analyzing<br/>the derivatives of different objects, together with the accompanying<br/>symmetries, has been the focus of much of Arone's work.  These<br/>derivatives seem to be very interesting objects on their own, and<br/>studying them involves combining methods from stable homotopy theory,<br/>equivariant topology, and group cohomology in fresh and unexpected<br/>ways.<br/>     Many basic questions in mathematics, and in topology, in particular,<br/>are of the following form: given two objects, describe the possible<br/>functions between them.  For instance, one can ask to describe the<br/>space of continuous maps between two topological spaces, or the space<br/>of embeddings of a circle into some physical space (this is informally<br/>known as the space of ``knots'').  These questions are usually very<br/>difficult.  This is so because the dependence of the space of<br/>functions on the source and the target is very complicated.<br/>Informally, one could say that the space of functions is a complicated<br/>function of two variables.  It turns out that, in analogy to ordinary<br/>differential calculus, one can develop a theory of ``Taylor series''<br/>of sorts for this kind of function and use it to approximate<br/>complicated spaces such as function spaces by simpler spaces, in<br/>much the same way as an ordinary function can be approximated by its<br/>Taylor polynomials.  This very striking idea was conceived by<br/>T. Goodwillie.  Much of Arone's work has focused on understanding the<br/>``Taylor polynomials'' and the ``Derivatives'' in this context.  This<br/>has proved to be a fascinating and rewarding journey, which has<br/>already led to interesting new results in (algebraic) topology.  Some<br/>of the results are of such a universal nature that there is at least a<br/>slight hope that this work will have an impact on mathematics outside<br/>hardcore algebraic topology.<br/>***<br/><br/>"

Perverse sheaves are a part of algebraic<br/>topology that is about twenty years old.  They have been applied with great<br/>success to the study of complex algebraic singularities.  Perhaps the most<br/>notable applications have been to spaces and stratifications related to<br/>algebraic groups, yielding new insights in representation theory.  Over the<br/>next two years, M. Grinberg will work on four research projects whose<br/>common goal is to develop the computational techniques of the subject.<br/>Specifically, the focus is on computing microlocal invariants of sheaves<br/>and stratifications and on computing with nearby cycles sheaves, in the<br/>presence of symmetry.  The first problem is to understand the microlocal<br/>geometry of the nilcone in a complex semisimple Lie algebra.  The second<br/>is to study the geometry of the enveloping semigroup of a semisimple group,<br/>recently introduced by E. Vinberg.  The third project is to explore possible<br/>applications of quasi-conical symmetry to the microlocal study of<br/>stratifications.  The last project, joint with D. Kazhdan, is to study the<br/>space of formal arcs of finite codimension in a singular variety.  The<br/>common theme throughout this work is to learn to extract the key topological<br/>invariants of the singular spaces and maps that arise in the study of<br/>algebraic groups, their representations, and invariants.<br/>     Loosely speaking, the theory of perverse sheaves is a systematic way<br/>to exploit the fact that, for a singular space defined over the complex<br/>numbers, the real and the imaginary directions contribute to the topology<br/>in dual ways.  This theory is a part of algebraic topology: a branch of<br/>mathematics concerned with the properties of higher dimensional spaces<br/>that are preserved under continuous deformations.  Most applications of<br/>algebraic topology are based on the following key idea: to consider all<br/>objects of a certain kind as points in a single ``configuration space''<br/>(sometimes called a ``parameter space'' or a ``phase space'').  For example,<br/>all possible states of a mechanical system, or all possible situations in an<br/>economic game (e.g., an auction) may be viewed as points of an appropriate<br/>configuration space.  The topological properties of this space may then be<br/>used to determine qualitative properties of the associated objects, such as<br/>whether the mechanical system will evolve towards a periodic motion, or<br/>whether the players in a game have optimal strategies.<br/>***<br/><br/>"

This is a useful step in<br/>trying to understand stable homotopy theory, since the decomposition is<br/>expressed in terms of simpler localizations.  In particular, the<br/>conjecture would generalize the very beautiful relationships known<br/>between the 0th, 1st, and 2nd chromatic levels.  Similarly, the<br/>``chromatic Segal conjecture'' (due in various forms to combinations of<br/>Mike Hopkins, Mark Mahowald, and Doug Ravenel) deals with a<br/>decomposition of the Tate cohomology of the localization of a finite<br/>CW-complex with respect to the nth Morava K-theory.  Again, this<br/>conjecture intertwines different chromatic levels in a beautiful way;<br/>together they give some techniques for inductively determining<br/>information about higher chromatic levels from lower ones (like<br/>rational homotopy theory and K-theory).  These conjectures both also<br/>give data about how the cohomology of the different Morava stabilizer<br/>groups are related.  The tool used to attack these conjectures is a<br/>spectral sequence based on ideas from work of Goerss that computes the<br/>BP-homology of various spectra involved in this calculation in terms<br/>of the derived functors of inverse limits of comodules over the Hopf<br/>algebroid of BP-operations.  Surprisingly, at least in the first<br/>interesting cases, the higher inverse limits seem to be tractable.<br/>     This research is concerned with understanding ``homotopy classes of<br/>functions.''  A simple example of the sort of problem studied is given<br/>by considering knot theory.  Take a ``knot'' in space to be a loop of<br/>string embedded in space in some way.  One is not really interested in<br/>*all* ways of embedding that loop of string; if one can get from one<br/>way of embedding the loop to another just by moving the string a<br/>little bit, one considers those two embeddings to be equivalent.<br/>Similarly, if one looks at all ways of putting a loop of string in the<br/>plane with the origin removed, one considers two ways the same if the<br/>loop of string is wound around the origin the same number of times.<br/>As the second example makes clear, it is critical to understand<br/>``holes'' in the space to which one is mapping, and how the space from<br/>which one is mapping interacts with those holes.  There are different<br/>sorts of holes, though; a circle has a hole one can pass something through,<br/>while a (hollow) sphere has a different sort of hole.  The ``holes''<br/>associated to a map (or to a space) can be sorted into different<br/>flavors (usually referred to as different chromatic components).<br/>These components do not appear to be independent for spaces and maps<br/>arising from geometric considerations, and the goal is to understand<br/>these dependencies.  Solutions to this sort of problem are potentially<br/>related to questions from geometry, but at the same time, surprisingly,<br/>to objects arising in number theory, something that gives this work far<br/>greater importance than would either aspect alone.<br/>***<br/>"

This work aims at computing the Gromov-Witten invariants of a symplectic manifold by decomposing it into two pieces. Such an operation will in general introduce orbifold singularities, so the establishment of Gromov-Witten invariants for symplectic manifolds with orbifold singularities will lay the foundation for a program of computing Gromov-Witten invariants, which has great potential applications in symplectic topology as well as other related fields such as birational geometry.  Other motivations come from mirror symmetry and string theory of theoretical physics, in which there is a demand to consider spaces with controlled singularities such as orbifold singularities. In the second part of this project the principal investigator will continue his work on the 3-dimensional Reeb dynamical systems by exploiting a potential connection between Seiberg-Witten Floer homology and the contact homology. The last part concerns symplectic structures on smooth 4-manifolds with vanishing second homotopy group. Currently very less is known about them. <br/><br/>In recent years, one has witnessed some great interactions between different branches of mathematics in the area of geometry and topology, with the input of ideas from theoretical physics. This project seeks to exploit the intimate interplay between these different fields to investigate some very interesting or fundamental questions in such areas as quantum cohomology, birational geometry, the existence of periodic orbits of Reeb dynamics on a 3-dimensional space, and symplectic 4-manifolds. The principal investigator believes that a successful outcome of this project will make a significant advancement of knowledge in the areas listed above, which are important not only within mathematics but also in real life problems. For example, the importance of Reeb dynamics is seen in the following example. The motion of a satellite in the presence of the gravitational forces of the sun, the planets and the moon is described mathematically as a Reeb dynamics. The relevant part of this project aims at solving the 20-year-old Weinstein conjecture for Reeb dynamical systems on a 3-dimensinal space, which is one of the most important conjectures in the field. <br/>"

Thistlethwaite will continue to investigate the rate of growth of the number of knots, following his collaboration with C. Sundberg, where the exact growth exponent was determined for prime, alternating links.  He will study optimal configurations of symmetric knots, and will investigate other geometric problems associated with knot complements, in particular hyperbolic knot complements containing essential4-punctured spheres.  He will investigate the possibility that hyperbolic geometry might be used to provide a new, completely geometric proof of the Tait flyping conjecture.  The knot tables will be extended well beyond the 1,701,936 knots currently listed, and these new tables will be used to search for interesting examples.  Development will continue on the freely available software package ""Knotscape"", which provides a graphical interface to the knot tables and access to many invariants.<br/><br/>Thistlethwaite's specialty is classical knot theory, a branch of 3-dimensional topology with origins in the nineteenth century.  A knot is a closed curve in 3-dimensional space; one can imagine a knotted rope with its ends joined together.  Two knots are considered to be equivalent if one can be deformed continuously to the other, and a knot is deemed to be trivial, or unknotted, if it is equivalent to a flat circle.  Knot theory is a rich subject, as it interfaces with geometry, topology, algebra and combinatorics.  In recent years it has aroused the interest of chemists and molecular biologists, particularlyin relation to the knotting of DNA. Knot theory abounds with problems which are simple to state, but hard to solve; for example, it is often difficult in practice to prove that two given knots are inequivalent, as it is hard to rule out the existence of some ingenious method of deforming one to the other.  It can even be hard to decide whether a given knot is trivial.  If a knot is laid down on a flat surface with as few crossovers as possible, the resulting number of crossovers is called the crossing-number of the knot.  To date, Thistlethwaite has classified by computer the 1,701,936 knots of up to 16 crossings; this classification was confirmed by an independent tabulation carried out by J. Hoste and J. Weeks.  As part of this project, he will extend the tables to 17 or 18 crossings, thereby expecting to find many new examples with exciting properties.  He will continue to investigate the fundamental problem as to how fast the number of knots grows in relation to crossing-number.  Thistlethwaite will use hyperbolic geometry, a form of non-Euclidean geometry, to investigate hidden symmetries of knots, and to determine the structure of alternating knots (a knot is alternating if it can be arranged so that the rope goes alternately over and under at successive crossings.)  He will continue to develop the software package ""Knotscape"", which provides a graphical interface to the knot tables.<br/>"

Applications to exceptional Dehn surgery,especially to the property P conjecture and the cabling conjecture will be explored. It is well known that all closed orientable 3-manifolds are interelated topologically through Dehn surgery on knots and links. This relation is nicely and deeply encoded algebraically in the SL(2,C)-character varieties of the involved knot or link complements. Studying the connections between the topology of 3-manifolds and their character varieties has been very successful in understanding 3-manifolds and their change under Dehn surgery. This project is a continuation of this line of investigation, with an eye to possible solutions of some outstanding conjectures.<br/><br/>3-manifold topology is a branch of mathematics in which we study and classify certain global structures of ""universes"" (called 3-manifolds by mathematicians). It is natural and compelling for human beings to understand 3-manifolds because we believe we live in one of them. Besides being interesting and beautiful in its own right, 3-manifold topology has profound connections and interactions with other branches of mathematics, and also with physics, chemistry, biology and computer science. It is one of most active and fertile research fields in modern mathematics. The current project aims at solving several fundamental problems in 3-manifold topology.<br/>"

The macroscopic view on unbounded metric spaces allows us to extract the essence of several important conjectures in modern mathematics. These conjectures are often called `The Novikov type conjectures', since the first in the list is the Novikov higher signatures conjecture. Among others conjectures of this type are the Baum-Connes conjecture, the Borel conjecture, the Gromov-Lawson positive scalar curvature conjecture, Zero-in-spectrum conjecture. Most of the above conjectures can be formulated in terms of the large-scale geometry of discrete groups. An asymptotic approach to investigation of metric spaces can be accomplished in rigorous frames of special category, called `Coarse category'.  There are parallels between the coarse category and the category of compact (metrizable) spaces. Partly this analogy is established by the Higson corona functor, partly this is due to Gromov's work on cultivating basics of dimension theory and of its dual, connectedness theory, in this new territory. One of the most difficult problems in the theory of compact spaces was the Alexandroff Problem about coincidence of geometric (Lebesgue's) and algebraic (cohomological) dimensions. The problem came from late 20s and it was completely solved only in late 80s by the PI. Suddenly Alexandroff Problem appeared to be important in the realm of coarse category. The corresponding equality for a discrete group would imply most of the above conjecture for that group.  <br/><br/>Thus a local technique of general topology such as dimension theory and absolute neighborhood retract theory can help to resolve problems of asymptotic (global) topology which in their turn would answer very important and difficult questions of `local mathematics'.<br/>           <br/><br/>"

A standard procedure in<br/>algebra is to study an algebraic object by studying its localizations at<br/>various primes, then reassembling the localizations into a global picture.<br/>In stable homotopy theory, one can localize at an ordinary integer prime p,<br/>but after doing so, more primes become visible.  These are known as Morava<br/>K-theories.  Denote the localization of a spectrum X with respect to the<br/>nth Morava K-theory K(n) by L(K(n))X.  Calculation of L(K(n))X can usually<br/>be reduced to a purely algebraic problem, but little is known about the<br/>reassembly of the L(K(n))X for different n into knowledge of X itself.  The<br/>chromatic splitting conjecture, due to Mike Hopkins, is a conjecture about<br/>the composition L(K(m))L(K(n))X for finite spectra X, and it would allow<br/>one to recover X from the different L(K(n))X.  The truth of this conjecture<br/>is known to have significant impact on several other conjectures in stable<br/>homotopy theory, and even partial results about it would be a major advance.<br/>One of the methods involved in the principal investigator's approach to this<br/>conjecture is the study of the derived functors of the inverse limit functor<br/>in a category of comodules.<br/>     Homotopy theory is the study of curves, surfaces, and higher dimensional<br/>spaces up to continuous deformation.  That is, in homotopy theory, the letter<br/>A and the letter O are considered equivalent, because one can gradually<br/>deform the letter A into a triangle by pushing in the legs, then gradually<br/>deform the triangle into a circle by pushing out on the corners.  A <br/>difficulty with homotopy theory is that different dimensions behave<br/>differently.  More precisely, given a space X, one can form its suspension<br/>by attaching it with wires to two points outside X.  The suspension of a<br/>circle, for example, is a sphere, and the suspension of a sphere is a sphere<br/>of the next higher dimension.  In stable homotopy theory, two spaces X and Y<br/>are considered equivalent if, after suspending X and Y repeatedly, one can<br/>be deformed into the other.  For example, the surface of a donut is obtained<br/>by attaching a sphere to two circles that touch at one point (one circle<br/>goes around the hole, one circle goes around the filling, and the surface of<br/>the sphere gets spread out over the rest of the surface of the donut).  But<br/>a donut cannot be deformed into two circles and a sphere, all touching at one<br/>point.  However, the suspension of a donut can be deformed into two spheres<br/>and a 3-dimensional sphere, all touching at one point.  The great advantage<br/>of stable homotopy theory is that problems become much more amenable to<br/>algebraic methods of solution.  Many geometric problems turn out to depend<br/>only on the stable homotopy type of the space involved, so stable homotopy<br/>theory has been of considerable utility.  <br/>***<br/><br/><br/>"

From any given point <br/>the insect can map all nearby points using standard xy coordinates. <br/>The invariant which distinguishes these three shapes is called<br/>the Euler characteristic.
