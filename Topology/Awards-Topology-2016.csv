The engagement of mathematics with other sciences, and of science with mathematics, is a continual source of fruitful ideas with long-term benefits -- our current technology and economy rely on the foundation of basic research from past decades and centuries.  For many years, the interaction of physics with geometry has concerned quantum field theory and string theory, and now condensed matter theory is added to the mix.  A major issue in the latter is the classification of phases of matter.  New exotic phases of matter have direct applications to materials science and to quantum computing.  This research project applies recent advances in abstract topology, the study of the gross structure of shapes, to this classification problem.  The project also aims at broader foundational issues in geometric formulations of quantum field theory, as well as questions in pure geometry.  Graduate students are involved in the research.  <br/><br/>This research involves both purely mathematical projects influenced by physics and projects that apply geometry and topology to concrete problems in quantum field theory, string theory, and condensed matter theory.  As an example of the latter, the investigator aims to classify certain topological phases of matter using ideas and techniques from homotopy theory.  Another set of projects aims to develop the general theoretical underpinnings of geometric models of quantum field theory, including issues of scale, unitarity, and long-range approximations.  The investigator also plans to explore questions in pure geometry.  One set of projects investigates invariants of three-dimensional manifolds using abelianization via spectral networks.  This provides a new perspective on dilogarithm formulas for volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Another project investigates quadratic forms in topology with applications to special quantum field theories.  Characteristic classes on smooth simplicial manifolds are also revisited, with an attempt to forge a relationship with central extensions of infinite dimensional groups."

The proposed research projects investigate ways of characterizing, describing and studying spaces with many symmetries in various dynamical, geometric and topological settings. These questions often require learning, adapting and applying ideas and techniques from many areas of mathematics. This work has connections with diverse areas of mathematics: from differential equations (the use of wavefront sets to study fine analytic properties of solutions to equations) to theoretical computer science (expander graphs, Kazhdan's property (T) and coarse embedding problems).<br/><br/>The main thrust of the proposed research is to introduce and develop new analytic techniques in group theory and the study of group actions. Major projects include: (a) studying quasi-isometries using a new notion of coarse differentiation (introduced in recent joint work with Eskin and Whyte) and newer ideas involving non-standard analysis and Loeb measures; (b) developing techniques for studying rigidity of dynamical systems based on analytic techniques from partial differential equations, particularly the theory of wavefront sets; (c) classifying hyperbolic groups which act smoothly on their boundaries using ideas from both dynamics and geometric group theory; (d) developing new cohomological methods in the study of rigidity of group actions. All research lies in the broad interdisciplinary area of rigidity in dynamics, geometry and topology. Many proposed projects involve applying analytic ideas and techniques to problems traditionally studied by dynamical, geometric or topological methods."

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies. <br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

It has two broadly constructed goals: to study the three-dimensional homology cobordism groups, sets of spaces with many algebraic features in common with the three-dimensional sphere, and to understand area-preserving maps between manifolds. Philosophically speaking, these goals are united by a desire to understand the flexibility or rigidity of geometric qualities of spaces. Understanding the homology cobordism groups is a major motivating question in topology; questions of the complexity of these groups in three dimensions are tied to deep structural issues in higher-dimensional topology. Similarly, the study of area-preserving (symplectic) maps is one of the central issues of symplectic geometry, and has nontrivial connections to physics. The PI will also study applications of invariants of knot concordance which arise in connection with this research. Since one motivation for this project is that the tools used are particularly computationally accessible, the PI will actively seek to involve undergraduate and other young researchers in this work.<br/> <br/>The tools of this project are equivariant versions of Floer-theoretic invariants.  There are two main programs. The first involves a recently-constructed involutive version of the three-manifold invariant Heegaard Floer homology, which gives two new homology cobordism and knot concordance invariants. Using this invariant, the PI will study the homology cobordism group and cosmetic surgeries on knots. Involutive Heegaard Floer homology is a first step toward the long-term goal of constructing Pin(2)-equivariant Heegaard Floer homology, which the PI will continue to work toward. This is desirable in light of recent progress made using  Pin(2)-equivariant version of Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, an analogous theory. For the second, the PI proposes to construct a Serre spectral sequence for the Lagrangian Floer cohomology of certain symplectic fibrations. Relationships arising from this spectral sequence are expected to give information about the symplectic mapping class group; furthermore, since many invariants in symplectic and low-dimensional topology can be formulated in terms of Lagrangian Floer cohomology, the spectral sequence itself has potentially broad consequences. Other goals include understanding equivariant Lagrangian Floer cohomology for general Lie groups, which also has many theoretical applications; a Z_p version of existing theory for Z_2, for example, would imply a criterion for deciding that a symplectomorphism of a manifold with stably trivialized tangent bundle has infinite order."

Three-dimensional manifolds are modeled on the space we live in, and contact structures arise naturally in the study of three-dimensional fluid flows. It is the mathematical structure of physical fluid flows that gives rise to contact topology. This National Science Foundation funded project seeks to extend the application of physical phenomena to the study of three-dimensional topology.<br/><br/>One of the most important tools in the study of three-dimensional manifolds is an analysis of the codimension one structures they support.  These include surfaces, foliations, and contact structures.  These structures are most revealing of the ambient structure when they are, respectively, incompressible, taut, and tight.  Some of the major advances in the field have been made when people gained insight into how these structures interact.  Gabai and Thurston made major advances relating surfaces and foliations in the 1980's.  Giroux's discovery of the interplay between convex surfaces and contact topology in the 1990's has been extremely useful.  In 1998, Eliashberg and Thurston discovered a surprising connection between foliations and contact topology that has been very influential and is the starting point for the proposed research. The PIs propose to better understand the relationship between foliations and contact topology.  This includes extending the applicability of approximation theorems, and sharpening the conclusions of such theorems. This includes also an investigation of existence and uniqueness questions, for both taut foliations and tight contact structures."

This conference will bring together leading researchers and emerging mathematicians in 4-dimensional topology and geometry from around the world, with the aims of providing directions for future research on open problems in the subject and introducing younger mathematicians to the field. NSF funds will be used to defray travel and lodging expenses for participants based in the US, with priority for invited speakers, and for junior mathematicians without other sources of funding. The conference  will have an  impact in fostering communication and collaboration between topologists at various career stages, providing perspective and new research directions for young mathematicians. <br/><br/>Modern 4-manifold theory can be said to have begun in the early 1980s with the work of Donaldson applying gauge theory. Since 2000, the attention of many low-dimensional topologists has shifted to dimension 3, where  Floer-theoretic invariants  have allowed remarkable progress. However, some of the most striking applications of these invariants of 3-manifolds, and from a certain point of view the philosophical motivation for the invariants themselves, relate to 4-manifolds either directly or through the techniques involved. Moreover, there are a number of fundamental unsolved problems in 4-manifold theory that may yield to new ideas rooted in Floer theory. The conference will serve the dual function of publicizing the newest ideas and approaches to these unsolved problems, and of introducing a younger generation to 4-manifold theory. With participation by some of the preeminent leaders in the field as well as many talented younger mathematicians, the organizers hope that this conference will touch off new activity and progress in 4-manifold topology. As a part of the conference we also plan to celebrate the work of Ron Fintushel and Ron Stern which has been very influential in the development of the field.  The organizers will edit and publish a volume of proceedings associated with this conference, with contributions from many of the speakers. The centerpiece of the volume will be a section devoted to open problems in 4-manifold topology based on problem sessions run during the conference by Rob Kirby, Ron Fintushel and Ron Stern.<br/><br/>Further details can be found on the conference webpage, https://www.renyi.hu/~ldtbud/Dubrovnik/"

Speakers will give 30-minute research talks in various subfields of topology and algebra; these subfields include algebraic combinatorics, enumerative geometry, knot theory, and representation theory.  Two distinguished graduate students will give hour-long presentations and one invited faculty member, Dr. Abakuse Mbrika of the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, will give a one-hour keynote address.  Invited undergraduate researchers will participate in a poster session. USTARS promotes diversity within the mathematical community by providing a platform for collaboration and professional development.  Participants are exposed to a variety of current research, ideas, and results, and meet underrepresented professors and students who will become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Indeed, the conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and hence is well-positioned to encourage participation from a diverse group of students. The participants of the conference will continue to influence the next generation of students by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the symposium is to showcase the mathematical research being conducted by underrepresented graduate students. This is done by structuring the meeting so that speakers will give 30-minute parallel research talks focusing on research leading to their graduate theses. Graduate students will give at least 75% of these presentations. Topics of prior years' presentations include: combinatorics, braid groups, graph theory, knot theory, representation theory, number theory, and algebraic geometry. In addition to the parallel sessions, two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour lectures and a poster session featuring invited undergraduates is also planned. Given the high quality and diversity of talks and participants ""The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) Invited Volume"" was created in 2014. This is a new series aimed specifically at disseminating the research of USTARS participants. The intention of this Invited Volume is to provide graduate students with an opportunity to publish their results in order to further their development as mathematical researchers. In light of this, a yearly online volume will be published at the conclusion of each annual research symposium.<br/><br/>http://www.ustars.org"

This meeting is inspired by a similar conference which took place in Spring 2015 at the University of Virginia. The PIs intend  to establish a tradition of such meetings.  Algebraic topology, geometry, and category theory are in the midst of a generational shift of language, techniques and paradigms, rooted in new ideas about higher homotopy-theoretic structures in geometry, physics, category theory, and data analysis. These fields are in ferment, with a forefront defined by a younger generation of researchers who bring new ideas from higher algebra to classical areas of geometry, physics, and applied mathematics. This conference is intended to help clarify the shifting boundaries and intersections in these closely related fields. Recent developments in computer science, physics, and big data are changing profoundly our notions of what constitutes geometry; in response, ideas from homotopy and category theory have provided new algebraic methods for (re)organizing our understanding of these questions, and how to approach them.<br/><br/>The conference will focus on a developing new global language for both geometry and algebra, with connections to fields such as the following:<br/><br/>1. arithmetic geometry (new approaches to motives, for example, via motivic homotopy theory; new techniques in K-theory via Hochschild and cyclic homology; homotopy-theoretic methods in automorphic forms, with applications to classical homotopy theory)<br/><br/>2. geometric quantum field theory, for example, through various cobordism hypotheses (via chiral homology and related not-so-commutative ring spectra)<br/><br/>3. category theory (e.g., through Voevodsky's univalent foundations project and related work on homotopy type theory in computer science, and involving foundational work in and applications of higher category theory<br/><br/>Demographic and intellectual developments in these areas have brought a diverse population of new researchers into the field, and the organizers  hope that the conference will foster and encourage this development. The roster of speakers emphasizes junior researchers and diversity, but makes no compromises with the strength of the work under discussion. The speakers exemplify ground-breaking work in new directions, which points the way toward a new synthesis of algebra and geometry. This conference is an opportunity to expose graduate students and new researchers to these developments, and could have significant impact on their careers.<br/>A list of speakers and other details can be found at the conference website<br/><br/>http://www.math.jhu.edu/matc/"

The subject seeks to understand the ways in which an abstract collection of operators can be expressed as transformations on a space. Striking developments in this field have recently been made by researchers in Europe. A major aim of the scheduled events is to provide an opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and early-career researchers to learn about these developments directly from the sources. An additional aim is to facilitate new collaborations. This project will support the participation of US-based researchers (predominantly graduate students and recent PhDs) in the summer school and workshop.<br/><br/>The scientific focus of the summer school and workshop is the representation theory of finite groups and related algebraic structures, with an emphasis on the modular case. This is an active area of research in the US and abroad, with mathematicians on different continents working on different aspects of the subject. The summer school will be centered around four lecture series: Rational Cohomology and Support for Linear Algebraic Groups (Eric Friedlander); Group Actions via Homotopy Theory (Jesper Grodal); Local Representation Theory (Radha Kessar); and Endo-trivial Modules for Infinite Groups (Peter Symonds). Taken together, these topics cover a broad range of current research on modular representation theory of finite groups. The workshop will consist of twenty-three lectures by international scholars who are are known for their seminal contributions and for their ability to communicate mathematics effectively. The lectures from the summer school and workshop will be submitted for publication. The webpage for the summer school and workshop is http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/160727-psswgatartofg."

The field intertwines rigid geometric problems, such as studying periodic orbits or counting curves passing through a given point, with flexible cut-and-paste constructions. Part of the research conducted in this proposal is the development of a combinatorial description of these structures in terms of a diagrammatic calculus, and its applications to these rigid geometric problems. This provides an accessible source of new examples and computations, and establishes the ground for strictly higher-dimensional constructions. Due to its combinatorial nature, this line of research is naturally conducive to participation from undergraduate students and young researchers. Another part of this project uses techniques that combine known elements from algebraic geometry and geometric topology with new ideas from contact and symplectic topology, and the outcome of the proposed research contributes to each of these central fields of mathematical research. <br/><br/>The first part of this project is the development of a Legendrian calculus in the front projection, including higher-dimensional Reidemeister moves, Legendrian handle-slides and criteria for the existence of loose charts. By further establishing a relation with bi-Lefschetz fibrations, this tool will provide effective combinatorial criteria for (sub)flexibility of Weinstein structures and the computation of algebraic invariants such as the Legendrian contact differential graded algebra and the wrapped Fukaya category. This combines ideas from affine algebraic geometry and higher-dimensional contact surgery theory. The second part of this research project focuses on the detection of tightness and over-twistedness of higher-dimensional models, including bordered Legendrian open books and small neighborhoods of over-twisted models. The project will use pseudoholomorphic techniques adapted to each problem in combination with new ideas coming from the study of Legendrian submanifolds, including the study of Legendrian cobordisms and their relation to Weinstein cobordisms. In both these projects the study of compatible open books in special position have a role, and a general existence theorem will be studied with asymptotically holomorphic techniques. In addition, the project will include the study of a flexible class of Engel structures, completely determined by formal homotopy class, and related h-principles."

The topological model under study would help molecular biologists by simplifying the analysis of the site-specific recombination mechanism for closed circular DNA molecules. The investigator also aims to identify the forms of knots, links, and non-planar graphs that arise in proteins, and to model how these complex structures may have occurred. This information may offer valuable insights into protein folding mechanisms and degradation pathways. Synthetic organic molecules are normally too small to see with an electron microscope; when chemists synthesize a complex structure they use data from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to provide evidence that the molecular structure has a particular form. Since these structures are large enough to be somewhat flexible, both topology and geometry have to be taken into account when comparing the symmetry properties of the NMR data to those of a physical model. The investigator is working with organic chemists to identify different types of symmetries exhibited by complex structures and to design new structures with interesting symmetry properties. <br/><br/>In contrast with knots and links, whose topology depends exclusively on their embedding in the three dimensional sphere, the intrinsic structure of some graphs can affect the topological properties of every embedding of the graph in a given three dimensional manifold. For example, some graphs have the property that for any embedding G of the graph in a three-manifold M, there is no orientation reversing homeomorphism of the pair (M,G). Such a graph is said to be intrinsically chiral in M. The investigator will work on characterizing which graphs are intrinsically chiral in the three-sphere and in other three-dimensional manifolds, as well as determining other properties of embedded graphs which are independent of the particular embedding of the graph. The project draws on three-manifold results including Jaco-Shalen and Johannson characteristic decompositions, Mostow's rigidity theorem, Thurstons' hyperbolization theorem, and the classification of Seifert manifolds, as well as techniques from knot theory and the theory of tangles."

The spheres, which are among the simplest geometric objects, are building blocks for more complex entities. The homotopy groups of spheres, which are used to study the connections between these basic components, are collections of continuous functions between spheres considered up to deformations. Many problems in other fields, especially differential topology, have been reduced to the study of these groups, which is notoriously difficult. However, a bridge has been built between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology that allows us to use sophisticated algebraic theory to enable calculations of the homotopy groups of spheres. This bridge is known as chromatic homotopy theory. This project studies two of the most important structural conjectures in this field, the telescope and chromatic splitting conjectures. It has a strong computational component that will provide data to help study these two fundamental problems.<br/><br/>Chromatic homotopy theory uses higher analogues of K-theory which give rise to higher periodicity in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The chromatic splitting conjecture is an attempt at explaining the relationship between different periodicities. Recently, the PI has disproved a special case of this conjecture. In a project with Goerss and Henn, the PI aims to explain this failure and reformulate the conjecture. In a related project with Xu, the PI plans to compute the homotopy groups of the K(2)-local sphere at the prime two. These computations use self-dual resolutions which appear to be related to Brown-Commenetz duality and the structure of the K(2)-local Picard group. The PI plans to study this connection with Bobkova, Goerss and Henn. A parallel part of the project is to study periodicity in relation to the telescope conjecture. In work with Behrens, Bhattacharya, Culver and Xu, the PI plans to detect periodic elements using a resolution of the sphere by topological modular forms. The telescope conjecture gives a connection between periodic elements detected by such methods and those detected by the K(2)-local sphere. Comparing the two computations may shed light on this conjecture."

Our first foundational objective is to develop equivariant versions of the many known models for homotopical higher categories and to establish equivalences between them.  Our first proposed application is the development of homotopical approaches to equivariant extended topological field theories.  The second application is the development of topological cluster categories arising from surfaces; extending to higher dimensions should allow for the development of new invariants of higher-dimensional manifolds analogous to ones for surfaces.  This second application should also inform the first, with higher-dimensional cluster categories giving new information about topological field theories.  The third application is concerned with connections between Hall algebras and algebraic K-theory.  In one direction, constructions of homotopical Hall algebras are expected to give rise to K-theory spectra which should give new information about Hall algebras, especially those related to quantum groups.  In another, variations of Hall algebra constructions have corresponding variants of algebraic K-theory which are worthy of further investigation.  <br/><br/>Broadly speaking, this proposal is concerned with incorporating algebraic information into categorical and topological structures which are currently being used in a wide range of kinds of mathematics.  We then seek to apply these enhanced structures in mathematical physics, manifold theory, and representation theory.  The educational component of this proposal consists of a series of four summer workshops for mathematics majors who are in the process of transferring to UC Riverside.  The goal is to help twenty participants each year to make the transition to upper-level mathematics via introduction to proof techniques, more theoretical concepts, and a broad overview of the range of topics in higher-level mathematics courses.

This dimension is also special in the sense that it is borderline between ""low dimensions"" where many classification results have been settled and ""higher dimensions"" where geometric classification problems are known to admit an algebraic reformulation. This project is aimed at classification up to continuous deformations of 4-manifolds with special characteristics, known as large fundamental groups. <br/><br/>The main part of this project concerns geometric classification of topological 4-manifolds, specifically the topological surgery conjecture and the s-cobordism conjecture for ""large"" fundamental groups. The notion of a 1/2-null surgery problem is proposed, as an intermediate step in the context of universal surgery problems. A key ingredient is the group-theoretic Engel relation, which is closely related to higher-order singularities of surfaces in 4-manifolds. The framework of the AB-slice problem is also considered.

It was Charles Ehresmann in 1935 who started the study of deformation spaces of geometric structures, asking which ""shapes"" can be ""locally modeled"" on a certain geometry. In 1982 William Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, now a theorem, renewed interest in locally homogeneous spaces, that is, spaces that look the same at each point. This research project studies families of structures on manifolds and how they change when one perturbs them, focusing in particular on geometric and dynamical aspects. As a broader impact, the investigator will involve graduate students in her work, organize activities aimed at junior mathematicians, and deliver lectures outside the University. She also wants to promote the collaborative side of the work, and to create a supportive and attentive environment for members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.<br/><br/>The investigator will employ results and techniques developed in the context of hyperbolic structures to study other geometric structures. For example, she will investigate compact or hyperideal convex polyhedra in anti-de Sitter space, a Lorentzian analogue of the hyperbolic space, and the end(s) of complex hyperbolic manifolds. Many deformation spaces arise from spaces of representations of the fundamental group of a manifold into a Lie group, so the PI is also planning to continue the study of the dynamical decomposition of character varieties of free groups, and of fundamental groups of hyperbolic manifolds with compressible boundary. Finally, the PI will study ""higher Teichmueller theory"", that is, representations of a surface group into Lie groups of higher real rank, and Anosov representations, which are a dynamical analogue of locally homogeneous geometric structures. Since Anosov representations turn out to be generalizations of convex cocompact subgroups of rank one Lie groups to the context of discrete subgroups of Lie groups of higher rank, the PI plans to use techniques developed for Kleinian groups in order to study limits of Anosov representations. It is anticipated that results and techniques coming from differential geometry and low-dimensional topology will inspire new research directions with deep connections with dynamical systems, Lie theory, complex analysis, and even algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory, and physics."

They have been studied by many mathematicians and seem to touch on diverse areas of mathematics and physics, but only in the last few decades have they moved into the foreground of mathematics. This is due to the remarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and beautiful theory with many applications. Studying subsets and their interactions with such structures was instrumental in the understanding of three-dimensional spaces, and it led to profound progress. The Principal Investigator will now extend this to higher dimensions, where this exploration is likely to prove equally illuminating. The Principal Investigator will also continue to study properties of contact structures on low-dimensional spaces and their interaction with topology and Riemannian geometry, and he will train the next generation of researchers by working with a large group of graduate students and organizing conferences and seminars.<br/><br/>The research supported by this award will focus on problems centered around three broad topics: the interactions of contact geometry and topology in low dimensions, properties and constructions of contact manifolds in higher dimensions, and connections between contact geometry and the more familiar Riemannian geometry. In low dimensions the main motivating question is to determine which three-manifolds admit a tight contact structure. Currently quite a bit is known about this question, but very little is known about it for hyperbolic homology spheres. This problem will be studied using a variety of techniques, from convex surfaces, to holomorphic curves and Riemannian geometry. In addition, understanding interactions between various properties a contact structure can have will be studied. While much is known about contact geometry in low dimensions, there is very little known in higher dimensions. The principal investigator will study constructions and properties of high-dimensional contact manifolds. The starting point for this will be the study of isotropic and contact submanifolds of contact manifolds. Such considerations have led to a wealth of information in low-dimensions and it is expected to be similarly fruitful in higher dimensions as well. In the past few years there have been some interesting and subtle connections between contact geometry and Riemannian geometry. The Principal Investigator will explore this further hoping to find contact geometric analogs of classical results relating topology to Riemannian geometry."

For example, a mirror on a wall can help to visualize a reflection of 3-dimensional space, a symmetry which sends each point in our world to the corresponding point on the other side of the mirror. Coxeter groups are special kinds of groups of symmetries that consist of sequences of reflections through mirrors placed at precise angles to one another. The so-called ""crystallographic"" Coxeter groups occur frequently in physics and mathematics because they preserve lattice points, for example the locations of atoms in a crystal. Crystallographic Coxeter groups also arise when analyzing important geometric spaces; this imbues them with a great deal of interesting structure. Mysteriously, Coxeter groups which are not crystallographic still possess this beautiful structure, despite having no geometric explanation. For example, each Coxeter group has an associated Hecke algebra, and by multiplying elements in this algebra one can produce numbers called structure coefficients. For crystallographic Coxeter groups, these coefficients are always non-negative because they are counting something. However, the non-negativity result holds in general. An underlying goal of this project is to find combinatorial and algebraic descriptions of the structures apparent in Coxeter groups, to help explain these mysterious phenomena. The main objects of study are categorical representations of Hecke algebras, where usual reflections are replaced by ""reflection functors"" that act as symmetries not on some n-dimensional space, but on spaces attached to representations of other important algebras in mathematics.<br/><br/>In this research project the categorical representation theory of Hecke algebras will be investigated along three lines of attack. The first approach is to lift the notion of diagonalization from linear algebra to categorical representation theory. For example, the full twist in the braid group, and its image in the Hecke algebra, is diagonalizable in any finite dimensional representation. In joint work with Hogancamp, I aim to prove that the categorified full twist is ""categorically  diagonalizable."" This allows one to lift much of the structure  theory of Hecke algebra representations to the categorical level.  In the second approach, together with Williamson and Juteau, I will study certain categorical representations of affine Weyl groups which are significant for modular representation theory, and their quantum deformations. The goal is to compute local intersection forms, which will explain how the category degenerates in finite characteristic. This computation will give character formulas for modular representations of algebraic groups which were previously unknown. In the third approach, together with Young, I will find an algebraic description of the quantum deformation mentioned above, when the quantum parameter is a root of unity. This is related to the categorification of complex reflection groups, which is an open problem."

The conference will feature 16-20 talks and roughly 80 participants.<br/><br/>Symplectic geometry and contact geometry are the abstract setting of classical mechanics. Symplectic geometry was originally developed to study the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, with a particular focus on celestial mechanics. More recently, it has turned out that symplectic and contact geometry are key to fundamental questions in theoretical high energy physics, as a key component in string theory and with close relations to gauge theory. Roughly speaking, a symplectic manifold is a smooth space in which there is a well-defined notion of area - but not necessarily a well-defined notion of distance. One key question is how to tell if two symplectic manifolds are the same, and to list all symplectic manifolds with certain properties. Another important topic is the notion of size in symplectic manifolds, given that there is no intrinsic notion of distance. This problem is particularly subtle - it turns out, for instance, that an infinite cylinder may not be symplectically bigger than a finite one - and again is reflected in strange theoretical phenomena in physics. Another important topic in symplectic geometry - and most of mathematics - is symmetry: what symmetries can symplectic spaces have? Is it possible to classify all highly-symmetric symplectic spaces? A last theme is using smooth symplectic spaces to study singular spaces: smooth spaces are easier to analyze, but understanding what properties of singularities they reflect is subtle. This conference will bring together roughly 80 researchers on these topics, with a particular emphasis on recent developments and work by younger researchers, to exchange ideas and results on these basic research topics. The ultimate goal, naturally, is to promote the progress of science. A secondary goal is to highlight the many contributions of women to the field, to provide mentoring and support for women researchers who are just getting started and so promote diversity among mathematics researchers.<br/><br/>The conference web page, with information about speakers and registration, is<br/>http://math.columbia.edu/mcduff70"

Contact manifolds are in some sense a dimensional simplification, and have historically had connections to the differential equations of optics and dynamics. In recent years, mathematicians have found strong applications of the study of contact and symplectic manifolds to our understanding of three- and four-dimensional spaces. One foundational goal in topology is to understand the extent certain algebraic simplifications of a manifold determine the manifold itself. For example, the famous Poincare Conjecture asks whether the structure of a sphere is determined by a related algebraic entity known as its fundamental group; a four dimensional version of this question is still unanswered. Somewhat surprisingly, symplectic manifolds have played a strong role in answering such questions. In turn, as the field has progressed, mathematicians have used tools from topology, differential geometry and physics with the goal of better understanding contact and symplectic manifolds. This project aims to both use the tools from the study of contact and symplectic manifolds to further our understanding of three- and four-dimensional spaces, as well as to develop new tools to increase our understanding of contact and symplectic manifolds themselves. <br/><br/>In one sense, contact and symplectic topology bridges the rigidity of Riemannian geometry and the flexibility of topology, showing traits of both: local flexibility and global rigidity. Modern contact topology began in the 1980s with Bennequin's work and was connected to symplectic topology by Gromov and Eliashberg. Giroux brought topology and contact geometry in 3-dimensions closely together by associating a topological object, a singular fiber bundle called an open book decomposition, to a contact structure, as well as a method for describing all open books compatible with that contact structure. This tool has been extremely effective at forming connections with low-dimensional topology, allowing for the construction of new contact invariants, surgery characterization of certain knots, and the classification of symplectic fillings, among much else. Open books additionally provide two new intrinsic invariants of the contact structure: the page, a fiber in the open book, and the monodromy, the gluing map of the bundle. We call the minimal genus of a compatible open book the page genus of the contact structure, and it is an extraordinarily interesting invariant. If the page genus is zero, then we can say a tremendous amount about the contact structure. If the page genus is not zero, then there are infinitely many compatible open books and the existing methods for describing them all are far from effective, which makes determining the page genus impossible. Indeed, it is unknown whether there are contact structures with minimal page genus greater than one. This project aims to simplify this picture, first by producing new invariants of contact manifolds that can be effectively calculated using a given open book; and second by producing effective mechanisms for listing all open books as well as determining whether two open books yield the same contact structure."

Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will  mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies.<br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of ""geometric"" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces."

Over the years, mathematicians have developed various topological invariants, or in other words, quantities that are associated to shapes and can distinguish between those that have different properties. Homology is a well-known such invariant, which can be associated to any multi-dimensional shape, and which is a quantitative measure of the number of holes in a space. A circle, for instance, has only a one-dimensional hole, whereas the surface of a doughnut has two one-dimensional holes, a meridian and a longitude, that are not filled in by the surface itself, and an additional two-dimensional hole. Floer homology is a more refined invariant that is responsible for some of the most important recent advances in the study of knotted closed loops in space, three-dimensional shapes, and shapes with a geometry known as a symplectic structure that is exhibited by phase spaces in classical mechanics. This project brings together several researchers working in different areas of topology and geometry to study Floer homology. The main goal of the project is the following: To every knot, three-dimensional shape, or symplectic shape, one should associate a different object, called a Floer space or a Floer homotopy type, whose (ordinary) homology is the Floer homology of the initial shape. This has been accomplished so far in a limited number of cases. A general theory of Floer spaces will lead to new advances in several areas. Furthermore, the study of Floer spaces will be based on techniques from a subfield of topology called homotopy theory. This project will create a community of scholars at the interface of these current and extremely research active areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Floer homology is a fundamental tool in geometry and topology, whose applications range from the Arnold conjecture to the surgery characterization of various knots. Floer homology has also laid the basis for completely unexpected interconnections between algebraic and symplectic geometry in the form of homological mirror symmetry. Floer homotopy theory, an extension to spaces rather than homology groups, has been implemented in a small number of cases, leading to significant applications, for example, the resolution of the triangulation conjecture in high dimensions and work on immersed Lagrangian spheres. Further, the ideas behind Floer homotopy inspired the construction of a Khovanov homotopy type associated to knots in the three-sphere. The main scientific goal of this project is to give a general construction of Floer homotopy. The necessary foundational work will build upon recent advances in multiple areas. These include the conceptual advances in equivariant stable homotopy theory stemming from the resolution of Kervaire invariant one problem, and the development of new approaches to define virtual fundamental classes in Floer theory. The project aims to put the homotopical and homological variants of Floer theory on equal footing. As a consequence, new applications in both symplectic and low-dimensional topology are anticipated, for example: (i) a spectral Fukaya category associated to a symplectic manifold will be constructed; (ii) the Heegaard Floer theory of Ozsvath and Szabo will be used to produce a computable invariant parallel to the celebrated Bauer-Furuta invariant for four-manifolds; (iii) Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy types will be studied using the tools of equivariant stable homotopy theory; and (iv) the Khovanov homotopy type will be extended to give invariants of knot cobordisms and tangles."

Many new and powerful tools were developed; in addition, a surprising connection was discovered with number theory. This research focuses on expanding on our understanding of this connection by lifting recent developments from number theory to topology, and applying this new machinery of algebraic topology to concrete problems about geometric shapes such as knots and links. <br/><br/>This research project extends work of the investigator and collaborators in constructing structured ring spectra realizing connections to specific moduli of abelian varieties.

Further, the project will study positivity phenomena in the theories of modular and automorphic forms and their connection to the additive locus in chromatic homotopy theory. The work also aims to extend recent results in constructing Khovanov spectra associated to knots and to show Khovanov's work on complexes associated to tangles lifts to a theory of stable homotopy types associated to tangles.

When three-dimensional spaces (manifolds) are glued together along their two-dimensional boundaries, the properties of the resulting space depend in complex ways on the properties of the gluing maps. The gluing maps themselves form a rich algebraic structure known as a mapping class group; this research project explores a number of settings where this structure comes into play. A particular role is played by a special geometric property of the mapping class group known as relative hyperbolicity, which has enabled the fine geometric structure of three-dimensional manifolds to be teased out and analyzed. Some of the previous advances in this area have yielded general statements but not concrete estimates, and in a number of areas the investigator expects to be able to sharpen current understanding and compute concrete bounds. The focus, nevertheless, is to deepen conceptual understanding of the way that two-dimensional and three-dimensional manifolds fit together. <br/><br/>The project investigates aspects of the interaction between topology of surfaces and three-manifolds, with connections to deformation spaces of geometric structures and geodesic flows in Teichmuller space. A common thread in the work is the hierarchical structure of mapping class groups and the phenomenon of relative hyperbolicity via curve complexes. In a project on fibered hyperbolic three-manifolds, the investigator will explore the ""subsurface profiles"" of the set of all fibrations, namely the pattern of projections to fiber subsurfaces of the stable and unstable foliations associated to the monodromy maps. The goal here is to obtain uniform (genus independent) descriptions and to relate them to the combinatorial structure of veering triangulations. In Teichmuller theory, the investigator will pursue a conjectural description of the Weil-Petersson geodesic flow on the moduli space of a surface, developing new tools with which to analyze the combinatorial patterns or itineraries of geodesic rays. The investigator will study the skinning map defined by Thurston on the Teichmuller space of the boundary of a hyperbolic three-manifold. He will work toward a better quantitative control of the diameter bounds known for such maps in the acylindrical case. In the general case he will extend previous work that established relative bounded image results, to complete the proof of a claim of Thurston on iterates of the skinning-and-gluing maps in the setting where a gluing yields an atoroidal manifold.

The mathematical system that describes the motion of a pendulum is a dynamical system. Another example is fluid dynamics, which for instance, is used to study the flow of air over an airplane wing. Often, the structure of a phase space has implications for the dynamical systems that it supports. For example, any flow on the sphere has a stationary point, which means that the corresponding dynamical system has a state that never changes. This project is concerned with the obverse of this idea: What does a flow on a space say about the space itself? The spaces we consider are 3-dimensional, like the space surrounding us; the flows are used as a tool to ""flatten"" the space into simpler 1- and 2-dimensional spaces, where the geometric structure of the original space is reflected in the symmetries of these flattened spaces. In addition to its implications within mathematics, this project has applications to applied dynamics, where the flattened spaces can be used to understand the stability of fluid flows.<br/> <br/>Quasigeodesic and pseudo-Anosov flows are product covered, which means that the orbit space in the universal cover is a topological plane. This plane has a natural circle at infinity, with an action of the fundamental group, which reflects the large-scale dynamics of the flow and the geometry of the manifold. This project uses techniques from dynamics, 3-manifolds, geometric group theory, and classical analysis situs to understand the relationship between a flow, its underlying manifold, and the circle at infinity. In particular, it aims to prove Calegari's conjecture that every quasigeodesic flow may be deformed into a pseudo-Anosov flow, characterize the circle actions that come from such flows, and use flows to understand cubulations and essential surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds."

Isaksen<br/><br/>High-dimensional spheres are the basic building blocks of all geometric objects.  It turns out that spheres of different dimensions can fit together in only certain combinations to create more complicated geometric objects.  The computation of stable homotopy groups is essentially the same as counting these combinations.  This computation has been a major topic of research since the middle of the 20th century.  This work belongs to the field of homotopy theory, which is a technique for studying geometric objects up to certain kinds of deformations.  Motivic homotopy theory is a version of homotopy theory that applies to problems in algebraic geometry.  This project exploits the similarities and differences between classical homotopy theory and motivic homotopy theory to compute stable homotopy groups.<br/><br/>The computation of stable homotopy groups of the sphere spectrum is among the most fundamental problems in homotopy theory.  The projects goals are to apply Adams spectral sequences at the prime 2 to compute: (1) classical stable homotopy groups; (2) motivic stable homotopy groups over C; (3) motivic stable homotopy groups over R; and (4) C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups.  These four computations are closely interrelated.  Their connections reveal structure that is not apparent within just one type of stable homotopy group.  At face value, the computation of the C2-equivariant Adams spectral sequence presents unmanageable technical complexities.  There is a path to C2-equivariant computations that proceeds through intermediate stages of C-motivic and R-motivic calculations.  At each stage, new complexities arise, but they are manageable when taken one at a time. The first step is to compute algebraic Ext groups that serve as the E2-page of the Adams spectral sequence.  These Ext groups are in themselves quite complicated, and typically are obtained with an auxiliary spectral sequence.  Since this part of the problem is entirely algebraic, computers can be used to great effect here.  The second step is to compute Adams differentials and hidden extensions. This process usually requires subtle work with Toda brackets and is no longer algebraic.  Several techniques will be employed: (a) brute force computation in a range of dimensions; (b) machine-assisted computation to produce algebraic data and to organize the many individual computational facts into a consistent whole; (c) description of the global structure of stable homotopy groups by means of periodicity operators; and (d) comparison between the Adams-Novikov and Adams spectral sequences."

The discovery of symmetries and their usefulness is arguably one the greatest achievements of human knowledge. Concretely, one of the most effective ways of understanding and controlling geometric shapes is to exploit their symmetries. The modern approach is to encode this information in something we call the fundamental group. One goal of topologists and geometric group theorists is to understand all possible fundamental groups, classify them, and study their own intrinsic geometric properties. Classically, the most studied geometric objects have been in low dimensions, particularly in dimension two.  This is called surface theory and is one of the focus areas of the proposed projects. The principal investigator is also interested in taking the intuitions that one gains from studying the fundamental groups of surfaces and extrapolating them to more complex objects. This area is called geometric group theory, an increasingly active subject within mathematics over the last few decades.<br/><br/>The research projects address a broad spectrum of research problems in the general areas of geometric group theory and Teichmuller theory, with interactions with hyperbolic geometry, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics. The specific topics include: (1) Growth tightness of group actions on metric spaces. This notion was first introduced by Grigorchuk and de la Harpe for word metrics and it has connections to the Hopfian property for groups and the Rank Rigidity Conjecture. (2) Stable commutator lengths in right-angled Artin groups and related groups. (3) The geometry of Teichmuller space equipped with the Thurston metric."

A doughnut and the spatial universe are both examples of three-manifolds. These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other natural sciences and model many interesting phenomena. A geometric way of studying them is to cut a complicated three-manifold into simpler three-dimensional pieces along two-dimensional surfaces. For example, a so-called Heegaard splitting is such a decomposition. One can also use a technique known as surgery on a three-manifold that replaces a geometric piece with a different one. In this project, the PI plans to study various questions on three-manifolds using Heegaard splitting and surgery. The research targets several central questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, which has potential impact on other areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological structures of DNA.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI plans to study topology of three-manifolds. The first part of the research is to study a long-standing conjecture concerning Heegaard genus and degree-one map. The conjecture can be translated into a study of how Heegaard genus changes under a special type of surgeries and the PI plans to study such surgeries. The PI also plans to study several related questions on Heegaard genus of certain amalgamated three-manifolds. The second part of the project is to explore a new approach to proving the Berge Conjecture. This approach is inspired by the PI's observation that if there is a certain intersection pattern, then one can perform a stabilization and then an unstabilization, changing a Heegaard splitting of a knot exterior (in a lens space) into a meridionally primitive splitting. The PI plans to develop new tools and use techniques from his previous work to achieve these goals."

For instance, one can contract the equator to transform the round sphere into an hourglass. While the neck of the hourglass does not look much like a round sphere anymore, the two bulbs are still pretty round. The celebrated Gauss-Bonnet theorem says that in some precise sense, no matter how the sphere is distorted, the average geometry of the result will still be round. Mathematicians view this result as an example where the topology of an object (i.e., the fact that it was produced by distorting a round sphere) constrains its geometry. The broad theme of this proposal is to develop similar results pertaining to higher dimensional abstract geometric objects. <br/><br/>Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, proved by Perelman in 2003, states that every closed three-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which admits one of eight types of homogenous metrics. Of these pieces, only the hyperbolic three-manifolds have not been classified.  The full statement of the Perelman's result includes topological conditions that characterize when a closed three-manifold M admits a hyperbolic metric. Mostow's Rigidity Theorem implies that a hyperbolic metric on such an M is unique, if it exists, so it is natural to try to extract concrete geometric information about the metric from the topology of M. Effective geometrization, studied by the PI and his collaborators, is a program to extract concrete geometric information about a hyperbolic metric on a three-dimensional manifold from its topology. A large part of this project involves finding a description of the geometry of M given only that the number of elements needed to generate the fundamental group of M is bounded, or that M has a topological decomposition with certain characteristics. The key technique is to understand a sequence of closed hyperbolic three-manifolds asymptotically by passing to geometric limits. This perspective will also be applied outside of hyperbolic geometry, in the study of the growth of Betti numbers in sequences of higher rank locally symmetric spaces, in a program inspired by an active field in graph theory."

Algebraic geometry has ancient origins with many connections to real-world problems. Its goal is to understand the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, equations of central importance in various disciplines, such as theoretical physics, cryptography, and number theory. Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to robotics and to the analysis of large data sets, and a recent revolution in the foundations of algebraic topology has broadened its applicability to other fields of pure mathematics. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several well-known questions and conjectures in algebraic geometry. Some of these questions will be investigated jointly with students as part of undergraduate research projects in the Mathematical Computing Laboratory at UIC, which the PI founded in 2015 with David Dumas and Jan Verschelde. This integration will provide valuable opportunities for students to engage in research and impact ongoing research.<br/><br/>The PI will work on several projects at the border of algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. Three projects aim to use various topological methods to understand the Brauer group and Azumaya algebras as well as the role of higher algebraic structures in algebraic geometry. (1) The PI will study (higher) algebraic representatives of tale cohomology classes, generalizing the connection between the Picard and Brauer groups and low-degree cohomology groups. (2) The PI will explore separate applications of motivic homotopy theory and persistent homology to the period-index conjecture with the aim of finding algebraic counterexamples to the conjecture. (3) The PI will explore the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem in characteristic p, specifically focusing on the question of whether or not the local-global spectral sequence for Hochschild homology degenerates at the E_2-page for smooth projective surfaces in characteristic 2."

Despite its abstract nature, algebraic topology has proven to be useful in a variety of applications, including theoretical physics, where the subject arises naturally in attempts to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics, and data science, where the subject has had considerable impact in the analysis of large data sets. A fifty-year-old question in the field known as the Kervaire invariant problem was solved in 2009; the answer to the question at the heart of the problem was the opposite of what most experts had expected, and surprising new techniques, potentially useful in other areas, were required in the proof.  The research project aims to amplify this discovery and adapt it to further applications.<br/><br/>The principal investigator plans to follow up on this advance in two ways. First, a book in progress is designed to make the solution methods accessible to graduate students and other interested non-experts in the field, amplifying the mathematical infrastructure in equivariant homotopy theory and category theory for the Kervaire invariant problem with illustrative examples and explanations. Second, the tools developed to solve the Kervaire invariant problem are being adapted to further applications. In particular, there is a counterpart to the problem for each prime number. The recent solution of the original, geometrically motivated, problem was for the prime 2. The algebraic analog for primes 5 and larger had been solved in the late 1970s. The algebraic problem remains open for the prime 3, and the principal investigator has a plan for solving it. In addition, the surprising nature of the solution to the 2-primary problem raises more questions than it answers, implying in particular that certain predicted patterns in the homotopy groups of spheres cannot occur. The question of what might replace them is wide open."

Traditionally, one studies geometric objects via their symmetries. In geometric group theory the situation is reversed: one starts with a group of symmetries of an algebraic object (for example, another group) and constructs a geometric object with the same symmetries. This proposal focuses on the study of symmetries of a free group. Surprisingly, its geometry is to a large degree governed by hyperbolic geometry that goes back to Gauss, Lobacevski, Poincare and others, most recently to Gromov and Thurston. The goal of the project is to better understand this phenomenon.<br/><br/>The study of the large-scale geometry of the outer automorphism group of a free group on n generators, usually denoted Out(F_n) has made great strides in recent years, but several fundamental questions are still open. The principal investigator has proposed a strategy for proving the Novikov and Farrell-Jones conjectures for this group. The strategy is modeled on the proofs of corresponding conjectures for mapping class groups, taking into account the extra complications present in Out(F_n). The steps in the strategy provide concrete questions the PI plans to attack. More specifically, a goal is to prove that Out(F_n) has finite asymptotic dimension, to better understand the boundary of the complex of free splittings, and to study the extent to which the orbit map from Out(F_n) to a suitable product of projection complexes fails to be a quasi-isometric embedding. Additional questions include characterization of convex cocompactness in mapping class groups, uniform hyperbolicity of standard Out(F_n)-complexes, and cubing the pants complex."

Over the years, mathematicians have developed various topological invariants, or in other words, quantities that are associated to shapes and can distinguish between those that have different properties. Homology is a well-known such invariant, which can be associated to any multi-dimensional shape, and which is a quantitative measure of the number of holes in a space. A circle, for instance, has only a one-dimensional hole, whereas the surface of a doughnut has two one-dimensional holes, a meridian and a longitude, that are not filled in by the surface itself, and an additional two-dimensional hole. Floer homology is a more refined invariant that is responsible for some of the most important recent advances in the study of knotted closed loops in space, three-dimensional shapes, and shapes with a geometry known as a symplectic structure that is exhibited by phase spaces in classical mechanics. This project brings together several researchers working in different areas of topology and geometry to study Floer homology. The main goal of the project is the following: To every knot, three-dimensional shape, or symplectic shape, one should associate a different object, called a Floer space or a Floer homotopy type, whose (ordinary) homology is the Floer homology of the initial shape. This has been accomplished so far in a limited number of cases. A general theory of Floer spaces will lead to new advances in several areas. Furthermore, the study of Floer spaces will be based on techniques from a subfield of topology called homotopy theory. This project will create a community of scholars at the interface of these current and extremely research active areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Floer homology is a fundamental tool in geometry and topology, whose applications range from the Arnold conjecture to the surgery characterization of various knots. Floer homology has also laid the basis for completely unexpected interconnections between algebraic and symplectic geometry in the form of homological mirror symmetry. Floer homotopy theory, an extension to spaces rather than homology groups, has been implemented in a small number of cases, leading to significant applications, for example, the resolution of the triangulation conjecture in high dimensions and work on immersed Lagrangian spheres. Further, the ideas behind Floer homotopy inspired the construction of a Khovanov homotopy type associated to knots in the three-sphere. The main scientific goal of this project is to give a general construction of Floer homotopy. The necessary foundational work will build upon recent advances in multiple areas. These include the conceptual advances in equivariant stable homotopy theory stemming from the resolution of Kervaire invariant one problem, and the development of new approaches to define virtual fundamental classes in Floer theory. The project aims to put the homotopical and homological variants of Floer theory on equal footing. As a consequence, new applications in both symplectic and low-dimensional topology are anticipated, for example: (i) a spectral Fukaya category associated to a symplectic manifold will be constructed; (ii) the Heegaard Floer theory of Ozsvath and Szabo will be used to produce a computable invariant parallel to the celebrated Bauer-Furuta invariant for four-manifolds; (iii) Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy types will be studied using the tools of equivariant stable homotopy theory; and (iv) the Khovanov homotopy type will be extended to give invariants of knot cobordisms and tangles."

Second, he will study the effective scope of geometric invariant theory (GIT) invented by Hilbert and Mumford on the construction of algebraic moduli based on the work of the PI and his collaborators.

In the 1980s, Gromov revolutionized the field by introducing the notion of a hyperbolic space and outlining a broad program of study of isometry groups of such spaces. Intensive work in this direction has resulted in the rich theory of hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups. A further generalization, the class of acylindrically hyperbolic groups, was recently suggested by the Principal investigator; it received considerable attention in the papers of the PI and others over the past few years. The main goal of the proposed project is to continue this work and to make further advances in the study of groups acting on hyperbolic spaces.<br/><br/>More specifically, the proposed project consists of 4 parts. The main objective of the first part is to better understand the relation between various manifestations of negative curvature in geometry, analysis, and topological dynamics. The second part is devoted to the study of group theoretic Dehn surgery, an algebraic generalization of Thurston's theory of hyperbolic Dehn filling introduced in earlier papers of the PI. The PI suggests some further directions with potential applications to the study of group von Neumann algebras. The third part is focused on applications of geometric methods to the study of permutation groups. In particular, the PI proposes a way of solving several long standing open problems about factorizable groups.

Davis<br/><br/>Major branches of theoretical mathematics include topology, algebra, geometry, analysis, and combinatorics.  This project weaves these various threads together.  The major focus is the study of manifolds, which are sets of points locally modeled on Euclidean space.  Sample manifolds in dimension 2 are given by a plane, the surface of a torus, and the surface of a sphere.  However manifolds exist in all dimensions, and their consideration leads to a rich variety of examples and uses a rich variety of tools.  This project focuses on manifolds which are analytically simple but topologically complex. The connection between the disparate fields mentioned above means that one can use topology as a oracle, producing interesting questions, examples, and research in other areas of theoretical mathematics. Manifold theory connects with most areas of mathematics, as well as physical phenomena such as cosmology, string theory, and classical and quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>The principal investigator proposes six projects.  The first is the bordism of L2-acyclic manifolds.  This connects with low-dimensional topology (knot concordance), with algebra (Hilberts 17th problem and the Witt group of function fields), with high-dimensional topology (a new form of surgery theory), and analysis (amenable groups and L2-betti numbers). The second gives a systematic approach to topological equivariant rigidity, using tools from surgery theory, stratified spaces, algebraic K-and L-theory, and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture.  The third is to study and apply combinatorial characteristic classes based on oriented matroids.  The fourth is the Nielsen Realization question, where progress in now possible due to the Farrell-Jones conjecture and the understanding of manifolds whose fundamental groups are infinite with torsion.  The fifth is foundational work in algebraic L-theory, in particular the computation of the L-theory of the polynomial ring in n variables with integral coefficients and the group ring of a free product of groups.  The sixth is to study Brieskorn manifolds produced by algebraic geometry, and, in turn, to use algebraic geometry to study these manifolds.  These problems are all interrelated with each other; the basic theme being classification of manifolds, their bundles, and their symmetries."

There are special families of three-manifolds, including fibered three-manifolds and Dehn surgeries along knots, where advances in knot Floer homology and Heegaard-Floer homology are expected to lead to new topological applications.

This international event is sponsored by the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) Collaborative Research Group (CRG) in Applied, Algebraic, and Geometric Topology. Manifolds are geometric objects that locally resemble flat space. For example, the surface of a doughnut is a two-dimensional manifold called a torus. The technique of surgery, which involves cutting and pasting pieces of manifolds, allows a transition from questions in geometry to quantifiable and easier questions in algebra. The technique of surgery is a central area of mathematics, but it is quite difficult to learn because it draws on many other areas. This summer school is an educational outreach program designed to make the techniques of surgery and manifold topology accessible to a wide range of graduate students and junior mathematicians. The program includes lectures by experts, mini-lectures by participants on background topics, and exercise sessions mentored by experts. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support.<br/><br/>Classification of manifolds is a central area of geometric topology and intersects with many other fields, including analysis, geometry, algebra, and group theory. This summer school aims to stimulate education and research in classification of manifolds and related areas of mathematics. Participants will have diverse mathematical backgrounds, with knowledge in geometric topology, algebraic topology, geometric group theory, differential geometry, and geometric functional analysis. Depending on interest, participants will have different take-aways from the summer school. A geometric topologist may learn about handle analysis and the specifics of the topology of manifolds. An algebraic topologist might learn about how classifying spaces, generalized (co)homology theories, and algebraic K-theory are used in practice.  A geometer might learn about metrics of positive scalar curvature and tools for the topological classification of manifolds with geometric structure. A geometric group theorist might learn about applications of (co)homology of groups and large scale geometry. A geometric functional analyst would learn about a world parallel to that of C*-algebras and noncommutative geometry.

Over the years, mathematicians have developed various topological invariants, or in other words, quantities that are associated to shapes and can distinguish between those that have different properties. Homology is a well-known such invariant, which can be associated to any multi-dimensional shape, and which is a quantitative measure of the number of holes in a space. A circle, for instance, has only a one-dimensional hole, whereas the surface of a doughnut has two one-dimensional holes, a meridian and a longitude, that are not filled in by the surface itself, and an additional two-dimensional hole. Floer homology is a more refined invariant that is responsible for some of the most important recent advances in the study of knotted closed loops in space, three-dimensional shapes, and shapes with a geometry known as a symplectic structure that is exhibited by phase spaces in classical mechanics. This project brings together several researchers working in different areas of topology and geometry to study Floer homology. The main goal of the project is the following: To every knot, three-dimensional shape, or symplectic shape, one should associate a different object, called a Floer space or a Floer homotopy type, whose (ordinary) homology is the Floer homology of the initial shape. This has been accomplished so far in a limited number of cases. A general theory of Floer spaces will lead to new advances in several areas. Furthermore, the study of Floer spaces will be based on techniques from a subfield of topology called homotopy theory. This project will create a community of scholars at the interface of these current and extremely research active areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Floer homology is a fundamental tool in geometry and topology, whose applications range from the Arnold conjecture to the surgery characterization of various knots. Floer homology has also laid the basis for completely unexpected interconnections between algebraic and symplectic geometry in the form of homological mirror symmetry. Floer homotopy theory, an extension to spaces rather than homology groups, has been implemented in a small number of cases, leading to significant applications, for example, the resolution of the triangulation conjecture in high dimensions and work on immersed Lagrangian spheres. Further, the ideas behind Floer homotopy inspired the construction of a Khovanov homotopy type associated to knots in the three-sphere. The main scientific goal of this project is to give a general construction of Floer homotopy. The necessary foundational work will build upon recent advances in multiple areas. These include the conceptual advances in equivariant stable homotopy theory stemming from the resolution of Kervaire invariant one problem, and the development of new approaches to define virtual fundamental classes in Floer theory. The project aims to put the homotopical and homological variants of Floer theory on equal footing. As a consequence, new applications in both symplectic and low-dimensional topology are anticipated, for example: (i) a spectral Fukaya category associated to a symplectic manifold will be constructed; (ii) the Heegaard Floer theory of Ozsvath and Szabo will be used to produce a computable invariant parallel to the celebrated Bauer-Furuta invariant for four-manifolds; (iii) Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy types will be studied using the tools of equivariant stable homotopy theory; and (iv) the Khovanov homotopy type will be extended to give invariants of knot cobordisms and tangles."

Objects of this type are called polytopal complexes and provide a general approach to the study of other fields of mathematics, such as differential geometry and algebraic topology. The main advantage of discretizing is the possibility to leverage computational tools. Simple questions on the structure of polytopes, such as the Hirsch conjecture, have foundational importance in optimization. Meanwhile discrete Morse theory, a reduction tool to simplify a given polytopal complex, is employed both in pure mathematics and in big data analysis, to understand high-dimensional shapes. The project builds on these tools and expands their application. Further tools arise from the study of networks, which are polytopal complexes of dimension one. A plan is to integrate in this line of work new random models, with the goal of revealing fundamental properties of intersection patterns of algebraic varieties.<br/><br/>Enumerative aspects on the number of polytopes and spheres with given number of facets have importance beyond pure mathematics, in Regge calculus and simplicial quantum gravity. Techniques from metric geometry can provide desired exponential upper bounds. Another problem with importance in applied mathematics is the polynomial Hirsch conjecture, which was recently proven with metric methods for flag polytopes. Techniques ranging from knot theory to differential and hyperbolic geometry may be applied to better understand obstructions and constructions in Discrete Morse Theory, thereby revealing when and how we can simplify a given shape. A new perspective in this project is to connect discrete Morse theory with the notion of embeddability. A further goal is to lift the classical theory of polytope graphs (for example Balinski's theorem or the Hirsch conjecture) into a more general theory of intersection patterns of algebraic varieties, where algebraic tools such as liaison theory and local cohomology can be employed. Integrating this theory with the study of random simplicial complexes may provide some new random models in commutative algebra."

One- and two-dimensional spaces are well-understood, as are dimensions five and above; roughly, in the former, there are not enough dimensions for interesting phenomena, and in the latter, there are so many dimensions that anything interesting has enough room to become uninteresting. Low-dimensional topology focuses on three- and four-dimensions, where many unique phenomena occur. One central question is whether a knotted loop in three-dimensions becomes unknotted when one allows a fourth dimension. One can also ask what happens upon cutting a knot out of space, and then filling in the resulting void in a different way. Knot theory has applications to the very small (e.g., the behavior of knotted strands of DNA) as well as the extremely large (e.g., the shape of the universe).

She will also organize a workshop for undergraduates to present their research and learn more about careers in mathematics.<br/><br/>Heegaard Floer homology, developed by Ozsvath and Szabo, is a powerful tool for understanding low-dimensional topology.

In a different direction, the PI plans to study which manifolds arise from surgery on an n-component link, using the link surgery formula of Manolescu and Ozsvath.

This project studies knots and links, knotted circular strings in three-dimensional space. Three-dimensional manifolds can be mathematically represented by framed links, where the so-called framings are instructions to modify the space near the link. As a consequence, the study of knots and links is a fundamental tool in understanding three-dimensional manifolds. In this project, the investigator aims to get a better understanding of how knots behave as they move through time as a fourth dimension. This line of investigation constitutes an important subfield of low-dimensional topology known as concordance. An algebraic operation with properties similar to the addition of numbers can be performed on the collection of knots, and this leads to the construction of an algebraic object known as the concordance group. The concordance group is an extremely complicated entity, which is poorly understood despite great efforts by many mathematicians.  To gain perspective on its structure, the investigator will introduce a notion of distance and investigate how certain geometric operations change this distance.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of knot and link concordance.  The investigator will do this by studying the concordance group as both an abelian group with associated filtrations, such as the n-solvable and bipolar filtrations, and also as a metric space with discrete and non-discrete metrics. Specific projects are as follows:  (1) show that the ""other half'"" of the n-solvable filtration is nontrivial; (2) determine if successive quotients of the n-solvable filtration of the link concordance group are abelian; (3) understand the relationship between the Milnor invariants of derivatives of a knot and the concordance class of the knot; (4) view the smooth knot concordance group as a metric space and study natural geometric operators acting on it (in particular, show that there is a non-discrete metric on the subgroup of topologically slice knots T and, in addition, show that the successive quotients of the bipolar filtration are nontrivial on T); (5) define the knot complex and study its algebraic topology."

The first is purely geometric, asking which shapes can be cut up and rearranged into one another.  For example, given 250 sq ft of carpet, is it always possible to carpet a 250 sq ft room with it?  One may think that this depends on the shape of the room, but it actually does not: assuming that both the carpet and the room have straight sides, it is always possible.  However, this is no longer true with three dimensions: if you have a 100 cu in box to fill with foam rubber and I give you 100 cu in of foam rubber, you may not be able to fill up the box because the rubber may be the wrong shape.  Generalizing these problems to other dimensions and geometries is very difficult, and very little is known about the answers.  The second influence is more philosophical: as mathematicians, we often address problems by ""cutting"" them up into smaller problems, solving each of the smaller problems and the reassembling the solutions.  However, there is always an important last step: figuring out whether there is a unique way to reassemble a solution to the large problem, or whether there are many.  The current project on scissors congruence addresses these issues simultaneously by constructing a framework for ""cutting"" and ""pasting"" together different kinds of ""objects,"" be they shapes or mathematical objects.  This framework allows us to analyze all such questions together and learn more about the difficulties that arise when reassembling solutions.  In addition, it has applications in many different subfields of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, logic, number theory and category theory, producing a novel viewpoint from which to unify different problems.<br/><br/>A scissors congruence problem is the problem of classifying certain objects (such as definable sets, varieties, or polytopes) up to decomposition and isomorphism. Using previously developed techniques for turning a scissors congruence problem into a spectrum, this project continues analyzing scissors congruence problems through the lens of stable homotopy theory. This project has three general objectives: (1) analyzing the Grothendieck ring of varieties using the higher homotopical information present in the scissors congruence spectrum, (2) extending results of Goncharov relating mixed Tate motives to spherical scissors congruence groups to scissors congruence spectra, and (3) exploring the possibility of using scissors congruence spectra for developing spectrum-valued motivic integration. By generalizing classical maps between scissors congruence problems to scissors congruence spectra we hope to produce new geometric and algebraic invariants which will extend understanding of these problems."

The spheres, which are among the simplest geometric objects, are building blocks for more complex entities. The homotopy groups of spheres, which are used to study the connections between these basic components, are collections of continuous functions between spheres considered up to deformations. Many problems in other fields, especially differential topology, have been reduced to the study of these groups, which is notoriously difficult. However, a bridge has been built between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology that allows us to use sophisticated algebraic theory to enable calculations of the homotopy groups of spheres. This bridge is known as chromatic homotopy theory. This project studies two of the most important structural conjectures in this field, the telescope and chromatic splitting conjectures. It has a strong computational component that will provide data to help study these two fundamental problems.<br/><br/>Chromatic homotopy theory uses higher analogues of K-theory which give rise to higher periodicity in the stable homotopy groups of spheres. The chromatic splitting conjecture is an attempt at explaining the relationship between different periodicities. Recently, the PI has disproved a special case of this conjecture. In a project with Goerss and Henn, the PI aims to explain this failure and reformulate the conjecture. In a related project with Xu, the PI plans to compute the homotopy groups of the K(2)-local sphere at the prime two. These computations use self-dual resolutions which appear to be related to Brown-Commenetz duality and the structure of the K(2)-local Picard group. The PI plans to study this connection with Bobkova, Goerss and Henn. A parallel part of the project is to study periodicity in relation to the telescope conjecture. In work with Behrens, Bhattacharya, Culver and Xu, the PI plans to detect periodic elements using a resolution of the sphere by topological modular forms. The telescope conjecture gives a connection between periodic elements detected by such methods and those detected by the K(2)-local sphere. Comparing the two computations may shed light on this conjecture."

Increasingly, these models take the form of geometric objects. This project focuses on a class of geometric objects that arise as models in a number of contexts, including robotics and genetics. Geometric properties of these models and their symmetry groups are reflected in properties of the physical systems. Questions may involve either local geometry (what happens near a particular point) or large-scale geometry (the structure of the object viewed from a distance). This project concerns large-scale geometry.  By introducing a new notion of a ""boundary"" for the geometries in question, we are able to identify and quantify certain types of behavior, known as hyperbolic behavior.  The study of these boundaries, and their implications for the geometry and symmetry of the objects in question, is the main theme of this project.<br/><br/>Boundaries of geodesic metric spaces have played an important role in the study of hyperbolic groups, for example in proving rigidity theorems and dynamical properties.  Boundaries can also be defined for CAT(0) spaces, however they are not quasi-isometry invariant, hence do not give a well-defined boundary for a CAT(0) group.  In recent work, the principal investigator and Sultan introduced a new boundary, called the Morse boundary, for CAT(0) spaces which is quasi-isometry invariant and behaves more like the boundary of a hyperbolic space. Subsequently, Cordes generalized this construction to obtain a Morse boundary for any proper geodesic metric space.  This offers a potentially powerful new tool for studying large classes of groups, such as acylindrically hyperbolic groups.  The first part of this project will investigate properties of these boundaries and their implications for the groups in question.  The second part of the project concerns automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs).  Automorphism groups of free groups, mapping class groups, and linear groups have many properties in common.  Automorphism groups of RAAGs give a context in which to study these commonalities.  As Teichmuller space has been central to the study of mapping class groups, Culler and Vogtmann's Outer space has been a fundamental tool in the study of automorphism groups of free groups.  Similarly, analogues of the curve complex of a surface have been introduced for free groups and shown to be hyperbolic.

Soon it was noticed that hyperbolic manifolds formed the largest and the least understood class of manifolds. Informally, a hyperbolic 3-manifold is an object modeled locally on 3-dimensional space that has hyperbolic metric. An important subclass of such manifolds are knot and link complements in 3-sphere. Additionally, knots and links are an object of study on their own, and knot theory has a number of applications in pure mathematics, as well as in applied fields of study. A knot is easy to draw as a planar diagram with information about underpasses/overpasses at crossings. However, establishing the connection between the diagram and geometric properties of the corresponding 3-manifold is a hard task. This is the first main goal of the proposal. The other goal is exploring the relation between geometric invariants and invariants that come from other areas of mathematics. The PI is engaged in mentoring student research and developing software that helps to use the geometric perspective, and will continue these activities.<br/><br/>With M. Thistlethwaite, the PI made progress towards the first goal by suggesting a new method for computing the hyperbolic structure directly from a link diagram. With W. Neumann, she generalized this approach to parameterize hyperbolic structure of a cusped 3-manifold. This project blends the new method with various techniques for a systematic study of the intrinsic geometry of hyperbolic links and its connection with a combinatorial picture. Among the open problems considered are questions about the canonical cell decomposition, hyperbolic volume, lengths of various arcs, geometric triangulations, etc. While these questions are interesting a priori, a significant part of the project is concerned with immediate applications of the geometric insight obtained. For example, the PI will explore the relation between geometric and quantum link invariants, investigate the connection between the geometry and arithmetic invariants of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, approach tangle tabulation using geometry and computer calculations, and tackle some other open questions."

It involves applying homotopy theory (a branch of algebraic topology) to study arithmetic and geometry,  using coarse aspects or invariants of spaces to study arithmetic phenomena.  A generalization of the number of d-dimensional holes in a space is used to control the solutions to certain polynomial equations. When d is equal to one, this has applications to a program of Grothendieck to control solutions using the loops on a space.  Maps between certain spaces induce maps between the d-dimensional holes giving rise to a notion of degree. A generalization of degree due to F. Morel is used to study arithmetic properties of singularities. This project furthermore includes the design and implementation of a series of four week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During each of four summers, approximately eight high school students will work on an important mathematical problem which has an elegant or useful known solution, learning the background material as necessary, and then creating learning materials for other students of the same age group. The students will be accompanied by a teacher from their high schools. In addition to the work on the specific mathematical problem, career options in mathematics will be presented and support and mentorship will be provided for students interested in pursuing mathematical careers.<br/><br/>Certain arithmetic and geometric phenomena which appear delicate are invariant under appropriate notions of homotopy. Such phenomena motivate the use of homotopy theory to study arithmetic or geometry. The sub-projects contained in this project share the perspective wherein problems in arithmetic or geometry are approached by using Morel-Veoveodky's A1-homotopy theory and applying realization functors. Sub-project 1 studies an enrichment of the Section Conjecture and an approach to proving it. Running the same methods backwards produces results on the differential graded algebra of the absolute Galois group. Sub-project 2 applies an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence in tale homotopy to compute (co)homology of branched covers. This has applications to the study of the non-abelian Galois representation given by the fundamental group of the projective line with three points removed, and has applications to sub-project 1. The first step of sub-project 3 is to prove a joint conjecture with Jesse Kass that the quadratic form appearing in the Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili Signature Formula can be interpreted as a local degree in A1-homotopy, where the natural notion of degree is a quadratic form. We then enrich the Milnor number and use this enrichment to study arithmetic properties of singularities."

One goal is to better understand the knot concordance group, in particular the difference between the smooth and topological categories. Concordance invariants coming from Floer homology, such as d-invariants and epsilon, are well-suited for this task. Specifically, the principal investigator aims to show that the subgroup of the smooth concordance group generated by topologically slice knots contains an infinite rank summand. A different approach to concordance is via bordered Floer homology. In the same sense that knot Floer homology categorifies the Alexander polynomial, one may hope that the bordered Floer homology of a Seifert surface categorifies the Seifert form. Many classical concordance invariants can be defined in terms of the Seifert form, and the project will investigate how these invariants manifest themselves within the bordered invariants.<br/><br/>The structure of knotted curves in space is intimately related to our understanding of the shape of 3- and 4-dimensional space. Thinking of time as the fourth dimension, the study of knot concordance becomes a question about the evolution of knots over time. By putting different restrictions on how knots may evolve, one obtains different definitions of the complexity of a knot. These measures of complexity have applications from the very small (e.g., the behavior of knotted strands of DNA) to the very large (e.g., the shape of the universe)."

Two distinguished graduate students will give hour-long presentations and one invited faculty member, Dr. Abakuse Mbrika of the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, will give a one-hour keynote address.  Invited undergraduate researchers will participate in a poster session. USTARS promotes diversity within the mathematical community by providing a platform for collaboration and professional development.  Participants are exposed to a variety of current research, ideas, and results, and meet underrepresented professors and students who will become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Indeed, the conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and hence is well-positioned to encourage participation from a diverse group of students. The participants of the conference will continue to influence the next generation of students by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the symposium is to showcase the mathematical research being conducted by underrepresented graduate students. This is done by structuring the meeting so that speakers will give 30-minute parallel research talks focusing on research leading to their graduate theses. Graduate students will give at least 75% of these presentations. Topics of prior years' presentations include: combinatorics, braid groups, graph theory, knot theory, representation theory, number theory, and algebraic geometry. In addition to the parallel sessions, two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour lectures and a poster session featuring invited undergraduates is also planned. Given the high quality and diversity of talks and participants ""The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) Invited Volume"" was created in 2014. This is a new series aimed specifically at disseminating the research of USTARS participants. The intention of this Invited Volume is to provide graduate students with an opportunity to publish their results in order to further their development as mathematical researchers. In light of this, a yearly online volume will be published at the conclusion of each annual research symposium.<br/><br/>http://www.ustars.org"

The first is purely geometric, asking which shapes can be cut up and rearranged into one another.  For example, given 250 sq ft of carpet, is it always possible to carpet a 250 sq ft room with it?  One may think that this depends on the shape of the room, but it actually does not: assuming that both the carpet and the room have straight sides, it is always possible.  However, this is no longer true with three dimensions: if you have a 100 cu in box to fill with foam rubber and I give you 100 cu in of foam rubber, you may not be able to fill up the box because the rubber may be the wrong shape.  Generalizing these problems to other dimensions and geometries is very difficult, and very little is known about the answers.  The second influence is more philosophical: as mathematicians, we often address problems by ""cutting"" them up into smaller problems, solving each of the smaller problems and the reassembling the solutions.  However, there is always an important last step: figuring out whether there is a unique way to reassemble a solution to the large problem, or whether there are many.  The current project on scissors congruence addresses these issues simultaneously by constructing a framework for ""cutting"" and ""pasting"" together different kinds of ""objects,"" be they shapes or mathematical objects.  This framework allows us to analyze all such questions together and learn more about the difficulties that arise when reassembling solutions.  In addition, it has applications in many different subfields of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, logic, number theory and category theory, producing a novel viewpoint from which to unify different problems.<br/><br/>A scissors congruence problem is the problem of classifying certain objects (such as definable sets, varieties, or polytopes) up to decomposition and isomorphism. Using previously developed techniques for turning a scissors congruence problem into a spectrum, this project continues analyzing scissors congruence problems through the lens of stable homotopy theory. This project has three general objectives: (1) analyzing the Grothendieck ring of varieties using the higher homotopical information present in the scissors congruence spectrum, (2) extending results of Goncharov relating mixed Tate motives to spherical scissors congruence groups to scissors congruence spectra, and (3) exploring the possibility of using scissors congruence spectra for developing spectrum-valued motivic integration. By generalizing classical maps between scissors congruence problems to scissors congruence spectra we hope to produce new geometric and algebraic invariants which will extend understanding of these problems."

(Roughly, Heegaard Floer homology forms a (3+1)-dimensional topological field theory, and bordered Heegaard Floer homology is a (2+1+1)-dimensional extension of this field theory.)  This project seeks to further develop bordered Heegaard Floer homology.

It can also be sliced into a family of disks with boundary on the standard, unkotted circle (except that one disk will have a point missing): think of the disks as soap bubbles on a bubble-wand, and the family as coming from blowing on the soap harder or less hard.  If you start with a knotted circle K, it may or may not be possible to slice space into a family of surfaces with boundary on K.  So, it is natural to ask:  for which knots K is there such a family of surfaces?  Knots for which there is such a family are called ""fibered knots"", and finding ways to tell if a knot is fibered turns out to be both interesting and hard.  Surprisingly, some of the most effective tools for answering this kind of question are closely related to ideas from modern mathematical physics, quantum field theory, and string theory, and have applications not just to 3-dimensional questions but also to 4-dimensional ones.  A family of invariants called Heegaard Floer homology is one such tool.  This project seeks to further understand the structure of Heegaard Floer homology, with the goals of developing ways to compute it more efficiently and finding other related tools adapted to different problems."

Behrens<br/><br/>This project aims to address major problems in the field of algebraic topology.  Topology is the study of geometry (in any number of dimensions) where you identify one geometric object with another if one can be deformed into the other.  The goal of algebraic topology is to ascribe discrete algebraic invariants to these geometric objects to distinguish their topological types.  In this way, distinguishing geometric objects is reduced to algebraic computations.  Such algebraic computations are desirable, because they can be handled by a computer, for example.  An early success of algebraic topology was the classification of all possible surfaces (2-dimensional objects) by means of Euler characteristic (a number, defined by Euler in the 18th century) and orientability (e.g., a Mobius strip is nonorientable). By contrast, the situation in higher dimensions is much more intractable, and is the subject of active research.  Understanding the topological type of geometric objects is a fundamental act of scientific/mathematical inquiry, comparable to the study of prime numbers, or the classification of the fundamental particles that constitute matter and carry forces.  However, there are also important applications of algebraic topology. We live in a 3-dimensional universe (4-dimensions if you include time).  What is the shape of this universe?  Addressing this question requires a working knowledge of the possible shapes in 3 or 4 dimensions. The fundamental interactions of matter and forces in particle physics is governed by quantum field theory.  The global behavior of the partition functions of such theories involves topological considerations.  Such considerations are impossible to avoid in the context of string theory, as a moving string traces out a surface.  Topological computations have recently been applied to solve problems in solid state physics.  Also, data involving the interrelation of a large number of variables naturally traces out a high dimensional geometric object in a higher dimensional space.  The study of such data-sets using algebraic topology is the subject of the new and active field of topological data analysis.<br/><br/>The specific projects proposed are aimed at shedding light on many problems in algebraic topology surrounding the homotopy groups of spheres, chromatic homotopy theory, and topological modular forms (tmf).  The principal investigator (PI) and his collaborators will engage in a project to develop the tmf-based Adams Spectral Sequence to the point where it can be actually used for calculations.  The classical Adams spectral sequence has succeeded in computing the first 60 stable stems.  We expect that since tmf is a much more sensitive cohomology theory, when properly developed, its associated Adams spectral sequence could push these computations into the 90s, which would shed light on the only remaining case of the Kervaire Invariant Problem, in dimension 126. The PI also plans on using the tmf-based Adams spectral sequence to investigate the Telescope Conjecture at chromatic level 2.  Unstable homotopy will also be studied through the chromatic lens, using a generalization of Quillen-Sullivan rational homotopy theory based on topological Andre-Quillen cohomology.  Computations in stable homotopy theory at generic primes using ultra-filters will be investigated using Drinfeld Modules. The Chromatic Splitting Conjecture will be investigated using Goodwillie calculus.  The PI will also study the conjectural relationship between the Ochanine genus, topological modular forms, and smooth structures on loop spaces of spheres."

Both  invariants associate chain complexes to knots whose chain homotopy types (and consequently, homology groups) are knot invariants. This project has two major research goals. The first goal is to extend various aspects of these homological invariants to stable homotopy types, i.e., construct new knot invariant topological spaces (well-defined up to stable homotopy equivalences) whose homology groups are the existing invariants. This will produce higher structures on the homological invariants which will be useful for studying certain geometric properties of knots, such as their four-ball genus. The second goal of this project is to study the relationship between the homological invariants. The project seeks to find new spectral sequences, and combinatorial reformulations of the existing spectral sequences, from the Khovanov homology invariants to the knot Floer homology invariants. This will lead to a better understanding of why these two invariants coming from very different origins share so many similarities.<br/><br/>Topology is the branch of mathematics that studies shapes of spaces; and low dimensional topology concentrates on spaces up to dimension four. Knot theory is an important sub-field of low dimensional topology where one studies one-dimensional objects inside three-dimensional spaces, for example, knotted pieces of strings inside the (three-dimensional Euclidean) space that we live in. In addition to being an extremely valuable tool in low dimensional topology, knot theory has also proven to be useful in real world applications: from analysing knotting in DNA to studying mixing in liquids, and from estimating energies of orbits inside a magnetic field to creating new data encryption schemes. A fundamental problem in knot theory is the knot isotopy problem: to determine if a given knot can transform into another one without tearing or crossing itself (such a transformation is called a knot isotopy). Knot invariants are mathematical objects, such as numbers or groups, that one associates to knots, and which remain unchanged during such a knot isotopy. Therefore, knot invariants are used extensively in the knot isotopy problem: if one finds some knot invariant that takes different values on the two given knots, then one concludes that the two knots are not isotopic. The current project is based on knot theory, and it seeks to study properties of certain previously known knot invariants, and to extend them to construct new knot invariants. The project will lead to dispersion of mathematical knowledge, particularly in the area of low-dimensional topology, via a variety of means. This project will fund undergraduate students for summer research, week-long workshops on low-dimensional topology, and a wiki-based website on knot theory."

Goodwillie<br/><br/>This award provides support for principal investigator's research in algebraic topology, which uses algebraic tools to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to certain equivalence. Manifolds are topological spaces that locally resemble Euclidean spaces. The first part of the project holds the promise of new invariants for families of manifolds and new connections between higher-dimensional geometric topology and string topology. The second part should lead to other new invariants for families of manifolds with a group action. The third part will continue the study of ""functor calculus"", a theory developed by the PI previously, from a geometric point of view. Graduate students will be involved and trained in the project.<br/><br/>The planned research has three components. The first involves systematically detecting that about manifolds which is invisible to surgery and algebraic K-theory, beginning with the homotopy fiber of the Hatcher suspension map for pseudoisotopy spaces. Though the appropriate analogue of K-theory is elusive, the corresponding analogue of topological cyclic homology and the cyclotomic trace seems to be within reach. The second is concerned with actions of finite groups on manifolds; the goal is to develop G versions of various constructions related to spaces of manifolds, and especially of spaces of h-cobordisms. The third is about the ""geometric"" view of homotopy functor calculus, and especially about some fundamental questions about jets and differential operators in that context."

This project studies relation between algebraic properties of groups and geometry of spaces for which groups appear as symmetries. Another part of the project deals with geometry of mechanical devices such as bar-and-joint mechanisms and gear trains. The project will involve rigorous mathematical definitions of such devices and analysis of possible motion spaces (configuration spaces) of the devices.<br/><br/>This project is a continuation of the principal investigator's research of previous years in the areas of geometry, topology, geometric group theory and theory of mechanical devices. The subjects of the planned research revolve around geometry of group actions on various spaces, geometry of buildings, interactions of algebraic geometry, hyperbolic geometry and geometric group theory. Another part of the project deals with geometry of mechanical devices such as gear trains.  The goal here is to give mathematical definition of such devices, generalizing the definition of a mechanical linkage as a finite metric graph and proving a universality theorem for configuration spaces of these devices, namely that any algebraic partial differential relation can be realized as the configuration space of some device."

Work of William Thurston brought the geometry of such spaces more clearly into view as a central feature to explore. The triumph of this approach was Perelman's proof of Thurston's geometrization conjecture, that each three-dimensional manifold could be naturally broken up into pieces, each with a uniform geometry. The study of these geometries is frequently reduced, via a notion of rigidity, to considering simple combinatorial structures arising from loops on surfaces. The proposed research will explore how these structures predict volume, diameter, length and other aspects of the geometry, relating to notions from quantum physics.<br/><br/>A longstanding connection between volume of hyperbolic three-manifolds and Weil-Petersson distance relied on a combinatorial comparison via the pants graph which organizes maximal multicurves on a surface, yet other connections were known to arise from work of Witten via renormalized volume. Recent work of Schlenker made this connection explicit in the context of quasi-Fuchsian manifolds, and PI's proposed work will develop this idea further to explicitly relate fibered 3-manifolds and translation distiance. More generally, a primary project in the proposed research is to solidify and extend the connection between combinatorics and geometry in closed manifolds, and to continue to investigate the structure of deformation spaces of Kleinian groups with these tools. As an example of the power of these techniques, bi-Lipschitz models for 'random' Heegaard splittings provide a full solution (with Rivin and Souto) to the conjecture of Dunfield and Thurston that random Heegaard splittings are almost surely hyperbolic and their volume grows linearly. Finally, the PI will pursue projects with Minsky, and with Modami, Leininger and Rafi on the role of combinatorics in the geometry of geodesics in the Weil-Petersson metric, investigating disparities between Teichmuller and Weil-Petersson geodesics in terms of unique ergodicity."

Over the years, mathematicians have developed various topological invariants, or in other words, quantities that are associated to shapes and can distinguish between those that have different properties. Homology is a well-known such invariant, which can be associated to any multi-dimensional shape, and which is a quantitative measure of the number of holes in a space. A circle, for instance, has only a one-dimensional hole, whereas the surface of a doughnut has two one-dimensional holes, a meridian and a longitude, that are not filled in by the surface itself, and an additional two-dimensional hole. Floer homology is a more refined invariant that is responsible for some of the most important recent advances in the study of knotted closed loops in space, three-dimensional shapes, and shapes with a geometry known as a symplectic structure that is exhibited by phase spaces in classical mechanics. This project brings together several researchers working in different areas of topology and geometry to study Floer homology. The main goal of the project is the following: To every knot, three-dimensional shape, or symplectic shape, one should associate a different object, called a Floer space or a Floer homotopy type, whose (ordinary) homology is the Floer homology of the initial shape. This has been accomplished so far in a limited number of cases. A general theory of Floer spaces will lead to new advances in several areas. Furthermore, the study of Floer spaces will be based on techniques from a subfield of topology called homotopy theory. This project will create a community of scholars at the interface of these current and extremely research active areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Floer homology is a fundamental tool in geometry and topology, whose applications range from the Arnold conjecture to the surgery characterization of various knots. Floer homology has also laid the basis for completely unexpected interconnections between algebraic and symplectic geometry in the form of homological mirror symmetry. Floer homotopy theory, an extension to spaces rather than homology groups, has been implemented in a small number of cases, leading to significant applications, for example, the resolution of the triangulation conjecture in high dimensions and work on immersed Lagrangian spheres. Further, the ideas behind Floer homotopy inspired the construction of a Khovanov homotopy type associated to knots in the three-sphere. The main scientific goal of this project is to give a general construction of Floer homotopy. The necessary foundational work will build upon recent advances in multiple areas. These include the conceptual advances in equivariant stable homotopy theory stemming from the resolution of Kervaire invariant one problem, and the development of new approaches to define virtual fundamental classes in Floer theory. The project aims to put the homotopical and homological variants of Floer theory on equal footing. As a consequence, new applications in both symplectic and low-dimensional topology are anticipated, for example: (i) a spectral Fukaya category associated to a symplectic manifold will be constructed; (ii) the Heegaard Floer theory of Ozsvath and Szabo will be used to produce a computable invariant parallel to the celebrated Bauer-Furuta invariant for four-manifolds; (iii) Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy types will be studied using the tools of equivariant stable homotopy theory; and (iv) the Khovanov homotopy type will be extended to give invariants of knot cobordisms and tangles."
