A surface is a two-dimensional space, in other words, a two-dimensional version of the world we live in.  Surfaces come in many shapes (for instance the surface of a ball is different from the surface of a doughnut) and they arise in many varied contexts, from physics to robotics to data analysis to quantum field theory.  The symmetries of a surface form a beautiful and rich theory that has been the focus of intense study over the past century.  One surprising phenomenon is that there are combinatorial objects called curve complexes - looking nothing themselves like a surface - that have the same symmetries as a surface.  Many such objects have been discovered in the past twenty years.  The first goal of this project is to give (essentially) a complete list of such curve complexes.  This will be a capstone in the well-studied theory of symmetries of curve complexes.  The second project is to study a certain centrally important subset of the set of symmetries of a surface - the so-called Torelli group.  These symmetries are significant because of their strong connections to algebraic geometry and representation theory.  Basic properties of the Torelli group are unknown, despite the fact that this group has been studied heavily for fifty years.  This project aims to understand the basic finiteness properties of the Torelli group - for instance finite presentability.  This is one of the main open problems in the theory of surfaces.  Using a computer-aided search,  new footholds have been found into this problem.  The third project is a proposed algorithm for quickly computing the basic properties of a single symmetry  of a surface. For instance, this algorithm computes the entropy, which is the amount of mixing being achieved on the surface.  Other such algorithms exist, but ours is much faster.  For instance, using an appropriate notion of size (called word length), the existing algorithms can handle symmetries of size 30 (or so) and our algorithm can very easily handle symmetries of size upwards of 30,000.  In conjunction with these projects, the principal investigator will also be completing a textbook for undergraduates on a related subject, called Office Hours with a Geometric Group Theorist, and also will continue to run a professional development workshop for graduate students, the Topology Students Workshop.<br/><br/>The mapping class group of a surface is the group of homotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the surface.  Among other things, the mapping class group encodes the outer automorphism group of the surface fundamental group, the (orbifold) fundamental group of the moduli space of the surface, and the isomorphism types of surface bundles over arbitrary spaces.  The mapping class group also has connections to many, many areas of mathematics, including dynamics, group theory, number theory, quantum field theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry, just to name a few. The goals laid out in this project are threefold: (1) find a general theory for when a combinatorial, algebraic, or geometric object associated to a surface has the extended mapping class group as its group of automorphisms; (2) determine the finiteness properties of the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class group, specifically whether or not the Torelli group is finitely presented; and (3) establish a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the conjugacy invariants for a pseudo-Anosov mapping class.  Problem (1) was conceived by Ivanov; with Brendle, the PI has made substantial progress on this question.  Problem (2) is one of the most important open problems in the theory of mapping class groups.  It is a very hard question going back to the work of Dehn and Nielsen in the 1920s.  Bestvina, Lucarelli, Vogtmann, and the PI are making significant progress by performing a computer-aided search.  Various algorithms for Problem (3) are known, most notably the Bestvina-Handel algorithm.  With Yurttas the PI has a new algorithm for computing train tracks that works in quadratic time; in practice it is much quicker than the Bestvina-Handel algorithm (which we conjecture to be doubly exponential).  All three projects address fundamental questions in the theory of mapping class groups and in all three cases the PI and his collaborators have already made significant headway. In addition to these research goals, the PI also proposes to continue work on two major projects that have direct impact on graduate and undergraduate students.  The first is the Topology Students Workshop, a conference that serves both as a research conference in topology for graduate students as well as a professional development workshop.  The second is Office Hours with a Geometric Group Theorist, an introductory text on Geometric Group Theory for undergraduates."

The annual international Gokova Geometry-Topology Conferences was founded in 1992 with the purpose of creating a lively informal environment where the latest results of Geometry and Topology are discussed by active world-renowned experts and junior researchers along with enthusiastic graduate students. Many junior now-well-known mathematicians of the field got their early international exposure in these friendly conferences. These conferences aim to increase participation of junior researchers and experts from US. Gokova conferences will continue to provide a platform for exchanging ideas between American, European and Asian mathematicians in timely fashion.<br/><br/>The focus topics for each conference are  determined by the Scientific Committee during the previous year based on the major scientific breakthroughs that occur in the field, and on  availability of outstanding speakers to present them to a broad audience of geometers and topologists. The list of the topics of current interest that the organizers hope to explore via mini-courses and/or lecture series in the next few years include: C. Manolescu's solution of the triangulation conjecture (Manolescu will be giving a minicourse in 2015 meeting); Flexibility phenomena in symplectic and contact topology (Y. Eliashberg, E. Murphy, and collaborators,one of them will be  minicourse); Geometric approaches to mirror symmetry and extensions of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture (D. Auroux, K. Fukaya, M. Abouzaid, T. Ekholm); Corks, surgeries, and exotic 4-manifolds (Akbulut, Yasui, Ruberman); Refined enumerations and knot theory (Cherednik, Goettsche, Shende).

It is applicable whenever one is interested in studying qualitative aspects of a system, or whenever there might be imprecision in the specification of the state of a system.  In recent years the methods of homotopy theory have found use in fields as diverse as condensed matter physics and the foundations of mathematics.  This project aims to bolster these relationships with new tools from algebraic topology, and to apply them to other areas of mathematics and science.  There are applications of this work to condensed matter physics, classical algebraic geometry, and, in the long term, to education.<br/><br/>The scope of this project involves several interrelated areas of study.  One of these, on algebraic vector bundles, depicts a new interface between complex analysis and algebraic topology, and is intended to get at the obstruction to topological vector bundles having algebraic structures.  Another organizes tools developed for the study of differential manifolds into higher categories, in service of providing a general topological expression for the evaluation of ""Gaussian integrals"" in topological quantum field theories.  The two principal investigators will work jointly on a project designed to establish a striking, conjectured, structural result for ""groups of units"" occurring in algebraic topology.  This result has implications for the construction of topological quantum field theories and offers a potentially new approach to understanding the ""homotopy groups of spheres."" Three further projects involve new generalizations of ideas in homotopy theory, in the contexts of algebraic K-theory, ""transchromatic homotopy theory"" and in a relationship between Goodwillie calculus and the construction of ""smash"" products in the stabilizatons of infinity categories."

Understanding these spaces and structures is central to understanding the shape and properties of our universe.  For example, Einstein's description of gravity via general relativity relies on mathematical tools for understanding manifolds that are not too different from those under development in this project.  Indeed, many of the theories under study have applications and origins in physics.  A major goal of the project is to develop methods that might be used to unify several existing and important tools for studying 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds.  Such unification would likely reveal interesting connections between disparate fields of mathematics.  An important method for understanding higher dimensional spaces is to study lower dimensional spaces that embed into them; much of this research project will be focused on understanding 1-dimensional spaces called knots embedded in 3-dimensional manifolds.  Knot theory was initiated as a subfield of topology in the 1880's by the chemist Lord Kelvin, and it has many other interesting applications outside of mathematics -- to the study of how certain enzymes alter the knotting of DNA, for example.  One of the project goals is to unify two very important, but prima facie different, tools for studying knots; there is tantalizing conjectural evidence of a concrete relationship between these two theories.  Another means of studying 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds is by understanding the sorts of geometric structures they support.  Considerable effort in this project will go into understanding contact structures on 3-dimensional manifolds.  In addition to their applications in mathematics, contact structures are important in classical mechanics, thermodynamics, dynamical systems, and in the study of liquid crystals.  This project also contains several explicit directions for student research, at both undergraduate and graduate levels, and will support the PI's teaching and mentoring activities.  In addition, the project will serve the broader community by creating a Wiki repository of open problems, with background and context.  The PI will also use the funds from this award to start a Boston-area graduate seminar, and to participate in math outreach for the general public at the Cambridge Science Festival.<br/><br/>Floer theory has revolutionized the study of the topology and geometry in low dimensions.  Many of these Floer theories appear to encode the same information, indicating deep connections between fields like symplectic geometry and gauge theory.  These and connections between Floer theory and link invariants from representation theory have led to spectacular results in low-dimensional topology, such as proof of the Weinstein conjecture.  Despite some progress in understanding these connections, there is not yet a simple, unifying explanation for them.  Indeed, a fundamental open problem, and a distant lodestar for part of the research project, is to axiomatize Floer theory.  One approach involves developing invariants of bordered 3-manifolds.  The bordered monopole Floer theory under development in this project is novel in that it may provide methods for computing invariants of 4-manifolds as well.  A complementary goal of this project is to elucidate links between Floer theory and Khovanov homology, an invariant of links motivated by representation theory.  Such connections were instrumental, for example, in establishing that Khovanov homology detects the unknot.  This project investigates a new approach to proving a long-standing conjecture relating Khovanov homology with knot Floer homology, which would imply, among other things, that Khovanov homology detects the figure eight, trefoil, and Hopf link as well.  The project also investigates a novel approach for using actions of quantum cohomology on Floer theory to study the rich theory of Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds.  This has not been done before, despite the role Heegaard splittings play in the constructions of some Floer theories.  Finally, the research project will employ newly-developed gauge-theoretic contact invariants to provide fresh insights into Legendrian knots and Lagrangian concordance, and to establish hitherto unexplored connections between contact geometry and the fundamental group."

The mathematical focus of the conference is on the fields of topology and geometry.  The greatest impact of the conference comes from its emphasis on the Southeast region of the US, especially on the junior researchers in this area.  Besides bringing a high profile conference to the area and allowing local researchers to interact with leading mathematicians from across the country, the Tech Topology Conference provides a platform for the promotion and advancement of the mathematics being done in the Southeast region.  Indeed, half of the speakers in the first four conferences have been from the Southeast, and one third have been junior researchers.  With the 2015 conference, the organizers will introduce a 5-minute lightning talk session, allowing the conference to feature even more of the work being done - especially by junior researchers - in the Southeast.<br/><br/>The Tech Topology Conference is a annual conference series at Georgia Institute of Technology that started in 2011. The main aims of the conference are: (1) to provide a high-profile Geometry-Topology conference to the Southeast that brings leaders in the field to the area as well as showcases the high quality mathematics being done in the Southeast and (2) to provide a convenient meeting place for Southeastern researchers and students to gather, discuss, research, and interact with leading mathematicians from across the country.  The Tech Topology Conference focuses on several areas of Geometry and Topology, all in line with the interests of the Geometry and Topology faculty at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  In the past there have been lectures on 3-manifolds, dynamics, knots, and geometric group theory, to name a few.  In inviting speakers, the emphasis is on researchers in the Southeast, especially junior researchers.  For speakers and participants alike, the Tech Topology Conference provides a critical venue for researchers in the Southeast to interact with leaders in the field from around the country and to share their work.  Mathematical progress is integral to the whole idea of the Tech Topology Conference: the organizers provide ample time for the participants to meet, formally and informally, to discuss mathematics.  Beginning in 2015 we there will be a lunchtime session consisting of 5-minute talks, enabling the conference to feature even more of the work being done in the Southeast.   The organizers post notes from the conference talks on the conference web site, making much of the mathematical content of the conference available publicly.<br/><br/>The conference website is ttc.gatech.edu"

Their Julia sets provide prototypical examples of fractals and exhibit fascinating dynamical behavior starting from very simple rules. In this project, the PI will work to better understand the geometry of fractals, particularly those generated by ""rational maps"", generalizing the polynomials used in the Mandelbrot set. The PI has developed a simple description of such maps using graphs, thought of as networks of rubber bands. This promises to be more accessible than previous approaches, lowering the barrier to participation by undergraduates and beginning graduate students, and letting them experience and understand first-hand the structure behind the beautiful pictures. In particular, the project will allow for a classification of the simplest rational maps, and a new test for when a loose (topological) description of a rational map can be tightened up into the rigid picture that generates the fractal.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the project will study certain maps from the sphere to itself (topological branched self-covers) that are related to rational maps. To determine the behavior of the rational map, the key points to look at are the critical points, where the map branches. A map can be described by giving an appropriate spine for the complement of the post-critical set on the sphere, along with its inverse image. One key question is to characterize when a branched self-cover can be made ""rigid"" into a rational map. William Thurston gave one answer in 1982, in terms of certain obstructions, collections of annuli that could not exist inside actual rational maps. This answer is complicated to state and difficult to apply, but it nevertheless provides one of the few tools for constructing rational maps.  In this project, the PI will study a complementary criterion, which loosely says that the spine (with elastic weights on the edges) get looser under repeated backwards iteration. The new criterion promises to be both simple and powerful, and the PI will work with other researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students to explore it. They will use the new characterization to, for instance, construct a new census of rational maps. They will also investigate extensions of the main theorem and study the new structure it reveals."

Despite their different origins, it has recently been appreciated that persistent homology and symplectic Floer theory share key algebraic structures, and the time is ripe to exploit these parallels and apply the insights gained during the separate developments of these two subjects over the last several years in order to learn more about each of them.

Broadly speaking, the theme of the conference is algebraic topology. There will be eight plenary lectures, giving presentations of major recent developments in this area by leaders in the field. Our goal is to provide a stimulating setting in which participants will be encouraged to discuss their ideas and foster new collaborations. Focused research conferences such as this one play a fundamental role in the development and dissemination of research in mathematics. Such conferences serve as a forum in which researchers can announce new results and explain their ideas to other experts in the field, long before results appear in refereed journals.<br/><br/>The themes of the conference are homotopy theory, group theory (especially cohomology of groups), and interactions between them via the classifying space functor. Cohomology of groups is important both in group theory and algebraic topology. On one hand, methods of algebraic topology are useful for the calculation of cohomology of groups. Conversely, important questions in algebraic topology often can be reduced to questions about group cohomology. There are many instances of this phenomenon. One important example is the role played in homotopy theory by the cohomology of Morava stabilizer groups. Another example occurs in the study of the connection between the (p-completed) homotopy type of the classifying space of a finite group and the structure of the fusion system on its p-Sylow subgroup. Our plenary speakers are leading experts in these subjects. Specifically, they are: Mark Behrens (Notre Dame), Paul Goerss (Northwestern), Mike Hill (University of Virginia),  Nitu Kitchloo (Johns Hopkins), Bob Oliver (Paris 13), Geoffrey Powell (Angers), Douglas Ravenel (Rochester) and Kirsten Wickelgren (Georgia Tech).<br/><br/>More information about the conference can be found at http://pi.math.virginia.edu/topology/Conference2015/"

Its purpose is to bring together specialists in singularity theory and topology from around the world, to have them present new developments and perspectives in singularity theory and new applications of topology to singularity theory, and to introduce these new directions to young researchers. Singularity theory studies mathematical phenomena associated with degenerations of generic objects into special ones and which results in radical changes of the objects. The study of such ``catastrophes"" concerns a wide range of areas, ranging through economics, biology, chemistry, vision and medial imaging, control theory, to engineering and theoretical physics.<br/><br/>Singularity theory and topology work with each other, and the collaboration has led to many rich connections with various fields such as mathematical physics, symplectic and contact topology, surgery theory. Recently, many new connections have appeared. For example, low dimensional topology and new homology theories have brought new invariants to singularity theory, there are new applications of surgery theory techniques, and applications of metric geometry also form a very fruitful new direction. The workshop will concentrate on five particular particular areas among which there have already been strong interactions: 1. Singularities, homology theories and related invariants, 2.  Bilipschitz geometry of singular spaces, 3. Intersection homology, 4. Morse 2-functions, 5. Surgery theory."

This connection between geometry and algebra implies that the study of groups provides an algebraic language and a set of techniques for studying problems throughout geometry.  In recent years, some of the most important problems in three-dimensional geometry (such as the Virtual Haken Conjecture on the structure of spaces that cover three-dimensional manifolds) have been solved by a combination of group theory and geometric properties of two-dimensional submanifolds of these spaces.  Some of the names associated to this line of work are Agol, Wise, Kahn, Markovic, Haglund, Hsu, Bergeron, and Manning.<br/><br/>A major focus of the first half of this project is to broaden the range of applications of the available theory, and to apply these new tools to many more problems in geometry and group theory.  In the second half of this project, techniques will be developed to study problems about maps between families of groups.  Again, problems from three-dimensional geometry will give key motivation.  Due to the work of Agol and many others, the objects in this setting are now quite well understood.  However, there are many fundamental questions about the maps between these objects, and this proposal will tackle some of these problems, as well as building a general toolkit for studying questions such as these.  In the first half of the project, we study hyperbolic groups acting cocompactly on CAT(0) cube complexes.  In the case that the cell stabilizers are finite, Agol's famous theorem implies that such a group is ""virtually special"" (an important concept introduced by Haglund and Wise) which implies many strong properties, such as linearity and strong residual finiteness properties for such a group.  In the case of a one-dimensional complex (a tree), if the cell stabilizers are infinite but quasi-convex and virtually special, then Wise's Quasiconvex Hierarchy Theorem implies that the hyperbolic group is again virtually special.  The main goal of the first half of this project is to prove a simultaneous generalization of these two theorems: If a hyperbolic group G acts cocompactly on a CAT(0) cube complex with quasi- convex and virtually special cell stabilizers, then G is virtually special.  This will have many applications to relatively hyperbolic and hyperbolic groups acting on cube complexes. In the second half of this proposal, we will develop a quite general framework for studying the set of a maps from an arbitrary finitely generated group into natural families of groups.  Examples of such families which will be studied include: Kleinian groups, arbitrary three-manifold groups, relatively hyperbolic and acylindrically hyperbolic groups, and others."

Symplectic topology is concerned with global structures of symplectic manifolds, a class of spaces that appeared first as the phase space in classical mechanics. Gromov developed a theory of pseudoholomorphic curves, which has led to a number of advancements in symplectic topology, including a class of symplectic invariants now known as Gromov-Witten invariants. More sophisticated invariants, namely Fukaya categories, are the subject of mainstream research. Much of this research arises from predictions made by physicists under the name of mirror symmetry, an area of both mathematics and physics that remains largely conjectural. These conjectures are striking as they have been understood to predict a rather general correspondence between symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry - a huge field of mathematics whose roots go back to ancient times. Various questions one may ask about the geometry of a symplectic manifold can be answered by studying instead the algebraic geometry of a different manifold (its ""mirror""), and vice-versa.<br/><br/>This project will be concerned with a study of a mirror theory to the classical Bott-Borel-Weil construction in algebraic geometry. Bott-Borel-Weil gives a geometric description of all finite dimensional, irreducible representations of semi-simple Lie groups in terms of equivariant vector bundles on the corresponding homogeneous spaces. The latter are Fano varieties, for which Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry has been studied extensively over the past decade. In particular, the predicted mirror partner to such varieties is an explicitly known Landau-Ginzburg model.  Homological mirror symmetry suggests that there should be Lagrangian submanifolds, mirroring the equivariant vector bundles, and Floer cohomology of pairs of such Lagrangians should form the underlying vector space of a representation of the Lie group. In a recent work (jointly with J.  Pascaleff), PI defined the notion of an equivariant Lagrangian brane where equivariance is to be understood with respect to an algebraic action of a Lie algebra on the mirror variety. In addition, the simplest non-trivial example of the aforementioned mirror theory to Bott-Borel-Weil construction was worked out. The current project will extend these constructions to the case of an arbitrary semisimple Lie algebra with the main motivation being the identification of a canonical basis of representations coming from intersections of Lagrangian submanifolds."

The growth of this subject was swiftly followed by a variety of applications to geometry, groups, and number theory.

The concept also encompasses the notion of a space-time in the theory of relativity, as well as phase spaces, configuration spaces, and other useful structures in physics. While empirical physics is dedicated to measuring the precise features (e.g. shape, size, etc.) of our universe, the question of what possible features could the universe have, subject to certain laws, is a mathematical one. The data comprising the answer to such a question is called a moduli space; it is a topological space whose points are all possible geometric manifolds of a certain type and whose topology organizes those geometric manifolds into families whose features vary continuously. This project addresses important questions about many different classes of low-dimensional geometric manifolds and their moduli. The PI will study these questions by further developing and applying an emerging new mathematical framework which describes interaction between moduli spaces of different types of geometric manifolds through a mechanism called geometric transition. The research to be conducted in this project weaves together ideas from a wide cross-section of mathematics and physics, including geometry, topology, group theory, dynamics, and relativity. Progress on these problems will be of significance to many researchers across these disciplines and, more broadly, will contribute to the growing base of foundational knowledge on which many innovations in science and engineering are built.<br/><br/>Recent progress by the PI and collaborators, in the setting of complete affine Lorentzian three-manifolds called Margulis spacetimes, suggests a rubric to approach difficult questions in higher dimensional affine geometry. By further developing and generalizing the geometric transition technology used to study Margulis spacetimes as limits of curved spacetimes, the PI will address important questions in higher dimensional affine geometry surrounding the Auslander Conjecture. A second main theme is the study of the relationship between hyperbolic and anti de Sitter (AdS) geometry in dimension three. Work of the PI on the hyperbolic-AdS transition establishes an explicit and natural connection between the two geometries with the potential to expedite progress in the study of geometric structures in both settings. In particular, recent joint work gives new evidence for the bending measure conjecture for convex AdS spacetimes, a counterpart to Thurston's conjecture characterizing convex hyperbolic three-manifolds in terms of bending data on the convex core. The PI will work toward the resolution of these conjectures by further examining the interaction between convex structures in both settings. Additionally, the PI will begin a new project to develop applications of geometric transitions in the setting of representation theory of hyperbolic groups into higher rank Lie groups, a growing subject known as higher Teichmller theory."

The ubiquity of these groups throughout mathematics has motivated their study from many perspectives, drawing on and contributing to the development of numerous diverse fields. The workshop will feature six introductory mini-course lectures and 16 research talks by the world's leading experts, describing cutting edge techniques and the latest results in the field.  This award partially supports workshop speakers and early career mathematicians.<br/><br/>Mapping class groups and outer automorphism groups of free groups have evolved hand-in-hand throughout their long and rich history because of the similarities in their definitions and structure, and because they share much of the same robustness in their individual elements.  The imperfect analogy between the two groups has led to many striking developments on one side, which in turn motivate problems on the other.  In addition, abstracting the ideas and techniques from the setting of these groups has led to generalizations with applications in many other classes of groups and geometric situations.   The lectures will cover a wide array of topics, such as hyperbolicity of associated complexes, quasi-isometric embeddings and distance formulas, connections to right-angled Artin groups and to outer automorphism group of other groups, and algebraic and homological properties, to name a few.

The series will provide opportunity for researchers in the area to share their latest ideas and to collaborate with each other. The presentations will include plenary talks by distinguished researchers, as well as short talks by various participants. Graduate students and recent PhDs will also be encouraged to attend. Over the years, we have attracted a large number of postdocs, graduate students, and even some undergraduate students. In the greater Washington DC area, the series helps to bring together the relevant researchers, and to boost research activities in the region.

There have been exciting new developments in the area of knot theory and 3-manifold topology in the last 35 years -- from Jones polynomial and quantum invariants of 3-manifolds, through Vassiliev invariants, topological quantum field theories, to relations with gauge theory type invariants in 4-dimensional topology (e.g., Donaldson, Witten). More recently, a new development in quantum topology has emerged in the form of Khovanov homology, a generalization of the Jones type polynomials to homology of chain complexes that significantly generalizes the invariants. Also, the categorification of the Kauffman bracket skein module of 3-manifolds has been proposed and developed for some manifolds. The relation to Hochschild homology of algebras has been discovered and studied. The (quantum) complexity of computing the Jones polynomial and Turaev-Viro invariants have been analyzed. Knots in Washington will provide a place for researchers in the above mentioned areas to communicate with each other and work together. The organizers will strive to be at the frontier of new developments in knot theory and its ramifications. Distinguished researchers will give plenary talks surveying the state of knowledge related to Khovanov homology. The choice of conference topics will also reflect the strength of the topology group at the George Washington University.<br/> <br/>Conference Web Page: http://home.gwu.edu/~przytyck/knots/index.html"

These dimensions are special from an anthropic perspective, since they model our everyday perception of the physical world, and from a mathematical perspective, since the phenomena they exhibit and the collection of techniques used to study them are rather different from those in higher dimensions.  Many of these techniques used to study these phenomena involve combinatorics, the study of discrete structures.  A central goal of this research project is to advance the combinatorial aspects of these techniques with a view towards concrete problems in the field.  Alongside the research component, the PI proposes activities that integrate his research interests with education and training initiatives that reach audiences from the high school level to postdoctoral researchers.  For instance, the PI is actively involved with mathematics enrichment at the high school level through the Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics and Mathematical Staircase, Inc.  In the context of these programs and in other mentoring activities, he seeks to inspire the discovery process and aid in the exposition of beautiful mathematics.  A chief outreach activity in the project is a graduate summer school that will showcase several different perspectives on one central theme in low-dimensional topology, Dehn surgery.<br/><br/>Amongst the various techniques that come to bear on low-dimensional topology are graphs of surface intersections, exemplified by the work of Gordon and Luecke, and Heegaard Floer homology, defined and developed by Ozsvth and Szab.  Both techniques have led to sensational progress on the main problems in low-dimensional topology.  The two approaches lend very different perspectives on the subject, and they have complementary strengths and weaknesses.  The surface intersection techniques are more direct and rely on the development of graph theoretic tools in order to draw topological conclusions.  Floer homology methods are less direct but apply heavy machinery to a vast collection of problems. The PI specifically seeks to blend the combinatorial ideas stemming from these techniques and others with a view towards some of the driving problems in low-dimensional topology, spanning topics including the study of knot diagrams, Dehn surgery, and the curve complex."

Since its inception in the 19th century, the topology of manifolds has been intertwined with theoretical physics. This connection grew with Einstein's theory of general relativity, which requires that space-time is curved by the presence of mass, and therefore that the geometry of space-time is more complex than the classical geometry of Euclid. This connection grew further with the advent of quantum field theories, which have given rise to the most discerning invariants of manifolds. Here, an invariant means a uniform technique for analyzing all manifolds at once. The cobordism hypothesis is a proposed classification from the mid 1990s of these invariants of manifolds - called topological quantum field theories - which could arise from theoretical physics. Our project proves the cobordism hypothesis. The principal investigators do this by developing a new method in algebra, factorization homology, for the theoretical assembly of global invariants from local invariants.<br/><br/>The central structural tenet of contemporary topological quantum field is the cobordism hypothesis, developed by Lurie, Hopkins, and Baez-Dolan. This asserts that topological quantum field theories valued in a symmetric monoidal n-category are in bijection with fully dualizable objects of that n-category. In particular, it asserts that a field theory is determined by its value on a point. Our project proves the cobordism hypothesis. The principal investigators do this by further developing, and then applying, the theory of factorization homology. This enhanced theory allows for coefficient systems which are symmetric monoidal n-categories, generalizing the previous factorization homology whose coefficients are n-disk algebras. Their enhanced factorization homology offers a new basis for locality in field theory based on moduli of stratifications, as opposed to the Morse theory and surgery presentations which have formed the basis for locality since Atiyah's axioms from the 1980s. The technical basis for this work is this differential topology of stratifications in families."

Such mathematics workshops provide an opportunity for mathematicians working in a certain subfield, in this case geometric topology, to meet, interact, and share their research through both official lecture presentations and informal discussions.  Grant funds will be utilized primarily to support the travel and attendance costs of conference participants, particularly graduate students, young Ph.D.s, and other researchers without their own sources of funding.<br/>The field of geometric topology, broadly speaking, is the study of spatial configuration, both in the physical universe and of abstract ""spaces"" that can model real-life phenomena. For example, a topologist might study how a physical string or protein strand is knotted in the real three-dimensional world, or he or she might study the abstract space of positions that a machine could inhabit, allowing for an arbitrary number of parameters that describe the positions of various components.  Research in this field can vary from the highly abstract to more concrete applications supported by those abstract underpinnings. Modern applications of topology occur in such diverse areas as robot motion planning, data analysis, image processing, sensor networks, and mathematical biology.<br/><br/><br/>A primary goal of these Workshops in Geometric Topology is to provide mathematicians in geometric topology (and, more recently, the closely related field of geometric group theory) who have active research programs, but limited support, an opportunity to discuss their work with others in the field. Another important goal is to expand the interests of the participants by having a nationally-recognized expert discuss an important area of current interest. A third goal is to provide a serious but informal research atmosphere in which graduate students can meet and learn from others in the field. At each workshop, participants will have the opportunity to attend three lectures given by a principal speakers chosen for his or her top-tier research credentials and superb expository abilities. The principal speaker at the 32nd annual Workshop will be the internationally-renowned Wolfgang Lck of the University of Bonn and the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics; he will provide introductory talks about L2-Betti numbers and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture and then a talk about applications to 3-manifolds. The other workshop participants will be invited to share their own work by giving short talks in a congenial environment, and important time will be provided for informal discussion and interaction among participants and with the principal speaker. Overall, the workshops will provide opportunities for geometric topologists to interact and share ideas, leading to possible research collaborations. The workshops will be advertised nationally. Graduate students and members of underrepresented groups will be given top priority for funding and will be particularly encouraged to attend and to speak.

A ""contact structure'' is an extra geometric structure on a manifold (these structures originate from physics); the study of contact structures and knots in contact manifolds draws on ideas from different fields (geometry, algebra, combinatorics). This project will contribute to the development of these areas, especially to geometry of manifolds. The main part of the project concerns the investigation of ""right-handed'' and ""left-handed'' properties of certain knots. Related ideas often appear in the broader context of geometry,  algebra, and physics.<br/><br/>This project will focus on two different topics. The first topic concerns knot theory and contact topology in dimension 3, and is related to knot invariants of gauge-theoretic and combinatorial nature. The project's goal is to develop properties and applications for a special class  of transverse knots (those with certain ""positivity"" properties); the PI expects to find relations between algebraic properties of corresponding braids, behavior of invariants from knot Floer and Khovanov homology  (including an invariant introduced by the PI in 2006), properties of symplectic surfaces (cobordisms) connecting the knots, and  rigidity of their branched double covers. This investigation develops a novel approach (with a focus on braid group orderings and the braid monodromy) but also continues the PI's past research. The PI also plans to continue studying  flexible phenomena in higher-dimensional contact topology and expects to contribute to this rapidly developing area. The goal is to better understand properties of  rigid/flexible contact manifolds, developing analogs of existing results in dimension 3."

At first glance these words and ideas seem foreign and unrelated to the natural world.  However, pure mathematics is the language of modern physics.  Broadly speaking the main intellectual merit of this proposal is to create new mathematics which will add to the language of physics.  More precisely, the theory of quantum groups associated to Lie algebras is widely and productively used in low-dimensional topology, in particular with the creation of quantum invariants.  Within this context, the PI and his collaborators have given new systematic strategies to define re-normalized quantum invariants arising from non-semi-simple categories.  The focus of this proposal is to describe and explore the geometric and physical meanings of these re-normalized invariants, while concurrently using the unique properties of these invariants to gain new information about well-known problems in low-dimensional topology.   The broader impacts of this proposal can be arranged in two main categories: mentoring and outreach.  The PI will create a mentoring system for the students of the Mathematics Department at Utah State University, with the aim of providing students skills to help them succeed in future academic pursuits.  The outreach component of this grant is to organize a Moab Topology Conference which will allow students and postdocs to attend and present their research, while also interacting with leading experts. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The first main theme of the proposed research is further exploration of the PI's re-normalized Reshetikhin-Turaev 3-manifold invariants in the context of the Volume Conjecture.

The advent of coordinate geometry led to a better understanding of the nature of such problems, and the introduction of complex numbers provided an important new perspective.   In this way, determining the nature of a curve in the plane defined as the solution set of a polynomial equation with two variables is related to the problem of understanding surfaces in four dimensional space. The Principal Investigator is investigating topological properties of the surfaces that arise.  It has been observed that the local properties of these surfaces relate to knots; this project includes continuing research on four-dimensional aspects of classical knot theory. Coupled with his research in knot theory,  the Principal Investigator  maintains a website devoted to providing students and researchers access to current information about knots.  In addition to assisting people working in knot theory (both pure mathematicians and applied), the website serves as an important educational tool, reaching students around the world.<br/><br/>A homogenous polynomial equation with three variables defines a complex curve in two-dimensional complex projective space.  Recent work of the Principal Investigator, done jointly with Borodzik and Borodzik-Hedden, has restricted the possibilities for singularities in the case that the curve is topologically a sphere or torus.  The approach was to understand the Heegaard Floer homology of the boundary of a neighborhood of the curve.  Constraints on these homology groups arising from the complement of the curve in turn constrain the singularities the arise.  Developing this further is one goal of the Principal Investigator's research. In studying singularities of complex curves, one is led naturally to studying the four-genus of knots.  When restricted to torus knots, the topic is well understood.  Working with Van Cott, the Principal Investigator  is applying a combination of classical techniques and Heegaard Floer theory to understand the four-genus of connected sums of torus knots, beginning with linear combinations of a pair of torus knots.  Independent of this work, the Principal Investigator is also trying to extend his previous work with Gilmer concerning the non-orientable four-genus of knots; one goal is to apply Heegaard Floer theory to build new examples of knots with large nonorientable four-ball genus."

Homotopy theoretic properties tend to be accessible to computation by taking advantage of the invariance under small changes.

Knot theory has become important within the life sciences, in the field of DNA Topology.  Most of the DNA that is worked with in laboratories is in small circular molecules that are called plasmids.  Circular DNA also appears in nature.  Plasmids can naturally be modeled with knots.  With every cell division the DNA is copied in a process called replication.  This is a complicated process that involves a number of enzymes.  After replication the two new plasmids are linked (or catenated) and sometimes knotted.  The reason for knotting is not completely understood.  In the middle of replication DNA forms the more complicated structures, that of a knotted graph, this is an area of DNA topology that has yet to be investigated by mathematicians.  This project will have immediate contributions to our biological understanding of DNA replication.  <br/><br/><br/>In particular, the PI will focus on three main projects centering around spatial graphs:  First, the PI will study a number of aspects of Legendrian graphs.  Central results in contact geometry use Legendrian graphs in their proofs. Thus this opens an exciting new area with great potential. These projects will increase the overall understanding of Legendrian graphs, further increasing their potential to use Legendrian graphs as a tool to understand 3-manifolds, and potentially distinguish contact structures.  Second, the PI will develop new invariants and better understand existing invariants of spatial graphs and knots, including graph Floer homology.  Third, the PI will begin classification of unknotting number one theta-graphs to understand unknotting in DNA replication intermediates."

Contact structures are geometric objects which originated in the study of optics in the 19th century; in recent years they have become important tools in low-dimensional topology, providing information about the shapes of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces such as our universe, and in knot theory, which has seen emerging links to such topics as protein folding.  Many of the tools which the PI uses to study such spaces, including Floer homology theories, draw heavily from mathematical physics, and they contain contact-geometric data which has provided a wealth of information about both the contact structures themselves and about the spaces in which they reside.  The proposed research would investigate such data and uncover connections which it provides between disparate areas of mathematics, including algebra, topology, and dynamics.<br/><br/>The PI intends to study invariants of contact structures and 3-manifolds, especially homological invariants of 3-manifolds with boundary, which arise from gauge theory and symplectic geometry.  The first goal of this project is to develop applications to topology and to symplectic geometry of contact invariants in several Floer homology theories for sutured 3-manifolds.  These potential applications include computable obstructions to Lagrangian concordances between Legendrian knots; bounds on the number of Reeb orbits in a contact 3-manifold, generalizing the proof of the Weinstein conjecture in this setting; and an intriguing conjecture relating Stein fillings of a 3-manifold to representations of its fundamental group.  The second goal is to establish a relationship between different sutured Floer homology theories, whose corresponding closed 3-manifold invariants (Heegaard Floer homology, monopole Floer homology, and embedded contact homology) are now all known to be isomorphic, and to identify their respective contact invariants as well.  The third goal is to investigate an emerging connection between Legendrian contact homology (LCH) and new sheaf-theoretic Legendrian knot invariants, and in doing so to apply algebro-geometric techniques to problems in contact geometry and hopefully understand the relationship of LCH to classical knot invariants."

The goal of algebraic topology is to systematically build a connection between algebraic objects like numbers and geometric objects like spaces. This connection allows a two-way flow of information, with algebraic invariants distinguishing spaces and topological methods informing algebraic problems. A beautiful example of the latter is the Goerss-Hopkins-Miller theory of topological modular forms, a way to encode elliptic curves (a fundamental object in algebraic geometry) in topological language. This builds new kinds of elliptic curves and highlights commonalities not visible through ordinary algebra. ""Equivariant algebraic topology"" remembers a collection of symmetries inherent in a space as part of the data, systematically grouping spaces with the same symmetries, and the numbers and invariants produced must reflect this. Remembering the extra structure makes richer, but more complicated, computations, and it allows one to tease apart otherwise interconnected problems. For example, using equivariant methods, the PI, Hopkins, and Ravenel solved the Kervaire Invariant One problem, the oldest outstanding problem in algebraic topology with roots dating back to the 1930s. This in turn gave information about how one can build spaces out of simpler ones like spheres. This project aims to build on the techniques developed in the solution, tackling other computational problems in algebra and topology. In particular, the project seeks to explore the interaction between the visible equivariance in settings like topological modular forms arising from underlying algebraic data and the constraints placed by the topology.<br/><br/>Modern stable homotopy theory heavily utilizes the fact that the stable homotopy category behaves like a derived category of modules. Here the ground ring is not an ordinary ring but rather a ring spectrum, the sphere spectrum. Work over the last twenty years has described how to do algebraic geometry directly with commutative ring spectra: the theory of derived algebraic geometry. Many of the naturally occurring examples arise as commutative ring spectra with an action of a finite group, so one asks when there is an underlying equivariant commutative ring spectrum which is computationally accessible. This is the main focus of this project, a new area of research called ""equivariant derived algebraic geometry"". From a computational perspective, the goal is to understand the interplay between the homotopy groups of fixed points of a group action on a spectrum and the underlying homotopy groups of the spectrum. In general, this is a very difficult problem. One of the most exciting new tools developed to solve the Kervaire problem is a general slice filtration, a method which directly computes homotopy groups of fixed points. For Real Landweber exact theories, theories well-rooted in the underlying algebraic geometry, this is an extremely efficient tool. For larger groups, computations are tractable but much more mysterious. One of the goals of the project is to determine when the kinds of spectra arising from equivariant derived algebraic geometry have slices as nice as those for Real Landweber exact theories. Equivariant homotopy is also central to the homotopical approach to algebraic K-theory. Algebraic K groups are also exceedingly difficult to compute, and even knowing whether or not they are zero would settle long-standing number theory conjectures. The primary approach in homotopy is via a tower of spectra, the TR tower, built inductively out of fixed point spectra for topological Hochschild homology. The new equivariant machinery provides alternate, simpler construction of topological Hochschild homology, allowing us to evaluate it on Thom spectra and to build relative versions."

The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. This research project studies mathematically the application of topological phases of matter to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit in quantum computation.<br/><br/>In this project the investigators study mathematical models for topological phases, focusing on their applications to topological quantum computation.  Topological phases of matter in two spatial dimensions are well-described in the framework of modular categories, but relatively little is known in three spatial dimensions.  A large part of this project is devoted to developing appropriate mathematical models in three spatial dimensions and analyzing the corresponding computational paradigms.  Specifically, the project will study (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories and representations of the loop braid group, and symmetry enriched topological order and gauging symmetry.  In addition, because locality and universality are two desirable properties for quantum computation that are manifested in the representations of the braid group, this project also aims to formulate conjectures characterizing when these properties hold and to verify and adapt these conjectures where appropriate to better characterize physical and computational aspects.  To compare the computational power of topological quantum computers to that of classical computers, the project investigates the complexity of the most natural computation in this setting: topological invariants."

The first part of this project aims to explore an entirely new kind of dynamics, in which the states of the system (such as positions of particles) move around in time, without a global motion of the entire system. This seems paradoxical, and indeed one expects it to happen mostly in situations that are far from applications. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the phenomenon is mathematically possible, and because dynamical systems thinking provides such a powerful intuition, it makes sense to want to stretch its limits as far as possible. Any evidence of additional complexity in classical mechanical systems, even if it directly affects only a few cases, ultimately changes how we think of the complexity of such systems in general. The second part of this project deals with a phenomenon in mathematics which arises from its current close exchange of ideas with string theory: namely, the appearance of complicated explicit functions (typically, of one variable). From the viewpoint of topology, which is more qualitative, one hopes to minimize the amount of information that needs to be encoded inside such functions. For instance, if the functions themselves solve a differential equation, they can be recovered from a finite amount of information. String theory has been very effective in providing such a characterization, but this project aims (in a special case) for a more direct and simpler description. It should be viewed as an exercise in ""noncommutative geometry"", which is the mathematicians' way to prepare ourselves for thinking beyond conventional notions of space (which is one of the big challenges in contemporary mathematics and physics).<br/><br/>Symplectic manifolds have a rich internal structure. This can be approached from a variational viewpoint (capacities, Hofer norms, spectral invariants), or from string theory and mirror symmetry. Nevertheless, the basic known invariants are a collection of numbers, or homology classes (Gromov-Witten invariants). There is information beyond that (Lagrangian submanifolds, Fukaya categories), but it is not directly amenable to being used as a classification tool.  The project intends to attack this situation by looking at dynamical systems acting on the Fukaya category. The idea is start with geometric considerations such as flux, and export them to other situations. The approach is designed to be applied to a specific class of symplectic manifolds, related to mapping tori. The other major topic is a way of computing Fukaya categories, using Lefschetz pencils. While there is a body of previous work in this direction, it is restricted to the exact (or monotone) situation, and does not address the challenge of understanding the infinite series that arise in the Calabi-Yau case. The PI's aim is to describe those series in a more direct way than is provided by the standard framework of mirror symmetry (Gauss-Manin connections, mirror maps); this description would then also be more general, since it is ultimately independent of mirror symmetry considerations."

Since its inception in the 19th century, the topology of manifolds has been intertwined with theoretical physics. This connection grew with Einstein's theory of general relativity, which requires that space-time is curved by the presence of mass, and therefore that the geometry of space-time is more complex than the classical geometry of Euclid. This connection grew further with the advent of quantum field theories, which have given rise to the most discerning invariants of manifolds. Here, an invariant means a uniform technique for analyzing all manifolds at once. The cobordism hypothesis is a proposed classification from the mid 1990s of these invariants of manifolds - called topological quantum field theories - which could arise from theoretical physics. Our project proves the cobordism hypothesis. The principal investigators do this by developing a new method in algebra, factorization homology, for the theoretical assembly of global invariants from local invariants.<br/><br/><br/>The central structural tenet of contemporary topological quantum field is the cobordism hypothesis, developed by Lurie, Hopkins, and Baez-Dolan. This asserts that topological quantum field theories valued in a symmetric monoidal n-category are in bijection with fully dualizable objects of that n-category. In particular, it asserts that a field theory is determined by its value on a point. Our project proves the cobordism hypothesis. The principal investigators do this by further developing, and then applying, the theory of factorization homology. This enhanced theory allows for coefficient systems which are symmetric monoidal n-categories, generalizing the previous factorization homology whose coefficients are n-disk algebras. Their enhanced factorization homology offers a new basis for locality in field theory based on moduli of stratifications, as opposed to the Morse theory and surgery presentations which have formed the basis for locality since Atiyah's axioms from the 1980s. The technical basis for this work is this differential topology of stratifications in families."

It has two broadly constructed goals: to study the three-dimensional homology cobordism groups, sets of spaces with many algebraic features in common with the three-dimensional sphere, and to understand area-preserving maps between manifolds. Philosophically speaking, these goals are united by a desire to understand the flexibility or rigidity of geometric qualities of spaces. Understanding the homology cobordism groups is a major motivating question in topology; questions of the complexity of these groups in three dimensions are tied to deep structural issues in higher-dimensional topology. Similarly, the study of area-preserving (symplectic) maps is one of the central issues of symplectic geometry, and has nontrivial connections to physics. The PI will also study applications of invariants of knot concordance which arise in connection with this research. Since one motivation for this project is that the tools used are particularly computationally accessible, the PI will actively seek to involve undergraduate and other young researchers in this work.<br/> <br/>The tools of this project are equivariant versions of Floer-theoretic invariants.  There are two main programs. The first involves a recently-constructed involutive version of the three-manifold invariant Heegaard Floer homology, which gives two new homology cobordism and knot concordance invariants. Using this invariant, the PI will study the homology cobordism group and cosmetic surgeries on knots. Involutive Heegaard Floer homology is a first step toward the long-term goal of constructing Pin(2)-equivariant Heegaard Floer homology, which the PI will continue to work toward. This is desirable in light of recent progress made using  Pin(2)-equivariant version of Seiberg-Witten Floer homology, an analogous theory. For the second, the PI proposes to construct a Serre spectral sequence for the Lagrangian Floer cohomology of certain symplectic fibrations. Relationships arising from this spectral sequence are expected to give information about the symplectic mapping class group; furthermore, since many invariants in symplectic and low-dimensional topology can be formulated in terms of Lagrangian Floer cohomology, the spectral sequence itself has potentially broad consequences. Other goals include understanding equivariant Lagrangian Floer cohomology for general Lie groups, which also has many theoretical applications; a Z_p version of existing theory for Z_2, for example, would imply a criterion for deciding that a symplectomorphism of a manifold with stably trivialized tangent bundle has infinite order."

For example, to analyze a fluid flowing throughout a closed system, we might deposit tracers into the fluid at a particular location then examine how it has been mixed, distorted, or changed when (and if) it returns.  We can also try to predict how the behavior of the ""first-return"" to the starting location-called a cross section-might influence or predict the behavior at some other cross section.  One goal of this project is to study the evolution of certain classes of abstract mathematical systems, similar in many ways to the fluid flow just described, which arise from geometric and algebraic considerations.  Previous work of the PI with S. Dowdall and I. Kapovich provides structural results which relate the cross sections and their first-returns to one another and to the original system.  The PI will continue this analysis with Dowdall and Kapovich and pursue deeper connections between different cross sections and with the ambient system. The PI's work with Dowdall and Kapovich, past and future, is motivated by the foundational work of W. Thurston, D. Fried, and C. McMullen in a more classical setting, but diverges in fundamental and striking ways.

In addition to strengthening the connection between different cross sections, for example proving that full-irreducibility for monodromies is a property shared by all or none of the sections, he will also tie together all the monodromies with an action of the entire group on a tree and connect the Cannon-Thurston maps to each other.

The most commonly encountered model for quantum computation, the quantum circuit model, requires challenging, if not impossible, accuracy on the hardware to be of practical value, due to local interactions of the system with the surrounding environment. The topological model based on exotic states of matter, while mathematically more complicated, has a built-in tolerance for such interactions. This research project studies mathematically the application of topological phases of matter to new computational paradigms with potentially significant benefit in quantum computation.<br/><br/>In this project the investigators study mathematical models for topological phases, focusing on their applications to topological quantum computation.  Topological phases of matter in two spatial dimensions are well-described in the framework of modular categories, but relatively little is known in three spatial dimensions.  A large part of this project is devoted to developing appropriate mathematical models in three spatial dimensions and analyzing the corresponding computational paradigms.  Specifically, the project will study (3+1)-dimensional topological quantum field theories and representations of the loop braid group, and symmetry enriched topological order and gauging symmetry.  In addition, because locality and universality are two desirable properties for quantum computation that are manifested in the representations of the braid group, this project also aims to formulate conjectures characterizing when these properties hold and to verify and adapt these conjectures where appropriate to better characterize physical and computational aspects.  To compare the computational power of topological quantum computers to that of classical computers, the project investigates the complexity of the most natural computation in this setting: topological invariants."

The classical physics describes the universe we live in as a 3-manifold. Hyperbolic geometry is a (non-Euclidean) geometric model satisfying Euclid's first four postulates but not the fifth (the parallel postulate). It turns out that hyperbolic geometry is much more important than Euclidean geometry for 3-manifolds. Thurston's and Perelman's works imply that ""most"" 3-manifolds have a hyperbolic geometric structure (i.e., they are hyperbolic 3-manifolds). These hyperbolic 3-manifolds can be described by so-called discrete groups of two-by-two matrices, and their covering spaces correspond to subgroups of these discrete groups. Although subgroups of the matrix groups may seem easy to understand, various properties of covering spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are actually quite mysterious. The PI plans to investigate covering spaces of hyperbolic 3-manifolds by various geometric and algebraic methods.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to investigate finite covers of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and to use finite covers of fibered hyperbolic 3-manifolds to study finite covers of pseudo-Anosov maps. The research will be based on tools developed during the recent progress on the Virtual Haken and Virtual Fibered Conjectures. In particular, the PI will focus on three topics. The first topic is about the asymptotic behavior of topological invariants of finite covers of 3-manifolds (e.g., the Seifert volume, the size of homological torsion). The second topic is to use finite covers of hyperbolic 3-manifolds to study finite covers of pseudo-Anosov maps (e.g., the virtual homological spectral radii of pseudo-Anosov maps). The third topic is to study the mapping tori of small dilatation pseudo-Anosov maps (e.g., to find the explicit finite collection of hyperbolic 3-manifolds that generates all pseudo-Anosov maps of smallest dilatation). Methods from hyperbolic geometry, low-dimensional topology, geometric group theory, dynamical systems, and metric geometry will be involved in the work."

First started in 2007, the Young Topologists Meeting (YTM) is an annual European conference for graduate students and young researchers in in the field of topology.  The subject of topology, the mathematical study of geometric properties that are independent of deformation, has importance throughout mathematics as well as in a large number of applications that range from theoretical physics to data analysis to robotic motion planning.  The YTM offers junior topologists the opportunity to present their work to a large international audience, giving the speakers experience as well as facilitating the dissemination of research results. In addition, the YTM hosts two mini-courses by senior topologists that offer introductions to advanced topics and provide gateways into these subfields for even relatively inexperienced participants. This year the two mini-courses will stress both of the great successes of algebraic topology: theory-building and applications. <br/><br/>One course will offer an introduction to the theory of Infinity Categories from a simple and formal perspective. Infinity categories are a relatively new framework for understanding many tools arising in mathematics and physics, including homological algebra, model categories, locality in field theories, and theories of A- and L-infinity algebras. Although infinity categories can be identified as playing a role in many areas of mathematics, their usefulness can be limited by their combinatorial intractability -- a problem which will be addressed by introducing infinity categories from this new viewpoint. The second course will address applications of algebraic topology to data science. In particular, it will describe the theory of Persistent Homology, which is a tool used to extract meaningful inference from both large and multi-dimensional data sets. As data becomes more ubiquitous, developing mathematical methods for handling large amounts of data is paramount, and this course will introduce the next generation of topologists to these problems and possible solutions through topology. <br/><br/>The conference website can be found at http://gr-he.epfl.ch/ytm2015."

Symplectic and contact manifolds represent the kinds of geometric objects that connect abstract geometry to mathematical physics, and they give an ideal setup for studying classical mechanics, quantum physics, and string theory from a geometric perspective. Most work done in symplectic geometry today is in the direction of symplectic rigidity, meaning that we have very strong tools for detecting when this geometry obstructs you from doing something, for example, moving some subset of this geometric space somewhere else in the space. In contrast, symplectic flexibility aims to find geometric situations when we have constructive tools. Based on work of the past 40 years it seems that symplectic geometry is a very delicate thing, meaning that by making a small geometric alteration almost all geometric rigidity completely falls apart, allowing the geometry to become extremely malleable and unrestricted. The project aims to study what these geometric alterations are, how they cause the geometry to become flexible, and how these phenomena can be applied to symplectic geometry as a whole.<br/><br/>This contrast of rigidity and flexibility should be thought of as measuring the difference between geometry and topology. If we are looking for a geometric structure or equivalence between objects, it certainly must exist as a topological object if it has any hope to exist geometrically. But when does the topology determine the geometry? In symplectic geometry this question can be rephrased as the existence of a solution to an underdetermined PDE, or a partial differential inequality. An h-principle is a systematic way to construct solutions to such equations. The project is intended to study how h-principles relate to symplectic and contact geometry. Depending on the context this has many different facets. In some situations the PI intends to construct new h-principles designed to solve specific problems in symplectic geometry, but it also involves finding new geometric methods to detect when an existing h-principle applies, or extending existing h-principles to a wider context. The type of h-principle needed also depends heavily on the geometry available, such as whether the object in question is symplectic or contact, whether it is the ambient space or a submanifold, whether it is low or high dimensional, and other factors."

This problem (the basis of the subject of knot theory) has implications in physics (quantum theory), chemistry (molecular knots) and biology (knotting of DNA).  A central tool in classifying knots, and indeed in many topological questions, is to assign an invariant to a knot:  two knots are then different if their invariants are different.  The goal is find robust invariants which can distinguish different knots.  This project explores new types of knot invariants and continues the trend of using tools from algebra to define and investigate knot invariants.  The PI will use techniques from the mathematical fields of algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory. The focus of the project is on the class of knots and links that arise from intersecting an algebraic curve in the plane with a small sphere centered at the singularity of the curve (such knots and links are called algebraic). In this project the PI will study the interaction between the topological invariants of algebraic knots and links and certain algebraic and combinatorial objects associated to the corresponding curve.<br/><br/>Quantum knot invariants have proven to be a powerful tool in low-dimensional topology.  To every knot one can associate a polynomial with integer coefficients in one variable (as in the Alexander polynomial or the Jones polynomial) or in two variables (as in the HOMFLY polynomial).  It has recently been discovered by the PI and his collaborators that for torus knots all coefficients in the HOMFLY polynomial are in fact nonnegative.  To prove this fact, certain representations of the rational Cherednik algebra were studied and it was shown that the dimensions of some graded subspaces match the HOMFLY coefficients.  Khovanov and Rozansky introduced another collection of vector spaces, called HOMFLY homology, such that the HOMFLY coefficients are presented as alternating sums of their dimensions.  The similarity of the two constructions suggests that for a torus knot Khovanov-Rozansky homology may be isomorphic to a representation of the rational Cherednik algebra, equipped with an extra grading (or filtration).  This conjecture has been verified in many examples, but remains open in general.  The PI plans to use the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras for the construction of explicit combinatorial and geometric models for the Khovanov-Rozansky homology of torus knots, and their generalizations to algebraic knots and links.  Other knot homology theories, such as Heegaard-Floer homology, will also be studied."

The conference series focuses on the geometry and topology of 4-manifolds, regarded as a melting pot for various research areas, such as low dimensional topology, contact, symplectic, complex and differential geometry, geometric analysis, and mathematical physics. The organizers plan to bring together leading experts and rising young researchers from across the country as speakers for each meeting and to support participation of interested researchers and graduate students, especially from the institutions in the Northeast. An objective of the conference series is to fertilize new research directions by increasing interaction and collaboration among the wealth of geometers and topologists in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, particularly among graduate students, junior researchers, and their more senior colleagues, while providing all with a panorama of the subject area through a variety of talks and discussion sessions. The series will help build a regional network and support ties among graduate students, faculty, and other researchers throughout the Northeast.<br/><br/>The themes for both conferences are chosen from the most active and dynamic fields in recent years. Taubes' work connecting Seiberg-Witten gauge theory and symplectic topology has had great impact on both symplectic geometry and 4-dimensional smooth topology, while work of Donaldson and Gompf has led to many new constructions and applications of Lefschetz fibrations. The advances led to deep understanding of the internal structure of symplectic 4-manifolds. Remarkably, this led to the complete smooth and symplectic classification of symplectic 4-manifolds of negative Kodaira dimension. These will be the main topics of the first conference. On the other hand, gauge theory has had an enormous impact on the study of smooth 4-manifolds, starting with the seminal work of Donaldson in the 1980's and the introduction of Seiberg-Witten theory some 10 years later. Coupled with new methods for building 4-manifolds, this has led to the constructions of exotic smooth manifolds in many homotopy types, and to an understanding of the internal structure of smooth 4-manifolds. The deepest results of recent years have been based on the use of gauge theoretic invariants of 3-manifolds known as Floer homology theories, which give rise in turn to invariants of 4-manifolds with boundary. The second conference will focus on these invariants for all smooth 4-manifolds.<br/><br/>Web link for the Spring 2015 conference: http://people.math.umass.edu/~baykur/Symplectic4manifoldsConference.html"

Negatively curved spaces are ones which, at every point and every pair of directions, look like the surface of a saddle. While this type of space might sound odd, it is in fact pervasive in mathematics. For these spaces, there is a tight link between the geometry (quantitative features of the space) and the topology (qualitative features of the space). In addition, these spaces have some very interesting dynamical systems associated to them, where one can study how objects move over time. As a result, the study of these spaces provides a melting pot for different viewpoints and methods, making for a rich field of study. This project plans on using these three different approaches (geometry, topology, dynamics) to shed some light on these spaces.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to work on a series of projects that are centered around the notion of non-positive curvature.  The PI's projects loosely fall into three broad categories: geometry, topology, and dynamics. On the geometric side of things, the PI plans on focusing on the distinction, for manifolds, between Riemannian non-positive curvature and metric non-positive curvature. The PI also proposes to study discrete versions of Gromov's systolic inequality. Another project involves studying the relation of almost-isometry for groups and spaces. On the topological side of things, the PI plans on giving combinatorial formulas for the topological K-theory of 3-dimensional hyperbolic reflection groups. The PI will also classify Gromov hyperbolic groups with Sierpinski curve boundary. Another project concerns hyperbolization and the sign of the Euler characteristic. Finally, the PI plans on studying the topology of Anosov splittings. For the dynamical aspects of this proposal, the PI wants to establish marked length rigidity for Fuchsian buildings. He also wants to show that certain aspherical manifolds cannot support Anosov diffeomorphisms. Another project is to show the geodesic flow on locally CAT(-1) spaces has the specification property."

Geometric, topological, and probabilistic methods are often used in the study of groups and dynamical systems. The conference will provide an opportunity to all participants to keep abreast of recent developments simultaneously in all five of these components (geometry, topology, probability, group theory, dynamics), with special emphasis on their interplay.  There will be close to 100 participants, who will present 16 invited talks and 45 contributed talks. At least half of the contributed talks will be presented by researchers in early stages of their careers and graduate students. The mixture of participants, ranging from some of the world's most established researchers to postdocs and graduate students, will provide a sense of community and continuity. The conference, blending research and education, will stimulate healthy communication flow and collaboration between researchers in different areas and in different generations for years to come.<br/><br/>The wealth of ideas and applications related to the use of geometric and/or probabilistic approaches in group theory and dynamical systems is immense, and it practically touches all other areas in mathematics. Many important open problems in group theory and dynamical systems are essentially related to asymptotic, geometric, analytic or probabilistic concepts. The conference will showcase the recent advances and achievements related to such problems and it will provide strong momentum and set directions for further research in such diverse areas as amenability, virtual Haken conjecture, CAT(0) cube complexes, random groups and random subgroups, Borel equivalence relations and cost, sofic groups, interval exchange groups, iterated monodromy groups, and many others.

K-theory is the study of vector bundles on spaces and provides very important invariants of the space. Depending on the space considered and the variant of K-theory used, these invariants are of importance to different parts of mathematics ranging from algebraic topology to number theory. As a result, the program theme lies in the intersection of very active areas in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry,with major advances made in the area during the last decade. In view of these, the workshop and conference should be of great interest to junior faculty and graduate students who may be starting their research careers. The program will feature several key-note talks which will survey the historical background, current state of development and prospects for future progress in the focused areas. These talks will provide an opportunity to take a longer view than is customary at many research conferences and should be particularly valuable for young researchers.<br/> <br/> <br/>In recent years, there have been several major advances in the field of Algebraic K-theory, leading up to the solution of the Milnor, Bloch-Kato and Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures. The powerful techniques introduced for the solution of the above conjectures have stimulated work on several outstanding remaining problems in the area. The workshop and conference will focus on the Koszulity conjecture and the Carlsson conjecture, which are among the main remaining open problems after the solution of the Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures. The two conjectures have been around for nearly 20 years and special cases of both have been verified. In view of the solution of the Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures,  this shows the importance and relevance of the above workshop and conference. <br/> <br/> <br/>For the conference web-site, please visit https://people.math.osu.edu/joshua.1/Ktheory_conf.html"

To date the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 52 times. The conference has become an extremely successful semiannual event in the Southwest. The next series of conferences will have seven primary host universities: Rice University, Texas A&M University, The University of Texas at Austin, University of Houston, Texas Tech University, and (jointly) Texas Christian University and The University of Texas at Arlington. By design, the Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has two high-impact foci. First, the conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states (a huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics on a regular basis. In so doing, the conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to discuss their research as well as offering a venue for regional scholars and young people. This stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Second, the conference is committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel base. In order that there be no barrier to participation, the conference is widely advertised, participation is open, and there are no registration fees. Graduate students, junior faculty, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Furthermore the conference is partnering with two historically black universities (Fayetteville State University and Prairie View A&M University) on a project to foster research opportunities for select young faculty at these institutions. <br/><br/>The theme of the upcoming conference at Rice University will concentrate on ""Metric and Conformal Geometry"". Accelerated by the work of Gromov, metric techniques have gained an important place in Riemannian geometry, especially in the study of conformal structures. This development has deeply affected understanding, particularly of Teichmuller spaces, conformal dynamics, hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and symmetric spaces of non-positive curvature. In recent years, some of these metric techniques have also been important in the study of certain random conformal processes. The conference features leading researchers in these various fields, each of which has roots in metric and conformal geometry. <br/><br/>http://math.rice.edu/NewsEvents/Conferences/TGTC2015/"

These spaces will locally be similar to the standard (Euclidean) n-dimensional spaces and may be very complicated globally, but a local observer cannot tell the difference, just as an ant cannot tell whether it is sitting on a flat plane or a very large sphere.  Higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology is defined through contact and symplectic geometry, which in turn are closely related to mathematical physics and string theory.  These studies in higher dimensions should in turn contribute significantly towards our understanding of low-dimensional (i.e., 3- and 4-dimensional) shapes, from the knotting of DNA at the microscopic level to the shape of the universe at the macroscopic level. <br/><br/>The PI will study contact and symplectic geometry in higher dimensions through a higher-dimensional generalization of Heegaard Floer homology.  Heegaard Floer homology, due to Ozsvth and Szab, is a package of invariants of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces as well as knots and links in 3-space, which is extremely effective at distinguishing these spaces and knots and links from one another.  The main goal of the PI's research program is to develop the theory of Heegaard Floer homology in higher dimensions, i.e., in dimensions greater than 4.  This theory is expected to yield important applications to contact and symplectic geometry in higher dimensions, which in turn are related to algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.  Khovanov homology, another important invariant of knots and links in 3-space, can at least conjecturally be viewed as a special case of higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology."

Mathematics instruction has traditionally been very demanding:  mathematicians often ask their students to meet them on the mathematicians' own terms.  The current project turns this arrangement around, bringing beautiful mathematical ideas to the general public on their own terms, in a context they are familiar with, like games or artwork.  To bring each space or symmetry pattern to life, the software creates the illusion of a real physical object that people can hold in the palm of their hands and play with.  While having fun playing a game or painting a picture, people build up an intuitive understanding of the mathematics.  This project's primary goal is to let nonspecialists enjoy modern geometry in the same way that nonspecialists may enjoy literature and music;  at the same time the hope is that this exposure to ""advanced"" geometrical ideas may help prepare and inspire the next generation of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.<br/><br/>In terms of specific mathematical content and the software that brings it to life, the current project has three goals.  The first goal is to improve and extend the five existing Geometry Games flagship apps:  Torus Games (eight familiar games, but played on flat 2-manifolds and 3-manifolds), KaleidoPaint (create colorful paintings under the action of the 17 Euclidean wallpaper groups), KaleidoTile (explore polyhedra and tilings on spherical, flat and hyperbolic surfaces), Curved Spaces (flight simulator for spherical, flat and hyperbolic 3-manifolds) and 4D Draw (4-dimensional vector graphics).  The second goal is to raise the Hyperbolic Games (familiar games on hyperbolic 2-manifolds) from a minor app to flagship quality.  The third goal is to develop two completely new apps:  4D Maze (mazes in 4-dimensional space, as an aid to learning to visualize 4D) and Cross Chase (a projective plane game).  In terms of hardware, delivering versions of all these apps for Android and iOS is an especially high priority, given people's ubiquitous use of smartphones and tablets.  Versions for Macintosh and Windows will of course also be developed."

It was Charles Ehresmann in 1935 who started the study of deformation spaces of geometric structures, asking which ""shapes"" can be ""locally modeled"" on a certain geometry. In 1982 William Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, now a theorem, renewed interest in locally homogeneous spaces, that is, spaces that look the same at each point. This research project studies families of structures on manifolds and how they change when one perturbs them, focusing in particular on geometric and dynamical aspects. As a broader impact, the investigator will involve graduate students in her work, organize activities aimed at junior mathematicians, and deliver lectures outside the University. She also wants to promote the collaborative side of the work, and to create a supportive and attentive environment for members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.<br/><br/>The investigator will employ results and techniques developed in the context of hyperbolic structures to study other geometric structures. For example, she will investigate compact or hyperideal convex polyhedra in anti-de Sitter space, a Lorentzian analogue of the hyperbolic space, and the end(s) of complex hyperbolic manifolds. Many deformation spaces arise from spaces of representations of the fundamental group of a manifold into a Lie group, so the PI is also planning to continue the study of the dynamical decomposition of character varieties of free groups, and of fundamental groups of hyperbolic manifolds with compressible boundary. Finally, the PI will study ""higher Teichmueller theory"", that is, representations of a surface group into Lie groups of higher real rank, and Anosov representations, which are a dynamical analogue of locally homogeneous geometric structures. Since Anosov representations turn out to be generalizations of convex cocompact subgroups of rank one Lie groups to the context of discrete subgroups of Lie groups of higher rank, the PI plans to use techniques developed for Kleinian groups in order to study limits of Anosov representations. It is anticipated that results and techniques coming from differential geometry and low-dimensional topology will inspire new research directions with deep connections with dynamical systems, Lie theory, complex analysis, and even algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory, and physics."

The research projects invoke new ideas and techniques, creating leverage to address several important problems regarding the topology of smooth and symplectic 4-manifolds, and that of contact 3-manifolds and their fillings. A key aspect of this program is the reduction of many intricate problems to fairly simple algebraic relations between curves on surfaces, which sets an excellent ground to present problems accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students. The PI will engage and mentor students in related research topics.<br/><br/>This is a project in low dimensional geometry and topology, focusing on a variety of profound questions involving symplectic 4-manifolds and contact 3-manifolds. Some of the projects on 4-manifolds are pertinent to classification of symplectic Calabi-Yau surfaces, diversity of Lefschetz pencils and fibrations, novel constructions of small exotic and symplectic 4-manifolds, and complexity in various stable equivalences. As for 3-manifolds, the PI will probe the complexity in Giroux correspondence in terms of open book support genus, the characterization of newly discovered contact 3-manifolds with arbitrarily large Stein fillings, diversity of complex curves bounding links in the 3-sphere, and generalizations of quasi-positive links. Gauge theory, new mapping class group techniques and symplectic surgeries will play a vital role in this program."

It has long been known that in general one cannot hope to find exact solutions to polynomial equations, even for a single equation in one variable. Nevertheless, it is often possible to answer more qualitative questions about the set of solutions. In particular, one of the most fundamental and notoriously difficult questions in algebraic geometry is whether solutions exist at all. Motivic homotopy theory is a relatively new approach to such questions, and it has already helped solve many open problems in the past twenty years. It borrows many ideas and techniques from a different field of mathematics, topology, and successfully applies them to algebraic geometry in unexpected ways. Following this trend, this project aims to bring several fruitful ideas from topology to the world of algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This project consists of two parts. In the first part, the PI will develop equivariant motivic homotopy theory from the point of view of parametrized homotopy theory. In the second part, the PI will study highly structured commutative algebras in motivic homotopy theory and hopes to address the problem of recognizing motivic loop spaces. More specifically, the PI will lay solid foundations for equivariant motivic homotopy theory by constructing Grothendieck's six-functor formalism for fiberwise homotopy theory over algebraic stacks. The mere existence of this formalism has interesting consequences for classical invariants of stacks, like algebraic K-theory; it can also be used to construct new well-behaved cohomological invariants of algebraic stacks, and to better understand the relations between them. In the second part of this project, the PI will introduce a motivic refinement of the notion of E_infinity ring and show that many classical cohomological invariants of algebraic varieties possess this refined multiplicative structure. The PI will also introduce the related notion of motivic E_infinity space and investigate their role in a potential recognition principle for infinite motivic loop spaces. To achieve these goals, the PI will use existing as well as new methods from equivariant algebraic geometry, ordinary motivic homotopy theory, classical algebraic topology, and higher category theory."

In elementary school we learn that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle on the plane is 180 degrees. This fact characterizes Euclidean geometry, which is the model space of zero curvature.  Similarly, negatively curved geometries are characterized by the fact that the sum of the interior angles of (small non-degenerate) triangles is always less than 180 degrees.  Non-positively curved geometries are defined in the same way: the sums mentioned above are less than or equal to 180 degrees.  In this project we will try to construct more of these geometries on spaces, either on singular spaces or non-singular spaces (non-singular spaces are called manifolds).<br/><br/>Recent work has found smoothings of some of the singular metrics on hyperbolized cube manifolds produced by the methods of Charney and Davis to obtain Riemannian metrics with curvatures close to -1.  These constructions have needed relatively large pieces for the Charney-Davis hyperbolization construction and a new project seeks to eliminate this requirement.  Several projects concern the space of all negatively curved metrics on a space, addressing the generalizations to this context of the classical moduli and Teichmueller spaces.  One line of investigation continues the study of the potentially nontrivial homotopy type of the nonclassical counterparts to Teichmueller space, while another studies topological invariance: If M and N are smooth manifolds which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic, and if M supports a negatively curved Riemannian metric, must N also carry such a metric?"

The subject has attracted the attention of mathematical researchers from disparate fields who have traditionally worked in parallel.  A principal goal of this conference is to bring together these researchers from number theory, algebraic topology, and applied model theory to propel the study of the Witt vectors in all of these fields through this intellectual cross-fertilization.<br/> <br/>The conference will concentrate on topics related to  Witt vectors. The Witt vectors have been especially crucial in the arithmetic geometry, notably in p-adic Hodge theory.  Even more recently, in the form of the de Rham--Witt complex, the Witt vectors have had important applications in algebraic topology, especially in the work of Hesselholt-Madsen and their followers on algebraic K-theory. In the meantime, Witt vectors have grown further in number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry, perhaps most importantly in Buium's work. His key insight was that Witt vectors are closely related to certain arithmetic analogues of differential operators, and he was then able to extend large parts of classical differential algebraic geometry to an ""arithmetic differential"" algebraic geometry. Here, we take seriously the analogy that ordinary differentiation is to formal power series as arithmetic differentiation is to the Witt vectors. This program includes, most notably, extending applications in Diophantine questions over function fields to such questions over number fields. This aspect of the theory was then picked up and carried further by applied model theorists especially in the work of Blair-Macintyre-Scanlon in which Ax-Kochen-Ershov-style theorems are proven for the Witt vectors considered as a first-order structure in the language of rings augmented by the Witt-Frobenius operator and then in the work of Scanlon (and the recent extensions by Rideau) putting Buium's p-differential operators into a model theoretic context.  The work of Chatzidakis-Hrushovski on the model theory of difference fields brought out the fine structure of the algebraic part of the theory of arithmetic differential equations.  The subsequent applications of this theory to diophantine geometry by Hrushovski and Scanlon demonstrated its power and the reworking of the theory by Pink-Rssler and then by Rssler alone returned the ideas to algebraic geometry proper. As number theory, algebraic topology, and applied model theory have traditionally been quite separate fields, and it has not been easy for experts on Witt vectors and arithmetic differentiation in one of these fields to keep on top of developments in the others, even though they are working with largely the same mathematical objects. The purpose of the conference, then, is to remedy this. It will bring together researchers in these fields who study Witt vectors and arithmetic differentiation from their own points of view and for their own purposes. This will allow them to learn about the latest developments in other fields. Further, one hopes that bringing together researchers from very different traditions with very different ways of thinking about the same mathematical objects will lead to jolts forward in all of these fields.<br/><br/>Conference web site: https://math.berkeley.edu/~scanlon/aad15.html"
