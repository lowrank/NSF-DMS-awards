In the early 1990's difficult  techniques were developed and used by the principal investigator   and others to prove sharp statements about the computations  and structure of the Donaldson invariants (which were introduced in  1984).  The October 1994 introduction of the brilliantly conceived  and more easily handled Seiberg-Witten invariants has made clear  the role of these Donaldson invariants in the study of smooth  4-manifolds.  Now that the dust has begun to settle, it is time to  review our understanding of smooth 4-manifolds.  Surprisingly, most  of the questions and problems related to the topology of smooth  4-manifolds present in September 1994 remain open.  In particular,  we still do not know how to classify simply-connected smooth  4-manifolds.  The first part of this project is to determine the  fundamental building blocks and to determine the operations  performed on these building blocks to recover any given smooth  4-manifold.  As a focal point, given a simply-connected irreducible  smooth 4-manifold X, does there exist a finite collection of  complex surfaces, each of which carries a pencil of curves from  which X is obtained by using the following three operations: (1) fiber  sum along a general fiber of the pencils; (2) local fiber sum  along tori of square zero; (3) performing a topological log  transform on tori of square zero?  The second part of this project  is to determine the effectiveness of the Seiberg-Witten and  Donaldson invariants.  In particular, does the deformation type of  a complex surface determine its diffeomorphism type?  This project  will begin to focus on explicit examples (the Horikawa surfaces)  that have the same Seiberg-Witten and Donaldson invariants, are  known to be deformation inequivalent (i.e., not the same as complex  manifolds), but are not known to be diffeomorphic.  One disturbing  feature of the Seiberg-Witten and  Donaldson invariants is that they  are defined only for manifolds for which the sum of its signature  and Euler characteristic is divisible by an odd multiple of 4.  The  final part of this project will focus on those simply-connected  4-manifolds for which the sum of the signature and Euler  characteristic is divisible by an even multiple of 4, and about  which virtually nothing is known.       At bottom, this project centers on the classification of objects  that are locally modeled on 4-dimensional Euclidean space and upon  which one can do differential calculus for real-valued functions.     These objects are the so-called smooth four-dimensional manifolds.    The basic technique is to extract algebraic topological data   from the solution space on these manifolds of partial   differential equations that arise in theoretical physics,  i.e., to use gauge-theoretic techniques.  It is known that one  cannot expect simply to give a complete list of smooth 4-manifolds.   However, one can expect to determine classifiable fundamental  objects and a list of operations that one can perform on these  objects in order to obtain any smooth 4-manifold.  It is the goal  of this project to provide these building blocks and assembly  rules.  Further, the behavior under these operations of known and  future invariants of smooth 4-manifolds should be easily determined.    Success of the project will create another strong tie between  topology and theoretical physics, partly because, as noted above, the   topological tools involved come from gauge theory, i.e., from quantum   mechanics, and partly because any light shed on 4-manifolds bears on   our understanding of the 4-dimensional space-time of relativity theory.  ***"

The main theme is to study conjectures of Sir Michael Atiyah on  (homology) three-spheres, using invariants obtained from mathematical  physics, especially conformal field theory and string theory, and  symplectic topology.  The investigator and R. Lee have studied the  first conjecture of Sir Michael Atiyah on identifying these invariants  of three-spheres, and also extended the invariants to slightly larger  classes of three-spheres.  The major part of this project is, not only  to identify these invariants (the first Atiyah conjecture), but also  to identify the way to relate these invariants to each other (the  second Atiyah conjecture).  Such an identification suggests a ""hidden  duality"" between conformal field theory and four-dimensional  Yang-Mills theory.  The other part of this project is to study  intrinsic properties for the invariants of larger classes of  three-spheres.  It is a fundamental aim to investigate the change of  the new invariants under certain topological operations.  The project  will lead to a study of relations between Floer theory, which is an  invariant from mathematical physics, and other constructions of knot  theory, as well as the generalization of the invariants to general  three-manifolds.       A three-dimensional manifold is a space where a nearsighted person  sees a standard three-dimensional space everywhere.  (Homology)  three-spheres are those three-manifolds that one cannot tell from the  standard three-sphere by using the usual topological tools.  That such exist  indicates the complexity of the world we live in, even ignoring the time  dimension, thus making three-spheres of cosmological and physical  interest.  The topological invariants in the project are intended to  distinguish manifolds by systematically studying their properties with  respect to several quantum field theories.  It is therefore valuable  to investigate these new invariants and their structure s for  three-spheres and general three-manifolds.  This project addresses  some of the most fundamental problems in this subject.  ***"

Several of these conjectures are motivated by Marden's tameness  conjecture, which predicts that every hyperbolic 3-manifold with  finitely generated fundamental group is topologically tame, i.e.,  homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold.  Professor  Canary has previously established that topological tameness has strong  consequences for the geometry of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.  He will  also study the relationship between the algebraic limit and the  geometric limit of a sequence of Kleinian groups.  This study is  inspired by Thurston's ending lamination conjecture, which provides a  conjectural classification of all hyperbolic 3-manifolds.       A 3-manifold is a mathematical space such that about any point there  is a neighborhood which can be identified with a ball in 3-dimensional  space.  One can imagine building 3-dimensional manifolds by gluing  together 3-dimensional blocks.  Of course, this gluing would have to  be an abstract gluing in general, not one which could be done in  3-dimensional space.  For example, consider the 3-manifold obtained by  taking the unit cube and gluing the top to the bottom, the front to  the back, and the left side to the right side.  A Riemannian metric is  a way of measuring distances and angles in a 3-manifold.  For  instance, the world we live in is a 3-manifold with a Riemannian  metric.  In the 1970's, Wiliam Thurston conjectured that every  3-manifold can be cut up, in a canonical way, so that each piece has a  Riemannian metric of one of 8 geometric types.  He proved his  conjecture for large classes of three-manifolds.  The 3-manifolds  which admit seven of the eight geometric types of Riemannian metrics  are completely classified and well-understood.  3-manifolds that  admit the eighth type of metric are called hyperbolic and are currently  a subject of intense interest and act ivity in the fields of geometry  and topology.  Professor Canary is investigating the relationship between  the topology and the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  ***"

This project aims to study  the extension of this invariant to a holomorphic function of the parameter.  Following work of Murakami, Ohtsuki, Rozansky and the Principal  Investigator, it is currently possible to define such an extension only for  specific manifolds.  The goal of the project is to understand better the  relationship between this function, specific values that it takes, its  asymptotic expansion, and a combinatorial description of the geometry and  topology of the original manifold.  This should lead to combinatorial  formulae for finite type 3-manifold invariants, generalizations of the  Casson invariant, as well as a discretization of the Chern-Simons-Witten  Feynman integral and comparisons with the Kontsevich integrals.       Although much is known about the so-called quantum family of  invariants of knots and links in three dimensions, which are generally  polynomial functions of a complex parameter, the same is currently not true  for their 3-manifold counterparts.  From the few known results on these  functions, they are seen to have intriguing number theoretic properties,  the investigation of which is the subject of this project.

Low-dimensional topology is mainly concerned with classifying spaces of dimensions three and four, where two spaces are treated as equivalent if one space can be deformed onto the other without tearing - this is known as a homeomorphic transformation. Such a classification, known as the topological classification, has been essentially carried out in dimensions other than three and four. It turns out that these two dimensions provide further technical difficulties, some of which are topics of much current interest as they interface with various ideas of modern physics."

Rips's theory of real trees and from the  train track theory of Bestvina and Handel.  The Principal Investigator  will also examine to what extent the JSJ theorem of Rips and Z. Sela  can be extended to splittings over other than cyclic groups.       Now is an exciting time to be a geometric group theorist.  Much  beautiful mathematics is devoted to classification results.  For  example, the classification of surfaces (spaces, such as the sphere, that  are locally the same as a plane) is classical.  This classification is  akin to Mendeleev's periodic table of the elements -- each surface  appears once and only once.  In recent years, due in large part to the  geometric ideas of W. Thurston, there has been great progress towards a  classification theorem for 3-manifolds (spaces that are locally like 3-  dimensional space).  Inspired by these manifold successes,  mathematicians have begun to look at groups from a geometric viewpoint.  (A group is a fundamental object found throughout mathematics and the  sciences.  Roughly speaking, a group is the set of symmetries of some  object.)  Mathematics has arrived at the point where the possibility of a  classification theorem for (geometric) groups can be envisioned.  For  example, a recent result of E. Rips and Z. Sela describes how to break  a group into more fundamental pieces.  In the current project, the  Principal Investigator will continue his research along these lines.  More specifically, he will show how to break up groups into fundamental  pieces in ways other than that of Rips and Sela.  Also, he will continue  his work with M. Bestvina and M. Handel undertaking a detailed study of  some of the groups that will play a key role in this classification.  ***"

Since  all the known examples come from subgroups of the rotation group that  act freely on the 3-sphere, the manifolds involved have positive constant  curvature, and the problem is known as the spherical space-form problem.  Together with I. Hambleton, Ronnie Lee plans to solve this problem using  Donaldson's theory of instantons.  Closely related to the above and in  collaboration with S.Cappell and E.Miller, Ronnie Lee plans to study  generalizations of Casson's invariants and show that they belong to the  so-called ""finite type invariants.""  With Weiping Li, the principal  investigator plans to investigate two types of Floer homologies.  The first,  known as the instanton Floer homology, is obtained by applying Morse  theory to an infinite dimensional space of connections, and the second,  known as the symplectic Floer homology, is based on the Lagrangian  intersection theory of a representation variety.  They plan to show that  these are the same theory and hence establish a conjecture of Atiyah.  Finally, with Wilczynski, the principal investigator plans to study the  problem of finding locally flat surfaces of minimum genus representing a  given homology class of a simply connected 4-manifold.  In the smooth  setting, the corresponding problem is known as the Thom conjecture and  has been solved recently by P.Kronheimer and T.Mrowka to great acclaim.       In short, the project plans to study several well-known  problems in 3- and 4-dimensional manifold theory concerning the basic  symmetric nature of these objects and also the geometry of the  submanifolds inside them.  Many of the techniques to be used in solving these  problems are new and were not previously available.  They were  developed through the interaction between quantum physics and topology  in recent years.  On the mathematics side they are known under the  heading of Sympl ectic Invariants, while on the physics side they have  their counterpart in Quantum Field Theory.  ***"

Venema is currently   investigating problems involving existence of topological embeddings   in codimension two.  For example, he is working on the problem of   determining which elements of the second homology group of a   simply-connected 4-dimensional manifold can be represented by   topologically embedded (possibly wild) 2-spheres.  This is a   special case of the following, more general, problem: If a  compact n-dimensional manifold-with-boundary has the homotopy type of  some closed (n-2)-manifold, then is there a (wild) topological  embedding of the second manifold into the first which is a homotopy  equivalence?  What if the manifolds are highly connected?       This project concerns Venema's efforts to understand knotted spheres  in 4-dimensional space.  Specifically, he is investigating the  question of what sorts of knots can be formed from different kinds of  spheres.  In the study of spheres in 4-dimensional spaces, three  different kinds of spheres have proved to be useful: those that are  smooth (possess continuously varying tangent vectors), those that are  piecewise linear (made up of a finite number of triangles), and those  that are topological (formed by continuous deformation).  Spheres of  the first two types are fairly well understood, and there is a  reasonably well developed theory which predicts when a continuous  function from a sphere into a space can be deformed to a one-to-one  function whose image is a smooth or piecewise linear sphere.  This  research project aims to understand the mysteries of topological  spheres.  ***"

They occur ubiquitously in  mathematics and its applications and are among the most important  objects of study in all of mathematics.  Their most observable  topological properties are that of being finite dimensional, locally  contractible, having the local homology of euclidean n-space, and  allowing nicely embedded subspaces to be put in general position.  A  space is called a generalized n-manifold if it satisfies all of these  properties, except possibly the last.  If in addition, n is at least 5  and X allows general position, X is said to satisfy the disjoint disks  property (DDP).  The long standing conjecture that a generalized  n-manifold X having the DDP must be a topological manifold was  disproved recently by the investigators in joint work with S. C. Ferry  and Shmuel Weinberger.  Among the most significant questions that  remain concerning generalized manifolds and that are the subject of  this project is the question of whether generalized manifolds are  topologically homogeneous.  Other goals are to establish other  structure theorems for DDP generalized manifolds that are known to  hold for topological manifolds, such as the s-cobordism theorem,  various splitting theorems, and regular neighborhood theorems.  Splitting theorems, in particular, would be useful in attacking the  conjecture that the pathology exhibited by generalized manifolds  resides in dimension 4.       It has been quite a shock for topologists to learn that  n-dimensional manifolds are not characterized by a small collection of  their most obvious properties, as had been conjectured.  Since these  spaces are the most heavily used in mathematics, it is highly  desirable to understand this phenomenon better.  The two  co-investigators, who were among the four who dispatched the  conjecture several years ago, are now intent on doing just this.  As  mentioned above, they will attempt to le arn whether, like ordinary  topological manifolds, generalized manifolds exhibit the same  topological structure in the vicinity of each of their points.  The  interest of these spaces arises from their potential as models for  several phenomena observed in the study of dynamical systems,  geometric group theory, and other areas, but lack of such homogeneity  would seriously limit this potential.  ***"

Gabai indicates that certain fundamentally  important open problems in 3-manifold theory will be solved if an  appropriate understanding of solid tube neighborhoods around short  geodesics in hyperbolic 3-manifolds can be developed.  For example, if  it can be shown that sufficiently large solid tube neighborhoods can  be found in any hyperbolic 3-manifold, then it would follow that  closed (irreducible) 3-manifolds that are homotopy equivalent to  closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds are themselves hyperbolic.  This project  has as its goal to gain a deep understanding of solid tubes in  hyperbolic 3-manifolds and to apply this understanding to fundamental  problems in 3-manifold theory.  The methods employed involve  parametrizing the possible ways that shortest geodesics can sit in  hyperbolic 3-manifolds and then analyzing the resulting parameter  space by means of rigorous computer programs.  This work is joint with  D. Gabai and N. Thurston.       In the late 18th century, Henri Poincare pioneered the study of  3-manifolds.  One of his best methods was to analyze all loops in the  3-manifold in question; in particular, he studied the so-called   fundamental group of the 3-manifold.  Poincare's general question was,   if I understand the fundamental group, do I thereby understand the  3-manifold completely?  (The infamous Poincare Conjecture is a  specific instance of this general question.)  In the late 1970's and  early 1980's, William Thurston revolutionized the study of 3-manifolds  by showing that most 3-manifolds have hyperbolic structures  (hyperbolic geometry is the most important non-Euclidean geometry).  This leads to a natural and important Poincare type question: If a  compact (irreducible) 3-manifold has the same fundamental group as a  compact hyperbolic 3-manifold, must it be a hyperbolic 3-manifold as  well?  The goal of this project is to answer this question in the  affirmative.  The method is to reduce the question to an analysis of a   certain region in a 6-dimensional space that is related to solid tubes  around shortest geodesics in hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  The plan is to  break this region up into about a billion sub-boxes and to deal with  each of these sub-boxes separately.  Naturally, this involves the use  of a (rigorous!) computer program.  ***"

This is an important aspect of classical knot  theory and has potential applications to the Poincare conjecture.  A  second goal is to improve the known bounds for the distance between  various types of exceptional Dehn fillings of a 3-manifold with torus  boundary.  This amounts to achieving a quantitative understanding of  the phenomenon that a generic Dehn surgery on a hyperbolic knot  produces a hyperbolic manifold.  A third objective is to improve some  of the known lower bounds for volumes of hyperbolic manifolds under  various topological restrictions.  Such bounds give a quantitative  understanding of the Mostow Rigidity Theorem, which implies that the  volume of a hyperbolic manifold is a topological invariant.       Topology is the branch of mathematics that deals with properties of  geometric objects that are so universal that they are unaffected by  any distortion of the shape of the object.  A simple example of such a  property is the winding number of a closed circuit in the plane.  If  the circuit does not pass through the origin, then it winds around the  origin a certain number of times, and that number is not affected by  any distortion of the circuit (just so long as it never passes through the  origin during its deformation).  This was the main idea in Gauss's  first proof that every polynomial equation has a solution in the  complex numbers and was the origin of the subject of topology.  The  geometric objects being studied by Culler and Shalen are 3-dimensional  spaces, one example of which is our physical universe.  (The  geometric and topological properties of the physical universe are  not yet understood, but modern physics has shown that it is definitely  not the 3-dimensional Euclidean space that we study in high school.)  This research focuses on various numerical quantities that are   determined by the geometric properties of the space.  The goal is to  understand how the fundamental topological properties of the space are  reflected in these quantities.  In very general terms, this is  analogous to the process by which the chemical composition of a star  can be deduced by studying its spectrogram.  ***"

Other directions of research are study of configuration spaces of  line arrangements and mechanical linkages in homogeneous metric  spaces in relation with the representation theory of certain classes  of finitely generated groups (Artin and Coxeter groups) and  investigation of the ``Riemann-Hilbert problem'' from the  topological point of view.       The project focuses in part on the structure of symmetries of  objects naturally arising in geometry, algebra, and differential  equations.  The ancient Greeks understood symmetries of Platonic  solids, e.g., a cube.  Platonic solids are positively curved, and they  have a finite number of symmetries.  At the opposite end of the  spectrum are negatively curved objects, such as the Lobachevsky  hyperbolic plane (featured frequently in Escher paintings), and  these typically have infinitely many symmetries.  Consequently, the  structure of these symmetries is both more interesting and harder to  understand.       Another part of the project is the study of linkages.  These are  mechanical devices constructed from rigid rods connected at joints.  It is a classical problem to describe the possible shapes traced out  by an end of a linkage after affixing another end with a nail.  For  example, a compass can be regarded as a (very simple) linkage, and it  traces out a circle.  This project explores the surprising  relationship between the shapes traced out by a linkage and  certain symmetries of spaces of solutions of algebraic equations.       The final part of the project is concerned with symmetries arising  from a system of differential equations.  ***"

A main focus of the  investigation is on the topology of Stein surfaces, or complex affine  varieties that are also smooth 4-manifolds.  These are automatically  Kaehler, hence symplectic, and when their topology is finite, they  have natural boundaries that are contact 3-manifolds.  The principal  investigator is studying Stein surfaces by means of their handle  decompositions, addressing questions such as the following:  Which  3-manifolds arise as boundaries of Stein surfaces, i.e., which  3-manifolds admit holomorphically fillable contact structures?  Which  homotopy classes of 2-plane fields on a given 3-manifold can be  realized in this manner?  How many Stein surfaces can have a given  3-manifold as boundary?  Through the known connections between  symplectic and 4-manifold topology (such as Seiberg-Witten theory),  this should relate to the classification problem for smooth  4-manifolds as well as to other problems, such as the slice genus of  classical knots.       One of the cornerstones of modern mathematics and physics is the  notion of a ""manifold,"" that is, a space that looks locally like  ordinary Euclidean space.  Curves are 1-dimensional manifolds, and  surfaces are 2-dimensional.  The space in which we live is  3-dimensional, and the universe, space-time, is an example of a  4-manifold.  A basic question of topology is what shapes such spaces  can have.  Ironically, the familiar dimensions 3 and 4 are by far the  least understood -- even less understood than dimensions 5 and higher,  where there is more ""room"" in which to work.  Almost nothing was  known about the shapes of 4-manifolds until 15 years ago, when the  revolutionary breakthroughs of Freedman and Donaldson led to an  explosive growth in knowledge and techniques.  In the last few years,  it has become apparent that topology in low dimensions (i.e., 3 and 4)  is intimately linked to sympl ectic and contact geometry.  These  latter fields emerged from classsical physics (Hamiltonian  mechanics), and in recent years they have become rapidly developing  independent subjects with connections to various other areas of  mathematics (for example, algebraic geometry).  The principal  investigator has been studying 4-manifolds since the initial  breakthroughs in the field, and he is now examining the connections  between low-dimensional topology and symplectic and contact geometry.  Using topological techniques, he recently expanded the scope of  symplectic geometry by showing that symplectic structures are much  more common than originally believed.  He is currently producing new  examples of contact structures, and new tools for analyzing them.  He  anticipates that continued investigation of the interplay between  these three areas should lead to further insight into all three.  ***"

The  main goal is further to circumscribe the various exceptional (non-hyperbolic)  surgeries on hyperbolic knots.  The known bounds on the number and nature of  such surgeries are now quite sharp in many cases, and it seems that it may  eventually be possible (at least modulo the Geometrization Conjecture of  Thurston) to give an essentially complete description of all exceptional  surgeries.  The methods used will be based largely on the combinatorial-  topological techniques developed by Gordon and John Luecke in their previous   work on Dehn surgery, such as the proof of the Knot Complement Conjecture.       This project deals with knot theory and 3-dimensional topology, the  general goal of the latter being to understand the structure of 3-dimensional  manifolds.  These are objects that are locally like ordinary 3-dimensional  Euclidean space but whose global structure may be quite complicated.  Since  we live in a 3-manifold, one might say that 3-dimensional topology aims to   describe what the mathematical possibilities are for our spatial universe.    This aim is still not realized, although there is tantalizing evidence that  such a description might ultimately be possible.  One important aspect of  3-dimensional topology is the theory of knots---a knot being a closed loop  embedded somehow in ordinary 3-dimensional space.  On the one hand, results  about 3-manifolds often give information about knots as special cases, while  on the other hand, a wide variety of mathematical methods can be applied to  the study of knots, leading in turn to new information about 3-manifolds.    (Recently, deep connections between 3-dimensional topology and quantum field  theory were discovered in this way.)  The main vehicle by which knot theory  relates to the general theory of 3-manifolds is Dehn surgery, and this is the  focus of the current project.  In Dehn surgery, a solid tube around a knot is  removed and ""s ewn back"" differently, giving a new 3-manifold.  If one allows  links (i.e., several loops linked together) as well as knots, then every  3-manifold can be obtained in this way, so a sufficiently good understanding   of this construction would have important implications for the general theory   of 3-manifolds.  ***"

Of  particular interest are properties of incompressible surfaces in  hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and interactions between number theory and  algebra on the one hand and hyperbolic 3-manifolds on the other.    The former involves the study of the existence and construction of   incompressible surfaces in hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the latter   concentrates on how certain invariants arising from algebraic data   associated to a hyperbolic 3-manifold are related to the geometry and   topology of the the 3-manifold.       The study of surfaces in 3-manifolds plays an important role in  3-dimensional topology.  Indeed, many of the deepest results in 3-manifold  topology have arisen from the study of how surfaces map into  3-manifolds.  Apart from their application in 3-manifold topology, the  study of surfaces in 3-manifolds has had many interesting applications  in physics.  The number theoretic connections alluded to above have  proved important in recent years in proving theorems about hyperbolic  3-manifolds.  One of the simplest number theoretic connections is  through the volume of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.

Experimentation  in this field, essential to the formulation of theorems and  conjectures, is currently hampered by the very large amount of  labor entailed in classifying and analyzing even a single example  of a surface homeomorphism.

The software is made available  via the World Wide Web.       One studies dynamical systems to explain and make  predictions about a vast range of phenomena, from the motions of  the stars and planets, to the circulation of the Earth's  atmosphere, to the behavior of machinery such as drilling rigs  and human hearts, to the self-propulsion of bacteria.  In  describing such phenomena, which are repetitive in character,  models in the form of iterated maps from some space to itself  frequently have great explanatory and predictive power.  Perhaps  the simplest class of realistic models is that of continuous maps  of two-dimensional surfaces.  Even simple members of this class  can exhibit a bewildering complexity of behavior, and many  questions about these systems have yet to be answered.  Maps of  punctured surfaces are of interest because of their bearing on  the relationships among periodic orbits and on long-standing  problems of the theory of knots.  The purpose of this project is  to develop a software tool for experimentation in the topological  properties of maps of punctured surfaces.  Topological properties,  those that ar e persistent under distortions of the surface or  map, are the most fundamental.  The software is made available via  the World Wide Web."

A prominent open question in this field is Thurston's Ending  Lamination Conjecture, which states that a hyperbolic 3-manifold is  uniquely determined by its topological type and a list of invariants  that describe the asymptotic geometry of its ends.  Consequences of  this conjecture include a rigidity theorem for Kleinian group actions  on the sphere, directly analogous to outstanding rigidity conjectures  in holomorphic dynamics, and a topological description of parameter  spaces of isomorphic Kleinian groups.  Minsky previously established  these conjectures in special cases, and the techniques developed show  promise for extension to the general case.  A number of projects have  grown out of this program, whose successful completion should  contribute to the solution of the conjecture, as well as being of  independent interest.  These projects investigate topological  characterizations of Kleinian group actions on the sphere, some  phenomena associated with geometric limits of Kleinian groups (with  R. Canary and J. Brock), and the large scale geometry and  combinatorics of the Teichmueller space of a surface (with H. Masur).  Minsky is also considering (with M. Lyubich) a new construction that  associates to a rational map a 3-dimensional hyperbolic object  analogous to the quotient 3-orbifold of a Kleinian group.  This object  renders more explicit the powerful analogies between Kleinian groups  and other holomorphic dynamical systems.       In the study of low-dimensional geometry, topology and dynamics,   one witnesses the depth of interconnection between fields of  mathematics.  Henri Poincare, who studied both celestial dynamics and  complex analysis (among many other things), observed in the 19th  century that the conformal transformations of the Riema nn sphere --  some of the building blocks of complex analysis -- extend to act on  the three-dimensional ball bounded by the sphere, and their action  preserves a complete, homogeneous metric, the metric of Hyperbolic or  Non-Euclidean Space.  This opened the door to a beautiful theory  relating topology, geometry, and complex dynamics, which was only  seriously explored in the latter part of this century.  The rigidity  problem mentioned above is essentially the question of to what extent  the topological, or combinatorial, properties of a system determine  its geometric properties.  This and other basic questions in the field  can be phrased in geometric, topological or dynamical terms, and are  still linked to some of the motivating questions about physical  systems of which Poincare was aware a hundred years ago.  Issues such  as classification of systems, mapping out regions of stability and  instability, deformation and bifurcation of families of systems, and  probabilistic properties such as ergodicity, all have significance in  both pure and applied mathematics.  Topology and geometry have already  provided deep insights into such issues, and one hopes that further  study of these interactions will continue to bear fruit.  ***"

Outstanding conjectures have fallen, one  after the other, with the application of hyperbolic techniques.  There has  been a shift in the entire approach to low dimensional topology, as  researchers now use rigid geometric arguments to prove topological  theorems.  The investigators intend to continue their research, both   individually and jointly, on the theory and computation of hyperbolic   3-manifolds.  Through a set of projects, many relying heavily on their   ability to compute examples on the computer, the researchers plan to further   the understanding of the connections between hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the   invariants that come out of hyperbolic 3-manifold theory, and the traditional   topological invariants in 3-manifold theory.       A sphere, a torus and a 2-holed torus are examples of topologically  distinct 2-dimensional surfaces.  For about 100 years mathematicians have  known that the only possible (finite) surfaces are the n-holed tori and a  corresponding family of nonorientable surfaces (e.g., the nonorientable  surface corresponding to a 1-holed torus is a Klein bottle).  In contrast,  the topological possibilities for a 3-dimensional space are vastly richer.  The beautiful relationships among the possible 3-dimensional spaces have  been greatly clarified since 1978, when William Thurston discovered that  the best way to understand the topology of the spaces was to give them  shapes of constant curvature.  The present project continues to explore the  relationships between the curvature and the topology.  Because  the shapes can be computed by hand only in a very few cases, the  project also continues to develop and support computer software for  creating the spaces and studying their properties.  This NSF funded  software is freely available, and it is used not only by mathematicians, but  also by cosmologists seeking to model the shape of the real  universe, and  by physicists modelling the behavior of various dynamical systems.  ***"

Garoufalidis, of finite-type invariants of homology 3-spheres, in   particular, their relationship with filtrations of various subgroups of the   mapping class group of a surface.  He will continue to study the Morse theory   of harmonic 1-forms, in particular, the question: for every closed Morse   1-form, is there a harmonic 1-form with the same critical points and in the   same cohomology class?  The next case to consider is when the associated   foliation has all compact leaves.  He will also continue to study invariants   of manifolds arising from previous work on jumps of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer   eta-invariant and return to questions about link concordance.

He also plans to study the Steenrod operations in an   algebraic setting and the construction of minimal models.       To put it less technically, Daniel Ruberman's project is concerned with   properties of four-dimensional spaces called manifolds.  Among the questions   under study are the existence and geometrical properties of two-dimensional   surfaces sitting inside a four-dimensional manifold.  Ruberman will also   investigate symmetries of four-dimensional spaces in order to determine when   a pair of symmetries can be joined by a one-parameter family of symmetries.    The approach to these investigations is via the Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten   equations of mathematical physics, which arise in studies of the fundamental   particles.  There are several formulas coming from various branches of   mathematics and physics that are known to represent the same geometric   phenomena that are manifested in many ways, ranging from the circles and   lines in the plane to the equations of gravity.  Using his knowledge of these   methods, Kiyoshi Igusa will be investigating the relationship between these   formulas.  Jerome Levine will be working to determine those invariants of   3-dimensional manifolds that are computable in a very explicit sense and that   seem to be closely related to invariants coming from quantum field theory.

General  formulae for invariants of singular varieties will be developed and  will be applied, using toric varieties, to obtain precise comparisons  of lattice summation and integration.  Analytical, combinatorial and  number theoretical aspects of these comparisons will be explored with  a view to many possible applications.  Another line of investigation  will be the use of symplectic geometrical methods in the study of  representation-theoretic invariants of three-manifolds.  This will  include a series of studies of Maslov indices and analytical formulae  for Casson's SU(2) invariant as well as a study of SU(n) invariants.  A third area of investigation will be the development of a  satisfactory general theory for the topological classification of  finite group actions on manifolds; this will encompass such  foundational questions as the appropriate notion of functoriality for  this classification problem in a given homotopy type.       Non-technical summary: In this project, constructions and ideas   drawn from topology and geometry will be used to get precise formulae   that compare multidimensional integration with lattice summations.  Such   comparison formulae have been available for several centuries for  one-dimensional integrals and sums, i.e., in the Euler-MacLaurin  expansion, but have not been available in adequate generality in the  higher dimensional settings needed for many applications.  Through a  series of intermediate steps, such problems have been translated into  questions about the topology of spaces which have singularities (that  is, which are not uniform) and the measurement of how such  singularities contribute to the computation of invariants of such  spaces.  The deep methods of modern topology will be applied to  resolve these geometrical ques tions and hence ultimately to solve the  concrete problems of precise comparisons of integrals and sums.  Envisioned applications include new approaches to rapid integration  and to discrete optimization.  ***"

The aim of this project is to  make progress in settling some of these problems, mainly by creating  new constructions of topological spaces.  The principal technique to  be used has its origin in a paper of M.E.Rudin, where an example of a  normal but not collectionwise normal simplicial complex is constructed.  In that paper Rudin uses countable substructures of a structure of  size 2^c on a set of cardinality c (= the cardinality of the real  line) to code normality.  Refinements of and improvements on this  technique will be used to attack seven problems from the literature as  well as to obtain related results.  A typical such problem is whether  and which normal, screenable (= every open cover has a sigma-disjoint  open refinement) spaces are paracompact.       The following two important properties of the usual Euclidean  space are often used in mathematics.  (1) Every continuous function on  a closed set can be continuously extended over the entire space  (normality).  (2) Continuous local structures can be continuously  amalgamated into global ones (paracompactness).  Research during and  before the early fifties showed that many of the more general types of  spaces used in mathematical applications also have one or both of  these properties; those that do are called, respectively, normal and  paracompact spaces.  Major breakthroughs in the seventies and eighties  uncovered much of the structure of normal and paracompact spaces.  However, basic research questions remain unanswered.  Such questions  are typically concrete, explicit conjectures in the literature that  have to do with problems such as these: (a ) How does one recognize  paracompact spaces in the class of normal spaces?  (b) Does the  product of two or more normal spaces of a certain kind also have this  useful extension property?  During the course of this project,  refinements of a technique originated by M.E.Rudin will be used to  build general topological spaces, with the goal of settling some of the  conjectures mentioned above.  ***"

A manifold is a second countable Hausdorff topological space which is  locally homeomorphic to euclidean space.  There is quite a difference  in studying manifolds in high dimensions and in low dimensions, and  this project is mainly concerned with high dimensional phenomena.  The  non-linear similarity problem is the question whether two  representations of finite groups can be homeomorphic without being  linearly ismorphic.  This question is high-dimensional in nature,  since it is easy to see that such phenomena cannot occur in dimensions  lower than four.

The project has connections to many branches of mathematics, notably  to analysis.  The main methods used are from controlled topology, and  there are analogues of controlled topological problems in analysis,  notably through the Baum-Connes conjectures.  While high dimensional   manifolds are not readily accessible to our mind's eye, they arise  naturally in real-life situations whenever there are numerous degrees of  freedom, as, for example, the space of all possible configurations of a  mechanical linkage with numerous joints and pivots.  ***"

The most pressing of these concern  the nonresolvable homology manifolds discovered by the investigator,  J. Bryant, W. Mio, and S. Weinberger.  Simply put, the main project is  to discover to what extent the classical geometric theory of  topological manifolds carries over to these newly discovered spaces.  This study is closely related to the well-known Borel and Bing-Borsuk  Conjectures.  Other problems on the investigator's list of projects  include the construction of controlled Gamma-surgery theory and its  application to the study of topological embeddings in codimension two,  the construction of manifold structures on acyclic Poincare duality  spaces, the study of ``short'' maps defined on ``large'' Riemannian  manifolds, and applications of controlled topology to the study of  spaces of Riemannian manifolds.       Much of topology is concerned with the study of mathematical objects  called spaces.  The surface of a sphere is a space, as is the surface  of a donut.  In the study of mathematical systems with many variables,  it is common for spaces of very high or even infinite dimension to  play important roles.  A classical problem in topology is to find small  checkable sets of axioms which characterize particular spaces.  One  popular set of axioms involves the notion of connectivity.  Roughly  speaking, a space is connected if it is all in one piece.  It is  locally connected if it can be chopped up into arbitrarily small  connected pieces.  (Be warned -- these plain English definitions are at  best rough approximations to the actual mathematical definitions.)  In 1978, James Cannon made an amazingly perceptive conjecture.  He  conjectured that if a space satisfied certain generalized connectivity  axioms and had enough room in it to push certain sets apart, then it  was a topological manifold -- a space which is assembled by gluing  together small pieces of ordi nary Euclidean space.  (Both the surface  of a sphere and the surface of a donut are topological manifolds of  dimension 2.  The ``curved spaces'' appearing in general relativity are  topological manifolds of dimension 4.)  Combining work of F. Quinn and  R. D. Edwards shows that Cannon's conjecture is true whenever a  connected space contains even the tiniest manifold piece.  This  manifold piece acts as a sort of seed which determines the entire local   structure of the space.  Working with J. Bryant, W. Mio, and S. Weinberger,   the investigator has shown that Cannon's conjecture is not true in complete  generality.  The main question the investigator will be studying is whether   the ``seeding'' phenomenon from the Edwards-Quinn case holds in general --   whether the local structure of connected counterexamples is the same at   every point.  If this turns out to be true, these new spaces could become  objects of interest paralleling manifolds.  Cannon's axioms guarantee  that from a large-scale point of view, these spaces look exceedingly  like manifolds.  If the seeding phenomenon holds, one imagines that  there could eventually be theories speculating that we live in one of  these new mathematical objects rather than in ``ordinary'' Euclidean  space.  ***"

The study of links concerns quantum and  finite type invariants of knots and links in 3-manifolds, including  generalizations of Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.  The study of quasicrystals involves local rules that determine  quasiperiodic tilings of Euclidean space.       Each of the topics in this project is intimately related to  physics.  The most powerful invariants of knots and links currently known  (i.e., most likely to distinguish among different but similar objects)    find their motivation in quantum field theory.  The algebraic aspect of  the theory is beautiful and rich in results.  However, the invariants   remain difficult to compute except in simple cases, and their intrinsic  topological meaning remains obscure.  The second topic, quasicrystals,  stems from the discovery in 1984 of solid substances whose spectrum has   sharp peaks enjoying some symmetries that real crystals do not (for  example, 5-fold symmetry).  It is believed that a mathematical model of    a quasicrystal is a quasiperiodic tiling of space, such as the famous   Penrose tilings of the plane discovered in 1973 by the physicist Roger   Penrose but considered at that time to be only a mathematical curiosity.

A Reebless two dimensional foliation F in a closed 3-manifold M lifts to a foliation (F1) by topological planes in the universal cover.  This project proposes to study the topological structure of F1, the geometric properties of F1, and how these relate to the topology and geometry of M.  Of special interest is the study of the large scale geometry and asymptotic behavior (when M is hyperbolic) of leaves of F1.  A second topic to be considered consists of flows in 3-manifolds and the large scale geometry of flow lines when lifted to the universal cover.  The principal investigator has constructed many examples of metrically efficient (called quasigeodesic) pseudo-Anosov flows in hyperbolic 3-manifolds and now proposes to study the consequences of the quasigeodesic property for the geometry of the stable and unstable foliations associated to these flows and the finite depth foliations to which these quasigeodesic flows are almost transverse.   A foliation is a decomposition of an object of dimension n (called a manifold) into a disjoint union of objects of dimension less than n (called the leaves of the foliation), much the same as a book (dimension 3) is the union of its pages (of dimension 2).  In mathematics these objects are quite common; for instance, a flow without fixed orbits is a foliation of dimension 1 (the leaves are the flow lines and they have dimension 1).  A general principle of manifold theory is the following: the smaller the dimension, the easier to understand.  Hence foliations are very useful;  understand the leaves and how they are put together to form the manifold and one partially understands the manifold. This project attempts to understand how the geometry of the leaves interacts with the geometry of the manifold;  in the case of a book, the leaves sit flat in the manifold, but in general their geometric behavior is much more complex.  The principal investigator hopes  to describe this geometric behavior for a special class of manifolds called hyperbolic manifolds."

It is based on the investigator's recent  work, in which he successfully employed some classical constructions  of algebraic topology and differential geometry to reveal the  geometric content of ordinary cohomology as well as smooth and  holomorphic Deligne cohomology.  The investigator plans to apply the ideas  contained in his previous research on Deligne cohomology to study the  structure of the image and the kernel of the cycle homomorphism.  Some  of the deepest and most important problems of transcendental algebraic  geometry concern the cycle homomorphism.  The most celebrated among  these is the Hodge conjecture.  Except for a few classes of very  special algebraic varieties, codimension one is the only codimension  in which complete cohomological and geometric descriptions of the  image and the kernel of the cycle homomorphism exist.  The investigator  intends to pursue extensions to all codimensions of structures   playing a central role in the codimension one case.  In particular, he  introduces generalized exponential sequences and a new cohomology  theory that is conjecturally dual to Chow groups of algebraic cycles  modulo rational equivalence.  The objective of this project is to  verify that conjecture.  If this is the case, then the cohomology long  exact sequence of the generalized exponential sequence will induce a  complete cohomological description of the image and the kernel of the  cycle homomorphism.       Projective varieties are geometric objects defined by means of   polynomial equations.  Like other notions that arise in many important   contexts and sound deceptively simple, for example, the ordinary whole   numbers, they possess properties that are not at all obvious or easy to   discover, and over the course of many years, mathematicians have been   led to develop elaborate algebraic machinery for making computations   concerning some of  these properties.  It is hard to remain in touch with   the geometric meaning of these computations, and this is what has given   rise to the current project.  The investigator will attempt to understand   a geometric structure of what are known as algebraic cycles.  This will   be done by extending some classical techniques of algebraic topology and   differential geometry to the context of algebraic geometry.  One might   say that at least this one corner of algebraic geometry will be reintroduced   to its roots.  This will be not only an esthetic triumph, but an aid to   intuition and thus to further discoveries and advances in mathematics and   in the disciplines like theoretical physics that make use of this   mathematics.  ***"

Recently, attention has  turned to the so-called ""Fundamental lemma,"" which appears to be the  single most difficult unproven conjecture in the field, and which  threatens to delay indefinitely the completion of the program.  Nevertheless, the lemma is so widely believed to be true that papers  are regularly published that depend on its validity.  In the simplest  cases, the fundamental lemma is a conjectural equality between an  orbital integral on a p-adic algebraic group, and another orbital  integral on an endoscopic group.  It is an amazing formula, which has  been verified (with great difficulty) in a number of special cases.  Professors Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson have found a new approach  to this problem that adds a number of geometric ideas and methods;  by a sequence of reductions, applications of the Weil conjectures and  the Lefschetz fixed point formula, each case of the fundamental lemma  may be restated as an equality between the equivariant cohomology  groups of two naturally occurring complex projective algebraic  varieties.  These two varieties apparently have little or nothing to  do with each other except that they both admit an action by the same  torus.  Using their newly developed formula for equivariant  cohomology, Professors Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson have found it  possible to compare both sides of the fundamental lemma, which in many  cases suffices for a proof.  They are refining this technique with the  hopes that it may eventually lead to a complete proof.       To put the foregoing in perspective, during the 1970's, R. Langlands  (of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton) outlined a series  of conjectures and ideas of enormous scope and depth that, when fully  explored and verified, will result in a ""grand unification"" of several  branches of mathematics, including number theory, representation  theory of  Lie groups, and harmonic analysis.  During the last twenty  years enormous progress has been made on this program, and very  difficult obstacles have been overcome.  Nevertheless, it is commonly  believed that it may take another twenty years (or more) before  Langlands' ideas are fully explored.  The ""fundamental lemma"" remains  the single most outstanding difficulty in the program.  It has been  proven in many special cases, and, as mentioned above, it is so widely  believed to be true that papers which depend on it are regularly  published in refereed journals.  Professors Goresky, Kottwitz and  MacPherson have discovered new geometric techniques in the study of  the fundamental lemma that will lead to its proof in many new cases  and may eventually lead to a complete proof.  Although these geometric  techniques have been developed primarily to carry out this step in  Langlands' program, they have already been applied to problems in  other areas of mathematics.  ***"

The homotopy type of related complexes on which the automorphism  groups act, for example the complex of free factors of a free group, will  also be investigated.  Another problem which will be studied is to  determine the homotopy type of the space of all embeddings of a link in  3-space, extending known results for knots.  In particular, it should be  possible to answer Kontsevich's question whether this space has finite  homotopy type.       In more general terms, this involves determining all the essentially  different ways of removing unnecessary tangles from a knotted piece of  string or from several pieces which are knotted and linked together.  With regard to the other part of the project, automorphisms of free  groups play a fundamental role in group theory (the general study of  symmetry) somewhat analogous to matrices in linear algebra, and the goal  is to understand just how close this parallel is:  When one takes a  geometric view of both sorts of algebraic objects, is the picture  qualitatively the same, or qualitatively different?  ***"

Additionally, quantum invariants are to be used to formulate criteria for the existence of symmetries in three-manifolds. Low-dimensional topology is mainly concerned with classifying spaces of dimensions three and four, where two spaces are treated as equivalent if one space can be deformed onto the other without tearing - this is called a homeomorphic transformation. Such a classification, known as the topological classification, has been essentially carried out in dimensions other than three and four. It turns out that these two dimensions provide various further technical difficulties, some of which are topics of much current interest as they interface with deep ideas of modern physics."
