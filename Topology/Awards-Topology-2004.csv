In the dimension 2 the main problem is to understand the<br/>algebraic structure of the groups of isotopy classes of such<br/>diffeomorphisms, known as mapping class groups of surfaces or Teichmueller<br/>modular groups. The proposal addresses some of the central problems about<br/>the mapping class groups: understanding the structure of the Torelli groups,<br/>braid groups of surfaces, and mapping class groups themselves. The problems<br/>addressed in the proposal are<br/>the ones which either hold the key for the fundamental properties<br/>of the groups in question (like the problem of finite presentability of the<br/>Torelli groups) or have connections with other branches of mathematics (like<br/>the problem of understanding the Wajnryb presentations from the point of<br/>view of algebraic K-theory and topological quantum field theory). In the<br/>dimension 3 the key problem is the understanding of the homotopy type of the<br/>diffeomorphisms groups, especially of their connected components. The main<br/>goal here is to relate the few available results in this area to the more<br/>mainstream tools of topology and to extend, on this basis, these results to<br/>other manifolds. A particular goal is to understand the diffeomorphisms<br/>groups for all lens spaces, the simplest 3-manifolds after spheres.<br/><br/>The proposal belongs to the field of low dimensional topology, which<br/>investigates the possible shapes of objects (namely, the so-called<br/>manifolds) in dimension 2 and 3. These shapes continue to be in the focus of<br/>the mathematical research for more than a hundred years. In the last<br/>decades, the theory of 2-dimensional shapes, i.e. surfaces, acquired an<br/>additional significance as a result of a promising physical ""theory of<br/>everything "", namely the so-called string theory. In this theory, the<br/>elementary constituents of matter are not point-like particles, but rather<br/>collections of loops (""strings"") sweeping a surface during their motion. The<br/>3-dimensional shapes provide the model for the large-scale structure of the<br/>universe. Some previous results of the PI in this direction have already<br/>attracted the attention of physicists working in general relativity.

Great successes <br/>have come from the classical topological 3-manifold <br/>program (surfaces, foliations and laminations), from the <br/>Ricci flow, Floer homology, and from algebraic invariants <br/>in knot theory and topological field theory. In dimension <br/>4 the Donaldson, Seiberg-Witten, and Oszvath-Szabo <br/>theories have revealed structure of smooth manifolds. <br/>However these different threads remain largely unconnected <br/>and, with the notable exception of geometrization of <br/>3-manifolds, few general structural features have emerged. <br/>This is in contrast with high dimensional topology where <br/>great advances between 1950-1980 revealed deep and <br/>relatively uniform structure dominated by homotopy theory, <br/>bundles, and stable algebra (K and L theory). We hope that <br/>a spirited discussion among a range of experts and new <br/>researchers will help reveal the deep structure of low <br/>dimensions. Can the Ricci flow be coupled to a 2-form or <br/>other gauge-theoretic object on a 4-manifold? Do <br/>nonsingular flows with special dynamics provide a <br/>``singular homology'' analog of the Oszvath-Szabo <br/>``cellular'' Floer homology? Do special metrics associated <br/>to foliations and laminations have implications for the <br/>Ricci flow?

Strangely <br/>this was not the case: dimensions above 4 are actually <br/>easier and a deep systematic theory was developed between <br/>1950 and about 1980. For the last 30 years the focus has <br/>returned to dimensions 3 and 4. This has been one of the <br/>most active areas of mathematics, with deep relations to <br/>geometry, analysis, algebra and physics. However a <br/>unifying perspective analogous to the one achieved in <br/>higher dimensions is still lacking. The aim of the <br/>conference is to promote interactions among researchers <br/>working on different aspects of the subject, in hopes that <br/>unifying perspectives will begin to emerge.<br/>"

An advisory committee works by consensus to decide meeting sites and serve as and consult with local organizers. Local organizers consult with the advisory committee and interested parties to select a list of speakers. The lecturers do not necessarily have to speak on a topological topic. Due to the interests of the organizers, most talks do touch on topological subjects, hence the title of the seminar. Typically two or three of the speakers are from outside the region. Recent presentations in the Seminar included such topics as Geometrization in dimension 3, the Orbifold Theorem, Topological Robotics, Cryptography and the Braid Group, Finiteness Properties of Groups, Integral Structures in Topological Quantum Field Theory, Representation Varieties, Embedding n-complexes into 2n-space, Skein Theory in knot theory and beyond, Quantum Representations of Mapping Class Groups, and the self homotopy equivalences of 4-manifolds. <br/><br/>The Cascade Topology Seminar is designed in part to keep its participants abreast of recent developments in their own and related fields, and no attempt is made to limit the topics covered in the lectures. However, the interests of the various organizers tend to be mirrored by the interests of the speakers. The lectures therefore usually concern algebraic, geometric, or low dimensional topology, differential or algebraic geometry, or combinatorial group theory. The Seminar also strives to enable graduate students and topologists in the Pacific Northwest and Southwestern Canada to hear, consult, and possibly collaborate with the outside speakers and members of other institutions. Efforts are made to accommodate special needs of participants and to encourage members of traditionally under-represented groups to participate. The Cascade Topology Seminar organizers also make a consistent effort to include younger and/or women speakers in its programs and to provide opportunities for local people to lecture on their own work. <br/><br/>"

The theory of groups was developed in the 19th century for<br/>studying symmetry, and it quickly developed into a deep and rich<br/>mathematical tool.  Groups and geometries go hand-in-hand: every group has<br/>a corresponding geometry, and one can use tools of geometry to learn about<br/>the group.  This project will focus on two classes of groups which have<br/>assumed importance in the field of topology.  Given a surface, such as the<br/>surface of a doughnut with one or more holes, the ""mapping class group"" of<br/>that surface describes all the ways in which that surface can be mapped<br/>back onto itself.  Similarly, the ""outer automorphism group of a free<br/>group"" is a group that describes all of the ways in which a finite<br/>1-dimensional network or graph can be mapped back onto itself.  In both<br/>cases, we will study geometries associated to these groups, with the aim<br/>of learning more about the groups themselves.  In the case of mapping<br/>class groups our aim is to prove one of the central geometric conjectures,<br/>known as quasi-isometric rigidity.  In the case of outer automorphism<br/>groups of free groups, where the geometry is less well understood, we will<br/>attempt to build new tools and make a deeper study of existing tools, in<br/>order to reach a better understanding of the geometry.<br/><br/>"

The main focus of the project is a program to solve<br/>Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture, which states that a<br/>hyperbolic 3-manifold is uniquely determined by its topological type<br/>and a list of invariants describing the asymptotic geometry of its<br/>ends. This conjecture is central in the field and would settle a<br/>number of outstanding questions about the structure of the deformation<br/>space of all hyperbolic structures on a given manifold.  The principal<br/>tool in this approach is the Complex of Curves, a combinatorial object<br/>which describes the set of all essential homotopy classes of simple<br/>loops on a given surface.  Such a complex, viewed as a metric space,<br/>is hyperbolic in the sense of Cannon and Gromov, and the invariants<br/>which describe the geometry of a 3-manifold turn out to be ""points at<br/>infinity"" for the complex. A study of geodesics within the complex of<br/>curves then allows us to construct a model for the geometry of the<br/>3-manifold which depends only on its end invariants.  Part of the<br/>program is joint work with Brock and Canary.  The complex of curves is<br/>also instrumental in studying the Teichmuller space of hyperbolic<br/>structures on a surface, and its symmetry group, known as the Mapping<br/>Class Group. Hyperbolicity of the complex implies a type of relative<br/>hyperbolicity property for the Teichmuller space and the Mapping Class<br/>Group, and in collaboration with Brock and Masur, Minsky hopes to<br/>apply this to study the geometric properties of Teichmuller space, and<br/>to answer a number of group-theoretic and algorithmic questions about<br/>the mapping class group.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Topological spaces appear in mathematics at varying levels of<br/>abstraction. The earth, for example, can be thought of as a sphere,<br/>spinning around its axis. The set of all positions of this sphere,<br/>perhaps as parameterized by the time of day in New York, can itself be<br/>visualized as a circle.  The positions of the earth in its orbit<br/>around the sun also make up a circle, and all this information<br/>together can be described by a 2-dimensional surface, called a torus,<br/>so that each point in the torus corresponds to exactly one position of<br/>the earth-sun system, and our motion in space gives rise to a<br/>trajectory winding around the torus.  Once a surface is being studied,<br/>we often give it various structures: it can have a metric, which is a<br/>way of measuring distance in it; it can also be filled up in different<br/>ways by loops. The set of all possible metrics can itself be studied<br/>as a ""space"", where motion in this space corresponds to changing<br/>shapes of the surface. The set of all loops in the surface gives<br/>rise to another space, of a more combinatorial character.  A<br/>fascinating phenomenon, not uncommon in mathematics, is the appearance<br/>of analogies between these different levels of abstraction. For<br/>example, a property of a single metric on a surface called ""hyperbolicity""<br/>appears again, in another guise, as a property of the space of all<br/>metrics on the surface and the space of all loops.

One of the crowning <br/>achievements of 20th century mathematics was the construction by Boone <br/>and Novikov of groups for which no such algorithm can exist.  However, <br/>that is by no means the end of the story.  The Word Problem transcends <br/>its origins in algebra, decidability and complexity theory, and turns <br/>out to be a bridge to geometry and topology, as well as to linguistic <br/>complexity.  To a group we can associate a topological space and vice <br/>versa.  Recognising a word to be trivial amounts to spanning a loop <br/>with a disc in a corresponding space, and geometrical features of this <br/>disc (such as area) translate to algorithmic complexity measures (such <br/>as time) of the Word Problem.  Moreover, words over a group form <br/>grammars whose linguistic features relate to the ease of navigating <br/>around the corresponding space.

To begin, we propose to investigate the interface between<br/>two known approaches to the conjugacy problem in the braid groups: (a) the<br/>combinatorial solution that originated with the work of Frank Garside in<br/>1968; and (b) the dynamic approach which was first studied by Jakob<br/>Nielsen in 1932 and later given new meaning, in 1982, by William Thurston.<br/>We note that (a) gives a definitive test for when two braids are<br/>conjugate, whereas (b) gives less than that. On the other hand (a) is<br/>exponential in both word length and braid index, whereas (b) suggests the<br/>possible existence of a polynomial solution.  The moment seems to be ripe<br/>for an investigation which combines aspects of both. The new work of<br/>Gebhardt on (a) shows that the `Super Summit Set', a complete class<br/>invariant, can be replaced by the smaller `Ultra Summit Set'  (USS). Our<br/>hope is to use the known dynamic classification to study the USS. We will<br/>begin with a study of reducing curves for reducible braids, and go on to<br/>study finite order (FO) and pseudo-Anosov (PA) braids.   We conjecture<br/>that for braids in the USS the reducing curves can be chosen to be round<br/>circles which meet a line containing the punctures in 2 points.  We<br/>conjecture further that PA braids have `rigid powers whose combinatorics<br/>is particularly simple.  Looking at the braid group as a special case of<br/>mapping class groups, one then expects further that the associated train<br/>tracks will be special and interesting.  If all this goes well, there will<br/>be further problems to investigate, including related combinatorics in<br/>more general mapping class groups, and related dynamics in more general<br/>Garside and Artin groups.<br/><br/>In recent years there has been great interest in certain codes, in `Public<br/>Key Cryptography, which are based upon the use of braid groups.  The<br/>underlying idea has been that the so-called `word problem in the braid<br/>groups is known to have a solution which is fast. That is, the time<br/>required to check whether two words represent the same element in the<br/>braid group is known to be polynomial as a function of word length L and<br/>braid index N. On the other hand, the conjugacy problem, which is more<br/>difficult, has been thought to be fundamentally exponential in L and N.<br/>Like most such problems in complexity theory (e.g. the factorization of<br/>numbers into primes) the possibility always exists that a particular<br/>problem which was thought to be exponential will turn out to be polynomial<br/>if a more ingenious solution can be found.  The PI has been a leading<br/>expert in the study of braid groups for many years. She now proposes to<br/>investigate the conjugacy problem in the braid groups from a new point of<br/>view which she hopes will show it to be polynomial, like the word problem,<br/>in both L and N.  The underlying idea is to look at two very different<br/>approaches to the conjugacy problem, one based on `combinatorics and the<br/>other on `dynamics, and to apply ideas from the second approach to<br/>simplify the first.  If successful, this research would have implications<br/>in Public Key Cryptography as regards the security of codes based upon<br/>braid groups. It should also have many applications in mathematics because<br/>of the central role played by the braid groups.<br/><br/>"

Ravenel<br/><br/>This proposal has two parts: Higher chromatic analogs of elliptic cohomology and finding more stable homotopy groups of spheres.  The first part concerns a recent discovery by Ravenel that the Jacobians of certain algebraic curves in characteristic P have interesting 1-dimensional formal groups as formal summands. More precisely, he has examples where the the height can be any multiple of p-1.  This could lead to analogs of elliptic cohomology, which takes us deeper into the chromatic tower, meaning beyond v2-periodic phenomena.  It is the first example known to topologists of formal group laws of height greater than two occuring in a geometric setting. The methods used here come from algebraic geometry and number theory.  The second part concerns the determination of the stable homotopy groups of spheres and the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence.  This problem has been one of the central and most difficult in algebraic topology since the groups were defined in 1935. Little progress has been made in this area since the the publication of Ravenel's 1986 book (republished in 2003) ""Complex Cobordism and the Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres"" which described the state of the art at the time.  In it he determined the stable homotopy groups of spheres through dimension 108 for p=3 and 999 for p=5.  The latter computation was a substantial improvement over prior knowledge, and neither has been improved upon since.  It is generally agreed among homotopy theorists that it is not worthwhile to try to improve our knowledge of stable homotopy groups by a few stems, but that the prospect of increasing the know range by a factor of p would be worth pursuing.  This possibility may be within reach now, due to a better understanding of the previously used methods of and improved computer technology.<br/><br/>This project will help the general advance of algebraic topology, a subject which has been central to pure mathematics since its founding by Poincare a century ago.

The PI is currently interested in infinite dimensional transformation groups like Loop groups and Symplectomorphism groups. The topology of these groups may be studied via their proper actions on certain associated spaces.  For example, the Symplectormorphism group of a Symplectic manifold may be studied via its action on the space of compatible complex structures. A careful analysis of this space allows us to compute various homological invariants of the Symplectomorphism group, like homology and homotopy.  Similarly, the Loop group may be studied via its action on the space of connections on a trivial bundle. The orbit structure of these spaces allows one to decompose the homotopy type of the infinite dimensional group in terms of compact Lie groups. There are numerous applications of this decomposition. It may be exploited to understand the topology of other infinite dimensional objects that admit the Loop group or the Symplectomorphism group as their structure group. An example of such an object is the Loop space of a manifold.<br/><br/>In recent years, Lie groups have become increasingly important in mathematics and physics. They may be seen as groups of symmetries of various geometric objects. While finite dimensional Lie groups are well understood, the infinite dimensional ones are just beginning to be understood. Due to their infinite nature, their study is a difficult task.<br/>I have been successful in developing methods to systematically decompose these infinite dimensional Lie groups into finite dimensional compact Lie groups, hence making it possible to study them using standard techniques of geometry and topology. My current research involves extending these decomposition methods to other infinite dimensional transformation groups.<br/>"

Carlsson<br/><br/>This project concerns the descent problem in higher algebraic K-theory.  There has been much recent progress in identifying the initial term of a spectral sequence converging to the K-groups of a field, notably by V. Voevodsky and A. Suslin.  This project is an attempt to prove that the algebraic K-theory spectrum, not just its homotopy groups, can be described purely in terms of the absolute Galois group of the field in question, and the algebraic K-theory spectrum of an algebraically closed field.  The key ingredients are the equivariant K-theory spectrum attached to complex representations of the absolute Galois group, which can be regarded as a highly structured ring spectrum, and a derived version of a completion construction at an augmentation ideal. The model has already been developed, and what remains is to prove the agreement of the model with algebraic K-theory of the field in general.  The validity of these results should give striking connections between, on the one hand, the derived completion of the representation ring of the absolute Galois group, and on the other the Milnor K-groups of the field, which are groups defined directly from the arithmetic of the field. <br/><br/>This project seeks to connect the behavior of the arithmetic in a field (an algebraic object which generalizes our usual notions of real, complex, and rational numbers) and the behavior of so-called complex representations of a group of symmetries of a larger field containing all possible solutions to algebraic equations of the original field.  These representations contain a great deal of geometric information, and drawing this kind of connection (between geometric and arithmetic information) has been a longstanding theme in mathematics. The relationship between such seemingly distinct kinds of ideas has been responsible for many of the recent striking developments in arithmetic and algebraic geometry, including Delinge's proof of the so-called Weil conjectures as well as the recent work on the Geometric Langlands program.  The present project represents another facet of this circle of ideas.  <br/>"

The principal investigators are Gunnar E. Carlsson, Persi Diaconis, Leonidas J. Guibas, and Susan Holmes at Stanford University.  This project will develop topological tools for understanding qualitative properties of data sets.  We will use homology as applied to data sets directly and to derived complexes to define invariants or signatures that distinguish between the underlying geometric objects.  Important goals will include the identification, location, and classification of qualitative features of the data set, such as the presence of corners, edges, cone points, etc. and the use of homology applied to canonically defined blowups and tangent complexes to distinguish between two dimensional shapes in three dimensional Euclidean space.  We will use the recently developed techniques of persistence and landmarking to make homology a stable and readily computable invariant. We will also develop the theory of multidimensional persistence, in which one studies spaces that are equipped with several parameters, in order to better understand data sets in which there are several different parameters describing different geometric properties of the space.  The overall goal is to continue to develop and improve the available tools for studying qualitative information about geometric objects.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop tools for understanding data sets that are not easy to understand using standard methods of statistics and analysis. This kind of data might include singular points, or might be strongly curved. The data is also high dimensional, in the sense that each data point has many coordinates. For instance, we might have a data set whose points each of which is an image, which has one coordinate for each pixel. Many standard tools rely on linear approximations, which do not work well in strongly curved or singular problems. The kind of tools we have in mind are in part topological, in the sense that they measure more qualitative properties of the spaces involved, such as connectedness, or the number of holes in a space, and so on.  For example, the project takes the point of view that it is better to understand qualitative properties before attempting to do more precise quantitative analysis and better to distinguish shapes by understanding them qualitatively rather than doing data base comparisons.  Thus, methods will be developed to compute, in a timely, robust, and trustworthy manner, the fundamental geometric properties that any realistic mathematical model associated to a given data set must contain.  Then statistical and analytic techniques may be applied to the geometrically correct models in order to extract the detailed information desired by practitioners.  <br/>"

Specifically, Hain has three main projects: (1) resolving certain fundamental questions in the topology of moduli spaces of hyperelliptic curves that are arise in the study of Galois actions on fundamental groups of hyperelliptic curves; (2) resolving certain problems in the intersection theory of the universal jacobian over the Deligne-Mumford moduli spaces of stable, n-pointed curves, which arise in symplectic geometry and physics; (3) studying the action of an appropriate completion of the absolute Galois group on pro-unipotent and pro-ell completions of fundamental groups of curves defined over number fields.  The third problem is part of a joint project with Makoto Matsumoto of Hiroshima University whose goal is to determine whether this action is faithful, a fundamental question in the theory of motives. Mapping class groups and their cohomology play a central role in each of the projects.<br/><br/>Topology is the study of those geometrical properties of surfaces and their generalizations that remain unchanged under stretching (short of tearing) and other continuous deformations. Geometry is the study of those properties of surfaces and their generalizations that preserve geometric properties such as distances and/or angles. There is a profound connection between the topological symmetries of a surface (called the mapping class group of the surface), the geometry of all of the different ways of measuring angles on such a surface (the moduli space of conformal structures on the surface) and the arithmetical properties of the surface when viewed as the graph of a polynomial function. Questions about mapping class groups and moduli spaces of conformal structures on surfaces arise in many areas of mathematics (such as the study of numbers, and algebraic geometry), and have applications to particle physics through string theory and conformal field theory. There are also potential significant applications to cryptography. The goal of this proposal is to further explore and understand the intricate and deep connections between these topological, geometrical and arithmetical aspects of surface theory, especially those aspects with connections to number theory.<br/><br/>"

This appears naturally from the Chern-Simons functional on three-manifolds with boundary and leads to a new approach for Floer homology on three-manifolds with boundary. The construction of this new Floer homology moreover is a first step in a program that might lead to a proof of the Atiyah-Floer conjecture. The latter relates the Floer homology of a homology three-sphere to a corresponding Lagrangian Floer homology in a moduli space of flat connections, which arise from a Heegaard splitting of the three-manifold. This conjecture is a longstanding open question and its solution would  be an important step towards understanding the relations between different  invariants of homology three-spheres.<br/>The Atiyah-Floer conjecture has an analogue relating the new Heegaard Floer homology by Ozsvath and Szabo to Seiberg-Witten invariants. This program also aims to understand the relation between these new invariants and the Floer  homologies in the Atiyah-Floer conjecture.<br/>More generally, this program aims to achieve a better understanding and exposition of the analytic foundations of gauge theory and the construction of Floer homologies.<br/><br/>This project belongs into the general realm of interaction between symplectic geometry and low dimensional  topology. <br/>Important progress in these areas has been made in the last twenty years starting with the work of<br/>Donaldson on smooth four-dimensional manifolds, which was based on  anti-self-dual instantons (which roughly are a special case of the electromagnetic field equations), and with the work of Gromov on pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds (a generalization of holomorphic complex functions). In both subjects Floer introduced in the late eighties  his new approach to infinite dimensional Morse theory.   In Morse theory, properties of a finite dimensional space are understood in terms of the zeros and flow lines of gradient vector fields on this space.<br/>In Floer's context, this space is infinite dimensional but arises from certain objects (like paths) in an underlying finite dimensional manifold with some extra structure. The corresponding Floer theory extracts informations about this underlying manifold and its extra structure from the space of solutions of a partial differential equation associated to it.<br/>The aim of this project is to define a Floer theory, where the underlying manifold has a boundary, and this gives rise to a  boundary condition for the partial differential equation. This is one step in a program to understand the relation between different Floer theories that arise from the same underlying manifolds.<br/><br/>"

The principal investigators are Clarence W.

Groups and the ways in which they act (in other words, their representations) play a large part in mathematics. This proposal is concerned with studying group actions on topological spaces.  Three types of groups play a role: finite groups, infinite discrete groups, and compact Lie groups, and their actions are considered either from a geometrical or a homotopical point of view.  The investigators believe that they can leverage recent advances in homotopy theory in order to obtain new information about these groups, and in particular to clarify some ties between the internal structure of a group and the geometrical properties of a spaces on which it can act.<br/><br/>From a broader point of view, this proposal deals with symmetries of higher-dimensional geometrical shapes.  Given a particular shape, it can be very difficult to determine all of its symmetries explicitly, but sometimes it is possible to obtain partial information by looking at how the types of symmetries that can occur are affected by qualitative properties of the shape. For instance, it is known that a finite-dimensional shape that is acyclic (roughly, has no holes) cannot have a finite group of symmetries with the property that each individual non-identity symmetry moves every point of the shape. Some recent discoveries make it easier to approach qualitative questions of this kind, and the investigators hope to use these discoveries to solve some longstanding problems and to gain new theoretical insight into properties of symmetries.<br/><br/><br/>"

In the third and fourth<br/>projects the proposer explores ideas related to Taubes's question,<br/>that is: If a 4-manifold is symplectic and diffeomorphic to the<br/>product of a three manifold with a circle, does that three manifold<br/>fiber over a circle?<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is a space that locally looks like the familiar space<br/>we live in.  If one imagines replacing every point in the<br/>3-manifold with a circle of points in a nice way, one gets an<br/>example of a 4-manifold with a circle action. Here `action' means<br/>a rotation of the space along each circle.  Four manifolds with<br/>circle actions have many nice periodic and symmetry properties,<br/>which makes them particularly suitable for modeling and testing<br/>physical theories. (For example, the space-time universe we live<br/>in is an example of a general 4-manifold which may have a circle<br/>action.) These manifolds are especially useful for modeling if<br/>they also have a symplectic structure --- a key ingredient in<br/>almost all the equations of classical and quantum physics.

The principal investigators are Clarence W. Wilkerson and Jeffrey Smith at Purdue University, William Dwyer at the University of Notre Dame University, Alexandro Adem at the University of Wisconsin, and Jesper Grodal at the University of Chicago.  Groups and the ways in which they act (in other words, their representations) play a large part in mathematics. This proposal is concerned with studying group actions on topological spaces.  Three types of groups play a role: finite groups, infinite discrete groups, and compact Lie groups, and their actions are considered either from a geometrical or a homotopical point of view.  The investigators believe that they can leverage recent advances in homotopy theory in order to obtain new information about these groups, and in particular to clarify some ties between the internal structure of a group and the geometrical properties of a spaces on which it can act.<br/><br/>From a broader point of view, this proposal deals with symmetries of higher-dimensional geometrical shapes.  Given a particular shape, it can be very difficult to determine all of its symmetries explicitly, but sometimes it is possible to obtain partial information by looking at how the types of symmetries that can occur are affected by qualitative properties of the shape. For instance, it is known that a finite-dimensional shape that is acyclic (roughly, has no holes) cannot have a finite group of symmetries with the property that each individual non-identity symmetry moves every point of the shape. Some recent discoveries make it easier to approach qualitative questions of this kind, and the investigators hope to use these discoveries to solve some longstanding problems and to gain new theoretical insight into properties of symmetries.<br/><br/><br/>"

These different problems benefit from the approach of singularity theory via groups of equivalences and also from the analysis of geometric and topological properties, which are consequences of transversality to Whitney stratified sets.  He has applied these methods to determine local and global geometric properties of an object and its boundary from its Blum medial axis (which is a skeleton of the object used to characterize shape properties).

This takes several forms including: continued joint interaction of the investigator with computer scientists at several locations, but especially at the Univ. of North Carolina; the development of tools from singularity theory, which directly apply to problems of interest in imaging; and the specific consideration, in joint work with several computer scientists, of several concrete imaging problems of current interest involving feature statistics and tensor imaging.<br/>First, the PI proposes to build on his results for medial structures to: develop concrete models in terms of topology for searchable structures for 3D objects which will be of use in 3D-imaging, to enlarge the class of allowable structures to include degeneracies, and to apply these ideas for uses in statistical properties of geometrical features for shape. Second, he will further develop methods of scale-based geometry to: determine the singular geometry in the presence of parameters; develop methods to verify generic geometric properties for feature detection; and apply the methods to tensor images.

Artin groups span a wide range of groups including braid groups, free groups, and free abelian groups. <br/>The first part of the project concerns automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups. These are finitely generated groups <br/>whose presentations involve only commutator relations between generators. By varying the number of commutator relations, <br/>right-angled Artin groups may be viewed as ""interpolating"" between free groups and free abelian groups. The automorphism <br/>groups of free groups have been the focus of much research in recent years. They have been shown to have much in common <br/>with linear groups, in particular with the automorphism groups of free abelian groups.  This project aims to put these <br/>results in a broader context by studying the automorphism group of a general right-angled Artin group. The key idea is to <br/>construct a contractible space, analogous to Culler and Vogtmann's ""outer space"", on which the automorphism group acts.<br/><br/>The second part of the project concerns Garside groups. Garside groups are groups with algorithmic properties similar to <br/>those of braid groups. A Garside structure on a group gives a very powerful tool for studying the combinatorial and geometric <br/>properties of the group. This approach has been used extensively in the study of finite type Artin groups. While no such <br/>structure exists for infinite type Artin groups, it appears that something close to a Garside structure may exist for at <br/>least some of these groups. The project will consider various generalizations of Garside groups and their properties.<br/><br/>Symmetries of geometric objects have been studied since ancient times and have played an important role in many areas of <br/>mathematics and the sciences.

In recent years, this interplay between groups and geometry <br/>has been increasingly exploited to understand various types of infinite groups. A particularly interesting class of groups <br/>that lends itself to such techniques are the ""braid groups"".  The n-strand braid group, as the name suggests, encodes the <br/>different ways that a set of n strings can be braided.  It also describes the different ways that a collection of n particles<br/> can move around in a plane. Braid groups have applications to topology, mathematical physics, and cryptography.  <br/>Another fundamental class of groups are the ""free groups"".

Partly as a <br/>result of Einstein's work, the last century saw an intensive investigation into the curvature of smooth spaces.<br/>Combinatorics, roughly defined, is the study of objects which <br/>can be described by a finite amount of information.

The goal of this proposal is to come to a<br/>coherent understanding of curvature as a combinatorial notion. <br/>In addition, bringing together researchers from a variety of mathematical disciplines, we wish to bridge the chasms between geometry, combinatorics, algebra and topology, using curvature <br/>as the unifying theme.<br/>"

For example, in combinatorial arguments on<br/>surface intersections, graph-theoretic lines of argument (on the arcs<br/>of intersection) have proven to be almost magically effective in<br/>distilling geometric information; in Gabai's theory of sutured<br/>3-manifolds, intersection with a `parameterizing surface is the chief<br/>mechanism for transmitting information from the end of the hierarchy<br/>back to the beginning; the minimax principle usually called ``thin<br/>position"" exploits the intersection between a stationary surface and a<br/>moving surface to understand the topology of the entire manfold.<br/>Comparing intersections between two sets of moving surfaces (using the<br/>tools of Cerf theory) can be even more effective as in, for example,<br/>the Gordon-Luecke solution to the knot complement conjecture or the<br/>proposer's work with Rubinstein on explicit bounds for Heegaard<br/>stabilization.<br/>The problems addressed in this proposal have been chosen not solely<br/>for their intrinsic interest but also because the hope is that<br/>techniques developed in their solution would point the way to the<br/>solution of grander problems and, more generally, give insight to the<br/>general structure of knotting phenomena (broadly construed) and the<br/>structure of 3-manifolds, particularly structure that is on the edge<br/>of and interacts with natural questions about 4-manifolds.  An<br/>underlying theme of this proposal is that there is much to be learned<br/>about knot theory and the theory of 3-manifolds via a geometric<br/>approach that is more flexible than differential geometry but more<br/>structured than simple combinatorics.  This medium ground is<br/>characterized by a use of thin position arguments, in which sweep-outs<br/>of 3-space by level planes or sweep-outs of 3-manifolds by Heegaard<br/>surfaces can reveal structure that might be difficult to find by other<br/>techniques.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the most basic observations about the world around us, apparent<br/>almost from our birth, is that it is 3-dimensional.  So it is of<br/>interest to understand objects with this property: anyone living in<br/>the object would see their world as 3-dimensional.  Such objects are<br/>called 3-manifolds, and the broad goal of this research proposal is to<br/>increase our understanding of them.  Three-manifolds support<br/>interesting phenomena.  One of these phenomena is knotting, in which a<br/>simple object like a garden-hose (or a string of DNA) can be<br/>maneuvered so that its positioning in space is quite complex.  More<br/>generally, objects like chemical molecules can be put in a 3-manifold<br/>in extraordinarily complex ways if one thinks of their parts as made<br/>of rubber which can be knotted and interweaved.  Tools which are being<br/>developed to understand 3-manifolds help us understand knotting and,<br/>conversely, understanding knotting helps us understand 3-manifolds.<br/>One success of this ongoing research program is the proposer's<br/>solution (with Abigail Thompson) of the graph-planarity problem: There<br/>is a simple criterion, algorithmic in execution, which determines<br/>whether a knotted graph in 3-space (e.  g. a chemical molecule) can be<br/>isotoped to lie in a plane, and so in fact is unknotted.<br/>"

Groups and the ways in which they act (in other words, their representations) play a large part in mathematics. This proposal is concerned with studying group actions on topological spaces.  Three types of groups play a role: finite groups, infinite discrete groups, and compact Lie groups, and their actions are considered either from a geometrical or a homotopical point of view.  The investigators believe that they can leverage recent advances in homotopy theory in order to obtain new information about these groups, and in particular to clarify some ties between the internal structure of a group and the geometrical properties of a spaces on which it can act.<br/><br/>From a broader point of view, this proposal deals with symmetries of higher-dimensional geometrical shapes.  Given a particular shape, it can be very difficult to determine all of its symmetries explicitly, but sometimes it is possible to obtain partial information by looking at how the types of symmetries that can occur are affected by qualitative properties of the shape. For instance, it is known that a finite-dimensional shape that is acyclic (roughly, has no holes) cannot have a finite group of symmetries with the property that each individual non-identity symmetry moves every point of the shape. Some recent discoveries make it easier to approach qualitative questions of this kind, and the investigators hope to use these discoveries to solve some longstanding problems and to gain new theoretical insight into properties of symmetries.<br/><br/><br/>"

Recent work of Madsen, Tillmann, Weiss, Cohen, and others on the stable cohomology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces is based on the study of certain cobordism categories suggested by ideas from string physics.  These constructions have four-dimensional analogs (of similar significance in physics), which display surprising connections to the pseudoisotopy theory developed in the 80's and 90's by Hatcher, Waldhausen, and others. That theory involves the algebraic K-theory of the integers in a nontrivial way; and the latter subject is now seen to play an important role in an apparently unrelated circle of ideas connecting the absolute Galois group of the rational number field to the theory of motives in algebraic geometry (through work of Deligne, Goncharov, Kontsevich, and others). These ideas are in turn involved in work of Connes, Kreimer, and others on a reinterpretation of the classical theory of renormalization in physics. One of the central notions of this proposal is the hope of finding in differential topology an analog of the algebraic geometers' mixed Tate motives, which would be related to the algebraic K-theory of the integers as that subject is to Waldhausen's algebraic K-theory of spaces.<br/><br/>In less technical terms: homotopy theory provides a body of techniques for studying mathematical objects and their deformations on an equal footing; indeed, it is equally happy studying deformations of deformations, and so on. This proposal is concerned ultimately with two sets of ideas with roots in physics, one coming from modern string theory, the other from the more classical theory of renormalization. The former set of ideas has deep connections with differential topology, and the latter is related to recent developments in algebraic geometry and number theory. On the surface, differential topology and arithmetic algebraic geometry are far apart, but they are linked through the algebraic K-theory of the integers, which is at base a part of homotopy theory. [Because that subject deals so systematically with deformations of one theory into another, it provides a very convenient set of tools for relating such disparate subjects.] This proposal suggests a way of clarifying these linkages, based on ideas about the K-theory of spaces rather than numbers, which were first proposed by Waldhausen, and which have lately given further currency by workers in arithmetic geometry such as Soul\'e. This program would bring together these important recent developments in mathematics and physics in a conceptually satisfying way.<br/><br/>"

This project investigates these  ""higher-order""<br/> modules in more general situations, especially where the subgroup H <br/>is an element of the derived series of G. Families of modules that <br/>generalize the Alexander module are thus obtained. Although these are <br/>modules over noncommutative rings, they share many important properties <br/>with the Alexander module.

For a nonlinear trap subjected to secondary end-cap excitation and including a buffer gas, the equations of motion are coupled, damped, nonlinear, quasiperiodic Mathieu equations. The attractors for this system are non-trivially ""knotted"" in the 4-D phase space. The investigator and his colleagues have developed tools to characterize them topologically and geometrically, and have identified new bifurcations associated with their changes of type. Important outstanding problems include: how topological equivalence of attractors through torus braids and through surfaces is related; whether chaos is associated with transverse intersections of stable and unstable manifolds of saddle-type knotted tori.<br/>A sequence of the newly identified bifurcations leads to chaotic dynamics through a route observed, but not yet characterized. In some cases, two bifurcations bound extremely sharp resonances which are useful in applications.<br/><br/>The new knowledge being developed about this system can be used to suggest new operating regimes for ion traps used in discrimination of species in mass spectroscopy.  The sharp resonances already observed suggest the use of an ion trap as a tunable electromechanical filter. Two similar ion trap systems may be used for the purpose of masking and unmasking signals for secure communication. Finally, the results suggest that a trapped charged particle or ion can be used as an accelerometer and gyroscope.
