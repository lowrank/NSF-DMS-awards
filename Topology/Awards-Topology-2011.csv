This is a new annual conference on geometry and topology, with an emphasis on highlighting and enhancing research being done in the Southeast US.  We will have seven speakers, in the areas of contact topology, geometric group theory, and knot theory, and we will have participants from Georgia Tech, Florida State, Sevilla, Emory, Georgia, Columbia, Penn State, Rice, Clemson, and Tennessee. Over the past few years, there has been an incredible amount of cross-fertilization between the fields of surface topology, contact topology, knot theory, and group theory.  At this conference, we will have specialists in each of these areas, whose work lies at the interface of two more more of these areas.  As such, the conference will be a fertile ground for new ideas in geometry and topology.<br/><br/>The main goals of the conference are (1) To provide a high-profile geometry-topology conference to the Southeast that brings leaders of the field to the area as well as showcases the high quality mathematics being done in the Southeast, and (2) To provide a convenient meeting place for Southeastern researchers and students to gather, discuss, research, and interact with leading mathematicians from across the country.  This conference will be a valuable learning environment for graduate students and junior faculty in the Southeast, and will help raise the profile of the region.  We will provide ample time for the participants to meet, formally and informally, for example during long breaks between talks and organized discussion sessions.  We plan to post notes from all the talks on the conference web site.  More information can be found on the conference web site: http://ttc.gatech.edu"

The goals of the project include: expanding the class of manifolds for which the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group (or its universal cover) is known to admit Calabi quasi-morphisms; investigating global geometric questions about Hofer's metrics on the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group and on spaces of Lagrangian submanifolds (for instance, when do these spaces have infinite diameter?); and developing a new family of relative symplectic capacities that are constructed by using Floer theory in a novel way. To achieve this, the PI will make use of tools coming from the natural real-valued filtrations on Floer complexes, including the well-established Oh-Schwarz spectral invariants and also a newer invariant, the boundary depth, that was first introduced by the principal investigator in 2009.  An auxiliary goal of the project is to obtain a better understanding of the behavior of these two useful invariants.<br/><br/>Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of symplectic manifolds can be used to mathematically model those classical physical systems in which energy is conserved.  Thus they are relevant in the study of a very wide range of phenomena, from the motion of planets and satellites (with potential applications to lower-cost space mission planning) to the flow of turbulent fluids. A remarkable geometric structure on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold was discovered by Hofer over 20 years ago; despite much effort some basic aspects of this geometry remain poorly understood.  Much of this project is aimed at obtaining new results about Hofer's geometry, and at clarifying how the behavior of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a symplectic manifold is related to other properties of the manifold.<br/>"

It takes place at the University of Georgia in Athens in the Spring or Summer. The focus of the conference is a subfield of topology which varies from year to year; recent topics have included three- and four-dimensional manifolds, knot theory, contact and symplectic topology, and the calculus of functors. Each year, the conference gathers a core of senior researchers together with a larger group of young mathematicians, mostly recent Ph. D.'s and graduate students.  Participation by members of under-represented groups is encouraged and funded; in particular the speakers and organizers generally include several women.  The conference format is designed both to help disseminate important new research and to provide a formative experience for early-career mathematicians.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>Broadly speaking, topology is the study of the properties of a space (such as the universe that we live in) which are preserved when the space is continuously deformed.

The principal investigator intends to study these algebraic structures in concrete examples based on Hilbert schemes of points on complex curves or complex surfaces. Part of the goal will be to extend the structures to higher categorical structures, using symplectic constructions closely related to the string diagrams of physicists. The extended algebraic structures are motivated by constructions in algebraic geometry for the same Hilbert schemes, which should have symplectic analogues by mirror symmetry. Two examples in particular that have been well studied on the symplectic side, and can function as guides, are the Heegaard Floer theory developed by low-dimensional topologists, and Seidel-Smith's symplectic Khovanov homology, a symplectically constructed invariant of knots and links. The short-term objective is to find concrete illustrations, and potential applications, of a new theory that is largely abstract, but has the potential to explain algebraic phenomena in these fields. The broader goal is to describe as much of the algebraic structure of Lagrangian Floer theory as possible in a single algebraic language coming from ""quilts"", a recent technique in symplectic topology due to Wehrheim and Woodward.<br/><br/>A symplectic structure is the geometric face of Hamiltonian mechanics, in which the position and momentum coordinates of a system of moving particles are tracked and used to write out equations of motion that correspond to Newton's laws. Spaces that carry such structures are always even-dimensional, and their underlying geometry is about two-dimensional area and higher-dimensional volume rather than about length and angle, which are at the root of much of familiar geometry. New methods are coming into symplectic geometry from other subjects such as low--dimensional topology, and it appears that an algebraic formalism can be devised to carry a number of these new constructions and to reveal useful properties of them. &#711;"

Specifically, the PI will first give a much simplified <br/>description of the p-local finite group model for the homotopy theory of <br/>fusion systems.  This shows that a p-local finite group on a finite <br/>p-group is equivalent to map from the classifying space into a p-complete, <br/>nilpotent space with a stable retract satisfying Frobenius reciprocity up <br/>to homotopy.  In recent work, joint with Radu Stancu, the PI has shown <br/>that saturated fusion systems on a finite p-group are in bijective <br/>correspondence with stable idempotents of the classifying space that <br/>satisfy Frobenius reciprocity.  The PI will extend this result to a <br/>bijection between p-local finite groups and idempotents that satisfy <br/>Frobenius reciprocity up to structured homotopies.  The crucial question <br/>in the field is on the existence and uniqueness of classifying spaces for <br/>saturated fusion systems (in the form of p-local finite groups).  Using <br/>results from this project, the question can be approached by refining the <br/>current construction of classifying spectra from being a construction up <br/>to homotopy to producing structured classifying spectra, and steps will be <br/>taken in this direction.<br/><br/>Groups are fundamental objects in mathematics used to keep track of the <br/>symmetries of an object (e.g. a set or a space).  A group is said to act <br/>on an object if that object exhibits the symmetries encoded by the group. <br/>Among such objects the classifying space of a group is of special <br/>importance, as its homotopical properties contain information about all <br/>possible actions of the group on topological spaces.  A finite group can <br/>be characterized as the fundamental group of its classifying space --the <br/>set of paths in the space beginning and ending in a fixed point where two <br/>paths are identified if one can be continuously deformed into the other. <br/>For a given prime p, the p-local structure of a group can be thought of as <br/>the system of symmetries of the group that can be detected by actions on <br/>sets whose cardinality is a power of p.  This notion is made precise by <br/>fusion systems as introduced by Puig and developed by Broto-Levi-Oliver. <br/>As conjectured by Martino-Priddy, and proved by Oliver, p-localizing the <br/>classifying space mirrors this construction in topology.  More generally <br/>one can consider abstract fusion systems that do not necessarily come from <br/>groups and p-local finite groups are a model for the corresponding <br/>classifying space suggested by Broto-Levi-Oliver.  In this project the PI <br/>will elucidate this correspondence by providing a simpler model for <br/>classifying spaces of abstract fusion systems and take important steps <br/>toward proving the existence of classifying spaces for arbitrary fusion <br/>systems which is a fundamental question in the field."

Recent advances in techniques based on knot surgery and Luttinger surgery for creating exotic manifolds with small Euler characteristic will be coupled with computations of gauge-theoretic and symplectic invariants.  We will make use of 4-dimensional handlebody techniques in these constructions, with an organizing principle being the search for 'corks' and 'plugs' as a  technique for changing the smooth structure.

In most general terms, the theory of groups acting on rooted, spherically homogeneous, trees can be understood as study of residually finite groups by using the language, methods, ideas and the intuition from topology and geometry. The self-similarity of the object of action (the tree) and the presence of a fixed vertex (the root) in the theory of groups acting on rooted trees lead to a set of natural finiteness conditions, such as being a generated by a finite self-similar set, having rigid stabilizers of finite index, being defined by finitely many forbidden tree patterns, having finite nucleus, etc. Such conditions play a crucial role in the proposed problems and directions of study involving questions on presentations of self-similar groups, Bieri-Neumann-Strebel Sigma invariants, virtual endomorphisms and their applications, finitely constrained groups and other group shifts on trees, relations to Hausdorff dimension, and algorithmic problems, with special attention given to the conjugacy problem. <br/><br/>In many endeavors, in and outside of mathematics, understanding is achieved in two, often intertwined, phases. Namely, in the first phase one seeks understanding of some classes of objects and situations distinguished by their simplicity or regularity, and in the second understanding of the ways in which they fit together to build, or at least approximate, the more complex ones. Since, by its very nature, the notion of self-similarity concerns entities in which copies of the original can be found at various scales within the entity itself, the approach of building/understanding complex self-similar structures from simpler and more regular ones seems particularly well suited. The proposed research contributes to both natural phases in the understanding of self-similar group actions on rooted trees. For instance, all finite self-similar groups are being characterized, and they serve as the building blocks from which the finitely constrained groups, and more generally all self-similar groups, are put together. On the other hand, the decidability of algorithmic questions is explored in contexts in which the building blocks are already well understood and the solution of the problem in the simple instances could possibly be assembled into a solution in the composite structure."

One part of the project will combine several techniques,  developed   both by the PI and her collaborators and by others, to derive estimates of hyperbolic volumes and other geometric invariants of 3-manifolds from topological data such as  Dehn surgery presentations, link diagrams  and  group actions. A second part will establish relations between  the Jones knot polynomials (and the Khovanov homology), essential surfaces, and geometric structures of knot complements.

The research  also involves  graduate students currently working with PI.<br/><br/><br/>The research of the project lies in the area of 3-dimensional topology. The central objects of this study  are spaces called 3-manifolds. A 3-manifold is an object that locally looks like the ordinary 3- dimensional space but whose global structure can be complicated. An important part of 3-dimensional topology is also the study of knots (loops embedded in some tangled way in 3-manifolds) and their classification. The solution of Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture has established that  3-manifolds (and complements of knots in them) decompose into pieces that admit explicit geometries and that hyperbolic geometry is the one that appears more often. In practice, however,  3-manifolds are often given in terms of combinatorial  topological descriptions and it  is both natural and important to seek for ways to deduce geometric information from these descriptions. One of the ways that topologists have been approaching the study of 3- manifolds  is through the use of invariants. In the last few decades ideas originated in physics led mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. Understanding  the connections of topological and combinatorial quantities and invariants  to geometry is a central and important goal of 3-dimensional topology. The main theme of this project is to establish concrete such connections and explore their ramifications and applications to other areas of mathematics."

Ever since Gromov's celebrated theorem on polynomial growth which related a purely algebraic property with the large scale geometry of a group, researchers have been interested in what one can learn from studying finitely generated infinite groups via the geometry of their associated Cayley graphs.  One line of proposed research seeks to continue this program for certain families of self-similar groups and some generalizations of these groups.  The second area of proposed research arises from topological fixed point theory and concerns groups for which every automorphism has infinite Reidemeister number, a property which has other topological consequences.  The principal investigator and collaborator P. Wong are interested in a geometric interpretation of this number for the families of groups studied, building on their previous work.  The self-similar groups and generalizations studied by the principal investigator include the family of groups whose Cayley graphs (with respect to an appropriate generating set) are Diestel-Leader graphs, or horocyclic products of trees, generalizing geometrically the classical lamplighter groups.<br/><br/><br/>The principal investigator proposes several projects in the area of geometric group theory. This field studies fundamental mathematical objects called groups from a geometric point of view. Symmetry groups are a typical example of a mathematical group. The study of symmetry groups was used, for example, to discern that the shape of DNA was a double helix. The proposed work of the principal investigator is related to self-similar groups; the appearance of self-similarity in mathematics and nature is prevalent, from colorful fractals to a study of the Maine coastline.   In mathematics, self similar groups are defined relative to their action on an infinite tree; trees, or graphs without circuits, are fundamental objects in the study of combinatorics and in computer science.  In computer science, for example, trees are used to implement efficient search algorithms.  A self similar group has instructions for a ""rearrangement"" of a tree in a particular way.  The research questions above all relate to the interaction between the geometric and algebraic structure attached to such a group, and what one can learn about algebraic properties by studying geometry, and vice versa."

For this, the Hodge heat equation and the Hodge wave equation will serve as the basic model problems, and Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism and the equations of elastodynamics are two of the numerous applications.  Another important direction is the development of spaces and complexes of finite element differential forms on cubical meshes and the study of the approximation properties of such spaces when the elements of the mesh are distorted. The proposer will also study the application of the finite element exterior calculus to solving the Einstein equations, which are the fundamental equations of general relativity.<br/><br/>Computer simulation of physical systems coming from solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and other areas, are applied in countless ways every day in problems as varied as the design of aircraft, the prediction of climate, and the development of cardiac devices.  Once a physical system has been modeled by a system of mathematical equations, successful simulation depends not only on powerful computer hardware but also on mathematical algorithms that can harness the computer's high speed number-crunching to obtain accurate solutions of model's equations. While such algorithms exist for many important equations, and moreover have been certified by mathematical analysis so we can have confidence in the results, there are many other problems for which accurate and certifiable algorithms are yet to be discovered. This proposal focuses on a new approach to the development and analysis of computational algorithsm for simulation that has in recent years achieved great success for simulations involving the deformation of solid materials, like auto bodies or construction beams.  A primary goal of this project is to increase the range of systems which can be simulated accurately and confidently."

A Heegaard splitting is a decomposition of a 3-dimensional manifold into two simple pieces called handlebodies along a surface. A Heegaard splitting defines a presentation for the fundamental group of the 3-manifold in which the number of generators is equal to the genus of the surface. Thus the rank of the 3-manifold (the minimal number of generators) is less than or equal to the genus of the minimal Heegaard surface. In most cases, rank and genus are equal, but a small number of examples have been found in which the rank is strictly less than the genus. Tao Li recently discovered the first examples of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with rank strictly less than genus. This raises the question of how common these examples are and how big the difference between rank and genus can be.<br/><br/>When we look at the surface of the earth from ground level, it appears to be a flat plane that goes on forever in all directions. However, from world navigation and viewing the earth from space, we know that it is, in fact, a completely different shape - a sphere, or the surface of a ball. Similarly, the universe that we live in appears to be a flat 3-dimensional space that goes on forever in all directions. Unfortunately we have no way of checking what the shape actually is, but we can study the possible shapes that it could be. This is the focus of 3-dimensional topology.

This is closely related to the discretization of SL(2,C) Chern-Simon theory in 3-dimensions. The PI proposes  to use the volume functional on the finite dimensional space of circle valued angle structures as the basic tool. Given a closed triangulated 3-manifold or pseudo 3-manifold, there are Haken's theory of normal surfaces, and Thurston's algebraic gluing equation associated to the triangulation. Haken's theory is topological and studies surfaces in 3-manifolds, and Thurston's equation is geometric and tries to construct hyperbolic metrics from triangulations.  Solutions to Haken's equation are well understood.  However, there is no known existence theorem for Thurston's equation. The main objective of the proposal is to establish conditions on the triangulation to guarantee the existence of solutions to Thurston's equation.  The PI will focus on the following conjecture relating Haken's equation with Thurston's equation. It states that for any closed minimally triangulated irreducible oriented  3-manifold, either there exists a solution to Thurston's algebraic equation, or there exist three special solutions to Haken's normal surface equation which has exactly one or two non-zero quadrilateral coordinates all supported in a tetrahedron. A weaker form of the conjecture has been established by the PI recently using volume optimization. Recent work of Futer-Gueritaud, Segerman-Tillmann, and Luo-Tillmann shows that the conjecture in the case of simply connected 3-manifolds is equivalent to the Poincare conjecture in dimension three (without using the Ricci flow).<br/><br/>Our universe is 3-dimensional. To understand the shapes of the universe and other 3-dimensional solids, mathematicians developed the theory of 3-manifolds using topology and geometry. To investigate these 3-dimensional spaces, one of the revolutionary ideas of William Thurston says that one should use geometry and geometric tools to understand the space. This program of Thurston is called the geometrization of 3-manifolds and has dominated the study of 3-dimensional topological investigation for the past 40 years. Recent work of G. Perelman, using the Ricci flow method developed by R. Hamilton, established the conjecture of Thurston and revolutionized the field. Perelman's work is widely considered to be one of the major mile-stones in the history of mathematics. However, there remains the problem of how to find those geometric structures theoretically predicated by Thurston, Perelman and Hamilton. One of the goals of the proposal aims at developing algorithms to find these geometries on 3-dimensional spaces."

This is a non-commutative version of classical number theoretic results. We plan to take this direction some steps further and to apply similar methods for developing 'group sieve method' for the study of pure group theoretical problems. This method seems to be suitable for solving problems which are out of reach by the classical group theoretic methods.

Another of the investigator's projects in motivic homotopy theory, also joint with I. Kriz and K. Ormsby, is the study of equivariant motivic stable homotopy theory, which in turn also leads to new information in the world of equivariant topology. Together with I. Kriz, the investigator has a project studying equivariant spectra in topology arising from the realizations of motivic spectra, such as the so-called topological hermitian cobordism spectrum. The groups acting on such spectra contain Z/2, and the actions incorporate a Real (or complex conjugation) action. As shown by the recent work of Hill, Hopkins and Ravenel in solving the Kervaire invariant 1 problem, these objects are highly interesting sources of new homotopy theoretical information. In addition, the investigator also has a project in understanding string topology, as well as operad actions and deformation theory in both algebra and topology. This aspect of the investigator's work closely related to J. Lurie's recent notion of non-abelian Poincare duality on manifolds.<br/><br/>The overall theme of the investigator's research is in the interaction between two important areas of mathematics, that of algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.  Algebraic topology can be thought of as ""purely qualitative"" geometry, where one is allowed to deform shapes or topological spaces, and associate to them certain algebraic and numerical invariants. On the other hand, algebraic geometry can be thought of as the study of certain much more rigid mathematical objects, built essentially from the solution sets of algebraic equations. Morel and Voevodsky have constructed a way of applying the methods of algebraic topology to the area of algebraic geometry, giving rise to a new field of mathematics, that of motivic homotopy theory.  One of the investigator's projects (joint with I. Kriz and K. Ormsby) is to apply certain well-established machinery of algebraic topology to this world, which has the potential to answer long-standing questions. Another project is to gain an understanding of equivariant motivic homotopy theory, the goal of which is to shed light on structures in motivic homotopy theory by adding in the actions of groups to the story. In its turn, gaining an understanding of equivariant motivic homotopy theory will also lead to new information about objects in topology itself."

One aspect of the project will lead to a version of this equation which holds for families of dynamical systems that will relate a higher K-theory invariant to an invariant counting periodic orbits. The main tools will come from Waldhausen's work on algebraic K-theory and the functor TR, which is the topologists' version of the topological de Rham-Witt complex. The second project will study multi-relative version of intersection theory which will give insights beyond the metastable range. We will study obstructions to deforming a map from a manifold into another one off of a finite collection of pair-wise disjoint submanifolds, assuming that the map can be deformed off of the union of any proper sub-collection. The obstruction will live in a direct sum of bordism groups. In a certain range, the obstruction will capture the entire story. Applications of this theory will be given in embedding theory and also in the theory of link homotopy.<br/><br/>The proposed research is largely about ""manifolds"" which  are topological spaces that satisfy a certain homogeneity property. Locally speaking, all manifolds are alike in that at any point one sees a copy of Euclidean space. It is the global structure of manifolds that makes them interesting objects of study. Typically, algebraic topologists study manifolds by assigning certain algebraic quantities, called ""invariants,"" to them, which measure global topological structure. Manifolds having different invariants can then be distinguished from one another. Manifolds arise naturally in physics, chemistry and biology as spaces of solutions of a suitably ""nice"" set of algebraic equations modeling the scientific object of study (space-time, atoms, dynamical systems, etc.) . Manifolds play a central role in mathematics. It is often the case that mathematical questions about manifolds can be formulated in terms of parametrized families of functions between spaces associated with manifolds. Homotopy theory is a subject designed to tackle questions about such families of functions. K-theory is an algebraic theory which is a receptacle for invariants of manifolds. The PI will research certain kinds of manifold questions which can be analyzed using homotopy theory and K-theory."

It will be the 33rd conference in the Knots in Washington Conference Series.  There have been exciting new developments in the area of knot theory and 3-manifold topology in the last 30 years. From the Jones polynomial and quantum invariants of 3-manifolds, through Vassiliev invariants, topological quantum field theories, to relations with gauge theory type invariants in 4-dimensional topology (e.g. Donaldson, Witten).  More recently, again, a new development in quantum topology has emerged in the form of ``Khovanov homology"", a generalization of the Jones type polynomials to homology of chain complexes that significantly generalizes the invariants.  Also, the categorification of the Kauffman bracket skein module of 3-manifolds has been proposed and developed for some manifolds. The relation to Hochschild homology of algebras has been discovered and studied. The (quantum) complexity of computing the Jones polynomial and Turaev-Viro invariants have been analyzed.  ""Knots in Washington"" meetings would provide a place for researchers in described above areas to communicate and work with one another.  Distinguished researchers will give plenary talks surveying the state of knowledge related to Khovanov homology. PhD students and fresh PhD's will be encouraged to attend. We strive to be always in the frontier of new developments in Knot Theory and its ramifications. Our choice of conference topics also reflects the strength of our topology group at the George Washington University.<br/><br/>Knots in Washington provides an opportunity for researchers in the area to share their latest ideas and to collaborate with each other. The presentations include plenary talks by distinguished researchers, as well as short talks by various participants. Over the years, we have attracted a large number of postdoctors, graduate students, and some undergraduates. In the greater Washington DC area, Knots in Washington helps to bring together the relevant researchers, and to boost the research activities in the region.  Internationally, Knots in Washington has attracted researchers from all over the world, and is now considered as a major conference in knot theory and low-dimensional topology. We expect to publish conference proceedings (as we did in the past) containing cutting-edge research papers and lecture notes which will be suitable for research mathematicians, students and readers with background in other exact sciences, including biology, chemistry, computer science, and physics.

Observations across several disciplines, by researchers studying dramatically different problems, suggest the existence of geometrical and topological structures in many data sets, and much current research is devoted to modeling and exploiting these structures to aid in prediction and information extraction. Recent work by the investigators, among others, has shown that integrating statistical methodologies with ideas derived from computational topology and diffusion geometry often leads to strikingly superior results than by conventional means. The investigators now propose to bring these methods into the mathematics/statistics curriculum and departmental structure in a formal way, by establishing a vertically integrated program of undergraduate and graduate research and education. This activity has broad support from programs within the Division of Mathematical Sciences, including Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, Statistics and Topology programs, as well as Division of Mathematical Sciences Workforce Program.<br/>This involves new undergraduate courses in the core theoretical areas, graduate topics courses, an extensive summer research program for undergraduates, as well as year long seminars aimed at both graduate and undergraduate students.  In addition, the investigators will disseminate their ideas via summer workshops aimed at small-college faculty, and methodology workshops directed to faculty from other large research institutions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The need to analyze massive, complex data arises in a wide variety of scientific areas of national importance, including for example satellite image analysis, medical genomics, and internet security.<br/>The investigators propose a program of training future mathematical scientists to attack these new types of problems. The program will be vertically integrated, fostering extensive collaboration between post-docs, undergraduate and graduate students, and senior faculty, and will comprise a dynamic mixture of theoretical coursework and hands-on research activity. Participants in the program will gain valuable professional experience to distinguish them in the industrial and academic job-market."

Due to a result of Giroux, a topological insight into contact structures is offered by open book decompositions of 3-manifolds. Open books are related to Lefschetz fibrations on 4-manifolds; the latter provide a topological approach to Stein and symplectic structures. The PI plans to study these structures using low-dimensional techniques together with invariants from Heegaard Floer theory. Specific goals include, for example, the study (joint with M. Hedden) of Heegaard Floer contact invariants for rational open books. These will have important applications to surgeries on contact manifolds, and will allow to prove tightness for new classes of contact structures. In another project (joint with T. Mark and based on the previous work of the PI and J. Baldwin) Plamenevskaya will try to obtain invariants of Lefschetz fibrations on 4-manifolds from a certain spectral sequence in Heegaard Floer homology. She also hopes to develop a better understanding of the 4-dimensional Heegaard Floer invariants, and to use these (perhaps along with Lefschetz fibrations) to study certain exotic phenomena in 4 dimensions.<br/><br/><br/>Understanding the shape of the space-time world and of other related objects is a fundamental problem. The space we live in is an example of a 3-dimensional manifold (in general, manifolds can be curved or twisted, or have holes in them). With the addition of time, we obtain a 4-dimensional manifold. Low-dimensional topology studies the shape of manifolds of dimension 3 and 4. Knots are another object of research in low-dimensional topology; they have practical importance for disciplines outside mathematics (for example, DNA and some polymers are knotted). The goal of the present project is to study 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds equipped with contact (for 3-manifolds) and respectively symplectic  (for 4 manifolds) structures. These structures originate in mechanics, optics and hydrodynamics, and play a major role in mathematics.  The study of sympectic and contact structures lies at the crossroads of several important subjects in topology and uses various tools, including gauge theory (originating from physics), knot theory, and various topological ""building blocks"" decompositions, such as those given by open books and Lefschetz fibrations. The present proposal touches upon many of these aspects; the PI's goal is both to construct new tools and to find new applications of the theory."

The proposed research includes  large scale geometry of solvable groups, metric structure on the boundary of relatively hyperbolic groups, and quasiisometric rigidity of Hadamard manifolds.  The proposed research  on solvable groups  involves the study of quasiconformal analysis on  nilpotent Lie groups. Although the metrics on the nilpotent Lie groups are not Riemannian, they are left invariant and admit a one-parameter family of dilations.   They include Carnot metrics and also many other metrics.    Stated in the language of quasiconformal analysis, some of the goals are:  to classify  these nilpotent Lie groups up to quasiconformal equivalence; to show that (in most cases) every quasiconformal map is biLipschitz.  In terms of large scale geometry, the goal is to show that  quasiisometries between (most) negatively curved solvable Lie groups preserve distance up to an additive constant  and sometimes are    even  at a finite distance from isometries.   If  successful, this  research will lead to progress on the large scale geometry  of   finitely generated solvable groups. The proposed research on relatively hyperbolic groups will try to determine if there is a canonical quasiconformal structure on the boundary of relatively hyperbolic groups.   % and   the limit sets of geometrically finite groups. It would have applications to rigidity questions about these groups.  The proposed research about Hadamard manifolds concerns the question whether every quasiisometry between Hadamard manifolds is at a finite distance from a biLipschitz homeomorphism. The proposed projects on negatively curved solvable Lie groups and Hadamard manifolds  are  continuation of the PI's previous work on these topics. A common theme of these proposed   projects is the interplay  between geometry of negatively curved spaces  and  analysis  on the ideal boundary of these spaces.<br/><br/>The proposed research lies in geometric group theory and geometric analysis.  The questions in geometric group theory often concern the large scale properties of the spaces or maps, while in analysis the main focus is often the local properties. Surprisingly, these are related for spaces with negative curvature: a negatively curved space has an ideal boundary, and the large scale properties of the spaces are  encoded in the local structure of the ideal boundary. The PI proposes to study  the large scale properties of negatively curved spaces by  investigating the ideal boundary using  geometric analysis."

In particular, both Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer homology have been used to give new proofs of the topological Milnor conjecture and of the existence of exotic smooth structures on the open four-ball. Previously, such results had only been accessible via gauge theory. While Khovanov homology is defined combinatorially, via a construction which is motivated by the representation theory of quantum groups, Heegaard Floer homology is defined analytically, through moduli spaces of solutions of differential equations. Around 2008, Heegaard Floer homology was extended to an invariant for three-manifolds with non-empty boundary, called ""bordered Floer homology"", which can be used to compute Heegaard Floer homology combinatorially whenever a decomposition of a three-manifold into suitable smaller pieces is given. A main goal of this project is to study the relationship between bordered Floer homology and Khovanov homology for tangles. Comparing these two theories will expectedly shed more light on the geometric content of Khovanov homology and thus make Khovanov homology more suited to applications. Moreover, the envisioned relationship between bordered Floer homology and Khovanov homology will provide an example of a perhaps more general connection between symplectic geometry and representation theory. Other goals of this project are to develop new homology theories for contact three-manifolds, and to analyze the properties of Khovanov homology groups of n-cables of knots.<br/><br/>Mathematicians have long been interested in classifying topological spaces that are locally three-dimensional (like our physical universe) or locally four-dimensional (like four-dimensional space-time). Related to the problem of classifying such spaces is the problem of classifying knotted loops embedded in a given three-dimensional space. Over the past two decades, mathematicians have used ideas coming from several different areas of mathematics and mathematical physics (in particular from symplectic geometry, quantum field theory, string theory, and loop quantum gravity) to develop powerful new tools for classifying knots and low-dimensional spaces. The most notable ones among these new tools are Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer homology. This proposal aims to investigate the connections between certain generalizations of Khovanov homology and Heegaard Floer homology, and to use these connections to study knot theoretical problems. Mathematical knot theory has applications in biomedical research, where it is used to study the processes that are responsible for unraveling DNA strands during cell division. Thus, this project is important not only from a theoretical perspective, but also for its potential applications to biomedical sciences."

Loops can evolve by changing in size and even breaking apart.  These phenomena are measured by studying surfaces mapping to the background space, that span these loops.  In this project, Cohen tends to study various aspects of the theory related to topological quantum field theories, as well as those related to symplectic geometry."

Kirby<br/><br/>This award will provide funding for a conference ""Low-dimensional<br/>manifolds and high-dimensional categories"". The title is somewhat<br/>ironic, in that the low and high dimensions are in fact the same:<br/>3 and especially 4. The conference celebrates the occasion of<br/>Michael Freedman's 60th birthday and some of the current<br/>mathematical achievements and challenges influenced by Freedman's<br/>work. For manifolds of dimension 5 and higher, there is a<br/>well-established classification scheme, the so called surgery<br/>theory which includes the celebrated s-cobordism theorem that<br/>produces diffeomorphisms between manifolds from homotopy<br/>theoretic data.  Dimensions below 5 are more difficult because<br/>there is less room to maneuver and, as a consequence, the<br/>s-cobordism theorem fails.  For n-categories, dimensions n<br/>greater than 2 are difficult because of the complexity of the<br/>combinatorial relations which describe the various ways n-balls<br/>can be cut, glued and rotated. Thus dimensions 3 and 4 represent<br/>a shared frontier of the two subjects, though this frontier is<br/>approached from different directions. One of the main goals of<br/>this conference is to promote cross-fertilization between experts<br/>on 4-manifolds and experts on higher categories and quantum field<br/>theories.<br/><br/>Michael Freedman made groundbreaking contributions to the study<br/>and classification of 4-dimensional spaces (manifolds), which are<br/>a central topic in the study of topology, and have connections<br/>with algebra, geometry and physics.  Ideas from physics, in<br/>particular quantum field theory, imply that there ought to be<br/>certain constructions which describe the topology of<br/>4-dimensional spaces, that is, intrinsic properties which do not<br/>depend on the measure of length or angles on the space.<br/>Mathematically, these theories are formulated in the algebraic<br/>language of category theory and require substantial new<br/>developments in that area. The object of the conference is to<br/>bring together experts on 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds together<br/>with experts in category theory and quantum field theory to<br/>explore the interactions between these topics. Additional<br/>geometric structures, such as broken Lefschetz fibrations,<br/>contact and symplectic structures, smooth structures, and gauge<br/>theories will also be explored at the conference."

The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) is a project proposed by a group of underrepresented students in its department and will be largely run and organized by graduate students.  The conference is scheduled to be held at the University of Iowa on April 1-3, 2011. It will be structured so that speakers will give 20-minute parallel research talks in topology and algebra. One distinguished graduate student will give an hour long presentation and one invited faculty member, Dr. Emille Davie Lawrence of California Polytechnic University Pomona,  will give a one hour keynote address. <br/><br/>The broader impact of this event is that graduate students who attend USTARS will be better equipped to find academic positions and continue the cycle of research and collaboration. Attendees will be exposed to a greater variety of current research, ideas, and results, and meet more underrepresented professors and students in their generation who may become future collaborators or colleagues. This is particularly important for students with great academic potential but are not attending top tier research institutions schools that can often be overlooked, despite a strong faculty and graduate student population. The conference also promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. The conference Organizing Committee is remarkably diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and hence is well-positioned to encourage participation by women and minorities. The participants of the  conference will continue to influence the next generation of students in positive ways by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.<br/><br/>http://www.mathalliance.org/ustars.asp"

For example, Heegaard Floer homology was used to obtain obstructions to a knot having unknotting number one. This allowed for a classification of all unknotting number one knots of crossing number up to ten. At the same time, Cho and McCullough defined the tree of tunnel number one knots that gives an indexing of all knots whose exterior has a genus two Heegaard splitting. Fundamental properties of these knots can be deduced by where in the tree the knot is located. The PI is currently in the process of developing new techniques to study surfaces in closed manifolds and in knot complements. She proposes to use these techniques together with the aforementioned results to address two important and long-standing problems in 3-manifold topology: establishing the additivity of crossing number of knots, and generalizing the work of Cho and McCulough to all knots. For her educational component she proposes a program with a principal goal to  identify mathematically-gifted high school students whose previous mathematical achievements do not represent their potential, and nurture their talents, initially through a two-week summer program and later via existing support systems.<br/><br/>The topology of 3-manifolds is at the core of many of the current questions of interest in the natural sciences. Results about 3-manifolds and knots often allow us to gain better understanding of the world we live in. Protein folding, DNA knotting and string theory are just a few of the areas where low dimensional topology is a key research tool. The variety of applications of this field has served as a catalyst for increased research in the area and a plethora of new results and techniques. In spite of these developments, many of the oldest and simplest-to-state questions remain unsolved. A stark example of this is the behavior of crossing number of knots under connect sum. The crossing number is the minimum number of self-intersections in a diagram of the knot. More than a century ago mathematicians asked the following question: if two knots are ""fused"" into a single knot, what is the crossing number of this knot in terms of the crossing numbers of the original pair? The fact that little progress has been made on this question is evidence of the difficulty of this field. The significance of the work of the PI will be greatly enhanced by integrating her research with her educational efforts, particularly in terms of developing innovative programs that address forecasted future shortages of mathematicians and scientists by recruiting and supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds. A principal goal of the PI is to identify mathematically-gifted high school students whose previous mathematical achievements do not represent their potential, and to nurture their talents, initially through a two-week summer program and later via existing support systems."

The second goal is to deepen the understanding of a relatively new algebraic structure defined on curves on surfaces (the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra) and its relation to existing structures. The third is studying a generalization of the Goldman-Turaev Lie bialgebra, to three manifolds and its relation with intersection structure of submanifolds.<br/><br/>A surface is the mathematical representation of the ""outer layer of a solid"". A curve on a surface, can be thought of as a ""rubber band"" on the surface.

One of the mathematical goals of this project consists in studying statistical relations between this quantities. The other mathematical goal of this project  will be studying an algebraic structure defined on curves on surface, and a generalization of this structure to three dimensional spaces which are the mathematical representation of solids, like, for instance, a donut or a ball, and also, the space we live in.  Surfaces and three manifolds play a crucial role in many branches of mathematics and have applications beyond them - potentially protein folding and cellular arrangements in organisms. The third goal is educational: Since some aspects of this project do not require an extensive knowledge of mathematics, and possible statements can be tested by computer experiments, we will involve undergraduate students in the executions.

Some of the most fundamental questions about hyperbolic 3-manifolds concern the extent to which their properties are inherited in, or, conversely, may develop among covering spaces of finite degree.  The famous virtual Haken and virtual fiberering conjectures answer this description, for example, as do the questions below.  Given a hyperbolic 3-manifold with a special topological property, for instance a knot complement, with how many others that have this same property does it share a finite-degree cover?  Or for a fixed hyperbolic 3-manifold M and a family of finite-degree covers {M_n}, does the rank of the fundamental group of M_n grow linearly with the covering degree?   This relates to the fixed price question in the study of topological dynamics.  The PI intends to continue his attacks on these and other questions, such as the possibility of embedding in right-angled Artin groups.  He will also further describe the topology of hyperbolic manifolds with low volume.<br/><br/><br/>The objects of study here, 3-manifolds, are spaces which look, in a neighborhood of each point, like the familiar three-dimensional space in which we live.  Although their definition allows quite a bit of flexibility, 3-manifolds share with 2-manifolds (surfaces) the property that each admits a unique best metric, a way of measuring the distance between two points in the space.  This property of low-dimensional manifolds, known in dimension 3 as Thurston's geometrization conjecture and proven recently by V. Perelman, has motivated an enormous body of work that uses geometry as a tool for understanding 3-manifolds, and the project follows this broad theme.  The study of 3-manifolds has benefited from its interaction with many different fields of mathematics, and the project additionally draws from questions and techniques in the study of topological dynamics, geometric flows, geometric group theory, and others. <br/>The project will help us better understand the classification of 3-manifolds and the relationships between them.  This in turn has applications in such diverse fields as cosmology (in determining the shape of the universe, for example), biology (in understanding the knotting of DNA), and computer science (through connections with families of graphs that certain families of 3-manifolds coarsely resemble), among others."

This project is devoted to better understanding the internal workings of this theory and its relationships to other link homology theories like Khovanov and Rozanskys categorification of the HOMFLY polynomial. One of the PIs broad goals is to use these relationships to develop more computable invariants of knots, 3-manifolds, and contact structures. Another goal involves using Heegaard Floer homology to better understand the correspondence between topological features of open books and geometric properties of contact structures. Specific aims include finding obstructions to a contact structure having support genus one, determining whether Legendrian surgery preserves tightness, understanding the relationship between fractional Dehn twist coefficient and fillability, and developing a combinatorial spanning tree model for knot Floer homology. The PI plans to use the latter to find an axiomatic description of knot Floer homology, in part to show that it agrees with the monopole and instanton knot homologies defined by Kronheimer and Mrowka using gauge theory.<br/><br/>The proposed project involves studying geometric structures on 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds.

In his address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in  1983, Gromov talked about groups as geometric objects. This followed on his proof in 1981 that finitely generated groups of polynomial growth contain a nilpotent subgroup of  finite index, which has helped to focus attention on the extent to which the asymptotic properties of a finitely generated solvable group has on its algebraic structure. This has led to a number of results dealing with the quasi-isometries and rigidity of solvable groups.Some of these results have been  motivated by ideas coming out of the theory of lie groups, where the semi-simple ones exhibit a rigidity that is not shared by the solvable ones. This ongoing geometric study of what are perhaps the simplest finitely generated solvable groups has put into sharp relief the very nature of finitely presented solvable groups. <br/><br/>Groups arise in many different areas of mathematics, in physics, in chemistry and in chrystallography among other disciplines. One of the reasons for this is that they can be used as a tool for understanding  and defining symmetry. Floor patterns in many churches display a symmetry which can be analyzed and better understood by using group theory and it is this kind of symmetry that groups capture, but in a more abstract way. Groups also display an innate symmetry of their own and in recent years efforts have been made to connect geometry to group theory. This is an important area of current research. The objective of this conference is to join the existing combinatorial and theoretical approach of group theory to the geometric approach. The latter requires a great deal of mathematical machinery.  The work that is currently being undertaken involves solvable groups introduced by Evariste Galois (who died in 1832 in a duel aged 21) to determine the nature of the solutions of everyday polynomial equations. The aim  of the conference is to make the two aspects of group theory available to graduate students, postdocs and interested professionals."

In his 1998 Gibbs Lecture to the American Mathematical Society, the physicist Edward Witten called this interaction  ""a little piece of 21st century mathematics which happened to land in the 20th century"", and proposed that understanding it would be an interesting and important problem for the 21st century.  Recent work has shown that one of the fundamental pieces of structure of elliptic cohomology are its ""twists"": they crop up again and again each time there is important progress in the subject.  Ando's project will focus directly on these twists, exploring their manifestations in algebra, topology, and physics."

The most convincing explanation of their nature came from Witten's work which related these invariants to quantum Chern-Simons theory. However the reason why Jones and HOMFLY-PT polynomials were polynomials in q rather than formal power series in (q-1), as a Quantum Field Theory would suggest, and what is the meaning of the coefficients of these polynomials remained a mystery. A breakthrough came from Khovanov's categorification construction: it turned out that a quantum polynomial is an Euler characteristic of a Z-graded homology associated by a combinatorial construction to a link. An extension of this result to the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariant of links in 3-manifolds is a challenging problem, in part because the WRT invariant is not exactly a polynomial of q and is defined only for q being a root of 1. Recently Khovanov and Rozansky categorified the ""stable"" polynomial part of the WRT invariant of links in the product of a 2-sphere with a circle. Their construction uses the derived categories of modules over Khovanov's algebras H_n. Rozansky will try to extend this result further to general 3-manifolds. He conjectures that this might be done by deforming the algebras H_n into A-infinity algebras, thus reducing their Z-grading to a periodic Z_r grading which would correspond to the associated parameter q being the root of 1. A similar trick worked to construct a categorification of the SU(N) HOMFLY-PT polynomial from its 2-variable version. In addition to categorifying combinatorially the WRT invariant, Rozansky will try to categorify Khovanov's categorificaiton construction of the Jones polynomial. This idea is based on a similarity between the objects used in the Kamnitzer-Cautis version of Khovanov's categorification and the 2-category associated to a holomorphic symplectic manifold in the joint work of Kapustin, Rozansky and Saulina.<br/><br/><br/>The discovery of quantum invariants such as the Jones and HOMFLY-PT polynomials of links in a 3-sphere and the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of colored links in a 3-manifold opened a new chapter in 3-dimensional topology. In contrast to the Alexander polynomial which was very efficient in establishing the topological properties of links, the relation between these new invariants and classical topology is indirect. It seems that the purpose of quantum invariants is to establish deep links between 3-dimensional topology and other branches of Mathematics and Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Khovanov's categorification of the Jones polynomial was an important step in this direction: it showed that algebraic geometry could be ""married"" to 3-dimensional topology. Witten suggests that a superstring-inspired 6-dimensional QFT links together Khovanov homology and Langlands duality. By using the methods of homological algebra, Rozansky will try to extend Khovanov's categorification program from links in a 3-sphere to links in general 3-manifolds. He will also try to raise categorification by one level through associating a category rather than a homology to a link. If true, this might suggest that the underlying QFT is 7-dimensional rather than 6-dimensional."

He proposes to further develop his work which applies to computer imaging and also continue his theoretical work, based on recent discoveries, on the properties of highly nonisolated singularities. He will extend the methods involving ""skeletal structures"", which he introduced to capture the shape of objects in any dimension, to obtain ""skeletal/medial linking structures"" for configurations of multiple objects in images. Such a linking structure will provide a mathematical structure which could be used for: the statistical analysis of medical images involving multiple physiological features, improved segmentation in images, and providing a rigorous unified mathematical framework for analyzing the interaction of positional and shape information in images. As well his work will develop new methods for studying highly nonisolated singularities whose topology has been beyond the reach of previous methods developed for isolated singularities. This involves determining the ""vanishing topology"" of the singularities as well as the topology of the complements and Milnor fibers for (highly singular) ""free divisors"" which naturally arise from representation theory of solvable linear algebraic groups.<br/><br/>The proposed investigations to be carried out under this grant will concern both theoretical work on singular spaces and its application to problems in medical imaging. Singular spaces, which are different from our usual image of smoothly bending objects, inevitably arise in the study of smooth objects. In the case of configurations of smooth objects, the investigator will develop appropriate singular structures which allow for the simultaneous analysis of the shapes of the individual objects and their positional relations. Such structures can be used for various imaging problems, such as for 3D medical images, where for treatment and diagnosis, the exact relative position and features of multiple physiological features must be determined. This will involve joint work with several groups of computer scientists. The investigator will also investigate the properties of these singular spaces when their structure is highly singular and cannot be understood using traditional methods. He is developing a new method for both simplifying the qualitative structure of such singularities and providing explicit algebraic methods for computing qualitative numerical invariants of the structures."

The problems on which the PI proposes to work include the following. 1. Confirming a broad conjectural picture of the cohomology of pure braid groups, Torelli-type groups, and congruence subgroups.  Such conjectures are phrased in the language of {\em representation stability}, a theory (recently discovered by the PI and T. Church) that imports representation theory as a powerful new tool into the study of homological stability phenomena. 2. Applying cohomological computations to computing arithmetic statistics for algebraic varieties, for polynomials, and for maximal tori in algebraic groups over finite fields. 3. Giving a deeper geometric understanding of the Morita-Mumford-Miller classes via a remarkable coincidence between certain characteristic numbers, as discovered by the PI and T. Church. 4. Constructing a large number of linearly independent unstable cohomology classes in mapping class groups and arithmetic groups.  While it has been indirectly deduced that super-exponentially many such dimensions of such cohomology must exist, almost no such classes are known.  The technique proposed here is a new one, using torsion groups to detect rational homology classes. 5.

The problem is the topological structure of moduli spaces is extremely complicated to describe.  The purpose of this proposal is to apply the powerful machinery of representation theory in order to give a simpler, easier-to-work-with encoding of these complicated structures.  The PI and T.

The action of right-angled Artin groups on cubical complexes satisfying a non- positive curvature condition, known as the CAT(0) condition, has been central to our understanding of these groups as well as to many of their applications.  Moreover, these actions serve as a rich class of examples for understanding more general CAT(0) spaces.

The planned workshop has a clear set of focused goals, and is unique among conferences in related subjects. The main objective is to establish a topological and geometric foundation of a newly discovered topological recursion formula of 2007 by physicists Eynard and Orantin  in their work on random matrices, and its Gromov-Witten theoretic realization due to string theorists Marino and Bouchard-Klemm-Marino-Pasquetti.One of the  major problems in this area is the Remodeling Conjecture due to them. It states that both open and closed Gromov-Witten invariants of an arbitrary toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold are, quite miraculously, calculated by the Eynard-Orantin topological recursion based on the complex analysis of the mirror curve. A good part of the workshop will be devoted to attacking this unsolved conjecture. Another emphasis of the workshop is placed on discovering yet unknown relation between the generating function of Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau spaces and integrable nonlinear partial differential equations.<br/><br/>The subject matter of the planned Workshop, which is the first full-scale international workshop specifically devoted to the topics mentioned above, does not fit in a single discipline of mathematics. An important aspect of the Workshop is its function of cross fertilization of different areas of mathematics and theoretical physics. The origin of the main topic is in the soil of statistical study of random matrices. It's geometric significance was discovered by string theorists. It's mathematical nature apparently lies in topology. The theory itself  covers a large area of mathematics. So far rigorously established examples of the theory range from hyperbolic geometry  to algebraic geometry  and to combinatorics of topological graph theory. The mathematical apparatus of these rigorous theories is the Laplace transform and classical complex analysis. Any new understanding of the proposed topics is expected to enhance our current knowledge of mirror symmetry, Gromov-Witten theory, and certain combinatorial problems. The BIRS Workshop plans to bring a wide variety of researchers, to nurture international and interdisciplinary collaborations among young participants, and to generate a larger momentum in the discipline. Since the key players of the subjects are postdoctoral researchers and faculty members in their early careers, the Workshop is expected draw the attention of many graduate students and postdoctoral scholars."

Floer homology is an infinite dimensional version of Morse theory which has been used to construct various invariants of knots, 3-manifolds, 4-manifolds, etc. In turn, these invariants can answer subtle questions about the respective topological objects. One source of invariants with numerous topological applications is Heegaard Floer theory. For example, the Heegaard Floer invariant for knots (called knot Floer homology) is able to detect the genus of a knot. Originally, all the Heegaard Floer invariants were defined in terms of pseudo-holomorphic curves in symmetric products. Recently, the Heegaard Floer invariants of knots, 3-manifolds and 4-manifolds have all been given combinatorial descriptions, based on grid diagrams. One focus of this project is to improve our understanding of these combinatorial descriptions. The PI will also work on finding connections between knot Floer homology and other knot invariants, such as the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies; on extending Heegaard Floer theory to manifolds with corners; and on constructing new Floer-theoretic invariants of three-manifolds using moduli spaces of flat connections.<br/><br/>The proposed research is on topology, an area of mathematics that studies geometric objects such as curved spaces (manifolds), and knots in space. One useful method of studying manifolds and knots is through topological quantum field theories (TQFT's), which are certain toy models used in Mathematical Physics to explore quantum theories about the universe. TQFT's are of interest to topologists because they contain information about the possible shapes of space in various dimensions. An important problem is the classification of these shapes, and this is particularly difficult in four dimensions.  Because our macroscopic space-time has four dimensions, the properties of four-dimensional shapes are an essential input for quantum physicists and cosmologists looking for geometric models for the universe. The goal of this project is to study the TQFT's which hold the most promise for our understanding of four-dimensional shapes."

In more<br/>detail: The proposal includes the study of the equivariant Johnson- Wilson spectrum, denoted by ER(n), under the involution symmetry given by complex conjugation acting on the standard Johnson-Wilson spectrum.  <br/>This theory ER(n) belongs to a family that starts with real K-theory.  <br/>These theories have rich structure that has been explored by the PI in previous work. The power of this structure has been demonstrated by the PI and his collaborators in extending previously known results about the immersion dimension of real projective spaces. In his proposal the PI also studies infinite dimensional symmetry groups like Kac-Moody groups and symplectomorphism groups. Kac-Moody groups are infinite dimensional generalizations of compact Lie groups in terms of their structure and representation theory. The PI studies them from the standpoint of topology by studying their classifying spaces and the underlying equivariant K-theory. The PI also studies symplectormorphism groups of certain 4-manifolds. In earlier work, he and his coauthors have demonstrated that one can use homotopical techniques to completely understand these groups for rational ruled surfaces. The techniques used there appear to be applicable in much more generality which the PI plans to explore.<br/><br/>On a general level, the proposal attempts to solve geometric problems by first understanding the apparent symmetries in the problem and then applying algebraic techniques to the framework. For example, complex K- theory is an invariant constructed from families of complex vector spaces parametrized over a general space (a concept known as a complex vector bundle). Complex conjugation demonstrates an apparent symmetry of this structure and one obtains real K-theory by encoding this symmetry. This framework can be formalized into a very strong algebraic invariant the power of which was demonstrated almost 50 years ago to answer a fundamental question like which spheres have a group structure, or which euclidean spaces support the structure of a skew field. The PI studies a family ER(n) that generalizes real K- theory. In addition to this, the PI studies questions with apparent symmetries that are no longer finite, but still have fundamental geometric significance. For example, the infinite dimensional symplectomorphism group is defined as the symmetries of a smooth manifold which preserve a fixed symplectic form. The PI has shown that in some cases, this group is amenable to study using algebraic techniques."

The bacterial chromosome is circular and replication invariably results in the formation of interlinked daughter chromosomes. Error-free unlinking is required to ensure proper segregation at cell division and stable plasmid inheritance. Type II topoisomerases unlink replication links. In Escherichia coli, in the absence of topo IV (a type II topoisomerase credited with chromosome unlinking), the site-specific recombination system XerCD mediates sister chromosome unlinking. This reaction is activated at the division septum by a powerful translocase FtsK, which coordinates the last stages of chromosome segregation. The mechanism by which the XerCD-FtsK complex simplifies the topology of DNA remains unclear. The main objective of the proposed studies is to characterize the topological mechanism of DNA unlinking by the XerCD-FtsK system using knot theory, low-dimensional topology, and computer simulations.  There is evidence that after being activated by FtsK, the enzymes XerCD unlink DNA in a stepwise manner. The tangle method will be used to find possible topological pathways of DNA unknotting and unlinking by site-specific recombination on small substrates. A computer model of DNA recombination will be developed, adapted to the Xer-FtsK system, and combined with the analytical results to analyze experimental data obtained from the Sherratt lab. The research is highly interdisciplinary and involves close collaboration with groups in Japan, Canada and the UK. Such collaborations will facilitate state-of-the-art student cross-training. Basic information about DNA topology will be disseminated to the general public, including elementary school children and visitors to the California Academy of Sciences. <br/><br/><br/>DNA replication is the basis for biological inheritance. In bacteria, reproduction starts with replication of the chromosome into two identical daughter molecules, followed by segregation of the newly replicated chromosomes and division of the parent cell into two daughter cells. In circular chromosomes, problems of entanglement during DNA linking complicate the process of chromosome segregation. In Escherichia coli, DNA unlinking is typically mediated by the enzyme topoIV, which is an important drug target for quinolone antimicrobial agents. Understanding DNA unlinking by Xer recombination, in addition to providing a more complete picture of the chromosome segregation process, is highly relevant for drug design. Mathematical and computational tools are very useful for studying the action of enzymes that change the topology of DNA. In this project such tools will be used to characterize all unlinking pathways and to reveal the mechanism of unlinking by Xer. The educational goal is to develop new and effective ways to disseminate knowledge related to DNA topology and its biological significance, as well as to increase public awareness of the critical role of mathematics in understanding biological processes. The proposed plans include the creation of Math Circles for elementary school children in San Francisco and the development of a series of educational materials for public consumption in collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences. This will culminate in the production of an exhibit on DNA topology for the general public in the California Academy of Sciences Museum."

Circa 1980, researchers developed a new topological quantum field theory which, as its nomenclature suggests, drew from both quantum physics and topology.  This new theory opened up exciting avenues for research, and in particular has allowed many mathematical theorems and constructions to find applications in physics, quantum computation, and beyond.

The central focus is the geometry and algebra of the mapping class group of a closed surface, specifically the geometric and algebraic behavior of subgroups and profinite completions of this group, and spaces upon which they act. Much of the project is viewed through the lens of hyperbolic geometry, whose theorems and techniques cast a seductive profile upon the mapping class group. The core of the project falls into three parts: (1) continuation of an ongoing project with C. Leininger, relevant to Gromov's Coarse Hyperbolization Problem, to understand convex cocompact subgroups of mapping class groups of surfaces; (2) continuation of a program of the PI, J. Brock, and C. Leininger to produce purely pseudo-Anosov surface subgroups of mapping class groups and surface bundles over surfaces with hyperbolic fundamental group; (3) work devoted to completion of M. Boggi's program to establish the congruence subgroup property for mapping class groups of surfaces, building upon prior work of the PI.<br/><br/>A moduli space is a collection of geometric objects that is itself a geometric object. A practical example is the collection of all possible arrangements of cell phone towers on the surface of the Earth.  One may use the distances between individual towers to define a distance between two arrangements of towers, and the collection of arrangements of towers becomes a geometric object itself, a ""space"" of arrangements. Geographical constraints limit the feasible configurations of towers, and understanding the geometry of the space of feasible configurations can have direct bearing on which configurations provide the best network coverage. The project is concerned with moduli spaces of hyperbolic manifolds, of which the space of configurations of cell phone towers on the Earth is a special example.  There is an intriguing analogy between moduli spaces of hyperbolic manifolds and the hyperbolic manifolds themselves.  In other words, there is a sense in which a collection of hyperbolic manifolds may be roughly considered a hyperbolic manifold itself, creating a sort of information feedback loop reciprocally informing the study of both the hyperbolic manifolds and their moduli spaces. It is this analogy that lies at the heart of the project."

This summer school will strengthen the ties between basic<br/>areas of theoretical mathematics. Mathematicians from<br/>underrepresented backgrounds will be vigorously recruited.<br/>Graduate students and post-docs will gain hands-on experience<br/>with some of the most important developments of contemporary<br/>mathematics, preparing them to be future leaders of the field.<br/>Participants will enlarge their professional networks, which is<br/>especially critical given the geographical distances faced by<br/>mathematicians in the western half of North America.

The homotopy theoretic construction of these invariants is related to properties of holomorphic Eisenstein series on unitary groups.  A geometric construction of these invariants will also be pursued, using higher dimensional field theories.  These geometric invariants, when regarded as invariants of framed manifolds, give rise to invariants of elements of the stable homotopy groups of spheres.  The arithmetic properties of such families of automorphic forms arising from periodic families in the stable homotopy groups of spheres will also be investigated. Similar analysis for unstable homotopy groups of spheres will be considered using Goodwillie calculus.  The PI also proposes an educational program to identify and develop diverse undergraduate talent at MIT through ROUTE partnerships (Reading Outreach for Undergraduate Talent Exploration).  These partnerships will pair MIT undergraduates who are interested in the mathematics major, but may not know what mathematicians do, with graduate student mentors to engage in semester long directed reading projects. These mentoring partnerships will be targeted to undergraduates who are members of underrepresented minority groups.  The PI will solicit undergraduate research projects from outstanding students completing the ROUTE program, some of which will advance his own research agenda.<br/><br/>The proposed research will advance our current understanding of geometry.  It will also link this new understanding to physics, as the proposed research involves generalizations of string theory.  As the proposed research involves using number theory to study geometry, it will associate new arithmetic structures to known geometric structures.  The ROUTE partnerships will create a pathway to tap the diverse talent pool represented by the MIT undergraduate population, and will attract a more diverse collection of individuals to pursue the mathematics major."

It allows for systematic stratification of objects in a hierarchical way that reveals invariants that satisfy `polynomial' local-to-global behavior.  Pioneered by Tom Goodwillie and Michael Weiss in the late 80's and early 90's, it is only more recently that the broad power of these methods has been becoming clear. Principal Investigators Arone, Ching, Dwyer, Kuhn, Lesh, and Turchin have all been involved in important discoveries in this area, which range from new results about the periodic homotopy of spheres, to giving new models for spaces of knots.  Operad Theory is another algebraic machine that has been developed to study systems of operations satisfying specified algebraic properties (associativity, commutativity, etc.) up to some sort of controlled deformation. The current work of the PIs has led to the emerging perspective that Functor Calculus has deep connections with the more studied Theory of Operads, and that one might be able to use equivariant homotopy methods to measure how much simpler the latter is than the the former. The range of application is also growing with the placement of Calculus within the broader context of Homotopical Algebra.<br/><br/>In Topology, one is studying geometric objects ranging from manifolds (higher dimensional versions of curves and surfaces) and knots, in the case of Geometric Topology, to spaces of continuous functions and structured rings up to deformation, in the case of Algebraic Topology. One studies such things by means of algebraic invariants.  Such invariants need to be computable, which in practice means that if a `global' object is built out of `local' pieces, there is some process that allows one to attempt to calculate the global invariant from the local invariants.  The purposes of this project are to (a) investigate the Calculus of Functors method of organizing and constructing such invariants, (b) to connect this to Operad Theory, the very important theory of algebraic operations, and (c) to bring these methods to a broad spectrum of mathematicians through workshops and a conference. The methods studied in this project should give new insights into many mathematical topics of ongoing and wide interest, ranging from topological complexity of algorithms to representation theory to topological field theory."

This topic and these methods have been central in Riemannian geometry since its conception, and have direct ties to problems and methods in geometric group theory. With regard to submanifolds, the PI seeks to further investigate the geometric data encoded by the primitive totally geodesic submanifolds of a fixed Riemannian n-manifold. The simplest case of 1-dimensional totally geodesic submanifolds is nothing more than the geodesic length spectrum and has garnered interest for more than 50 years. In addition, the geodesic length spectrum has strong connections with the eigenvalue spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and analysis on manifolds. In addition to this study, the PI plans on investigating which manifolds arise as totally geodesic submanifolds of a fixed Riemannian manifold. Two cases are locally symmetric manifolds of non-compact type and the moduli space of genus g curves with n marked points. In the latter case, most prominent are the Teichmuller curves and their associated fundamental groups Veech groups, which are interesting geometrically, algebro-geometrically, and dynamically. In addition, the PI seeks obstructions or special properties of submanifolds of a fixed manifold, not only in an effort to understand the fixed manifold but also to better understand obstructions to isometrically immersing manifolds into other manifolds. Lastly, the PI plans to investigate the asymptotic behavior of geometric counting functions, what geometric data is encoded by these functions, and ties to this topic outside of geometry. These function counting the totally geodesic manifolds of a fixed type as a function of volume and a basic entities, which in the simplest cases are known to have ties to geometric dynamics and applications to number theory.<br/><br/>The objects that arise in the present proposal permeate mathematics as fundamental examples tied to basic problems and areas. They were fathered not by mathematics but from pure and applied science. Moreover, over time, have been proven to be centrally important not only in mathematics but in physics, chemistry, and computer science. The PI hopes to foster further these important connections not only directly with specific results but also in disseminating the core ideaology of the PI's proposal."

The modern theory of singularities dates back to the 1960s, with the pioneering work of Thom, Hironaka, Brieskorn, Zariski, and many other renowed mathematicians. More recently, Singularity theory promoted vigorous interchanges among mathematical fields such as algebraic and geometric topology, algebraic geometry, number theory, and more applied fields such as the study of configurations in robot motion planning. An International Conference in Singularity Theory and Applications will be organized in Hefei, China, during July 25-31, 2011, and it will be hosted by the University of Science and Technology of China. The conference will be research-oriented, intended to disseminate recent developments, but it will also have a significant educational component, featuring introductory lectures so as to better strengthen connections among the assorted research groups represented and to provide access points for younger researchers and students.<br/><br/>In the last century, considerable effort has been directed towards studying manifolds - spaces that locally look uniform, at each point and in each direction. This effort has been immensely successful; a substantial part of our insight has been gained through the study of various invariants (e.g., characteristic numbers and classes), the surgery program, etc. In recent decades, topologists have studied ""singular"" spaces with increasing interest, due to their numerous occurrences and applications within pure mathematics (algebraic geometry, number theory) and outside pure mathematics (mathematical physics, robot motion planning). In contrast to a manifold, a singular space may locally look different from point to point. The study of topological properties of singular spaces developed into the field of Singularity theory. The proposed conference will focus around recent developments in this fast advancing field of research.<br/><br/>For more details about the conference, please see:<br/>http://www.math.wisc.edu/~maxim/conf/Hefei/Hefei.html"

Character varieties occur in many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. The Project combines several aspects of character varieties, involving in particular geometry, quantum topology and dynamical systems.  Its overarching thread is to capitalize on various techniques and insights that, over the years, have been developed for certain low-dimensional groups and to apply these to a wider range of Lie groups and problems. The Project is articulated along two main themes. The first theme involves classical geometry and is focused on the case where the Lie group is the special linear group. It proposes to analyze the so-called Hitchin component of the corresponding character variety. The second theme is centered on the quantization of character varieties. In particular, one of the main goals of the Project is to classify all representations of the Kauffman skein algebra. A final part of the Project is devoted to the 3-dimensional implications of this analysis of representations of the Kauffman skein algebra, and in particular to applications to the Volume Conjecture. <br/><br/>Many phenomena in mathematics and mathematical physics involve the mathematical notion of flat bundle over a surface or, equivalently, of homomorphisms from the fundamental group of a surface to a Lie group. In particular, the case where the Lie group consist of 2-by-2 matrices is now relatively well understood, because of its relationship to (non-euclidean) hyperbolic geometry. The thrust of the Project is to build on this expertise to attack more complicated Lie groups and to investigate more complex phenomena. It borrows ideas from the theory of dynamical systems (popularized under the name of ""chaos theory"") and from quantum field theory in physics."

The fundamental group of the knot complement is an important algebraic invariant, but is rarely abelian. Homology with local coefficients can be used to associate modules to the knot. Since modules are abelian groups, distinguishing them is still feasible. However, since these are often modules over noncommutative rings, some of the rich structure of the fundamental group is retained. These homology modules, as well as linking forms defined on them, have been used by myself and others to define isotopy invariants of knots and concordance invariants of knots. This project concerns using these noncommutative techniques in two areas of knot theory: knot concordance and knot Floer homology.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to use non-commutative algebra to better understand knotted curves in 3- and 4-dimensional space. The study of knots has important applications in biology and physics. For example, DNA strands are naturally knotted, but must unknot in order to replicate. Many mathematicians have used algebra to better understand how curves can knot, however the type of algebra considered is usually commutative. By employing non-commutative algebras, we can get a more refined understanding for how curves can knot in 3-dimensional space and bound surfaces in 4-dimensional space."

The faculty members who attend serve an essential role in both providing new ideas as well as probing the ideas of graduate students, suggesting ideas for future study, and encouraging students to meet and work with people interested in their areas of research. Graduate students who attend the BUGCAT are better equipped to find academic positions and continue research and collaboration. The conference also promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences, both by encouraging women and minorities to attend and by encouraging participation from a broad range of graduate programs.

Another project is to understand the procedure of group theoretic ""Dehn filling"" from the perspective of boundaries of hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups. Finally, the PI will study (again algorithmically) the class of ""virtually geometric"" words in free groups.<br/><br/>Three-manifolds are topological objects which are locally three-dimensional, like the spatial part of our universe.

It follows that all the topology (and geometry!) of a three-manifold is encoded in its fundamental group, which then can be studied using geometric and algorithmic group theory. One concrete product of this work will be software useful for exploring the class of three-manifold presentations."
