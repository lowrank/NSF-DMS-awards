More generally, the PI will investigate the Johnson filtration, which is a sequence of subgroups of the mapping class group starting with the Torelli group.  A major open question is whether or not Torelli groups are finitely presented or not.  The Pi would also like to understand how pseudo-Anosov dilatations are distributed among the terms of the Johnson filtration. Finally, the PI aims to find generating sets for terms of the Johnson filtration and related groups.<br/><br/>The mapping class group describes the symmetries of surfaces, or two-dimensional objects which are analogous to the three-dimensional space we live in.  The set of symmetries of an object is often most easily understood by using matrices.  In the case of the mapping class group, there is a natural way to use matrices to understand a large piece of the picture, but there is also a large amount of information that escapes detection by these matrices.  It is this mysterious part of the mapping class groups that the PI is studying.<br/><br/>"

One of the ways that topologists have been approaching these problems is through the use of invariants. In the recent years, ideas originated in physics, lead mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. The central theme of the PI's project is to understand the properties  of these invariants, using ideas from 3-dimensional topology  and geometry and from physics, and investigate the extent to which they distinguish knots and 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>"

This is a fundamental notion reflected in many ways both in nature (well known examples include structure of clouds, coastal shapes, plant branching patterns, etc.) and in mathematics (as a recursion, iteration, self-reference, renormalization, etc.). The notion of self-similarity was recently introduced into group theory through actions on rooted trees. The point of view of studying some aspects and some classes of groups through actions on rooted trees has proved to be rather fruitful, since it allows the introduction of many natural(visual) concepts and ideas, while simplifying the notation and presentation. In fact, it is precisely this shift in language that enabled better intuition and resulted in the ongoing explosion of insights, breakthroughs, and links to other areas of mathematics. The current research moves in many directions, reflecting the richness of the subject and its wide appeal and applicability (we can explain and relate in the language of self-similar groups some 2000 years old problems such as Chinese Rings, modern mathematical constructions such as groups of intermediate growth, and entirely new concepts such as iterated monodromy groups)."

Two dimensional field theories  are algebraic and analytic structures associated to geometric surfaces. String theories are averages or integrals of two dimensional field theories over all  surface geometries. In this project we study various two dimensional field  theories , their integrals and their common underlying structure. For example we  will study a supersymmetric refinement of the Atiyah-Segal-Witten notion of 2D field theories with a nontrivial internal stucture related to modular forms. The point here is to construct examples and relate these ideas to the topological modular form cohomology theory. We will explore a new infinity categorical version of  2D field theory. There are  many natural examples to investigate and categorifications of two dimensional theories relate to three dimensional topological quantum field theories. We intend to clarify the ""string topology"" two dimensional field theories associated to any ""target manifold"" . These theories feature a master equation solution, dX + X*X = 0, required to form the analogue of the string theory integral. The algebraic formalism resonates with the J holomorphic curves of symplectic topology. More generally, we will research the conceptual meaning of solutions to master equations, deformations of structures with duality, and the formalism  related  to multilinear functions or operations called correlators. <br/><br/><br/>The different parts of science and mathematics are woven together in a rich tapestry and this phenomenon is well illustrated by the above. The studies of this project will impact  a wide range of younger researchers in the universities as well as PhD students and undergraduates. Other impacts might  eventually include improved technology. Practical applications by scientists are sometimes accidental like penicillin and  synthetic rubber. Sometimes however, like the discovery of transistors and microelectronics, they depend on a deep understanding of subjects like quantum theory. A very speculative application of a deeper understanding of two dimensional quantum field theory, the subject of this project,  could be  to  the physical realization of quantum computers. One knows quantum computers can theoretically solve problems not known to be solved theoretically by non quantum computing systems. One such problem is the theoretical possibility of cracking the factorization part of the security systems used by  financial systems  and  government agencies. The technical difficulties to realizing quantum computers can be recast according to  Michael Freedman, using the three dimensional topological theories alluded to above. Furthermore the relationship of these three dimensional theories with two dimensional theories suggests a direction to look to solve the technical difficulties: the  experimental physics that takes place in two dimensions, the very active area of condensed matter research.  There is an opportunity just now to organize these different perspectives and energies of the participants of the project into a coherent campaign to illuminate the area. The circle of ideas from two dimensional field theory, string theory, and deformations of structures with duality may very well become an  important organizing center for twenty first century mathematics in the way that topology influenced the twentieth century."

A first goal is to obtain explicite estimates of geometric data in terms of topological and combinatorial information such as the rank of the fundamental group of the Heegaard genus of the manifold. The second goal is to use these geometric information to reconstruct, under suitable assumptions, the hyperbolic metric itself.<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is a mathematical object of fundamental interest.

A certain amount of information is lost in the process. The goal of the project is to quantify how much information actually gets lost. Obtaining concrete a priori estimates is then crucial. For example, they open the door to predictions in terms of finite models of phenomena occurig in 3-manifolds. <br/>Surprisingly, it seems very likely that in many situations sufficiently precise a priori estimates will allow to recover all the geometric information.

Linear groups have been very well studied and appear everywhere in mathematics, physics, and computer science. Because matrices are relatively easy to understand, it is productive when studying a particular group to understand how closely it resembles a linear group. The PI is involved in developing the theory for Mod(S) and Out(F) by understanding possible obstructions to their being linear groups, as well as understanding the extent to which they behave and can be considered like linear groups.

The work already underway gives a new theoretical description of this class, by relating it to combinatorial constructions originating in group theory and the theory of mapping class groups of handlebodies. This description yields a unique procedure to construct any knot tunnel, and even a numerical parameterization of all the tunnels of all tunnel number 1 knots. It provides the foundation for a new level of investigation in this area, with many directions being pursued in ongoing research. Additional work with several other investigators will examine questions about minimal triangulations of 3-manifolds, and at least in its initial stages will develop software to examine large collections of examples.<br/><br/>Because of its connections with numerous other mathematical areas, and its relevance to the 3-dimensional space in which we live, 3-dimensional topology has been a vigorous area of research for many decades.

The work underway develops new connections between tunnel number 1 knots and certain disk complexes and curve complexes, which are objects of much recent interest in low-dimensional topology and Teichmuller theory. As basic research in a pure theoretical discipline, the work does not envision immediate applications to science or technology.

The second part of the project consists in bringing<br/>together algebraic geometric and symplectic methods to construct<br/>a full solution to the so-called Quantum Master Equation in<br/>Gromov-Witten theory. This equation describes the topology of the<br/>moduli spaces of holomorphic curves and relevant algebraic<br/>structures, providing important invariants in symplectic and<br/>algebraic geometry. The third part of the project aims at lifting<br/>Gromov-Witten theory to the (Floer) chain level and developing a<br/>combinatorial version of Gromov-Witten theory, thus bridging the<br/>areas of enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic Floer theory,<br/>and graph homology. The last, SFT part of the project will result<br/>in constructing a new compactification of the moduli space of<br/>Riemann surfaces, which would govern the algebraic operations and<br/>invariants arising in SFT.  This compactification will be an SFT<br/>analogue of the Deligne-Mumford compactification relevant to<br/>Gromov-Witten theory.<br/><br/>The project aims at discovering and studying new algebraic<br/>structures in topology suggested or motivated by mathematical<br/>physics, in particular, string theory, Symplectic Field Theory,<br/>and Gromov-Witten theory.  Another long-term goal is to build a<br/>bridge between several mathematical cultures working on problems<br/>related to mathematical physics.

The second scenario is when the target group is the mapping class group of S, an orientable surface of finite-type.<br/>If B is a nice space, then the set of (isomorphism classes of) S-bundles over B is naturally parametrised by (conjugacy classes of) homomorphisms from the fundamental group of B to the mapping class group of S.

In particular, calculus of functors produces a certain sequence of spaces which captures all the information about a relatively new class of knot invariants called finite type knot invariants.  These invariants have been found to connect in intricate ways to other areas of topology and geometry, as well as physics.

The PI believes he can make some progress on this conjecture since the calculus of functors provides a new, powerful, promising tool with which this problem can be attacked.  More generally, the PI plans to build on the work he and his collaborators have already accomplished concerning a complete topological description of spaces of embeddings of a manifold in a Euclidean space with suitable restrictions on dimensions.  In particular, he expects to be able to show the collapse of a certain spectral sequence which computes the homotopy of these embedding spaces, to extend certain integrals to more general spaces of knots in order to generalize finite type invariants, and establish a variety of foundational technical results of wide importance and variety of uses. <br/><br/>Knots are some of the most interesting objects of study in topology both because they are easy to define and visualize and because they are of interest to physicists, chemists, etc.  Some fundamental questions about knots, such as their classification, or construction of efficient ways of telling them apart (i.e. finding good knot invariants), still generate a wealth of exciting research.  One of the main objectives of this project is to further the understanding of knot theory by studying it through the relatively new technique of calculus of functors.  It turns out, however, that the methods used in this theory are quite general and extend beyond knots to larger classes of topological spaces.

The first problem is completing our understanding of the deformation space of hyperbolic structures on open 3-manifolds and describing the geometry of such structures. This problem has been the subject of many studies started by Bill Thurston and followed by Bonahon, Canary, Minsky, Brock and others. Their work provided very interesting results especially in the case of incompressible boundary 3-manifolds. However such a nice description does not exist in general for hyperbolic structures on other 3-manifolds and in particular handlebodies. Namazi will focus on deepening our understanding of this general case. The second problem deals with the geometry of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A very fundamental problem in the subject is to describe the geometry of a hyperbolic manifold and find a recipe to construct a very accurate approximation for the hyperbolic metric. These two problems are very closely related to each other and in earlier work Namazi was able to construct models for the geometry of a large class of hyperbolic structures on handlebodies and this was used to construct accurate approximations of the hyperbolic metric on a family of closed 3-manifolds. The hope is to extend this to a broader set of closed 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is an object, which looks like the regular Euclidean 3-dimensional space around every point. The problem of classifying 3-manifolds has been one of the fundamental questions in mathematics, which perhaps started by Poincare's work and conjecture in the early twentieth century. Thurston pushed the subject much further and conjectured that understanding and classifying hyperbolic 3-manifolds results in a classification of all 3-manifolds. The recent development of the subject in the last few years has brought us closer than ever to see a complete proof of Thurston's conjecture. A consequence of this classification is the fact that these fundamental objects have an almost canonical shape. What remains unanswered is a description of this shape and this is the major subject that Namazi will try to address in this project. Similar to his earlier work he also expects that such a description makes it possible to answer many unanswered questions in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.<br/><br/>"

For many application this space is more important than the uncompactified moduli space, and a homotopy theoretic understanding should be fruitful.  In particular, the proposer will study applications to Gromov-Witten theory.<br/><br/>A manifold is a general notion of space.  Manifolds are fundamental in geometry, topology, analysis, and other areas of mathematics.  In physics, they are the underlying geometric structure in Einstein's general theory of relativity, and play fundamental roles in mechanics, quantum field theory, and probably many other areas.  Studying manifolds from a mathematical perspective can be done in two ways: You can study the geometric properties each manifold, one at a time, or you can study geometric properties of the collection of all manifolds at once.  The ""collection of all manifolds"" can itself be thought of as a kind of space, and each individual manifold is a point in this space.  This space is an example of a moduli space, and the current project aims at understanding geometric and topological properties of this moduli space and its variations.<br/>"

This technology is already well-developed for Mod(S), but relies heavily on metric properties of Teichmueller Space and the complex of curves. Analogues of these objects for Out(F) are very recent and not yet well-understood, and it is one of the PI's long term goals to probe their geometry via the dynamics of the constructed automorphisms.<br/><br/><br/>The mapping class group is important to many areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, geometric group theory, and low-dimensional topology, and it also plays an important role in recent developments in theoretical physics. A successful program for studying the mapping class group Mod(S) and its relative, the automorphism group Out(F) of a free group, is based on their relationship to linear groups, i.e., groups consisting of matrices. Linear groups have been very well studied and appear everywhere in mathematics, physics, and computer science. Because matrices are relatively easy to understand, it is productive when studying a particular group to understand how closely it resembles a linear group. The PI is involved in developing the theory for Mod(S) and Out(F) by understanding possible obstructions to their being linear groups, as well as understanding the extent to which they behave and can be considered like linear groups.

The principal topics are the study of immersed surfaces in 3-manifolds, maps between hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The most ambitious aspect of the project involves the virtual Haken conjecture, which is equivalent to showing that hyperbolic 3-manifolds have a finite-sheeted cover which contains an embedded pi_1-injective surface. The PI would like to relate this to the virtual fibering conjecture of Thurston, which states that a hyperbolic 3-manifold has a finite-sheeted cover which fibers over the circle, and implies the virtual Haken conjecture. The PI would like to show that Haken 3-manifolds are homotopy equivalent to a compact CAT(0) cube complex. Next, the PI would like to show that fundamental groups of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are LERF. This would follow if Gromov-hyperbolic groups are residually finite, although this is believed to be false by many geometric group theorists. Following a program of Haglund and Wise, these conjectures would imply that a Haken hyperbolic manifold has fundamental group which virtually embeds in a right-angled reflection group. This in turn would imply that these manifolds virtually fiber by previous work of the PI. The PI also plans to investigate the volumes of hyperbolic Haken manifolds, and how various topological restrictions on the manifold give rise to lower bounds on volume. For example, the PI would like to understand the asymptotic behavior of the volumes of orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds with n cusps.<br/><br/><br/>The mathematical study of 3-dimensional spaces goes back to the work of Poincare. Because classical physics describes our universe to be a 3-dimensional space, the classification of 3-dimensional spaces is an important mathematical endeavor, since it may have ramifications for the global structure of our universe. Recently, this classification was spectacularly achieved by Perelman, using Hamilton's Ricci flow, who resolved Thurston's geometrization conjecture, and as a consequence the Poincare conjecture, which goes back 100 years. The geometrization conjecture implies that any finite 3-dimensional space has a canonical decomposition into geometric pieces, the most interesting of which are hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Mathematicians studying 3-manifolds are still sorting out the implications of Perelman's work and of the geometrization conjecture. This project will pursue various aspects of the ramifications of the geometrization conjecture. The principal and most ambitious project will study 2-dimensional objects inside of 3-dimensional spaces, especially the hyperbolic ones, which satisfy certain strong topological restrictions. Studying these 2-dimensional objects has implications for the global structure of finite 3-dimensional spaces. The project also aims to study the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and in particular understand the simplest such manifolds and how their geometric properties (such as volume) relate to their topological properties, such as how many components of the boundary."

One knows quantum computers can theoretically solve problems not known to be solved theoretically by non quantum computing systems. One such problem is the theoretical possibility of cracking the factorization part of the security systems used by financial systems and government agencies. The technical difficulties to realizing quantum computers can be recast according to Michael Freedman, using the three dimensional topological theories alluded to above.

This project has several different aspects.  One is to solve the connected sum problem -- when is a manifold which is homotopy equivalent to a connected sum itself a connected sum?  Another is to provide a strengthening of the Farrell- Jones Conjecture in L-theory, similar to that achieved by Davis-Khan- Ranicki in K-theory.  Yet another is to classify involutions on a torus, using the computation of the L-theory of the infinite dihedral group and the proof of the Farrell-Jones Conjecture in L-theory for crystallographic groups, joint with Connolly.

These invariants were described combinatorially, their relation to classical 3-dimensional topology was mysterious, and the only conceptual explanation for their existence came from physics: Witten constructed a family of topological quantum field theories, whose path integral partition functions were conjectured to coincide with quantum invariants. Recently, Khovanov, Ozsvath ans Szabo discovered the categorification of polynomial link invariants: to a link one associates a chain complex of graded vector spaces, whose graded Euler characteristic coincides with a given polynomial invariant. Also, to a cobordism between two links one associates a chain map between the link categorification complexes. Most of the known categorification constructions are either combinatorial or `semi-combinatorial' and their intrinsic 3-dimensional origin remains mysterious. The goal of this proposal is to extend the categorification to a wider class of link polynomial invariants and, more importantly, to the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of 3-manifolds. Rozansky suggests two approaches to this problem. First, he intends to use combinatorial methods based upon commutative algebra (matrix factorizations) and upon the topology of virtual links. These methods have shown promise in the categorification of the HOMFLYPT and SO(2N) Kauffman polynomials. The second approach is based on the methods of quantum field theory. Categorification implies that Witten's Chern-Simons theory is a dimensional reduction of a yet unknown 4-dimensional theory. The candidate theories were considered in the papers of Gukov, Kapustin and Witten, but the correct theory has not been found yet. A construction of this topological quantum field theory may lead to combinatorial categorification constructions for link and manifold invariants. It should also provide a conceptual explanation for the existence of cobordism invariants. <br/><br/><br/><br/>3-dimensional topology deals with classification of knots, links and 3-dimensional surfaces. The main approach to this problem is to construct topological invariants, that is, the numbers or polynomials that can be assigned to a topological object, computed readily from its presentation (say, from the picture of a knot) and used to distinguish these objects. A major breakthrough it 3-dimensional topology came about 25 years ago with the discovery of a wide variety of the so-called quantum invariants.<br/>Surprisingly, these invariants were rooted in physics: they come from a special kind of a 3-dimensional quantum field theory. Thus quantum invariants provide an important bridge between topology and advanced physical theories. A more recent development came in the form of categorification: it turned out that quantum invariants were just dimensions of special vector spaces associated with topological objects. From the physics point of view, this means that the 3-dimensional quantum field theory describing quantum invariants is the dimensional reduction of the yet unknown 4-dimensional theory (the idea of dimensional reduction is familiar in string theory which requires a 9-dimensional space, 6 extra dimensions being wrapped up tightly in order to make them invisible for a general observer). Rozansky proposes to search for the 4-dimensional physical theory related to categorification and to use the topology-physics relation in order to get a better understanding of both fields of science."

Dennis Gaitsgory will mentor the 2008 Talbot workshop, Affine Lie Algebras and Chiral Structures, which will focus on geometric approaches to the representation theory of affine Lie algebras and quantum groups using Beilinson and Drinfeld's theory of chiral algebras. Chiral algebras are certain structured D-modules on curves that encode the data of the operator product expansion of a conformal field theory; they provide a flexible geometric analogue of the theory of vertex algebras for describing the symmetries of conformal field theories. In recent work of Gaitsgory and Jacob Lurie, the theory of chiral algebras has been combined with ideas of homotopy theory and higher category theory to produce important new results in geometric representation theory. A particular focus of the workshop will be some of this work, in particular Gaitsgory-Lurie's derived version of the geometric Satake equivalence and a formulation of geometric Langlands duality for quantum groups.<br/><br/>The Talbot workshops seek to introduce aspiring mathematicians to active areas of mathematical research, foster community and collaboration across subdisciplinary and institutional lines, and form pedagogical and research ties between established mathematicians and young researchers. The topic for Talbot 2008 concerns the mathematical study of the symmetries that exist in fundamental physical theories. Understanding the structure of these symmetries lead to understanding the conservation principles, such as the conservation of energy, that define physical theories. The study of symmetries from recent quantum physics have led to new algebraic structures defining these symmetries. The 2008 workshop will introduce participants to recent work on these algebraic structures. The workshop will bring together graduate students and junior faculty with different specialties and from many universities to spend a week focused on this important subject. The participants and their mentor, Dennis Gaitsgory, will share a residence as well as lectures, discussions, and meals. This informal atmosphere, mixing fellowship and intellectual interest, will promote a concentrated study of the material and lay the foundation for future collaboration and research.<br/>"

The first strand centers on the ``Symplectic Poincare Conjecture,?? a question about whether or not the topological space of the complex projective plane has a unique smooth structure that supports a symplectic form. The second strand centers on a question first posed by C. Taubes: if the product space of a 3-manifold and a circle admits a symplectic form, does the 3-manifold fiber over a circle? Baldridge?s previous work in each strand has formed and influenced his work in the other--the two strands are deeply connected. <br/>The research in this proposal would investigate the following questions related to the conjectures above: (1) Which manifolds with small Euler characteristic admit smooth exotic structures? Which of those exotic structures admit a symplectic form? (2) Are there criteria under which a symplectic 4-manifold is (up to diffeomorphism) uniquely defined by its topological data? (3) What interesting phenomena occur in the geography problem as one gets close to the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau line? (4) Which circle bundles over a fibered 3-manifold admit a symplectic form?<br/><br/>A 3-manifold is a space that locally looks like the familiar space in which we live. If one imagines replacing every point in the 3-manifold with a circle of points in a nice way, one gets an example of a 4-manifold with a circle action. Here `action' means a rotation of the space along each circle. Four manifolds with circle actions have many nice periodic and symmetry properties, which makes them particularly suitable for modeling and testing physical theories. (For example, the space-time universe we live in is an example of a 4-manifold which may have a circle action.) These manifolds are especially useful for modeling if they also have a symplectic structure--a key ingredient in almost all the equations of classical and quantum physics. Baldridge will investigate the shapes of symplectic 4-manifolds with circle actions and of 4-manifolds in general. This investigation is done by constructing new examples of smooth and symplectic 4-manifolds and by distinguishing 4-manifolds from each other by relating invariant features of a 4-manifold to the number of solutions of certain systems of nonlinear partial differential equations on that manifold. In addition to his research work in mathematics, Baldridge will strive to help the next generation of U.S. citizens learn mathematics through his work on three projects. The first project is to complete a comprehensive college curriculum for prospective elementary and middle school teachers. The second is to bring outstanding mathematicians to Louisiana State University to be ``Scholars in Residence?? to interact with participants in a new professional Master?s degree program for teachers. The final project is professional development for teachers in a high-need school district that has the potential to create a replicable model for building high-performing mathematics programs in high-need schools.<br/>"

Both concordance of knots, and the motivating goal of understanding singularities remain central to topology and algebraic geometry.  A conference at Brandeis University will be held on June 2-5, 2008, to bring together a variety of researchers and students in geometric topology whose work connects to this fundamental idea.

A substantial number of young investigators will be invited to give them exposure, broaden their perspective, and allow them to get to know each other and the more senior members of these fields.

By closed, one means that if one travels along the curve, originating from any point on the curve, one eventually returns to the point of origin.  A foundational subject to the field of topology, knot theory interacts with important areas in geometry, biology, and physics as well.  The Knot concordance group measures wrinkles, or singularities, of surfaces in four dimensional space, and through this connection, enlightens our understanding of four dimensional shapes.

Etnyre<br/><br/>The focus of this proposal is to better understand the intriguing<br/>nature of contact structures in all (odd) dimensions, with<br/>special attention given to dimension three and to apply contact<br/>geometric techniques to questions in topology. The first main<br/>theme of the proposed research is open book decompositions. The<br/>connection of contact geometry and these specially fibered links<br/>have provided a fount of information concerning contact<br/>structures and low-dimensional topology. As part of this proposal<br/>this fundamental connection will be exploited to define and study<br/>new invariants of contact structures and special knots in them -<br/>specifically, Legendrian and transversal knots. From prior work<br/>it is clear these invariants have subtle connections to the famed<br/>tight vs. overtwisted dichotomy in dimension three and properties<br/>of symplectic fillings of contact structures, which in turn are<br/>crucial to applications to topology. Some of the major outcomes<br/>expected from this part of the project are various classification<br/>results for Legendrian and transversal knots in tight and<br/>overtwisted contact structures and a better understanding of the<br/>fundamental process of contact surgery. The project will also<br/>study the connection between contact structures and open books in<br/>high dimensions with the goal of illuminating existence questions<br/>in high dimensions and trying to generalize the notion of<br/>overtwistedness here as well. Similar to the connection with open<br/>books, contact structures are also related to foliations. This<br/>connection has been instrumental in applications of contact<br/>geometry to low-dimensional topology. Many of the outstanding<br/>questions concerning this connection will be explored. A second<br/>main theme of the proposal is the development and analysis of<br/>Legendrian contact homology in higher dimensions. There is a<br/>great deal of beautiful analytic and algebraic structure in this<br/>theory, much of which is yet to be discovered. Moreover, through<br/>the elegant conormal construction one can then use this to define<br/>invariants of manifolds and of their embeddings in Euclidean<br/>space.  These invariants appear to be extremely powerful and will<br/>be thoroughly investigated.<br/><br/>Contact structures on manifolds are very natural objects, born<br/>over two centuries ago, as a natural language for geometric<br/>optics, thermodynamics and classical mechanics. Everyday, one<br/>encounters contact structures when parallel parking a car,<br/>skating, or watching the prismatic play of light in a glass of<br/>water. Contact structures have been studied by many<br/>mathematicians and seem to touch on diverse areas of mathematics<br/>and physics, but only recently have they moved into the<br/>foreground of mathematics. This is due to the many remarkable<br/>breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and<br/>beautiful theory with many far reaching applications to areas<br/>such as three and four dimensional topology (that is the<br/>structure of space and space- time), string theory and large N<br/>dualities in modern physics, and fluid dynamics. The Principal<br/>Investigator will study the relation between contact geometry and<br/>various topological objects (such as open book decompositions and<br/>foliations). In addition he will develop analytic and algebraic<br/>tools for studying contact structures in high dimensions. As a<br/>whole it is expected that at the conclusion of this project we<br/>will have a much better understanding of contact structures in<br/>all dimensions and see many more surprising implications for low-<br/>dimensional manifolds.<br/>"

In particular the Volume conjecture that claims a deep relationship between the Jones polynomial of cablings of the knot on one side and the hyperbolic volume of the knot complement on the other side led to a new point of view. The topics of the project are inspired by the Volume conjecture. The scope is to gain a better understanding of both the colored Jones polynomial and the hyperbolic volume. In earlier works of the principal investigator and his collaborators it was shown that bounds for the hyperbolic volume of certain classes of knots can be read off from coefficients of the colored Jones polynomial. This made it interesting to study the leading and trailing coefficients of the colored Jones polynomial. Under certain conditions on the knot there seems to be an infinite polynomial, depending on the knot,  whose first n coefficients agree with the first n coefficients of the colored Jones polynomial at color n of that knot. The nature of these infinite polynomials as well as their number theoretical properties will be studied. Part of the project will also be to find a better topological understanding of the colored Jones polynomial. For this, earlier work of the principle investigator and his collaborators will be used that interprets the regular Jones polynomial as a state sum over subgraphs of a graph, embedded on an oriented surface, that is assigned to each knot diagram. Thus, every state is equipped with three parameters, the third being the genus of the subgraph.<br/><br/><br/>It has a long and fruitful tradition to study objects that are embedded in three dimensional space, e.g. knots, via their projections on a plane. However, information about the original object is lost and additional information is needed to indicate which arc of the knot is farther away from the projection plane. By projecting on other surfaces more information about the original object can be preserved. These projections will be used to gain understanding of the topological and geometrical properties of knot invariants like the Jones polynomial.<br/>"

They will study problems related to the geometric characterization of random structures, such as topological invariants of excursion (nodal) sets of random fields and learning the homotopy and  homeomorphism types of manifolds in the presence of noise and developing techniques for quantifying the statistical accuracy of  the resulting estimates. Whereas previous work on random field geometry has concentrated on characteristics coming from differential topology, such as Lipshitz-Killing curvatures (which include the Euler characteristic) this project will concentrate on characteristics coming from algebraic topology, involving homology-invariant concepts such as the number of connected components, Betti numbers, and other related invariants. Furthermore, while previous work in these areas was in the setting of Riemannian manifolds, it is planned to extend this to allowing  non-Riemannian metrics even on smooth manifolds. In manifold learning this is important due to the fact that in some applications  natural measures of closeness underlying the context of a data set can well be non-Riemannian. In the context of random fields, it may open new doors in the study of purely non-Gaussian fields, such as stable fields, where the natural geometry on the parameter manifold induced by the field is  non-Riemannian.<br/><br/>The motivation for this project, which links algebraic topology, probability, and pure and applied statistics comes from both its intrinsic mathematical interest and from a wealth of applications, from areas as broadly spaced as the statistical analysis of fMRI brain images, high dimensional data analysis in computer science, and cosmological projects such as the COBE and WMAP experiments and the Sloan digital sky survey.

Given a ring or S-algebra A, the topological Hochschild homology spectrum THH(A) carries a circle action. The topological cyclic homology spectrum TC(A) is defined in terms of the fixed points of THH(A) under finite subgroups of the circle, and there is a map from the algebraic K-theory spectrum K(A) to TC(A) which is often close to an equivalence. We are especially interested in trying to understand K(ku) using this approach. Here ku is the connective spectrum for complex K-theory, and the spectrum K(ku) models algebraic K-theory of the category of 2-vector bundles. There is a corresponding spectrum K(ko) for real 2-vector bundles, and we can ask if the canonical map from K(ko) to K(ku) is close to being a Galois extension. This is a higher chromatic analogue of the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjecture. We also want to take the S^1-action on THH(A) more seriously and study the RO(S^1)-graded homotopy groups of the various fixed points of THH(A). These groups enter in the calculation of algebraic K-theory of truncated polynomial rings. A good understanding of the de Rham-Witt complex has been very useful in calculations, and we would like to be able to define the RO(S^1)-graded version of the de Rham-Witt complex.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In algebraic topology there is a world of ``brave new rings'', technically known as S-algebras, which combines the worlds of algebra and topology. In this world we can use techniques from topology, a branch of geometry, and from algebra. Topological Hochschild homology is the generalization of Hochschild homology to this setting. Hochschild homology is a standard construction in algebra which has proven to be very useful, and topological Hochschild homology has already been used to solve some previously unsolved questions in algebra. For example, given a ring A, the algebraic K-theory K(A) captures much of the arithmetic and number theory of A. The Hochschild homology HH(A) gives a (poor) approximation to K(A), while the topological Hochschild homology THH(A) together with some extra structure gives a much better approximation to K(A). Hence the study of topological Hochschild homology ultimately gives insight into arithmetic and number theory, as well as geometry and topology. The project studies several aspects of topological Hochschild homology, some foundational and some calculational. We also go further, studying generalizations of topological Hochshcild homology and its relative, topological Hochschild cohomology. These generalizations have no algebraic analogue."

It is anticipated that<br/>as a result of this meeting, progress can be expected in the<br/>directions of producing analytic geometric structures on singular<br/>spaces, the quasi-isometric theory of groups, and characteristic<br/>classes.<br/><br/>Many of the basic ideas of analysis and geometry are based on the<br/>idea of linear approximation.  The first example of this is<br/>calculus itself where linear approximation defines the basic<br/>notion of the derivative.  A more modern example is the idea of a<br/>manifold in topology, which is a space that is, in small regions,<br/>well approximated by Euclidean space.  Countless further<br/>developments have shown the need for more general tools to deal<br/>with situations where such approximations are not feasible or may<br/>not exist.  By bringing together workers who have dealt with<br/>these issues in varied contexts, this conference will spur the<br/>development of new syntheses and bring to the fore common issues<br/>that arise in completely different settings.

In addition, 27 talks by graduate students, run in parallel sessions, will be delivered. The grant is primarily to provide travel assistance for participants and speakers. The conference will run two days and provide ample opportunities for informal discussions and new introductions to occur. Historically, these conferences have provided an excellent opportunity for positive support and fruitful collaborations to begin. The result has often been to increase student's success rate both in school and during the critical transition soon after finishing ones doctorate. Because of the traditionally high participation rate among usually under represented demographics at these conferences combined with the conferences effectiveness as an aid to students during a critical transition period, partially supporting the approximately 160 participants is an effective investment in the science.<br/><br/>The Graduate Student Topology Conference is a two-day event in which graduate students from across the country meet to share their work, gain experience presenting at conferences, and hear from some of the most distinguished geometry and topology professors in the nation. Now in its sixth year, the conference draws around 160 graduate students from across the United States. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will be hosting the conference in 2008, with grant funds primarily aimed at providing travel assistance for participants. The conference consists of twenty-seven talks given by graduate students, in addition to two plenary talks by visiting professors; this year the plenary talks are given by Mike Hopkins from Harvard University and Yael Karshon from the University of Toronto. Through its unique combination of research and expository talks, the Graduate Student Topology Conference creates a supportive environment to encourage future researchers and to allow them to make contacts amongst one-another that can lead to future collaboration. Additionally, the experience of presenting at a conference allows speakers to refine their speaking skills and grow into more effective communicators. The conference also encourages communication among different geographic regions. Participants come from very diverse schools all across the country and include graduate students at all years of study with a high participation rate among usually under represented demographics.<br/>"

The conference is being organized by Delaram Kahrobaei and Victoria Gitman of the NYCCT, who successfully organized the 2006 meeting. The conference will consist of invited talks by women mathematicians, a poster session by graduate and undergraduate women students, and a panel discussion of issues affecting women in mathematics. <br/><br/>The meeting will be in the fields of algebra, combinatorics, and logic, with added emphasis on interdisciplinary research and establishing connections between mathematics and computer science. The organizers will focus on the areas of combinatorial, geometric, and computational group theory, applications of model theory to algebra and combinatorics, computational complexity, and set theory. All these areas are relatively new to mathematics. They have developed in response to the deep interconnections discovered in the last century between theoretical mathematics, algorithmic processes, and formalizing our notions of information. Because these areas are so young and so wide in scope and application, the most fascinating questions still remain to be answered. These questions will determine how theoretical mathematics and the world of modern technology will reinforce each other in the near future.  The first objective of the conference is to advance our knowledge in these areas by supporting women mathematicians who work in them and promoting research collaboration among them. The second more global aim of the conference is to increase the participation of women in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The research proposed addresses these basic questions using a variety of techniques: combinatorial, geometric, algebraic and analytical.  This breadth, and the classical nature of the questions being asked, means that the proposal connects several mathematical subfields, in particular geometric group theory and the topics of lattices, rigidity, buildings, and algebraic and Kac-Moody groups.  In analogy with Bass-Serre theory, used for studying tree lattices, the theory of complexes of groups and their coverings is used as a powerful tool for studying lattices in automorphism groups of higher-dimensional complexes.<br/><br/>Lattices arise as discrete sets of symmetries of many spaces, and are important in physics and chemistry.  The PI is interested in lattices which consist of symmetries of polyhedral complexes, that is, spaces constructed by gluing together polyhedra.

This research also connects several areas of mathematics, in particular geometric group theory and the topics of buildings, linear algebraic groups, and Kac-Moody theory."

For space-time dimensions d=0,1,2 there are now well-defined notions of (d|1)- dimensional Euclidean field theories over a manifold X. For d=0 these are provably closed differential forms and for d=1 one obtains K- theory of X by taking concordance classes. It is conjectured that the case d=2 leads to the long desired geometrical/physical interpretation of classes in the universal elliptic cohomology theory of ""topological modular forms"" of Hopkins, Miller and Lurie. Evidence for this conjecture comes from the recently proven fact that the partition function of a (2|1)-dimensional Euclidean field theory is an integral modular form.<br/><br/>Both parts of the project relate methods from theoretical physics and mathematics. In the early 20th century, mathematical notions (like Riemannian geometry or functional analysis) were successfully used to explain physical theories (like relativity theory or quantum mechanics). In the second part of that century, the roles were somewhat reversed in that surprising predictions, mathematically provable only in very rare instances, were made by modern theoretical physics using notions like that of a quantum field theory. It is of ultimate importance for mathematical research to incorporate such notions into the body of well understood theories, hence providing both, progress in mathematics and a precise formulation of the basics of the physical theories. This project contributes to this goal via a particular relation between certain quantum field theories and some well understood cohomology theories in mathematics.<br/>"

The fundamental group of the manifold is an important algebraic invariant, but is rarely abelian. On the other hand, since the homology groups of the manifold are abelian, they can be classified easily.<br/>Unfortunately, a lot of the rich structure of the fundamental group is lost when considering the homology groups. Homology with local coefficients associates modules to the manifold. Since modules are abelian groups, distinguishing them is still tenable. Furthermore, since these are often modules over noncommutative rings, some of the rich structure of the fundamental group is retained. These homology modules, as well as linking forms defined on them, have been used to define algebraic invariants of knot complements, 3-manifolds, and algebraic curve complements. These have led to new results about knot concordance, obstructions to the existence of symplectic structures on the product of a 3-manifold with the circle, and restrictions on which groups can be realized as the fundamental group of an algebraic curve complement. The goal of this project is to use these noncommutative techniques to find answers to questions related to three particular areas of low-dimensional topology: knot Floer homology, the topology of algebraic curve complements, and the structure of the knot concordance group.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to use non-commutative algebra to better understand knotted curves and surfaces. The study of knotted curves and surfaces has important applications in biology and physics. For example, DNA strands are naturally knotted, but must unknot in order to replicate. Also understanding knotted surfaces is fundamental to understanding the shape of the universe. Many mathematicians have used algebra to better understand how curves and surfaces can knot, however the type of algebra considered is usually commutative. By employing non-commutative algebras, we can get a more refined understanding for how curves and surfaces can knot.<br/><br/>"

The  Farrell-Jones conjecture states that  the algebraic K-theory of the integral group ring of Gamma comes from the algebraic K-theory of the virtually cyclic subgroups of Gamma.  This conjecture has been proven for large classes of groups, and leads to very concrete calculations. In this project we will use this conjecture to compute the lower algebraic K-groups of the following groups: hyperbolic n-simplex reflection groups, hyperbolic reflection groups, certain co-compact lattices in semi-simple real Lie groups of R-rank 2 and three-dimensional crystallographic groups (for all of these groups the conjecture is well known).

In topology, surgery theory is the name given to a collection of techniques used to produce one manifold from another in a controlled fashion. Surgery refers to cutting out parts of the manifold and replacing it with a part of another manifold, matching up along the cut or boundary. With the development of this theory in the 1960's, many problems in high dimensional topology, in particular the classification of high dimensional manifolds,  were found to have obstructions in (and were often classified by) the algebraic K-theory of the integral group ring of the fundamental group Gamma of the manifold being studied.  As such, it is of great interest to obtain computations of these K groups for various groups Gamma."

Our techniques are inspired by Zlil Sela's geometric approach to the Tarski problem. The second project is with Michael Handel. We propose to build on our previous work in order to solve the conjugacy problem for outer automorphism groups of free groups. Finally, for the third project Bestvina and I propose to carry out a scheme we have for showing that outer automorphism groups of free groups don't contain any higher rank lattices.<br/><br/>Geometric group theory is an exciting and relatively young area of mathematics. The general idea is to take a problem from an another area of mathematics (most often algebra), translate the problem into geometric terms, and then use the methods of geometry to solve it. An illustrative example of this process is how we teach addition to elementary school students. The set of numbers (an algebraic object) is interpreted as the set of points on a line (a geometric object) and addition by say two (an algebraic operation) is interpreted as a shift to the right by two units (a geometric transformation).

Famous examples of this type of operations are String Topology and Gromov-Witten theory. The latter yields operations on the cohomology of a variety while the former provides operations on the homology of the loop space of a compact manifold.<br/>Additionally, the PI will use other methods and techniques such as operads, (quasi-)Hopf algebras, representation theory, category theory, moduli spaces, vertex operator algebras and cosimplicial sets in his analysis. Concretely based on his previous work, the PI expects to define and construct a new spectrum from an operad that detects loop spaces as well as to establish a cosimplicial setup for moduli space actions in string topology. Furthermore he expects to define quantum K-theory, Gromov-Witten invariants and characteristic classes for global quotients. Extending these orbifold constructions to other types of global quotients will yield  deformation spaces for singularities with symmetries  and  an orbifold version of the chiral deRham complex. These constructions are tied together by conjectural symmetries such as the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence and mirror symmetry which have their origin in physics.<br/><br/>The proposal contributes to several fields of mathematics and as the constructions are often motivated by considerations of string theory and quantum field theory it also finds applications in physics. In particular, the mathematical investigation of the above are expected to bring about important new results that cross-fertilize the subjects of topology, algebra, geometry, and number theory on one hand and on the other hand add to the transfer of knowledge between theoretical physics and mathematics.  The outcome will be helpful in understanding a wide spectrum of problems ranging from the purely mathematical such as the basic structure of solutions sets of equations which exhibit symmetries or are not smooth to a better mathematical description of the universe predicted by string theory.<br/>"

Sometimes however, like the discovery of transistors and microelectronics, they depend on a deep understanding of subjects like quantum theory. A very speculative application of a deeper understanding of two dimensional quantum field theory, the subject of this project, could be to the physical realization of quantum computers. One knows quantum computers can theoretically solve problems not known to be solved theoretically by non quantum computing systems. One such problem is the theoretical possibility of cracking the factorization part of the security systems used by financial systems and government agencies. The technical difficulties to realizing quantum computers can be recast according to Michael Freedman, using the three dimensional topological theories alluded to above.

(1) Make significant advances toward the classification of the knot concordance group.  In particular, classify the successive quotients of its  (n)-solvable filtration and find new structure in the group.

From cancer treatments based on the knotting of cellular DNA, to antiviral drugs based on the geometrical shapes of proteins, to non-invasive visualization of the shape of the heart, to contemplating the ``shape'' of space-time itself, we seek precise mathematical descriptions of 3-dimensional objects. When one thinks of a precise mathematical description, one often thinks in terms of numbers, but ordinary numbers are insufficient to capture the complexities of our world.  Multiplication of ordinary numbers is ``commutative.''  However, the physics of the twentieth century has taught us that matter and energy cannot be described merely by numbers. Rather, vectors and matrices are required, and multiplication of matrices is not commutative, that is AB does not usually equal BA.  Every physical interaction is thus based on noncommutative algebra.  This project is investigating how this noncommutative algebra yields a mathematical description of the geometric structure of 3-dimensional space and of objects in 3- dimensional space.  Of particular importance is the manner in which closed strings in 3-dimensional space are knotted in 3- and in 4- dimensions.

For example, the Jones polynomial is one such invariant. In the case of the general linear group and the standard representation the PI and Joel Kamnitzer categorify these invariants, meaning that to each knot they assign a (bi-graded) homology group whose Euler characteristic is the original invariant. This is analogous to the way (singular) homology of topological spaces ""categorifies"" the Euler characteristic. Their construction involves studying the (derived) category of coherent sheaves on certain flag-like varieties. All this parallels the earlier pioneering work of Khovanov and Rozansky who discovered such categorifications using algebraic and combinatorial constructions. Using the algebraic geometric approach the investigator and his colleagues have a conjecture for how to categorify some of the remaining Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. Checking, for instance, invariance under Reidemeister move 2 involves proving that certain integral transforms between (derived) categories are equivalences.<br/>The existence of such equivalences, which include Seidel-Thomas spherical twists, is a lively area of research which is interesting in itself.<br/><br/>The simplest example of a knot is obtained by taking a tangled-up shoe lace and glueing the ends together. A fundamental question in low-dimensional topology is to determine when two such knots are different (you are allowed to move the knots around without cutting them). One way to do this is to assign a number (an invariant) to each knot so that if two knots are assigned different numbers then they must be different. How to assign such numbers is a deep problem which is related to various areas of mathematics in surprising ways. For example, the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are obtained from representation theory (which is the study of matrices). There are also constructions of such invariants using algebra and others that are inspired by physics and string theory. The proposed research suggests yet another approach using algebraic geometry (which is the study of systems of polynomial equations).

The key to effectively presenting geometric topology to a broad audience is to keep in mind that explanations using words alone are sure to fail.  Explanations using pictures will convey a vague sense of the intended meaning. But to deeply understand the topology of a multi-connected space, the learner must experience the space for him or herself. One of the P.I.'s missions in life --- and the subject of the present project --- is to provide computer software that enables children and other non-specialists to experience 2-manifolds, 3-manifolds, and other structures directly. For example, the P.I.'s existing Torus Games have already proved effective with students from fifth grade on up, leading them to the mind-stretching concept of multiconnected spaces (specifically, the flat 2-torus and the flat Klein bottle). The present project aims to maintain this kid-friendly approach while extending the software's mathematical scope to include spherical and hyperbolic 2-manifolds as well as 3-manifolds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>While mathematicians' and physicists' understanding of space has made tremendous progress, the general public's understanding still lags behind.  Part of the reason is that, while the modern concept of space is not inherently difficult to understand, it is extremely difficult to explain in words. Explanations with pictures work a little better, but in practice they too usually prove inadequate.  The only truly effective way for a student (or nonspecialist adult) to fully grasp a new concept of space is for the student to experience the new space for him or herself.  The P.I.'s existing Torus Games software lets students develop a gut-level understanding of spaces that are finite yet have no boundaries;  this software is widely used in middle and high schools and is effective with students from fifth grade on up.  The present project aims to maintain this kid-friendly approach while extending the software's mathematical scope to include curved spaces as well as flat ones, and 3-dimensional spaces as well as ""toy"" 2-dimensional ones.  Cosmologists are currently investigating the hypothesis that the real universe might be finite, but no matter whether that hypothesis is ultimately accepted or rejected, spaces of all sorts (flat and curved, finite and infinite, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional) play a pervasive role throughout physics and mathematics, and merit a broader understanding in our culture as a whole."

Boyland, Louis S. Block,<br/>Alexander N. Dranishnikov, James E. Keesling<br/><br/>The University of Florida Department of Mathematics will host a<br/>joint Ulam Centennial and 43rd Annual Spring Topology and<br/>Dynamical Systems Conference (Ulam Centennial STDC-2009) from<br/>Saturday, March 7 through Thursday, March 12, 2009.  The Annual<br/>Spring STDC's are among the nation's most successful series of<br/>topology/dynamics conferences.  Stanislaw Ulam would turn 100 in<br/>Spring, 2009. He was one of the preeminent mathematical<br/>scientists of the 20th century and a Graduate Research Professor<br/>at the University of Florida.  In light of Ulam's many<br/>contributions to topology, dynamics, and related fields, it is<br/>very fitting that the annual STDC be combined with an Ulam<br/>Centennial. The joint conference will maintain the basic<br/>structure and sessions of the STDC, but will be extended by 3<br/>days to allow additional special sessions and plenary lectures in<br/>the areas of Ulam's many contributions to mathematics and<br/>science.<br/><br/>Topology studies generalized notions of spatial structure;<br/>Dynamical Systems studies the topological and analytic nature of<br/>time evolution. Each is a fundamental part of modern mathematics<br/>and has applications as far ranging as robotics, fluid mixing,<br/>computer networks and cardiac rhythms.  Conferences are<br/>fundamental to the strength and development of mathematics, and<br/>as such are a fundamental part of the national scientific<br/>infrastructure. This conference will combine the latest results<br/>in Topology and Dynamical Systems with many applied topics<br/>associated with Stan Ulam. While Ulam is perhaps best remembered<br/>by the public for his participation in the Manhattan Project, his<br/>mathematical and scientific contributions were wide and<br/>deep. They include significant work in numerical methods,<br/>classical mechanics, dynamical systems, number theory, graph<br/>theory, set theory, and ergodic theory. Inspired by Ulam's<br/>example, the conference will advance top quality research in<br/>Topology and Dynamical Systems while facilitating broad and deep<br/>interaction among adjacent mathematical research areas and<br/>between abstract and applied research.<br/>"

One particular focus will be joint work with Peter Kronheimer concerning a Floer homology theory built from connections with a prescribed singularity along a link in a three manifold.  When specialized to links in the three sphere this will invariant appears to be closely related to the Khovanov homology of the link.  Kronheimer and the PI intend to further explore this theory and understand more clearly its relation to Khovanov homology.  With a student, Maksim Lypyanskiy, the PI intends to further explore a new foundation for  Floer homology based on a theory of semi-infinite dimensional cycles.  This appears to lead to a drastic simplification of theory.  With another student, Ben Mares, the PI hopes to begin to put into place the mathematical theory of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills equations.  Finally with third student, Timothy Nguyen, he hopes to understand the hyperbolic Yang-Mills equations especially in dimensions 3+1.<br/><br/>The models physicists have constructed for understanding particles in high energy physics, like that Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten equations, have proved to be a source for many exciting developments in mathematics as well.  Most notably these models figure crucially in understanding  phenomena in dimensions three and four that still seem out of reach by other methods.  The PI has been a leader in the mathematical developments of these models and will continue research in a number of different directions on these models.  One project with Peter Kronheimer seeks to relate two quite different seeming models.  Another seeks to development new mathematical foundations for exploration of these models and will hopefully lead to a great simplification in the rigorous mathematical construction of these models.  Finally with some students Mrowka will explore new models in hopes that they too will have interesting mathematical consequences."

The scientific focus of the workshops will be on recent developments in topological and analytic methods in dynamical systems and algebra. <br/><br/><br/>Over the last 20-25 years, there have been many developments that have increased the interaction among topology, dynamical systems, algebra, and analysis.  NSF support will be used for at least 10 US-based students and recent PhDs to attend the workshops.  The workshops will provide the opportunity for recently trained professional mathematicians and students to prepare for research in areas in which current developments are moving rapidly at the intersection point of topology, analysis, algebra , and dynamics.  Major speakers with international reputations have been selected who are active in these research areas.<br/><br/>"

The participants of this conference come from many countries. The conference plans to cover three subjects. The first is symmetries of 3-dimensional manifolds. The topics to be discussed include Thurston's Conjecture of geometrization of 3-manifolds<br/>with symmetries whose singular set is of dimension at least 1, geometrization (after Perelman) of 3-manifolds with finite <br/>fundamental groups, and  symmetries of 3-manifolds related to knots and links.<br/>A second topic is group actions on 4-manifolds. The topics to be discussed  include locally linear, topological actions on 4-manifolds, smooth and symplectic symmetries of 4-manifolds, and gauge theoretic techniques and their roles in studying symmetries of 4-manifolds.<br/>A third subject is transformation groups on higher dimensional manifolds.<br/>The topics to be discussed include homotopy theory in transformation groups, group actions and surgery theory, group actions in symplectic geometry, and group actions on algebraic varieties. Besides the standard conference talks (30 minutes long) there will be invited (1-hour long) plenary talks delivered by leading researchers in the corresponding areas. These talks will give an overview of a given research area and suggest possible new research directions.<br/><br/>Symmetry is a fundamental phenomenon in mathematics (as well as physics),<br/>which is a unifying theme of a wide range of research areas.<br/>The main purpose of this conference is to bring together researchers from <br/>quite diverse areas of topology and geometry whose research is related to or <br/>involves transformation groups. This conference will be especially useful to young researchers and graduate students. For it will give them a chance to obtain a more global and comprehensive view of various research areas which only on a surface look to be disjoint and unrelated."
