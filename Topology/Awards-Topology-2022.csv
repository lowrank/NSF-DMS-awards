"2203431","Braids, Surfaces, and Polynomials","DMS","GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS, TOPOLOGY","09/01/2022","08/12/2022","Dan Margalit","GA","Georgia Tech Research Corporation","Standard Grant","Swatee Naik","08/31/2025","$395,998.00","","dan.margalit@vanderbilt.edu","926 DALNEY ST NW","ATLANTA","GA","30332","4048944819","MPS","1265, 1267","","$0.00","Polynomials arise in mathematics and science whenever we model a physical, biological, or chemical system. Surfaces often appear when we study the geometry of a system; for instance, the set of configurations of a mechanical system or the underlying template for a large dimensional data set. Braids occur whenever we have a collection of points moving in a surface, for instance stars and planets moving within our field of vision, or the roots of polynomials changing with respect to a parameter. In order to understand these phenomena, it is essential to study the set of symmetries of a surface, which is also known as the mapping class group of the surface. This is a  beautiful and rich theory that has been the focus of intense study over the past century. The goal of this research is to study surfaces, braids, and polynomials, and the interactions of these objects with each other. One project is to give fast algorithms for deciding basic properties of elements of the mapping class group. One of the properties that the algorithm computes is the entropy, which determines the amount of mixing happening on the surface. In addition to these research goals, the PI plans to continue work on several projects that have direct impact on graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. The first is the highly successful Topology Students Workshop, a conference that serves both as a research conference in topology for graduate students as well as a professional development workshop. The second is a free, online, interactive textbook for basic linear algebra, called Interactive Linear Algebra. The PI also plans to expand outreach activities to local K-12 classrooms.<br/><br/>The PI will study Thurston maps, braid groups, and mapping class groups. A Thurston map is a branched cover of the complex plane (or Riemann sphere) over itself, with finite post-critical set. Many polynomials are Thurston maps. A basic recognition problem in complex dynamics is: given a Thurston map, is it equivalent to a polynomial, and if so, which one? In prior work, the PI and his collaborators gave a new, geometric algorithm to solve this recognition problem. The PI plans to investigate new, structural descriptions of the universe of such recognition problems. Specifically, the project will establish a version of the Bestvina-Handel algorithm from the theory of mapping class groups that is adapted to the setting of Thurston maps. The project will also provide a version of the Birman exact sequence (again from the theory of mapping class groups). One project in the theory of mapping class groups is to give a quadratic time algorithm that takes as input a product of generators of the mapping class group  and determines the Nielsen-Thurston type of that product. This algorithm also produces finer information about the product of generators, such as reducing curves and entropy. A third project is to classify homomorphisms between braid groups. The main new tool is the theory of totally symmetric sets, developed by the PI and his collaborators. By classifying these homomorphisms we gain insight into the relationships between polynomials of different degrees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The meeting will focus on the branch of low-dimensional topology concerned with understanding four-dimensional manifolds. Low-dimensional topology is the mathematical study of spaces (manifolds) of dimension two, three, and four. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces are intuitive: The surfaces of tables, bagels, or the earth are all examples of two-dimensional spaces and the spatial world we inhabit and the inside of a bagel are examples of three-dimensional spaces. Four-dimensional spaces are considerably more difficult to imagine (and study) with the most salient example being the spacetime conceptualization of the universe. In this sense, four-dimensional topology is the study of the possible shapes that our physical universe might realize. Surfaces have been well-studied classically, and major advances in the late 1900s and early 2000s have given researchers a clear understanding of three-dimensional manifolds. Four-dimensional manifolds represent the unknown frontier of low-dimensional topology, and there remain myriad open conjectures and unanswered question in this field of mathematics.<br/><br/>There has been an explosion of activity within four-dimensional topology in the last few years, particularly in the study of diffeomorphism groups of four-manifolds, the construction and detection of exotic structures and embeddings, and the introduction of trisections as a new tool in the field. The purpose of this conference is to gather an international group of experts to explore these recent developments in the study of four-dimensional manifolds, disseminate contemporary research in the field, promote the research of early-career mathematicians working in the field, include and promote the research of mathematicians from underrepresented groups, and to give a venue for new collaborations to occur and old collaborations to continue.<br/><br/>Conference Website: https://math.stanford.edu/~maggiehm/developmentsin4D<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As one can infer information about the shape of a drum by listening to the way it sounds, one can define topological invariants of spaces of dimension 3 and 4 by studying the solutions of certain partial differential equations naturally arising in gauge theory, the geometric language in which the fundamental laws of the Standard Model of particle physics are formulated. This project focuses on the Seiberg-Witten equations which, because of their geometric nature, provide a perfect vantage point to probe the interactions of topology with neighboring subjects such as hyperbolic geometry, spectral theory, and complex analysis. A key objective is the exploration of new avenues of investigation at the interface with these fields of mathematics. Towards this end, this project will also create many research opportunities both at the undergraduate and graduate level.<br/><br/>The PI will study monopole Floer homology, with the following main goals: explore the interactions with hyperbolic geometry in three dimensions using tools from spectral geometry, the theory of elliptic partial differential equations, and the Selberg trace formula; develop computational tools for the maps induced by general negative definite cobordisms using index theory and functoriality properties of coupled Morse homology; investigate possible relations with classical topics in algebraic geometry such as the study of the singularities of the theta divisor of a Riemann surface; and use Pin(2)-symmetry to understand potential geometric characterizations of rational homology spheres with small Floer homology, in the spirit of the L-space conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the heart of the program is a duality principle (a form of electric-magnetic duality in physics), which predicts surprising connections between a priori unrelated mathematical objects. Understanding the nature of this duality is a fundamental problem in mathematics and physics. Rather than study these phenomena in the traditional contexts of number fields or algebraic curves, the PI sets the Langlands program in the realm of 3-dimensional topology - a rich and active area of research in its own right. In this setting, these deep ideas become much more accessible than was previously possible. For example, one component of the project is about observing Langlands phenomena by comparing different ways to count knots in a given 3-dimensional space. Such methods open up the Langlands program to a wider mathematical world and provide pathways to involve a new generation of students in this fundamental research area. This project provides research and training opportunities for students.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the PI will define (mathematically) and study the space of states associated to a 3-manifold in the family of geometric Langlands topological quantum field theories of Kapustin and Witten. The proposed research is broadly in the realm of geometric representation theory, intersecting with concepts and tools from gauge theory, quantum topology (skein theory), and derived algebraic geometry. Some particular goals of the research include: formulating a duality conjecture for the dimensions of skein modules, as well as tools to explicitly verify in a number of important cases; a proof of the Betti and de Rham geometric Langlands conjecture for elliptic curves at generic level by developing an elliptic/quantum variant of generalized Springer theory; a refined construction of the state space of the B-model using tools from derived algebraic geometry; and a computation of the homology of gauge groups of 3-manifolds in terms of the Langlands dual spectral Whittaker theory.

An additional goal is to support graduate education, and to disseminate mathematical results.<br/><br/><br/>More technically, this project will investigate Floer and Khovanov theories associated to knots and three-manifolds, and deduce topological applications.  In Floer theory, there have recently been several enhancements of the powerful and well-studied Floer homologies of three-manifolds.

This project is centered on developing our understanding of these and related invariants, and applying them to questions in geometry and topology, especially on homology cobordism.  Primary goals include proving surgery exact triangles in Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy theory as well as determining the Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy type of Seifert spaces.

This workshop will be an opportunity for participants from a wide variety of institutions and backgrounds to learn advanced topics in algebraic topology, an area of mathematics that uses tools from algebra to study certain invariant properties of geometric objects. The advantage of the workshop is that the questions and problems in this field are easy to state and motivate, yet their study naturally leads one to consider modern developments in the field of algebraic topology. The active-learning format, and emphasis on co-creating mathematics in community with one another, will allow for significant collaboration between participants and for interactions with the scientific committee. The approachability of the topic and the format of the workshop will attract participants coming from institutions with smaller topology research groups, as well as those with marginalized or underrepresented aspects of their identity. The scientific committee itself is made up of early-career researchers, and more than half of the organizing and scientific committee are women. This representation and the diverse perspectives it offers for the design of the summer school will have a positive impact on attendees.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of the summer school is to introduce participants to tools and ideas from algebraic topology and homotopy theory through the lens of fixed point theory. The workshop will be structured around mini-courses taught in an active-learning style and course topics will range from classical fixed point theory to modern tools such as duality, spectra, and trace methods in algebraic K-theory. This range reflects recent and superficially unrelated advances in homotopy theory and higher category theory that have provided new approaches to topological fixed point theory. These approaches have refined classical invariants defined using simplicial structures that were often difficult to generalize. This shift in perspective also illuminated the centrality of additivity for useful fixed point invariants. Since algebraic K-theory is the universal home for additive invariants, it is natural to look for connections between fixed point theory and algebraic K-theory. This connection is further supported by the recent important developments in computations of K-groups. Work of some members of the scientific committee has established that these computational approaches can be effectively modeled using the new forms of fixed point invariants. This provides a very different approach to these important developments and a new source of intuition. <br/><br/>https://sites.google.com/colorado.edu/fixedpointtheory2020/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More complicated topological objects can be constructed by fitting these spheres together. Spheres of different dimensions can fit together in only a few different ways. Enumerating these combinations of spheres is one of the fundamental questions of a branch of mathematics called homotopy theory. This project focuses on the computation of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, using three general categories of techniques: theory, manual computation, and machine computation. These categories are mutually reinforcing. Theory establishes new techniques of computation; manual computation reveals new structure that points toward theoretical advances; machine computation provides independent verification of manual computation and carries it even further. Broader impacts of the project include development and growth of the electronic Computational Homotopy Theory (eCHT) virtual research community. With a long-term goal of self-sustainability, the eCHT community will experiment with different types of online engagement, such as foundational courses for early-career graduate students, seminar series on focused topics, career development events, online conferences, and building connections to online networks in neighboring subjects. These new modes of interaction aim to overcome traditional barriers to entry, especially for people in remote geographical locations and for those with non-traditional backgrounds. <br/><br/>The project's main research goal is to compute stable homotopy groups of spheres in the classical, C-motivic, R-motivic, and C2-equivariant contexts. It breaks into three main topics: the Adams spectral sequence, the effective slice spectral sequence, and deformations of stable homotopy theory. The effective spectral sequence is a replacement for the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence in the R-motivic and C2-equivariant situations. The first two topics are essentially computational, although they point towards a number of more theoretical questions. Two of the many possible outcomes of these computations are: new information about Mahowald (root) invariants; and settling the last unknown case of the Kervaire invariant one problem. The third topic is a theoretical perspective that was recently uncovered by computational exploration. Deformations will play a growing role in computational stable homotopy theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the objects in each sequence tend to get progressively bigger in many senses, the goal of the project is to show that some aspects of their structure stabilize. To engage the public on her research, the PI will partner with her university?s Museum of Natural History to showcase her work through the Science Communication Fellows (activity booths), Scientist in the Forum (public talks) and Research Station (display case) programs.  These Museum programs have an established record of reaching hundreds of members of the public and inspiring interest in STEM topics. The PI will also organize a public lecture series on mathematics topics of popular interest.  To support graduate education, the PI will continue to support the department?s Marjorie Lee Browne program (a 2-year ""bridge to the PhD"" math Masters program for under-served groups) by supervising students, and designing a new Masters-level differential topology course (implementing inclusive teaching practices) as a stepping stone to the department?s PhD-level differential topology course.

The PI will run a semester-long professional development workshop for her department?s grad students on ?the art of mathematics research talks"".

The first program concerns representation-theoretic stability behavior in the homology of the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class groups of genus-g surfaces, and the analogous subgroups of the automorphism groups of the free groups on n letters, as g and n grow. Both families are central objects in geometric group theory and their homology is not well understood, but its long-term behavior may be studied using tools from the field of representation stability. The second program concerns the algebraic structure of the homology groups of configuration spaces of connected manifolds. Configuration spaces have a long history of study in fields ranging broadly from topology to algebraic combinatorics to physics. The PI aims to expand the scope of the existing stability literature by establishing higher-order stability patterns among the ?unstable? homology classes, extending her existing work with Miller on configuration spaces of surfaces. The third program concerns the principal congruence subgroups of the general linear groups?objects fundamental to number theory?and aims to adapt machinery developed by Galatius?Kupers?Randal-Williams to prove higher-order stability patterns in their homology. The fourth program will study the high-degree rational cohomology of the special linear groups of a number ring. Conjecturally, these homology groups do or do not vanish in a range below their virtual cohomological dimension, depending on ring-theoretic properties of the number ring. These cohomology groups are governed by their Bieri?Eckmann dualizing module, the Steinberg module.

Some invariants are stable in the sense that they are independent of certain spatial dimension shifts. They are easier to compute because they are in some sense more algebraic. This project has two main themes. The first line of investigation is in chromatic homotopy theory, a field of mathematics that studies structural properties of stable invariants. This part of the project seeks to answer questions such as: Are there families of stable invariants that share common properties? What kind of symmetries exist for these families? How can these symmetries be used to do explicit computations and learn new things about fundamental geometric objects such as higher dimensional spheres? The second line of investigation is part of a multi-disciplinary collaboration with mathematicians and physicists, which uses stable invariants to study the phase of matter. A quantum system is a collection of interacting particles and, roughly, a phase is a family of quantum systems that may be different microscopically, but share certain macroscopic properties. For certain types of quantum systems, the phase type can be detected by stable invariants. This project aims to construct new stable invariants of phases and to study stable invariants of quantum systems equipped with certain symmetries. The broader goal is to make progress on the classification of phases of matter to better understand the fundamental properties of materials. The project has an integrated educational component, one goal of which is to make the two areas of research accessible to graduate students and advanced undergraduates through a series of graduate workshops. The educational plan also includes undergraduate and graduate research. In particular, the project will conduct research in collaboration with existing initiatives at the University of Colorado, Boulder that work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in STEM. An important goal is to increase the accessibility of research for underrepresented minorities in mathematics.<br/><br/>Stable invariants are studied using generalized cohomology theories or, more specifically, mathematical objects called spectra.  Chromatic homotopy theory aims to classify families of spectra according to different periodic behaviors exhibited by the stable invariants they compute. There is a close relationship between periodic behaviors and the symmetries of the spectrum. This project uses equivariant techniques to better understand this relationship. It has applications to the study of stable homotopy groups of spheres. Specifically, the project explores theoretical and computational properties of equivariant generalizations of Lubin-Tate theories that are built from the Real bordism spectrum, an equivariant generalization of complex bordism. The project develops techniques to compute the equivariant stable invariants arising from these theories. In a different direction, the project examines a conjecture that parametrized gapped invertible phases of matter form a generalized cohomology theory. The project proposes the construction of a ground-state bundle for parametrized quantum systems and explores how equivariant homotopy theory can inform the study of systems with symmetries. The project aims to increase accessibility of these topics to students in two ways. First, the project includes two five days mathematical events that combine a graduate workshop with research talks with a focus on the main areas of research of the project. These are to be part of an ongoing series that will continue beyond the five year duration of the  project. These events will create an interactive and collaborative environment between participants and experts by incorporating active-learning in the program structure. Secondly, the project will engage in academic term and summer undergraduate research opportunities in topology and phases of matter with a goal to increase access to undergraduate research for students from historically excluded groups in mathematics. The project will also support graduate students working on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past joint work of the PI reimagined the foundations of infinite-dimensional category theory with the aim of simplifying proofs by replacing ""analytic"" methods, that rely on the combinatorics of a particular model of infinite-dimensional categories, with ""synthetic"" ones that apply in any model. One part of this project seeks to develop a computer-verifiable formal language that expresses only statements about infinite-dimensional categories that are invariant under change of model. Such a language would force users to ""speak no evil"" by guaranteeing that every statement they express is model-independent. This project connects to the plans to recast the theory of infinite-dimensional categories in a new proposed univalent foundation system for mathematics, in which homotopical uniqueness up to a contractible space of choices becomes genuine uniqueness, permitting streamlined definitions of fundamental concepts. Both of these projects will be undertaken in part with mentees of the PI at Johns Hopkins. In parallel, the PI has concrete plans to continue her expository and outreach work which include a new book (Elements of Infinity-Category Theory, joint with Verity), lectures directed at the general public, survey articles prepared for a variety of audiences, and efforts to improve access to advanced mathematics, such as her service on the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Advisory Board at the Banff International Research Station.<br/><br/>The pioneers of homotopy type theory - the new proposed univalent foundation system - envisioned a computer-verifiable foundation for infinite-dimensional category theory, but some computational content is lost through the classical reasoning used in classical homotopy theory. With collaborators, the PI will develop a new model for classical homotopy theory in a particular category of cubical sets, in which cubical fibrations are required to be equivariant, respecting the symmetries of cubes defined by permuting their dimensions. A longer-term aim is to use similar methods to obtain cubical set based presentations of all infinity-topoi. A computer proof assistant based on equivariant cubical fibrations would have the correct classical semantics but would be able to restore the computational content to univalent mathematics. A final project explores homotopical macrocosms for higher category theory, aiming to prove that the collection of cartesian fibrations between (infinity,n)-categories assemble into a cartesian fibration of (infinity,n+1)-categories, which can be regarded as some sort of categorified hyperdoctrine for (infinity,n)-category theory. Results of this nature would establish a global lifting property against homotopy coherent diagrams that should aid further developments in (infinity,n)-category theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will provide an opportunity for researchers in each area to obtain a broad introduction to all other areas, followed by more specialized talks. The goal of the conference is to bring out commonalities in methods and produce cross-fertilization between these areas. The plenary lecturers, Judy Kennedy (general continua theory), Nageswari Shanmugalingam (analysis on metric spaces), Guofang Wei (geometry of singular spaces), Olga Lukina (topological dynamical systems), and Kim Ruane (geometric group theory) are all prominent women in their respective areas. The plenary speakers will be involved in inviting additional speakers on more specialized topics. The conference encourages the inclusion and participation of junior scientists and members of groups under-represented in STEM.<br/><br/>Continua theory has a very long history in mathematics, going back to the earliest days in which topology became a distinct field. Continua, which are defined as connected, compact, metrizable spaces, include ?nice? spaces such as compact manifolds. Metrizable continua that do not (or are not known to) have a traditional universal covering space are referred as ?exotic?. Exotic continua emerged in the quest for interesting examples long before they began to appear in the natural settings in which we now encounter them. Fractals appear as the underlying spaces that arise in important questions in analysis with applications, for example in design of cell phone antennae. Fractals are examples of Peano continua which in turn include all compact limits of geodesic spaces in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Exotic continua, also, arise as boundaries of groups and spaces in geometric group theory, and as solenoidal spaces, generalizing original examples that are defined as inverse limits via covering maps of much nicer spaces, including manifolds, but which themselves need not be path connected.

Particularly natural spaces to study in topology are the so called smooth manifolds. An example of a smooth manifold is the universe we live in, which we think of as 3-dimensional, but if we include time is actually 4-dimensional. A fundamental question is: what manifold is our universe? A goal of a geometric topologist is to list possibilities and most importantly to develop tools to understand the structure and distinguish the overall topology of manifolds. Low dimensional topology mainly refers to the study of 3-and 4-dimensional manifolds, where the theory of such spaces, in particular in 4-dimension, is significantly more complicated and exhibits many unique phenomena that are not seen in any other dimension. A particularly successful and rich way to understand the topology of manifolds is to introduce certain complex analytic structures on them, such as Stein structures and/or geometric structures, such as symplectic and contact geometries. The PI will study questions and conjectures that sit at the intersection of symplectic/contact topology and smooth manifold topology in low dimensions, and complex geometry. Alongside the research component, this project also includes activities that integrate the PI?s research program with education and training initiatives for student research, at both graduate and undergraduate levels. To that end, the PI will maintain an active topology group at the University of Alabama by organizing seminars, workshops, REUs and conferences. More broadly, the PI will use funds from this award to organize a week-long research and professional development summer workshop for talented undergraduate students from underrepresented colleges in the state of Alabama. He will also initiate a collaborative, multi-dimensional, long-term educational and research program for geometry-topology graduate students and faculty in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) schools, initially including the University of Alabama, Louisiana State University, the University of Mississippi, and the University of Arkansas.   <br/> <br/>This project involves studying interactions between complex geometry, symplectic geometry and contact geometry, and low dimensional topology with a focus on various notions of convexity. The first long-term research objective will be to consider constraints on the topology of closed 3-manifolds embedded in 4-space from the perspectives of symplectic topology (e.g. contact type hypersurfaces) and complex geometry (e.g. the boundaries of holomorphically/rationally/polynomially convex Stein domains).  Specifically, the PI will work towards a complete resolution of Gompf?s conjecture that predicts no Brieskorn sphere bounds a holomorphically convex domain in complex 2-space, determining the topology of contact type hypersurfaces in 4-space and in complex projective space, and exploring their implications for the exotic nature of smooth 4-manifold topology. The second long-term research objective concerns two outstanding problems dealing with the existence and classification of tight and fillable contact structures on closed, oriented 3-manifolds. The PI?s various joint works provide a framework and new constructions to study the existence question of tight and fillable contact structures from the point of view of Heegaard Floer homology. The PI and his collaborators will investigate to what extent invariants coming from Heegaard Floer homology detect tightness completely. The PI will also work to complete the classification problem for tight structures on small Seifert fibered spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lower dimensions (1, 2, and 3) do not have enough room for interesting problems to arise, while there is ample space to resolve them in higher dimensions (above 4). A consequence of this is that many well-known questions remain unanswered only smoothly in dimension 4, such as the Poincar and Schnflies conjectures first posed in 1904 and 1908, respectively. The primary goal of this project is to advance the mathematical techniques and machinery necessary for the eventual resolution of these outstanding problems. This will be achieved by studying relatively ""simple"" smooth 4-manifolds and their submanifolds up to various notions of equivalence, through manipulating surfaces within these manifolds and understanding limitations on how these surfaces intersect and embed. As a broader impact, the PI is passionately involved with the Prison Teaching Initiative (PTI) at Princeton University, a program recruiting volunteer graduate students, postdocs, and faculty to teach college courses to incarcerated students in New Jersey Department of Corrections institutions. The PI is actively working with the PTI to co-develop a new math course for non-math majors to be offered as part of the BA curriculum, examining legal cases in which mathematics has been used (both correctly and incorrectly) in the courtroom. The PI is also designing and co-teaching a course in which students learn basic knot theory by using it to model circus arts such as aerial acrobatics, juggling, and tightrope walking. The PI is currently working with undergraduate students to compile their insights and observations from the first iteration of this course, with the goal of publishing these results in an undergraduate journal.<br/><br/>The classification of closed, simply-connected 4-manifolds up to homeomorphism is well understood, due to groundbreaking work of Freedman from the 80's. The goal of this research project is to further understand the difference between the smooth and topological categories in dimension 4. Examples of compact topological 4-manifolds admitting infinitely many distinct smooth structures were first produced by Friedman and Morgan, using the work of Donaldson. In contrast, compact topological manifolds of dimension other than four admit at most finitely many smooth structures. The PI is interested in developing concrete and useful methods of relating pairs of smooth 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic. In particular, the project will focus on (1) smooth 4-manifolds up to ""stable"" diffeomorphism, i.e. modulo connected summing with copies of the product S^2  S^2, (2) the diffeomorphism types of topological 4-balls that embed in the standard 4-sphere, and (3) embeddings of contractible manifolds called corks up to regular homotopy and topological isotopy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The usual direction is to study the set of symmetries of a geometric object of interest.  In geometric group theory, this becomes a two-way street in that algebraic objects (such as groups) are considered as geometric objects in their own right. Hyperbolic geometry is a subject going back to work of Bolyai, Gauss and others in the 19th Century, but it also plays a central role in modern geometry, due to the influence of Thurston and Gromov.  This project centers around a central question in geometric group theory, the Cannon Conjecture, about the difference (in three dimensions) between classical hyperbolic geometry and the coarse notion due to Gromov, in the presence of a large group of symmetries. Broader impacts of this project include research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Over the last decade the principal investigator, along with Manning and others, has developed many tools involving relatively hyperbolic Dehn filling, which gives strong control on certain kinds of quotients of relatively hyperbolic groups.  This project leverages this work to study hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups whose boundary at infinity is a two-sphere.  The Cannon Conjecture predicts that such groups are virtually Kleinian groups.  This project proposes various approaches to this and related conjectures.  With Haissinsky, Manning, Osajda, Sisto and Walsh, the PI continues to develop a theory of drilling hyperbolic groups with two-sphere boundary.  The PI will investigate possible quasi-isometries between hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups with 2-sphere boundaries.  With Wilton, the PI will develop a notion of coarse sectional curvature, with applications to coherence and local quasi-convexity of certain hyperbolic groups.

There are many different constructions of the Gromov-Witten virtual fundamental class of closed symplectic manifolds, each one with its own strengths and advantages, so knowing that most of these constructions carry the same information is useful, allowing one to choose whatever construction may be best suited for the particular problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By adding a time dimension, it is natural to think of the deformation as being a 4-dimensional object which has one object at one end, and the other shape at the other end. A fundamental question in low-dimensional topology is whether we can build a 4-dimensional space which connects two given 3-dimensional objects. Heegaard Floer homology is an important tool for studying such questions. It gives topologists a way of knowing that two 3-dimensional spaces cannot be related by a 4-dimensional space. Heegaard Floer homology involves the counts of complicated solutions to differential equations and has deep connections to Seiberg-Witten theory, Yang-Mills theory, and mathematical physics.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new tools for computing Heegaard Floer homology. A main focus of this project is to develop a new minus version of bordered Heegaard Floer homology for 3-dimensional spaces with torus boundary components. This theory is based on the link surgery formula of Manolescu and Ozsvth. The project aims to use this theory to study the lattice homology conjecture of Nmethi. Additionally, the project aims to study symmetries in this theory and in the link surgery formula. With these tools, the PI hopes to give computable invariants of homology cobordism.

The YTM consists of two major components: three mini-courses by distinguished researchers on the one hand, and a line-up of forty short talks and twenty poster presentations, mostly by graduate students, on the other. Being one of the largest conferences in the world dedicated to early career researchers in the field of Algebraic Topology, the YTM provides a unique opportunity for junior topologists to gain experience giving conference presentations to a wide audience, broaden their horizons by learning about subfields not represented at their institutions, expose their work to the international topology community, and develop collaborations with other early career researchers. Furthermore, the YTM seeks to promote diversity by featuring graduate student speakers from underrepresented groups and from universities that are less well-represented in topology and by providing a friendly and welcoming community for students from all backgrounds. By providing funding for US participants, the NSF is promoting the exchange of scientific ideas between the US and the international topology community, in particular providing a setting for students and other topologists from the US to make research connections and develop relationships with their future international colleagues, as well as supporting a culture of diversity and inclusion. <br/> <br/>The three mini-courses this year will be on: (1) symplectic homotopy theory by Andrew Blumberg, which will provide an introduction to Floer stable homotopy theory with an eye towards his recent breakthrough with Mohammed Abouzaid on the Arnold conjecture; (2) stratification and descent by Natalia Castellana, revolving around a recent series of papers by her and coauthors on the support-stratifications of module categories over cochains of various spaces of interest in algebraic topology and representation theory; and (3) cellular sheaf theory by Robert Ghrist, which will be a crash course on sheaf theory in applied topology, starting with basic materials on cellular sheaves and moving on to various use-cases in topological data analysis. These mini-courses offer introductions into major subfields of current active research, and serve as a gateway into these fields even for early graduate students. Participant-contributed talks and posters will cover a wide range of topics in topology, spanning across higher algebra, homotopy theory, geometry, and applied topology.

The story often begins with calculations in seemingly unrelated physical and mathematical theories that by coincidence give the same answer. Careful investigations then reveal a deep structure linking the disciplines. Such discoveries open new vistas and prompt novel lines of research. A nascent example of this phenomenon relates a certain type of quantum field theory to an object in algebraic topology called elliptic cohomology. The deep structure explaining the relationship between these areas remains elusive. However, the expectation is that the answer will illuminate important objects in several branches of mathematics and physics. In particular, a resolution should provide insight into foundational questions in string theory, while also revealing the geometric meaning of elliptic cohomology. The projects will develop new tools to study this problem. The award supports graduate students working with the PI whose research will contribute to this area. The PI will continue mentoring and advising activities along with his involvement in mathematics education for incarcerated people through the Education Justice Project in Illinois.<br/><br/>The main goal of the work is to leverage 2-equivariant elliptic cohomology to reduce the key questions to the study of a few structures in geometry and quantum field theory. The methods utilize a filtration on field theories mimicking the chromatic filtration, allowing one to break the larger problem into smaller and more manageable pieces. Success in lower stages of the filtration already offers several long-anticipated geometric applications of elliptic cohomology, as well as new deformation invariants of quantum field theories. Prior work shows that the first step of the filtration affords a geometric model for equivariant elliptic cohomology over the complex numbers. The proposed research builds upon this existing model and moves beyond characteristic zero.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a possible shape can be described by cutting it into tetrahedra and recording how to glue them back together. This structure, called a triangulation, is particularly useful for studying topological spaces using computers. Veering triangulations are a very special kind of triangulation, which seem to be closely connected to the possible flows through the space, that is, the ways in which a fluid could circulate. One of the central goals of the project is to formally prove this relationship, which will open the study of these flows to computational experimentation and exploration. In addition to answering other questions about veering triangulations, the project will investigate foundational questions about triangulations of higher-dimensional spaces. Another goal of the project is in mathematical visualization, using 3D printing and virtual/augmented reality to aid in research, pedagogy, and outreach. The PI has developed an undergraduate course in which students learn 3D design skills and apply their mathematical knowledge to produce 3D printed objects and has advised student projects in both 3D printing and virtual reality. He plans to extend these activities with new technologies and mathematical visualization projects. With collaborators at CIMAT (Mexico), the PI plans to design inexpensive 3D printed sliding tile puzzles and associated educational materials, to be distributed to underrepresented communities in Latin America. Other outreach activities will include expository papers, public talks, and YouTube videos.<br/><br/>In this project the PI aims to prove, together with collaborators, that veering triangulations correspond to pseudo-Anosov flows, that they can be used to produce new Cannon-Thurston maps (space-filling curves associated to hyperbolic geometry), and that certain types of manifolds have finitely many veering triangulations. The work will also extend the existing census of veering triangulations. In another direction, the project seeks to establish connectivity properties for triangulations in an arbitrary number of dimensions, with potential applications in topological invariants and census building. The PI and collaborators plan to further develop virtual reality experiences for the Thurston (and other) geometries, as well as an augmented reality application to investigate sphere eversions, and to work with developers of the research software ?SnapPy? to extend its visualization capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mathematics, knots that cannot be transformed into one another without cutting and regluing the strings that form the loops are considered to be different from each other, or in other words, inequivalent. Key tools for distinguishing inequivalent knots are called knot invariants and these are essentially the properties of a knot that are preserved by continuous transformations of the space. In this project the PI will study the relationship between quantum knot invariants, a relatively less understood family, constructed from the ideas of quantum physics and mathematics. Central questions in quantum topology are broadly connected to the geometric topology of three-dimensional spaces, number-theoretic properties of polynomials assigned by quantum invariants, and the algebraic structures of quantum groups defining the theory. The project includes research plans for undergraduate and Master's students. The PI will also engage with ""Girls Who Code"" club meetings in service to the local community.   <br/><br/>The colored Jones polynomial is an important knot invariant that comes from the representation theory of quantum groups and lies at the heart of quantum topology, low-dimensional topology, and hyperbolic geometry.  In this project the PI and her collaborators will expand the correspondence between a state sum defining the colored Jones polynomial and properly embedded surfaces in a link complement, by applying the techniques of classical three-manifold topology and normal surface theory. The next part is to prove a categorified version of the Strong Slope Conjecture for colored Khovanov homology, which is a categorification of the colored Jones polynomial. The PI will evaluate the potential for this framework to provide new perspectives on the relationship of Khovanov homology to knot Floer homology, another link invariant that has been extensively studied with deep connections to other fields.

This subject lies at the crossroads of many disparate areas of mathematics, and it has a wide variety of applications ranging from cosmology (the shape of the universe) to biochemistry (the knotting of DNA molecules) to mathematical physics. Surprisingly, many problems in low dimensions are more difficult than their analogues in higher dimensions and require the use of invariants that go beyond traditional algebraic topology. The PI?s primary tools come from Heegaard Floer homology and Khovanov homology, two important packages of invariants developed in the early 2000s. These tools bring together several different fields of mathematics, including representation theory, differential geometry, and analysis, and the PI hopes to elucidate the connections between these different areas and expand the discourse among researchers in these fields. In addition, the PI is deeply committed to integrating his research with a passion for education at a variety of levels and mathematical outreach. He has numerous projects in mind for both undergraduate and graduate students in the coming years, and he is deeply invested in expanding the pipeline of women and underrepresented minorities in the field.<br/><br/><br/>The specific research goals of the project are organized around two main areas. (1) The PI has made numerous contributions regarding knot concordance, the study of which knots in 3-dimensional space bound smoothly embedded disks in 4 dimensions, along with various other problems concerning smoothly embedded surfaces in 4-dimensional manifolds. These questions are deeply tied to the fundamental strangeness of 4-dimensional topology, as compared with higher dimensions. The PI plans to investigate a number of open questions in this area, including homology slice knots, piecewise-linear concordance of knots in homology 3-spheres, ribbon concordance, new constructions of exotic 4-manifolds, and invariants for knotted 2-spheres in 4-dimensional space. (2) The PI also works on questions that are more internal to the structures of Heegaard Floer homology and Khovanov homology and the relationship between them. While rather technical, these problems may have more topological applications down the road. In particular, the PI plans to investigate some technical issues that arise in the behavior of Heegaard Floer homology under surgery and to continue a long-standing effort to construct a spectral sequence between Khovanov homology and knot Floer homology in characteristic 2.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A guiding question in the field of topology is the classification, up to a given notion of equivalence, of all possible manifolds in a fixed dimension. Long-standing open questions concern the detection of exotic pairs in dimension 4. These are manifolds which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic, meaning that they are only distinguished by a very fine notion of equivalence. Techniques going back to Fox and Milnor and recently extended by Marengon, Manolescu and Piccirillo demonstrate that exotic pairs can be identified by using certain properties of knots, or entangled circles, which lie in the boundary of a 4-manifold after removing an open ball. The PI will explore this paradigm, which has the potential to lead to a fundamental shift in our ability to distinguish smooth 4-dimensional manifolds. An additional set of goals concerns studying the properties of knots in their own right, where certain old questions can be attacked by combinatorial tools introduced by the PI along with Blair and others. Overall, the development of these methods can have a lasting impact on the field of topology and on the applied sciences it informs, such as signal processing, data science and control theory, where manifolds appear in many guises - for one example, as state spaces of dynamical systems. The PI is also engaged in creating education and research opportunities for underrepresented communities. The PI will continue a program to employ combinatorial tools to address open questions in topology; her approach will provide graduate and advanced undergraduate students with an entry point to cutting-edge research in the field.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project outlines paths toward several distinct goals in low-dimensional topology for which the interaction between algebraic and geometric phenomena is the unifying principle; in which a combinatorial approach has proven effective; and in which knots in the 3-sphere and surfaces embedded in 4-manifolds are a central object of interest. Specific problems the PI will study include the Meridional Rank Conjecture of Cappell and Shaneson, the Slice-Ribbon Conjecture of Fox and Milnor and applications of knot theory to the detection of exotic smooth structures in dimension 4.

Invariants of knots and links are efficient tools that allow us to distinguish between such mathematical objects. Study of link invariants has yielded powerful new invariants in the form of homology theories that arise through categorification, the process of replacing a known invariant for links with a family of algebraic objects that generalize and enrich the original invariant. One focus of the project is to better understand some existing link homologies and investigate their properties and applications, as well as to construct new link homologies. Another goal of the project is to extend known quantum invariants to other knot-like objects, including singular links. The award will support research experiences in which students are charged with investigating and working on publication-worthy open questions. The PI is committed to increasing the participation of women in mathematics and will also continue to organize the university's annual Sonia Kovalevsky Math Day, an event designed for students in grades 7-12, with the goal of empowering the next generation of female mathematicians, scientists, engineers, and innovators. Moreover, the PI organizes a series of talks aimed for college students, celebrating the achievements of young mathematicians, in particular women and underrepresented groups in mathematical sciences; speakers are encouraged to talk not only about math and their mathematical achievements but also about their path and endeavors to a career in mathematical sciences. <br/> <br/>The range of topics in this project will establish connections between various areas of mathematics, including low-dimensional topology, combinatorics, abstract algebra, and representation theory. The project aims to construct and study new Khovanov-type homology theories for classical knots and singular knots via webs and foams modulo relations and to investigate applications of these theories to questions about braids and cobordisms, in particular to questions related to concordance, ribbon distance, and invariants of surface-links and surface-knots. Another goal of the project is to extend classical quantum invariants to singular links and virtual links by means of skein modules, Markov traces, and Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras, as well as combinatorial techniques involving graphical calculus.

Closely related to the study of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces is the study of knots, which can be viewed as tied in space. This project will further develop and apply recent cut-and-paste tools in low-dimensional topology. Part of the project concerns the question of what kinds of geometric structures, specifically what kind of ?contact structures?, a given 3-dimensional space can support. In addition to direct applications to mathematics, contact structures have found numerous applications in physics, including classical mechanics, thermodynamics, and control theory. In parallel to the research component, the PI will further their educational and outreach efforts. For example, the PI will supervise undergraduate and graduate research, and establish a high school enrichment program.<br/><br/>In the early 2000s, Ozsvath and Szabo developed a package of powerful invariants for knots and 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, generally known as Heegaard Floer homology. Heegaard Floer homology has since taken a major place in low-dimensional topology, and has helped researchers obtain many new results and settle numerous old conjectures. Bordered Floer homology generalizes Heegaard Floer homology to manifolds with boundary, and provides nice techniques for computing the Heegaard Floer invariants of closed manifolds, by cutting a manifold into pieces (e.g. a knot into tangles), and studying the individual pieces and their gluing. This project seeks to develop further the bordered Heegaard Floer tools we currently have. The PI plans to continue to develop an invariant from bordered Floer homology for contact 3-manifolds with convex boundary, and use it to address open questions in contact topology; extend bordered Floer homology and tangle Floer homology to integral coefficients; understand and develop the connections between knot Floer homology and quantum algebra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The twofold purpose of the proposed activities are to gather leading experts and early-career researchers working in rapidly developing subjects, and to foster interaction between groups of mathematicians and physicists working on different aspects of related problems; this will facilitate cross-fertilization between different fields and disseminate the most recent results of current research. GAP XVII and GAP XVIII will allow earlier-career mathematicians to disseminate their ideas and to broaden their perspective, both mathematically and internationally. Both summer schools, which will provide the opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas with foreign peers and launch collaborations, will include a poster session for individuals to present their recent work. <br/><br/>The theme of both schools is ""Higher Structures: Deformations and Homotopy Algebras"". GAP XVII (2022) will be devoted to ""Deformations"" and GAP XVIII (2023) to ""Homotopy Algebras"". Higher structures has emerged as a new field in mathematics, as well as in mathematical and theoretical physics. Covering many different topics, this field encompasses deformation theory, quantization, homotopy algebras, derived geometry, enumerative geometry, representation theory, Poisson geometry, mirror symmetry, noncommutative algebraic geometry, string theory, and quantum field theory. The event will be devoted to bringing together different aspects of higher structures, in particular deformations and homotopy algebras, as well as identifying new emerging directions of investigation. Deformation theory has become an important area of mathematics. Deformation quantization lies on the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics. Roughly speaking, it is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative associative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. Homotopy algebras provide a powerful machinery for studying many interconnected questions in different areas of contemporary mathematics and mathematical physics.

Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the lens of transfinite ordinal numbers, compactness, and large cardinals. This project includes the training of graduate students. <br/><br/>The first part of the research project involves using set-theoretic tools to study groups of piecewise linear and piecewise projective homemorphisms.  This includes attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is  elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected to have other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals.  This part of the research project also concerns use of set-theoretic tools such as compactness and the algebra of elementary embeddings to study the amenability problem for F.  The second part of the research project concerns further developing techniques in pure and applied set theory: methods for studying the vanishing of higher derived limits in homological algebra; the role that Jensen's diamond principle plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at most aleph1.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Real algebraic K-theory, which encodes classical invariants like algebraic K-theory, Hermitian K-theory, and L-theory, will also be studied using the trace methods developed in previous work.

A central challenge is to classify all maps from spheres to other spheres, where two maps are considered equivalent if one can be deformed to the other. The equivalence classes of these maps are called the homotopy groups of spheres, and collectively they form one of the deepest and most central objects in the field. Historically, much important theory has arisen out of attempts to compute more homotopy groups of spheres and understand patterns within them. This project involves furthering knowledge of the homotopy groups of spheres, using old and new techniques as well as computer calculations. The project also involves studying an analogue of these groups in algebraic geometry; this falls under a relatively new and actively developed area called motivic homotopy theory, which applies techniques in algebraic topology to study algebraic geometry.

One feature of low dimensions is the existence of deep structures known as TQFTs (Topological Quantum Field Theories), many originating in quantum physics and having applications to condensed matter, statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The Prinicipal Investigator will be studying such topological theories of more general type, where the theory is known on topological objects without boundary (closed objects) and extended canonically to objects with boundary. These constructions proved fruitful for explicit combinatorial construction of link homology theories, where topological objects are foam-like two-dimensional structures embedded in 3-space. The author has recently shown that a semi-linear version of this construction in dimension one extends so-called finite state automata and regular languages, which is a classical subject in computer science. This opens possibility of many generalizations, including exploring connections between more general languages and topological theories and possible relations between two-dimensional theories and cellular automata. Further studies of topological theories and related topics of foams and link homology should lead to fruitful discoveries in low-dimensional topology and related fields.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project has three major goals. The first major goal is to further develop the theory of foams, their evaluations and applications in link homology and categorification. Foams are two-dimensional CW-complexes with generic singularities. They have proved instrumental in combinatorial approaches to GL(N) link homology theories and boast tantalizing connections to instanton Floer homology for orbifolds. The PI will further develop topological theories related to foams, with an eye towards technically difficult problems, such as computation of Kronheimer-Mrowka homology of embedded trivalent graphs and finding combinatorial counterpart of that homology. The second goal is to find approaches to several link homology theories, including Cautis, Webster and Qi-Sussan homologies, to establish their functoriality and extend to tangles and tangle cobordisms. A number of important link homology theories, including triply-graded HOMFLYPT homology, Webster, Cautis, and Qi-Sussan homology, are missing a functorial extension to tangle cobordisms and, in most cases, a related extensions to tangles. The PI will develop new approaches to these homology theories to redefine them, repair functoriality where necessary, and extend them to link cobordisms. The third goal is to understand universal theories in low dimensions. The PI will continue studying universal construction of topological theories, motivated by recent successes such as the interpretation of finite state automata and regular languages via one-dimensional topological theories with defects and taking values in the Boolean semiring B, where a regular language and a circular regular language give rise to a rigid symmetric monoidal B-linear category.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the great successes of the subject is called obstruction theory, and it has largely made this procedure reversible. Starting with algebraic invariants associated to geometric shapes, obstruction theory gives information regarding objects that could or would have these invariants. Since its development, the basic techniques of obstruction theory have been applied in a wide variety of settings and been at the heart of several major developments in many areas of mathematics. The goal of this project is to develop the lessons learned in these separate branches into a modern, reusable library that is general enough to apply within the array of subjects where obstruction theory is found today, and more. Additionally, the PI is planning a series of workshops on mathematical writing, as well as regular ""write-ins"": shared, common writing time with peers and faculty hosts to provide Ph.D. students and early-career researchers tools for effective mathematical writing and sustainable practices for writing productively. The PI is also committed to establishing a supportive culture inside and outside the Ph.D. program and organizing discussion groups on mental health issues in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>This project builds upon recent developments in multiplicative obstruction theory to address new and old questions in the subject. By applying these techniques to adjacent fields, such as algebraic geometry and geometric topology, the PI aims to provide new solutions to interesting problems in those areas and also develop interface points for outside researchers hoping to make use of techniques and tools in higher algebra. Specific goals include: the study of multiplication for ring spectra and ring spaces; commutativity in equivariant homotopy theory; monoidality in the May spectral sequence; ""tame"" versions of the commutative algebras in K(n)-local homotopy theory; and construction of homotopy-theoretic topological quantum field theories for application to knot invariants. Tying these individual problems together would facilitate the development of a modern and flexible framework for obstruction theory that unites the developments and lessons from several of its branches. In particular, the PI aims to combine the synthetic approach of Hopkins-Lurie and Pstragowski with more classical resolution-theoretic calculational techniques due to Robinson and developed further by Goerss-Hopkins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A link is a mathematical object that formalizes the notion of one or more knotted pieces of string. The mathematical theory of links (knot theory) is the study of such objects up to continuous deformations, that is we imagine that our link is made from a flexible material, and we consider two links to be the same if we can deform one into the other. Despite the seemingly specialized nature of knot theory, it has been shown to have applications to the theory of 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, to theoretical physics, and it has been applied to the study of DNA recombination and protein folding. The problem of distinguishing two links is challenging for two reasons: first, it can be difficult to exhibit the deformations that identify two links that look different but are indeed the same; second, given two links that we suspect to be distinct, it is difficult to directly and rigorously show that in fact one cannot be deformed to the other. One technique for solving the latter problem is via a link invariant: an assignment of a simpler mathematical object to a link that is unchanged under deformation. If two links have different invariants, we know that they are indeed distinct. The main research goal of this project is to further our understanding of powerful modern link invariants called link homology theories. The accompanying educational activities share a common theme of increasing participation in the mathematical sciences at a variety of levels, including course-development, student research, and outreach activities at the K-12 level. The broader impacts of this project aim to support the persistence of groups typically underrepresented in mathematics via research mentoring efforts, and to foster connections with the public through the UNC Science Expo.<br/><br/>Link homologies are modern invariants of links that generalize (and moreover, categorify) quantum invariants such as the Jones polynomial. In addition to providing deep topological information in dimensions three and four, they enjoy a rich algebraic structure arising from connections to modern representation theory. Consequently, they are an important nexus for research in representation theory, topology, and related considerations in theoretical physics. Thus far, algebraic developments in link homology have focused on the Khovanov-Rozansky theory, which is associated with the Lie algebra sl(n). The PI will develop link homology beyond this (non-super) type A case. These developments are crucial for providing long sought-after bridges between quantum and classical topological structures and for studying link homology associated to simple complex Lie algebras distinct from sl(n) about which essentially nothing is known. In one line of work, the PI will construct the gl(m|n) link homologies (super type A) that have been predicted to exist by considerations in theoretical physics, and which conjecturally provide a connection between the Khovanov-Rozansky theory and knot Floer homology. In a second line of work, the PI will construct explicit and computable link homologies associated to simple complex Lie algebras outside type A. Along the way, he will also resolve the long-standing problem of finding  generators-and-relations descriptions of categories of quantum group representations for non-type A simple complex Lie algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the 1980s a well-known conjecture in this field, known as the nearby Lagrangian conjecture, was formulated. To this day the conjecture remains open as one of the fundamental problems that play a central role in modern mathematics. The overarching research goal of this project is to obtain new results in the direction of this conjecture by exploiting an interaction between two different areas of mathematics. This process will naturally lead to new problems and related applications opening future directions of research. The project aims to make the subject more accessible to early career researchers through inclusive learning seminars delivered in a hybrid mode accompanied by expository writings, fostering collaboration and community along the way. The PI is committed to undergraduate mentoring and to promoting diversity. The project includes problems suitable for undergraduate research. <br/><br/>This project aims to study the nearby Lagrangian conjecture, using tools and ideas from algebraic K-theory and probe various K-theoretic aspects of the conjecture. One aspect concerns the normal invariant of nearby Lagrangians, which encodes the tangential obstruction for the projection of the nearby Lagrangian to the base, which is a simple homotopy equivalence, to be homotopic to a diffeomorphism. Using tools from parametrized Morse theory, algebraic K-theory, and stable homotopy theory it will be shown that the normal invariant of a nearby Lagrangian factors through an eta map, which in particular implies it is 2-torsion. This will constitute the first known restriction on the smooth structure of nearby Lagrangians (beyond the simple homotopy equivalence condition) when the base is not a homotopy sphere. Another aspect concerns the higher Whitehead torsion of nearby Lagrangians. This invariant is defined more generally for Legendrians in 1-jet spaces which admit generating functions on tube bundles (or even twisted tube bundles), and can be shown to be nontrivial for this class of Legendrians. A natural conjecture is that the higher Whitehead torsion of nearby Lagrangians vanishes, and to confirm this conjecture constitutes another goal of this project. An application would be a restriction on the stable isomorphism classes of tube bundles which may be used to generate nearby Lagrangians. A number of related questions will be studied along the way, such as the homotopical calculation needed to apply the h-principle for the simplification of caustics in this context (this is needed to show that we may take our generating families to be generalized Morse) as well as the interaction with the analogous Floer theoretic invariant. There are other K-theoretic aspects of the nearby Lagrangian conjecture which may be considered in this project once the above aspects are understood, such as the possibility of developing a 1-parametric Cerf-Hatcher-Wagoner theory for the difference function of nearby Lagrangians.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within this subject lies the theory of knots, loops of tangled string that are tied together at their ends, which has various connections to physics (via quantum theory and string theory), chemistry (via molecular knots), and biology (via DNA structure, with applications to drug design). To better understand knots and other geometric objects, topologists have invented tools called invariants. Some modern invariants are inspired by theoretical physics, such as gauge theory. On the one hand, these invariants have been successfully applied to solve many important and long-standing questions in topology; on the other hand, their behaviors are far from entirely understood. The goal of this research project is to further the development of modern invariants in terms of both theory and computation, harnessing their power to explore the link between low-dimensional topology and contact geometry, a related area of mathematics that has its roots in Newtonian mechanics and that has emerged as an exciting area of research in recent years. As part of this project, the investigator will provide research training to undergraduate and graduate students, make modern invariants accessible to a wide audience, and continue efforts in mathematical outreach.<br/> <br/>Floer theory, which encompasses instanton, monopole, and Heegaard Floer homologies, is a large package of invariants for three-manifolds and knots, as well as their cobordisms, that originate from gauge theory and symplectic geometry. In recent years, Heegaard Floer homology has been shown to be algorithmically computable, using combinatorial diagrams or bordered invariants. This project aims to harness the power of Floer invariants that comes from combining theory and computation, in several related directions. First, Floer theory provides information on the existence or non-existence of cobordisms between three-manifolds and between knots, with topological or geometric constraints. It is also known to be closely related to contact geometry, giving rise to invariants that certify tightness of a contact three-manifold, and distinguish smoothly isotopic knots that are not Legendrian isotopic. One goal of the project is to further extend these applications to cobordisms and contact geometry. To do so, the investigator aims to establish naturality results that will refine isomorphism class invariants to concrete homology group elements. The combinatorial diagrams involved will also shed light on the significant yet mysterious link between Floer theory and representation-theoretic invariants, which has been established in the form of spectral sequences. Similarly, the project also aims to advance bordered Floer invariants, which will activate more topological applications and significantly augment the use of the contact invariants above.

Several algebraic structures of interest, such as groups or vector spaces, consist of endowing a set with one or more operations subject to axioms. Often, interesting phenomena in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, and logic seem at first glance to be formalizable by one of such algebraic structures, although with a closer look one realizes that the equalities demanded by the axioms do not quite hold. Instead, the failure of the validity of the axioms is captured by the presence of a ""higher isomorphism,"" whose nature is clear in the specific contexts. To accommodate those situations, one needs to acknowledge the presence of higher structures and replace the role played by the usual equality relation with higher isomorphisms, organizing the information into a higher category of some kind. Many objects of interest have by now been identified to have a specific type of higher structure called an (infinity, n)-category. The research project will investigate multiple questions related to this. Broader impacts of this collaborative research will be through making the literature more accessible to the users of higher category theory. The PI plans to organize an online working group of students and early career researchers to explore the features of the various models. Resulting expository materials will be made available online.<br/> <br/>An (infinity, n)-category is a type of categorical structure with objects and morphisms in each dimension which are furthermore invertible above dimension n. While there is a general agreement about this schematic idea, numerous alternative mathematical implementations of the definition of an (infinity, n)-category have been proposed, each approach leading to its own advantages and disadvantages. At present, some models are expected but not known to be equivalent. Even when models have been shown to be abstractly equivalent, it is often not easy to export constructions and results from a model to another. This research project sets goals to advance knowledge both in terms of developing aspects of specific models and understanding how to relate different models. The projects aim to provide consistency results that are currently lacking from the existing (infinity, 2)-categorical literature, producing an accessible and well-documented account of the pool of models of (infinity, 2)-categories as well as how they relate to the strict 2-categorical literature. These include developing a theory of weighted limits in (infinity, 2)-categories, proving a comparison of (infinity, 2)-categorical nerves, and studying the compatibility of the Gray tensor product with such nerves. Further, building on current work of the PI with collaborators, one of the main long-term aims of the joint research is to establish the equivalence of n-complicial sets with all other main models of (infinity, n)-categories for n>2. A positive answer to this longstanding question is crucial to unifying various results in the context of the (infinity, n)-literature. Finally, the PI also plans to formalize explicitly the inductive and coinductive homotopy theories of (infinity, infinity)-categories, understanding how they relate with the existing literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Homology is a fundamental algebraic invariant which can distinguish spaces up to this equivalence.  For instance, the homology of the surface of a donut is different than that of the surface of a donut hole, and this implies that turning one of these surfaces into the other requires some cutting or gluing.  Homological invariants are generally difficult to compute, especially in higher dimensions.  Instead of computing them exactly, this project addresses questions about the growth rate of these invariants for naturally occurring sequences of spaces.  The proposed research concentrates on several long-standing conjectures on the topology of aspherical manifolds.  This project will also promote graduate and undergraduate education through mentoring and outreach. <br/><br/>More specifically, the primary goal of the research program is to study the growth of homological invariants in a residual tower of finite regular covers of an aspherical complex. The underlying motivation is a conjecture that linear growth of rational Betti numbers in such a tower should obstruct these complexes being homotopy equivalent to manifolds of a certain dimension.  The project will explore this conjecture and variants of it with rational homology replaced with mod p or integral homology. For instance, the PI plans to construct Gromov hyperbolic groups where the growth rate of Betti numbers depends on the field of coefficients, and locally CAT(-1), odd-dimensional manifolds with linear growth of mod p Betti numbers. Such manifolds will not virtually fiber over a circle, and the PI will further explore the connection between vanishing homological growth and the Bieri-Neumann-Strebel invariants (which encode algebraic analogues of such fibering).

This is especially true of symplectic geometry -- the geometry of phase spaces of classical mechanics, where points are ""too small"" to be relevant, and it is more natural to consider objects called Lagrangian submanifolds. These objects and their interactions are encoded by an algebraic structure (or ""non-commutative space"") called the Fukaya category. A remarkable mathematical conjecture inspired by ideas from theoretical physics, ""homological mirror symmetry"", asserts that Fukaya categories are in fact often equivalent to honest (commutative) spaces of the sort studied in algebraic geometry. This research project studies versions of Fukaya categories for symplectic manifolds equipped with one or more (commuting) functions and/or relative to certain directions at infinity. The rich structure of these categories, coming from the additional data, yields new ways of understanding the effect of various geometric constructions on the Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold; this in turn should greatly extend the range of settings in which homological mirror symmetry can be verified. The project will also provide research opportunities for several graduate students and generally aim to make this research area more accessible to the broader mathematical community.<br/><br/> From a technical standpoint, the first goal of this project is to develop a better geometric setup for partially wrapped Fukaya categories as they arise in mirror symmetry, to arrive at a formulation where computations are possible and the expected structural features are manifest. The other main goal is to use these foundations to give a general proof of homological mirror symmetry for (not necessarily Calabi-Yau) complete intersections in toric varieties, and to study canonical bases of their coordinate rings. Finally, this project will also bring conceptual clarity to the field by unifying different proposed constructions of partially wrapped Fukaya categories, finding new instances of functoriality in mirror symmetry, and studying the interplay between geometric constructions and categorical ones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This helped make rigorous many calculations in calculus and physics involving integrals of functions defined on spaces with ?holes.? Homology gives an algebraic measure of holes in geometric objects, allowing algebraic techniques to give geometric information, for example, showing that a given geometric object cannot be deformed into another one. The aim of this project is to study patterns in the homology of families of spaces coming from number theory and geometry. These patterns simplify homology calculations by reducing infinite calculations to finite calculations. In this project, new methods involving the use of computers in theoretical algebraic topology and number theory will be developed. The project will enhance graduate and postdoctoral training in algebraic topology through mentoring, seminars, and conferences. The PI will promote diversity and inclusion through participation in a summer bridge program designed for students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to better prepare them for graduate school.<br/><br/>This project aims to improve understanding of the homology of arithmetic groups, a central concept in number theory, algebraic K-theory, and even the theory of manifolds. In high dimensions, the homology is known to vanish, and, in low dimensions, the homology is known to stabilize. These stable homology groups have been completely calculated in many cases. The project focuses on two ranges of dimensions: just below where the homology is known to vanish and just above the stable range. Conjecturally, the highest degree homology groups should exhibit a pattern called ?extremal stability? and the homology near the stable range should exhibit a different pattern called ?secondary stability.? Highly connected simplicial complexes and operadic cells will be used to try to establish these conjectures. The connection with algebraic K-theory will be a key point of emphasis when studying the homology of arithmetic groups. Similar patterns will be investigated in spaces coming from geometric topology such as various moduli spaces and configuration spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By allowing for both in person and remote participation, the 55th STDC will be able to bring together a broad and diverse group of mathematicians to disseminate research and establish connections for future collaboration. The organizers expect to host more than 100 participants from the United States and from abroad on-site, as well as more than 100 remote participants.  A crucial part of the STDC is its involvement of researchers at all career stages?graduate students and early career researchers as well as established researchers?allowing for younger generations of mathematicians to find mentors and to establish their research trajectories. In addition, the STDC makes a conscious effort to promote diversity in mathematics in its recruitment of organizers and speakers, with a focus on ensuring representation of women and underrepresented minority groups. <br/><br/>The 55th STDC is structured around five special sessions, each with a focus on one aspect of topology?continuum theory, dynamical systems, geometric group theory, geometric topology, and set-theoretic topology. The invited and contributed talks of these special sessions and their associated plenary and semi-plenary speakers provide an opportunity for the announcement and discussion of the most significant advances in the various subfields of topology over the last year. In addition, the STDC reserves a plenary address for the winner of the annual Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher award, which is given to an early-career topologist with outstanding contributions to the field. This year, the STDC will also host a workshop on Linear Dynamics, a relatively young subfield of dynamics, aimed at graduate students and early-career mathematicians, as well as a series of open problem, collaboration, and mentoring sessions. These talks and activities provide an excellent framework for the establishment of new collaborative efforts in mathematical research and for encouraging full participation of graduate students and early career researchers.

Topology is a field of mathematics that studies properties of shapes which are preserved under deformations such as stretching, crumpling, and bending, but not tearing or gluing. Quantum field theories that only depend on topological properties of space, and not geometric ones such as length and angle, became a field of mathematics, known as topological field theory (TFT). This project constitutes a multifaceted investigation of TFTs in dimensions three, four, and higher, using new techniques which have only been fully developed in the past decade. The problems considered are of a foundational nature, and answers to these are expected to lead to new techniques and interactions among different fields of mathematics and have potential applications in physics. Graduate students are an important part of this research program; graduate education, mentoring as well as dissemination of the results to the broader community of scientists via lectures and workshops is a key broader impact of the project.<br/><br/>The PI's program will initially focus on recent advances relating TFT to the classification of smooth manifolds up to stable diffeomorphism. Special emphasis will be placed on 4-dimensional aspects and obtaining new examples of TFTs that distinguish homotopy equivalent manifolds. Another goal is to construct non-semisimple TFTs. Unlike the currently known examples, these have the potential to distinguish exotic smooth structures. A long-term goal of the program is to give a proof of the relative tangle hypothesis. This is the main missing part of Lurie?s proof of the cobordism hypothesis and fills a major gap in the proof of this important result.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Relationships between different dimensions arise in two ways. One way to study complicated 3- or 4-dimensional spaces is to decompose them into simpler pieces; the decomposition happens along lower-dimensional spaces, like surfaces. These are complicated versions of the principle that you cut a 3-dimensional watermelon by using a flat, 2-dimensional knife. Trying to do this leads one to ask in which ways low-dimensional spaces can sit inside high-dimensional ones. For example, 1-dimensional shoelaces can be knotted or unknotted; it was recently discovered that a 3-dimensional watermelon sitting in 4-space can also be knotted. This involves developing aspects of differential equations and abstract algebra. One long-term goal of the research project is to have a computer program that can compute certain subtle invariants of 4-dimensional spaces coming from counting solutions to differential equations from theoretical physics, the Seiberg-Witten equations. The grant will also support training graduate students in these topics, writing a book introducing some of them to graduate students and advanced undergraduates, outreach activities to share the excitement of geometry and topology with K-12 students, and a website to help other researchers use non-photorealistic raytracing to draw useful figures in their own papers.<br/><br/><br/>The research involves  a number of specific  projects. One is to further develop an extension of bordered Heegaard Floer homology to the ""minus"" version of Heegaard Floer homology. Bordered Heegaard Floer homology is a version of Heegaard Floer homology for 3-manifolds with boundary; many aspects of the theory are currently only defined for the simpler ""hat"" version of Heegaard Floer homology. Another is to develop new invariants of embedded non-orientable surfaces in 4-space, using variants on Khovanov homology. A third is to apply Floer homotopy theory to questions in equivariant 3-dimensional topology, and a fourth is to study relationships between Floer homology and the mapping class groups of surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manifolds arise naturally in physics (our universe as a 4-dimensional manifold), computer science (graphics), and biology (investigating how the shape and ""knottedness"" of molecules like DNA affect their function). In many ways, this subject is especially interesting for 4-dimensional spaces. Fortunately, a manifold can often be studied using the lower-dimensional manifolds that sit inside of it. Remarkably, several of the most important questions about 4-dimensional manifolds can be reduced to asking if a given knotted circle in 3-space arises as the boundary of a 2-dimensional disk in 4-space. This project aims to develop new techniques to tackle this latter problem and related questions, with a range of applications in 4-dimensional topology. Of particular interest are the disks and surfaces in 4-space that arise as solution sets to equations with two complex variables, known as ""complex plane curves"". Such surfaces exhibit surprising connections to foundational questions about 4-manifolds, as well as connections to other areas of mathematics, such as the mathematical theory of braids. In addition, aspects of the project aim to illuminate the connections between complex plane curves and important topological tools that have deep connections to mathematical physics. These projects include accessible entry points for undergraduate research.<br/><br/>The project is guided by three interrelated questions: (1) When does a knot in 3-space bound a disk (or another low-genus surface) in 4-space? (2) How unique is an embedded surface in a 4-manifold, up to isotopy? (3) Which smooth surfaces in complex manifolds are isotopic to complex curves? For all three questions, the PI aims to blend constructive techniques (such as handle calculus and branched coverings) to enhance the power of obstructive tools like Heegaard Floer homology and Khovanov homology. Further investigation of the cobordism maps in the aforementioned homology theories will help shed light on whether these tools can be used to detect pairs of orientable surfaces in 4-dimensional space that are ""exotically knotted"", i.e., isotopic through ambient homeomorphisms but not diffeomorphisms. In particular, the PI will use these homology theories to investigate uniqueness problems for complex curves. In addition, the PI will continue to develop topological techniques for studying complex curves in 4-space and other 4-manifolds, including novel techniques using singular foliations inspired by the theory of characteristic foliations in contact geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main objective of the event is to open new avenues of investigation and create opportunities for future collaborations. Participants will benefit from the unusual breadth of the conference, with outstanding experts engaging with early-career mathematicians and graduate students to promote cross-fertilization and cooperation across diverse disciplines. Organizers will pay special attention to recruitment from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The focus of this conference is on the unified themes underlying the study of fluids, quantum field theory, topology, and dynamical systems. A particular emphasis will be a reformulation of the equations of fluid motion in algebraic-topology terms. The lectures will emphasize the connections between various topics with exciting potential applications in mathematics and physics. Progress in these areas, including quantum field theory, the study of fluids, and their various offshoots, serve the national interest by sowing the foundations for applications that will benefit the larger public good.

A particularly successful approach, which has produced innumerable results since the 1950's, is computing algebraic invariants which are then studied through algebraic means. However, in many situations this way of transforming the problem hides some inherent geometric complexity - for example, one can deform one object to another, but only by making it very complicated somewhere in the middle. In such a case, the existence of a deformation may not be particularly meaningful from a physical, application-oriented point of view. In other cases, in contrast, one can always find a reasonably straightforward deformation, validating the use of algebraic methods for applications. The purpose of this project is to investigate these phenomena. Broader impacts of this project include research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The past few years have seen significant progress in the area of quantitative homotopy theory: understanding the complexity, typically measured by the Lipschitz constant, of objects, such as maps and homotopies, whose existence is guaranteed by algebraic topology.  This progress has been particularly pronounced for simply connected spaces. The current project will seek to harness this progress mainly in two ways.  The first goal is to obtain quantitative results about topics in geometric topology such as immersions, embeddings, and surgery theory.  Since these topics are usually studied via reduction to homotopy theory, this will also require a more geometric understanding of these reductions.  The second goal to apply the ideas of quantitative homotopy theory to studying the geometry of nilpotent groups, an area at the intersection of geometric group theory, sub-Riemannian geometry, and analysis on metric spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
