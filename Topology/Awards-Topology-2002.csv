An arsenal of <br/>techniques has been thrown at this problem; it is the focus of dozens of <br/>research groups. The most successful attempts have associated to each <br/>4-dimensional manifold the solution space to complex systems of <br/>equations that arise in particle physics: the Yang-Mills equations and <br/>the monopole equations of Seiberg and Witten. These solution spaces are <br/>useful in distinguishing cunningly constructed 4-dimensional manifolds. <br/>The result of this assault is that 4-dimensional manifolds are more <br/>complicated than we ever expected.  As a result, it is impossible to <br/>predict a classification scheme. It is the goal of this project to more <br/>systematically approach the existence and uniqueness framework for a <br/>classification scheme. The first goal is to understand why smooth <br/>structures on 4-manifolds are sensitive to local topological change. <br/>This project describes the underpinnings of how the smooth structures <br/>change in the known constructions. Log transformations on <br/>null-homologous tori are shown to play a significant role. The first <br/>step is to determine if two smooth structures on a fixed homeomorphism <br/>type of simply-connected smooth 4-manifold are related by a sequence of <br/>log transformations on null-homologous tori. The second step is to <br/>determine the characteristic numbers of irreducible smooth 4-manifolds <br/>and to determine how these topological invariants affect their <br/>Seiberg-Witten invariants. A notion of general-type smooth 4-manifolds <br/>is given and a conjectured restriction on their Seiberg-Witten <br/>invariants is proposed. This project outlines new constructions that <br/>show that there are general-type manifolds that fill out the regions <br/>determined by these restrictions. Careful investigation of these <br/>constructions should indicate why they are best possible. Other <br/>questions related to potential restrictions on the characteristic <br/>classes of irreducible simply-connected smooth 4-manifolds will be <br/>investigated.<br/><br/>Excitement has been generated by the idea that the puniest of all <br/>forces, gravity, may in fact be a strong as nature's other three <br/>fundamental forces: the strong force which binds protons and neutrons <br/>together in atomic nuclei; the weak force which governs radioactive <br/>decay; and the forces that govern electricity and magnetism. The <br/>perceived mismatch between these three forces and gravity creates a <br/>theoretical nightmare; it's the principle reason we have yet to find a <br/>grand unified theory. However, it has recently been hypothesized that <br/>this weakness is a mirage; the force of gravity only appears weak <br/>because its force is diluted in our own universe and most of gravity's <br/>force radiates out into extra dimensions. All other forces remain <br/>trapped in our 3-dimensional world, while gravity is free to roam other <br/>dimensions. With this hypothesis, there could be other worlds that are <br/>parallel to our own; they all neatly stack up, each oblivious of the <br/>other, with gravity the only force that moves between them. This would <br/>also account for the missing dark matter of our universe; it actually <br/>resides in other parallel universes. New mathematics will be generated <br/>in this project to further explore these ideas. Much of the relevant <br/>mathematics has already exposed the special nature of dimensions three <br/>and four. These parallel universes may be explained by the theory of <br/>(singular) foliations. The proposed study of singular foliations may <br/>structure the way in which we view our own universe -how we stack up <br/>with possible parallel universes. These singular foliations will also <br/>provide new insight into the classification of 4- dimensional <br/>manifolds.  At bottom, the goal of this project is to develop more <br/>systematic constructions of smooth 4-dimensional manifolds with the hope <br/>that a general picture begins to emerge that will at least suggest a <br/>classification scheme.<br/>"

Jaco<br/><br/>This project involves the development and use of efficient<br/>triangulations in the study and understanding of 3--manifolds. A<br/>triangulation of a 3-manifold determines a class of surfaces in the<br/>3--manifold called normal surfaces. A fundamental observation is that <br/>in most cases when a 3--manifold contains an interesting surface, then for<br/>any triangulation of the 3--manifold the same interesting feature is<br/>exhibited by a normal surface in the triangulation. This has provided a<br/>powerful method for studying 3-manifolds and solving certain decision<br/>problems. Normal surface theory has, for example, lead to the theoretical<br/>resolution of determining when two 3--manifolds, which contain injective<br/>surfaces, are homeomorphic, to the classification of these same manifolds,<br/>and to the determination of whether a knot in the three-sphere is the<br/>unknot. However, even with the presence of interesting normal surfaces, a<br/>given triangulation may have numerous uninteresting normal surfaces, which<br/>make theoretical arguments quite tedious and computational attempts nearly<br/>impossible. The guiding principle of efficient triangulations is reducing<br/>unnecessary normal surfaces and improving the efficiency of computations<br/>for triangulation based algorithms.  They have exhibited remarkable<br/>success in doing this. However, more surprisingly, efficient<br/>triangulations have exposed interesting relations between one-vertex and<br/>ideal triangulations of three-manifolds and new combinatorial structures,<br/>which seem to be intimately related to the topology of the three-manifold.<br/>This project will explore efficient triangulations with particular<br/>emphasis of their application to the Homeomorphism Problem/Classification<br/>Problem for three-manifolds and issues of computational complexity.<br/><br/>Low-dimensional topology brings together many areas of mathematical<br/>research and provides a common ground for interaction and advance across<br/>all of mathematics.

In this project he focuses attention on the low-dimensional homology groups of the general linear group over the coordinate ring of an elliptic curve over a number field with the goal of proving that the second K-group of such a curve has finite rank.  This extends Knudson's previous work on the homology of rank one groups over such rings.  In addition, a new homology theory based on algebraic cycles in the product of a scheme with the simplicial classifying scheme of an algebraic group is constructed and its properties investigated.  The hope is that this construction will lead to a proof of the Friedlander-Milnor conjecture concerning the homology of algebraic groups made discrete.  Also, the investigator's previous work on the structure of special linear groups over integral Laurent polynomial rings is used in the study of the Burau representation of the braid groups.  This representation is known to be faithful for three strings and unfaithful for five or more strings; the remaining case of four strings is singled out for study in this project.  Finally, Knudson studies the completion of a discrete group relative to a Zariski dense representation in a reductive group over a field of positive characteristic.  This generalizes the classical unipotent completion of a group and extends to positive characteristic R. Hain's work in characteristic zero.<br/><br/>A scheme is a geometric object constructed from solution sets of polynomial equations.  Algebraic K-theory associates to a scheme a sequence of groups which encode information about the scheme.  One aspect of this project is the study of the K-groups of an elliptic curve.  Such curves have remarkably rich structure and appear in various branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry and coding theory.  A seemingly unrelated part of this project concerns the so-called Burau representation of the braid groups which is intimately connected with knot theory.  These diverse topics are unified by studying the structure of groups of matrices with entries in various rings (the coordinate ring of the elliptic curve in the first case and the ring of integral Laurent polynomials in the second). The hope is to solve several outstanding conjectures about these objects.<br/><br/>"

The study of 3-manifolds is<br/>considerably more complex than that of surfaces.  Surfaces are<br/>completely classified, 3-manifolds are not.  In fact, it is at present<br/>unknown whether 3-manifolds can be classified (in an algorithmic<br/>sense).  It is known that 4-manifolds cannot be classified.

The methods for this investigation include a counting<br/>technique developed by M. Scharlemann and the P.I along with the<br/>notion of an orbifold Heegaard splitting.  The methods further include<br/>the notion of untelescoping of Heegaard splittings, Cerf theory, thin<br/>position arguments, and the analysis of foliations induced by Morse<br/>functions corresponding to Heegaard splittings or untelescopings of<br/>Heegaard splittings.

This part of the project, joint with Dennis <br/>Sullivan, generalizes the work pioneered by Chas and Sullivan <br/>in the case n=1, i.e., that of a usual free loop space. Another <br/>goal is to establish connection between Chas-Sullivan's work and Gromov-Witten invariants, which we believe to be a holomorphic <br/>version of Chas-Sullivan's algebraic structure.

Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture predicts that points <br/>in  the entire space AH(M) can be classified by topological data <br/>(coming from the marked homeomorphism type of the hyperbolic <br/>3-manifold) and geometric data (which encodes the asymptotic <br/>geometry of the ends.) Yair Minsky has made substantial progress <br/>towards the resolution of Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture <br/>in the case that M has incompressible boundary. Prof. Canary will <br/>collaborate with Jeff Brock and Yair Minsky on a program to <br/>complete the proof of this conjecture and a number of related <br/>conjectures. Recent work, by Anderson, Brock, Bromberg, Canary, <br/>Holt, McCullough and McMullen, has revealed surprising new <br/>phenomena concerning the global topology of AH(M). Components of <br/>the interior may bump (i.e. have intersecting closures) and <br/>individual components may bump themselves. Prof. Canary proposes <br/>to further study the global topology of AH(M).

It is the interplay of <br/>these tools which gives the subject its rich flavor. A 2-dimensional<br/>manifold or surface is a space which looks locally like 2-dimensional<br/>Euclidean space; examples are given by the surfaces of familiar <br/>3-dimensional objects such as doughnuts. Similarly, a 3-manifold <br/>is a space that looks locally like 3-dimensional Euclidean space.  <br/>A Riemannian metric is a way of measuring distances and angles in <br/>a manifold.  For example, the universe we live in is a 3-manifold <br/>with a Riemannian metric.  Surfaces were classified in the 19th <br/>century, and it was shown that all surfaces admit a beautiful <br/>Riemannian metric of one of three types: Euclidean, spherical or <br/>hyperbolic. The study of all possible such metrics on a fixed <br/>surface was begun in the 19th century and has played a key role<br/>in topology, complex analysis, Riemannian geometry and algebraic <br/>geometry. Thurston revolutionized the study of 3-manifolds by <br/>conjecturing, and proving in many cases, that every 3-manifold<br/>may be canonically decomposed into pieces which admit metrics of<br/>one of 8 geometric types.  Hyperbolic metrics are the most common <br/>and least understood class of such metrics.  Prof. Canary will <br/>study the space of all hyperbolic metrics on a fixed 3-manifold.<br/>"

A study of geodesics within the complex of<br/>curves then allows us to construct a model for the geometry of the<br/>3-manifold which depends only on its end invariants.  Part of the<br/>program is joint work with Brock and Canary.  The complex of curves is<br/>also instrumental in studying the Teichmuller space of hyperbolic<br/>structures on a surface, and its symmetry group, known as the Mapping<br/>Class Group. Hyperbolicity of the complex implies a type of relative<br/>hyperbolicity property for the Teichmuller space and the Mapping Class<br/>Group, and in collaboration with Brock and Masur, Minsky hopes to<br/>apply this to study the geometric properties of Teichmuller space, and<br/>to answer a number of group-theoretic and algorithmic questions about<br/>the mapping class group.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Topological spaces appear in mathematics at varying levels of<br/>abstraction. The earth, for example, can be thought of as a sphere,<br/>spinning around its axis. The set of all positions of this sphere,<br/>perhaps as parameterized by the time of day in New York, can itself be<br/>visualized as a circle.  The positions of the earth in its orbit<br/>around the sun also make up a circle, and all this information<br/>together can be described by a 2-dimensional surface, called a torus,<br/>so that each point in the torus corresponds to exactly one position of<br/>the earth-sun system, and our motion in space gives rise to a<br/>trajectory winding around the torus.  Once a surface is being studied,<br/>we often give it various structures: it can have a metric, which is a<br/>way of measuring distance in it; it can also be filled up in different<br/>ways by loops. The set of all possible metrics can itself be studied<br/>as a ""space"", where motion in this space corresponds to changing<br/>shapes of the surface. The set of all loops in the surface gives<br/>rise to another space, of a more combinatorial character.  A<br/>fascinating phenomenon, not uncommon in mathematics, is the appearance<br/>of analogies between these different levels of abstraction. For<br/>example, a property of a single metric on a surface called ""hyperbolicity""<br/>appears again, in another guise, as a property of the space of all<br/>metrics on the surface and the space of all loops. The interaction<br/>between these different levels yields interesting phenomena and tools<br/>which can be applied to solve a number of problems in<br/>"

Now in its 36th year, this is the largest annual <br/>topology conference in the US. It has a broad scope that <br/>encompasses set-theoretic and general topology, continuum<br/>theory and dynamical systems, geometric group theory and <br/>geometric topology. It thus provides a unique forum for <br/>researchers in a wide range of disciplines within topology. <br/>There will be eight invited plenary one-hour lectures of a semi-expository nature, given by leading researchers in the <br/>areas covered. There will also be twenty invited half-hour <br/>lectures, together with 15-minute contributed talks, held in<br/>four parallel sessions. The invited speakers have been <br/>selected with the help of an advisory committee of experts <br/>in the various subfields.<br/><br/>Topology is one of the major subdisciplines of mathematics, <br/>and, at just over a hundred years old, the youngest. It <br/>originated with Henri Poincare around 1900, who introduced <br/>it as a means of describing the qualitative behavior of <br/>certain physical systems (for example, our solar system),<br/>whose complexity renders a precise quantitative analysis <br/>too difficult.  The wide range covered by the subject today <br/>is well represented by the Conference. General topology deals <br/>with the abstract properties of topological spaces; set-theoretic<br/>topology impinges upon the logical foundations of mathematics. <br/>The study of dynamical systems is close to Poincare's original motivation, and deals with the behavior of various iterative <br/>processes. These often give rise to complex objects, continua,<br/>which are studied in their own right. Geometric topology <br/>deals with manifolds, objects which are locally like <br/>n-dimensional Euclidean space, but whose global structure <br/>might be quite complicated. For instance, there is a lot <br/>of current activity in 3-dimensional topology, whose goal is<br/>essentially to describe all theoretically possible <br/>3-dimensional universes. Rich connections have recently <br/>been discovered between this subject and quantum physics, <br/>while on the other hand topological techniques from the <br/>theory of knots in 3-dimensional space have recently <br/>been applied to the study of DNA. Finally, geometric <br/>group theory, a relatively new subject, studies groups, <br/>which are algebraic objects, from a topological point of view; <br/>this is leading to deep connections between topology and <br/>algebra. The interaction at the Conference between workers <br/>in all these different branches of topology is expected to <br/>be very fruitful.<br/>"

In turn, mathematical physics has led Representation Theorists to new conjectures, interesting generalizations, and fascinating results.  Invariants of knots and links such as the polynomials of Kauffman and Jones arise as the trace of representations of certain algebras (Hecke algebras, Birman-Wenzl-Murakami algebras, group algebras of braid groups).

It is ironic that<br/>manifolds of dimension three and four are least well understood. One would<br/>guess that our intuition should be strongest in these dimensions. A knot<br/>is a closed loop in a 3-manifold. A link is a collection of closed loops<br/>in a 3-manifold.  In 1900, Hilbert gave a famous list of problems for<br/>mathematicians to study. His sixteenth problem concerns the topology of<br/>real algebraic curves in the real projective plane, It is still unsolved<br/>but it has lead to many beautiful developments and partial solutions.<br/>Hilbert asked how the components (called ovals) of the set of zeros of a<br/>nonsingular real homogenous polynomial of given degree can be arranged in<br/>the plane, if the number of these ovals is maximal for the given degree.<br/>This project further studies certain type of links to make progress on<br/>Hilbert's problem and related questions."

Second, Parabolic <br/>coupled systems: a Morse-theoretic homotopy index for braids <br/>will be used to solve parabolic variational problems arising in pattern-formation PDE's, discrete Lagrangian mechanics, and <br/>coupled oscillators. A Floer-theoretic extension of the braid <br/>index will also be developed for infinite dimensional systems. <br/>Third, Hydrodynamics: tools from contact geometry and topology <br/>will be directed toward solving global problems of the dynamics <br/>and stability of Eulerian fluid flows in dimensions higher <br/>than two.  <br/><br/>In most systems of interest in science and engineering, <br/>multiple cooperative tasks must be globally coordinated. <br/>A common thread is that whether the tasks involve <br/>macro-scale robots, micro-scale devices, coupled oscillators, <br/>or fluid particles, there is an abstract space of configurations<br/>lurking behind the physical phenomena.

This<br/>conjecture says that if any finite collection of disks in the<br/>Euclidean plane is rearranged so that the distance between any<br/>pair of centers does not increase, then the area of the union<br/>does not increase and the area of the interesection does not<br/>decrease.  They have solved the conjecture in the plane, but many<br/>higher-dimensional questions remain.  For example, there is a<br/>candidate for a configuration that might be a counterexample for<br/>the analogous statement in three-space, and there are some<br/>interesting possible differences between the case for a union of<br/>disks and the intersection of disks.  Another major topic is the<br/>study of linkages in the plane that are locked in the sense that<br/>they can only move a small amount without crossing.  The theory<br/>of frameworks and tensegrities plays an important role here and<br/>can be applied to give reasonable criteria to detect when such a<br/>linkage is locked.  This is continuing work of the investigator,<br/>Erik Demaine, and Gunter Rote, who originally solved the<br/>carpenter's rule problem, which states that any polygonal arc can<br/>be opened without creating any self-intersection.<br/>     The investigator works on certain basic, fundamental<br/>questions about the geometry of discrete objects.  Just as<br/>physics asks fundamental questions about the nature of matter,<br/>space, and the universe, and the physical laws they must obey,<br/>geometry asks fundamental questions about how geometric objects<br/>interact and the implicit constraints they satisfy.  How does the<br/>area of the union of round disks change as the centers are moved<br/>apart?  The investigator (with Karoly Bezdek) has shown that the<br/>area behaves (it increases or stays the same) as expected in the<br/>plane, but the situation in space is not so clear.  When is a<br/>robot arm in the plane rigid, and when can it be opened?  The<br/>investigator (with Erik Demaine and Gunter Rote) has shown that<br/>arms open as expected in the plane, but what about more<br/>complicated linkages?  What can be said about the rigidity of<br/>packings of round balls as a granular material?  The investigator<br/>is an expert in such matters, but there are delicate questions<br/>about the rigidity in a container with a small number of disks.<br/>The volume enclosed by a flexible surface is constant, but what<br/>about other geometric invariants? These are concrete tangible<br/>objects, but accessible to the appropriate geometric insight.<br/>These questions are both relevant and potentially quite useful<br/>for subjects as wide-ranging as cell biology, protein folding,<br/>kinematics, and granular materials.  For example, it is widely<br/>believed that the geometric structure of a cell has a great deal<br/>to do with its function.  So the rigidity of appropriate discrete<br/>objects is relevant.  As has been shown over and over again in<br/>physics and mathematics, if the questions are to the point,<br/>applications follow.<br/><br/>"

Block<br/><br/>In recent years there has been an explosion of interest in the<br/>applications of large scale or ""coarse"" methods in geometry, <br/>topology, index theory and group theory. For many topological <br/>and geometric problems of interest, this large-scale structure <br/>is relevant in answering them. The Principal Investigator will <br/>study three such instances. First, on a singular space, phenomena <br/>are affected not only by the global fundamental group, but also<br/>by a local picture of the fundamental group. The fundamental <br/>groups of the link of a stratum changes from stratum to stratum <br/>and affects the topological behavior of the space, in particular, <br/>the classification of stratified spaces must take into account <br/>this behavior. The PI proposes to study via operator K-theory<br/>how the index theory of the strata of singular spaces <br/>(as non-compact manifolds) fit together to give an index <br/>theory for the singular space itself.  Second, the PI <br/>proposes to study more generally quantitative aspects <br/>of homology theory, taking into account such issues as the <br/>images of the homology of balls of a given size in the homology <br/>of a non-compact manifold.  Applications to existence of <br/>infinitely many null-homotopic geodesics are proposed. Third, <br/>the large-scale / small-scale duality between a discrete group<br/>and its unitary representation theory has been studied under <br/>the rubric of the Baum-Connes conjecture. The PI, motivated by <br/>his work in large scale geometry proposes a broader study of <br/>this duality. This requires the development of tools from <br/>algebraic geometry (especially moduli space theory) to <br/>apply to infinite dimensional unitary representations. <br/>These tools place families of representations at the fore, <br/>which as two effects. First, families of representations <br/>seem to be more rigid then single ones. And secondly, one <br/>can concentrate ones attention on specific parts of the <br/>representation theory. Thus, the PI demonstrates, in several<br/>situations, that for lattices in Lie groups, the<br/>representation theory in an infinitesimal neighborhood <br/>of the trivial representation coincide for the lattice and <br/>the ambient group. A second type of question proposed by the <br/>PI are called reconstruction problems.  When can one reconstruct representations on the ambient group knowing its values on the<br/>lattice? The PI views this as a version of the Sampling theorem <br/>from signal processing.<br/><br/>Large scale geometry is the study of spaces as seen from an increasingly distant perspective. For many problems in geometry <br/>and topology, the phenomena at a small or moderate scale only <br/>obscure the situation and the large scale perspective shines <br/>the essential light on the subject: seeing the forest for the<br/>trees.  This proposal focuses the attention of large-scale <br/>geometry on problems in index theory and representation theory <br/>of discrete groups. Students of PI and his collaborators are <br/>involved at various stages of the project. The developments <br/>and anticipated results are intended as a bridge between <br/>algebraic and geometric topology, harmonic analysis and <br/>functional analysis. This should provide a clearer understanding <br/>of all these subjects and enhance the interaction between <br/>the experts in them.<br/>"

The basic goal is to develop <br/>a method for describing spaces in terms of numbers and other <br/>algebraic objects, in the expectation that this will make it<br/>possible to quantify the subtle geometric characteristics of <br/>spaces, and allow for the study of relationships betweens <br/>spaces of various types.

The space of all such homotopy equivalences, <br/>called Outer space, is a contractible space on which the <br/>group of outer automorphisms of a free group acts properly<br/>discontinuously.  Analyzing the quotient of Outer space by <br/>this action has yielded a significant amount of algebraic <br/>information about this group over the years.  More recently,<br/>work of Maxim Kontsevich has  related the rational homology <br/>of this quotient to the homology of a certain <br/>infinite-dimensional Lie algebra, consisting of derivations <br/>of the free Lie algebra.   Kontsevich also defined variations <br/>of this infinite-dimensional Lie algebra whose homologies <br/>are related to the homology of mapping class groups and to<br/>Kontsevich's graph homology, which is a homology <br/>theory containing various 3-manifold and knot invariants.  <br/>The Principal Investigator will use this point of view to <br/>obtain new information about invariants of these groups <br/>of classical interest to topologists; conversely, topological <br/>methods will be applied to obtain new information about <br/>these Lie algebras and their homology.  In particular, new <br/>Lie bi-algebra structures on the chain complexes used to<br/>compute graph homology, recently discovered by Jim Conant <br/>the the Principal Investivator,  will be investivated. <br/>Finally,  the local geometry of Outer space will be studied.  <br/>Certain neighborhoods in Outer space are non-positively <br/>curved metric spaces, and can be identified with spaces <br/>of finite labelled metric trees.  Such trees are of interest <br/>in many branches of science, including biology, where they <br/>appear as evolutionary trees produced from DNA data. Another <br/>aim of this project is to determine efficient algorithms for <br/>finding geodesics in this space, and to continue from there <br/>to develop a program of applying statistical methods to this <br/>space of trees.  <br/><br/>Graphs and trees appear in many contexts in the sciences and <br/>in mathematics.  In Geometric Group Theory  a space of graphs <br/>known as Outer space, originally defined by Marc Culler and <br/>the Principal Investigator,  has been used extensively to <br/>study the group of outer automorphisms of a finitely <br/>generated free group.  In this project the Principal <br/>Investigator will continue to study how the geometry of <br/>this space is related to algebraic properties of the group <br/>of automorphisms. A new perspective on this problem is <br/>provided by work of M. Kontsevich; motivated by <br/>considerations from physics and symplectic geometry, <br/>Kontsevich defined various abstract infinite-dimensional <br/>algebraic structures whose invariants  are closely related <br/>to invariants of Outer space.  Finally, small regions of <br/>Outer space can be identified with spaces of finite trees.  <br/>Such trees are used as a tool by evolutionary biologists, <br/>and another focus of this project is understanding the <br/>local geometry of these regions in a very concrete, <br/>algorithmic way which can be applied to problems in<br/>molecular phylogenetics.<br/><br/><br/>"

The principal investigator, together with his colleagues Robert MacPherson and Robert Kottwitz, have discovered that the kappa-orbital integrals which occur in the fundamental lemma may be expressed as the trace of Frobenius acting on the cohomology of an ""affine Springer fiber"".  So the (conjectured) fundamental lemma is equivalent to a (fairly complicated) statement concerning the structure of the cohomology groups of affine Springer fibers.  (An affine Springer fiber is the fixed point set, on the flag manifold of a loop group, or of a Kac-Moody Lie group, of the vectorfield which is determined by a semisimple element in the Lie algebra of the group.  These researchers have been able to prove the required cohomological statement for affine Springer fibers which are associated to elements <br/>in unramified tori in the loop group.  They are addressing the many technical problems associated with understanding the homology of affine Springer fibers associated to elements of ramified tori.<br/><br/>In the 1970's, R. Langlands (of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton N.J.) developed an elaborate theory, indicating that there should be deep and hidden connections between several widely separated areas in mathematics:  number theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, and automorphic forms.  He showed, for example, how results from representation theory could be used to deduce results in number theory.  This vision was so far-reaching and broad in scope that it became known as ""Langlands' program"", and it is perhaps the mathematician's version of ""grand unification"".  However, most of this program was conjectural and to some degree, even speculative.  Progress on these conjectures was slow at first, as research in this subject demands an understanding of several different, highly technical branches of mathematics.  Nevertheless, after decades of research by scores of dedicated and talented mathematicians worldwide, enormous progress has been made on Langlands' conjectures.  For example, Andrew Wiles' celebrated proof of ""Fermat's Last Theorem"" depends in an essential way on some of these results.  However, one step in this program, which was originally felt to be a relatively minor one, has turned out to be one of the most difficult questions in<br/>the area: the so-called ""fundamental lemma"" (and its generalization, the Langlands-Shelstad conjecture).  While the supporting evidence for this conjecture is overwhelming, the conjecture has only been proven, after Herculean efforts, in a handful of special cases.  It is a stubborn obstacle which threatens to indefinitely delay further progress in the area.  The principal investigator and his colleagues Robert MacPherson (Institute for Advanced Study) and Robert Kottwitz (University of Chicago) have discovered that the Langlands-Shelstad conjecture may be restated in terms of the geometrical properties of certain objects (""affine Springer fibers"") which have recently attracted the attention of mathematicians for completely different reasons.  Using these geometric techniques, the investigator and his colleagues expect to outline a proof for the Langlands-Shelstad conjecture in a broad class of cases, the so-called ""unramified"" cases.  They are also addressing the many difficulties involved with the remaining ""ramified"" cases.  It is expected that this exciting connection between Langlands' program and ""Springer theory"" will lead to new developments in both subjects.<br/>"

The first main theme of the <br/>proposed research is Legendrian knots. Legendrian knots are knots that are tangent to <br/>a contact structure and seem to encode a great deal of information about the contact <br/>structure. For example, the famed tight vs. overtwisted dichotomy in dimension three <br/>can be understood in terms of Legendrian knots. These knots also give an important invariant <br/>of a contact structure. As part of this proposal the general structure of Legendrian knots <br/>will be studied. The expected outcome will be various classification result for certain <br/>Legendrian knots and contact structures; and, moreover, a better understanding of Legendrian <br/>surgery (an important surgery construction of contact structures). Legendrian knots in <br/>higher dimensions will also be studied using contact homology. There is very little known <br/>about contact structures, or Legendrian knots, in dimensions above three. By investigating <br/>Legendrian knots in these dimensions the nature of contact structures should be illuminated, <br/>just as the corresponding study revealed much about three dimensional contact structures. <br/>The final part of the proposed research centers on the connection between contact structures <br/>and hydrodynamics discovered a few years ago by the Principal Investigator and R. Ghrist. <br/>Here work with Ghrist will continue with the aim of understanding when, and what type of, <br/>closed flow lines occur in fluid flows. We shall also study hydrodynamic instability from <br/>the contact topological perspective. This naturally leads into the study of energy minimization <br/>for fluid flows and relations between contact and Riemannian geometry.<br/><br/>Contact structures are very natural objects, born over two centuries ago, in the work of Huygens, <br/>Hamilton and  Jacobi on geometric optics. Through the centuries contact structures have touched <br/>on many diverse areas of mathematics and physics, including classical mechanics and thermodynamics. <br/>In everyday life one encounters contact geometry when ice skating, parallel parking a car, <br/>navigating a submarine, using a refrigerator, or simply watching the beautiful play of light in a <br/>glass of water. Many great mathematicians have devoted a lot of their work to this subject  but <br/>only in the last decade or two has it moved into the foreground of mathematics. This renaissance <br/>is due to the recent remarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and beautiful  <br/>theory with many applications. The most remarkable feature of all this recent work is the intimate <br/>connections between contact structures and topology in dimension three. Moreover, there were <br/>important newfound interactions with Hamiltonian mechanics, symplectic and sub-Riemannian geometry, <br/>foliation theory, complex geometry and analysis, topological hydrodynamics, and knot theory. The <br/>Principal Investigator will explore new connections between contact structures and topology in all <br/>(odd) dimensions and continue his study of idealized fluid flows (hydrodynamics) via contact geometry.<br/>"
