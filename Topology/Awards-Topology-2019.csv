Smooth topology uses the tools of calculus to understand and classify these spaces; intriguingly, different dimensions behave very differently when looked at through the lens of calculus. Most surprisingly, foundational problems have been solved in dimensions less than and greater than four, but stubbornly resist attack in the space-time in which we actually live. This project brings together a group of researchers, with a diverse set of skills and experience, to help tackle these fundamental problems in smooth four-dimensional topology, by utilizing a key new idea about how to decompose (trisect) four-dimensional spaces into elementary building blocks. In particular, the study of trisections allows exporting many successful ideas from three-dimensional topology to four-dimensional topology. Along with the study of four-dimensional spaces in their own right, the investigators will also study the ways in which lower-dimensional spaces can be embedded in dimension four, in analogy with the study of knots as embeddings of circles in three-dimensional space. Using these tools and analogies, this focused research group aims to develop new ways to distinguish four-dimensional objects, new four-dimensional constructions, and new applications of four-dimensional results to topology and geometry in other settings and dimensions.<br/><br/>The smooth topology of four-dimensional manifolds remains one of the greatest mysteries in topology, as evidenced by open questions such as the Poincare and Schoenflies conjectures, which have been solved in all dimensions other than four.  This focused research group aims to breathe new life into this important field of study by exploiting a striking new perspective on four-manifolds: Every four-manifold decomposes into three simple pieces, and this trisection is unique up to a natural stabilization. The setup exactly parallels the three-dimensional theory of Heegaard splittings, setting the table for an interesting and valuable exchange of ideas between dimensions three and four.  Many extremely rich theories have been developed over the last few decades in low-dimensional topology, such as contact topology, Heegaard Floer homology, Heegaard splittings and bridge splittings, Khovanov homology, Dehn surgery, curve complexes, and thin position. These ideas now have the potential to interact with the theory of trisections. The focus of this project is the development of these connections into a comprehensive theory that solves important problems in four-dimensional topology."

There will be a summer school June 3-7 with several lecture series to provide background material for early career participants in the conference. The overall goal of the conference is to study interactions between the two areas of mathematics in the title. <br/><br/>""Topology"" is the study of shapes that are allowed to stretch and bend. For example, a triangle and circle are considered to be topologically equivalent because one can be stretched into the other, and similarly a cube and sphere are considered topologically equivalent. ""Low dimensional topology"" studies shapes or objects in dimensions 2, 3, and 4, such as surfaces, or knotted loops in 3-dimensional space. This can be useful in other sciences; for example, DNA can be knotted, or the shape of the universe could have a nontrivial topology. ""Representation theory"" is the study of symmetries in mathematics, and at a concrete level, these symmetries often manifest themselves as solutions to systems of equations where the variables represent matrices instead of numbers. This mathematical area has also had applications in other sciences, such as symmetries of elementary particles in physics, or symmetries of molecules in<br/>chemistry. There are sophisticated mathematical techniques for taking certain spaces of solutions to polynomial equations and producing solutions to matrix equations, and recently low dimensional topology has been used to find solutions to the same equations, using completely different mathematical constructions. One of the goals of the conference is to understand this new phenomenon using ideas coming from mathematical physics. This award will fund participation of early career US scientists in this summer school and conference so they can learn about these exciting new ideas.More details about the conference are available at https://www.icms.org.uk/geometricrepresentation.php.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will also seed the development of a community, with particular emphasis on stimulating the growth of young mathematicians via networking, professional development opportunities, and exposure to state of the art scientific content. The scientific program is organized both to foster communication between mathematicians from a class of underrepresented groups and to bridge divides between adjacent subjects in and around the areas of geometry, topology and dynamics. There are strong ties between low-dimensional topology and both symplectic and hyperbolic geometry. These subjects are in turn tied to Teichmueller theory, dynamics, and algebra, and differential geometry and algebraic topology permeate all of these subfields. There are many deep relationships between these different fields, and the conference aims to explore these ties and create new connections.<br/><br/>The conference is devoted to new developments and interactions between low-dimensional topology, geometry, and dynamics. The program spans geometric and algebraic topology, hyperbolic and symplectic geometry, the geometry and topology of surfaces, Teichmueller theory, geometric group theory, and dynamics. Highlights of topics covered include: the relationship between the hyperbolic structures on 3-manifolds and the algebra of their fundamental groups; the relationship between 3- and 4-dimensional geometric topology and the algebra of cobordism and concordance; the influence of combinatorial structures such as the complex of curves on the geometry of Teichmueller space; the foundations and geometry of symplectic manifolds; the interaction of algebra, arithmetic, and analysis in dynamics.

As it turns out, solving such systems exactly is, apart from a few very special cases, essentially impossible. We thus attempt to describe the solution sets more qualitatively. One classically fruitful approach to this is to consider the set of solutions as a topological space, an object sitting in some higher dimensional space.  For instance, the equation x^2+y^2=1 describes a circle of radius 1.  Topologists have invented invariants for qualitatively describing topological spaces, and we can just attempt to work out these invariants for the special spaces we are interested in. Taking this idea to its extreme, one arrives at a field called motivic homotopy theory. It provides novel ways for qualitatively describing solutions of systems of polynomial equations, and has in the past twenty years been successfully applied to several longstanding open problems in algebraic geometry.  This project aims to deepen our understanding of motivic homotopy theory by exploring further not only its parallels with classical topology, but also what happens where these parallels break down.<br/><br/>This project consists of several parts. One set of parts explores properties of motivic highly structured ring spectra, called normed spectra (introduced in collaboration with M. Hoyois).  The Principal Investigator (P.I.) will (1) study power operations in normed spectra and deduce splitting results for normed spectra of positive characteristic and stability results for the motivic homology of symmetric groups and (2) construct further normed spectra, such as a normed spectrum structure on the motivic spectrum KO representing hermitian K-theory.  Another set of parts explores the passage from unstable to stable motivic homotopy theory. Specifically the P.I. will (3) study the motivic Barratt-Priddy-Quillen map, and (4) study an unstable motivic homology Whitehead theorem.  These goals will be achieved by using techniques from higher category theory, classical stable homotopy theory, algebraic topology and algebraic geometry. The results in parts (1) and (2) can be used to more effectively study algebraic varieties using cohomology theories; for example by exploiting the cohomology operations present in theories represented by normed spectra. Parts (3) and (4) are more useful for studying the motivic (stable) homotopy category itself, and hence the totality of all cohomology theories for algebraic varieties at once.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Murray and J. von Neumann as a mathematical tool to understand particle physics. Subsequently, it became an independent discipline that has stimulated the development of powerful mathematical theories and bringing valuable insight to physics (statistical mechanics), biology (DNA structure), and engineering (cell phone network design). Von Neumann algebras are highly interdisciplinary in nature as they arise canonically from simpler mathematical structures, such as symmetries and actions, often present in many areas of mathematics. Over time their study remained closely connected with various topics in dynamical systems, measured group theory, and more recently geometric group theory. This project investigates several major open problems inspired by the rich interaction between operator algebras and the aforementioned fields.<br/><br/>This research project explores new horizons in the classification of group von Neumann algebras. The first objective of the project is to advance Connes' rigidity conjecture, a major wide-open problem predicting that ICC property (T) groups are completely recognizable from their von Neumann algebras (W*-superrigid). The PIs proposed several natural constructions of W*-superrigid property (T) groups based on new developments in geometric group theory and deformation/rigidity theory. The second objective of the project revolves around the study of prime II1 factors. The main focus is to understand the relationship between various manifestations of negative curvature in group theory and primeness aspects of the corresponding group factor. The results arising from this project are expected to reveal significant cross-pollination between, geometric group theory, ergodic theory, random walks, C*-algebras, and von Neumann algebras. The PIs intend to organize a series of workshops aimed at stimulating collaboration between experts in these fields. To promote the career development of graduate students the proposal also involves a student exchange program between the participating institutions aimed at exposing students to different expertise and research environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The former is the language in which many physical theories are formulated, while the latter studies the shapes of three- and four-dimensional spaces. It is common to apply knowledge of geometry to predict the behavior of physical systems. For example, it is straightforward to predict the sound of a drum from its shape. The opposite approach is sometimes also feasible; in particular, the study of differential equations originating from gauge theories can lead to very deep insights about the topology of spaces. In recent ground-breaking work, Ciprian Manolescu disproved the almost hundred-year-old Triangulation conjecture, which roughly asserted that in higher dimensions, every space can be cut into very simple pieces. The main goal of this project is to use the PI's recently developed computational techniques to understand in greater detail several properties of the object studied by Manolescu, called the three-dimensional homology cobordism group.<br/><br/>This project has two main goals. First, to explore the properties of Pin(2)-monopole Floer homology, a package of invariants of three-manifolds defined in analogy to Manolescu's construction within the Morse-theoretic framework of Kronheimer and Mrowka. The Pin(2)-symmetry is reflected in an extremely rich A-infinity structure on these invariants, and we will focus on understanding the higher operations and their implications for natural topological operations such as connected sums. Second, to apply these tools to study problems in low-dimensional topology, focusing particularly on the homology cobordism group in dimension three. Very little is known about this group, especially regarding the existence of torsion, and Pin(2)-monopole Floer homology may provide an avenue to solve many of these problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award will support the attendance of approximately 30 US-based mathematicians at the conference. <br/><br/>Geometric group theory is a relatively recently recognized subfield of mathematics emerging from Gromov's work in the 1980s, which put the classical treatment of groups as geometric objects in a far broader context. The field is now quite large, and has interactions with many different fields of mathematics including low-dimensional topology, the topology of manifolds, complex dynamics, combinatorial group theory, logic and the study of various classical families of groups. The central idea of geometric group theory is to study a group through an action (typically an isometric one) on some space (typically a metric space) and then use properties of the space to deduce properties of the group. Perhaps the most successful instance of this is when the space has some form of negative curvature. While classically curvature is a concept of Riemannian geometry, another central insight of Gromov is that many properties of spaces of negative curvature in Riemannian geometry have ""coarse"" analogues and that this is the natural setting to study the geometry of groups. The study of groups that act on spaces with coarse versions of non-positive and negative curvature will be the focus of this week long conference.

More complicated geometric objects can be constructed by fitting these spheres together, but spheres of different dimensions can fit together in only certain combinations.  Enumerating these combinations of spheres is one of the fundamental questions of stable homotopy theory.  This problem is known as the computation of homotopy groups of spheres. The project uses spectral sequences to carry out these computations.  They are delicate, intricate, subtle, and complicated, but they are also understandable with enough insight and patience.  Each time a new part of the machinery is understood, another layer of complexities becomes accessible for further study.  Computer calculations play a large supporting role. The project promotes the use of videoconferencing to collaborate with peers, to advise graduate students, and to host online seminars.  These efforts build towards a self-sustaining virtual mathematical research community.  One major benefit of these new modes of interaction is that they erode traditional barriers to entry.  This is especially beneficial for people in remote geographical locations and for those with non-traditional or non-prestigious backgrounds who are not typically afforded access to traditional departments of mathematics.<br/><br/>The project will compute classical, C-motivic, R-motivic, and C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups.  The key tools are the Adams spectral sequence, the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, and the effective slice spectral sequence. The project consists of a series of interlocking problems, both algebraic and homotopical.  Many of the problems suggest specific methods for obtaining calculational data about stable homotopy groups.  Other problems address related structural issues, such as exotic periodicity and Mahowald invariants. A key idea is to use C-motivic calculations to see deeper into classical structure.  Preliminary results suggest that this is a surprisingly powerful technique that allows for the computation of new stable homotopy groups in a range. The project also includes a series of techniques for computing R-motivic and C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups.  This represents the first serious effort to grapple with equivariant versions of tools like the Adams spectral sequence at a computational level.  The key point is to build up to the C2-equivariant computations gradually, through C-motivic and R-motivic intermediate steps.  One example of the kind of payoff for this work are computations of new values of notoriously difficult Mahowald invariants. Finally, the project will study the effective slice spectral sequence, especially in R-motivic homotopy theory but also over arbitrary fields.  This spectral sequence is a motivic replacement for the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence.  The R-motivic calculation is more accessible, while the arbitrary fields involve interesting arithmetic.  Inspired by the motivic effective slice filtration, the project will also attempt to study a new C2-equivariant filtration that ought to be useful for studying C2-equivariant stable homotopy groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interestingly, the fundamental problem of understanding and classifying shapes of spaces is more difficult in these lower dimensions compared to higher dimensions. In fact, investigating some of the new phenomena that happen in these dimensions require the use of more modern invariants, or in other words, quantities associated to shapes that can distinguish between those with different properties. This subject is also closely related to knot theory, that is focused on studying the shapes of knotted circles in three-dimensional spaces.  Low dimensional topology and knot theory have various implications in physics (quantum theory), cosmology (the shape of the universe), chemistry (molecular knots) and biology (knotting of DNA and DNA-protein interactions). This project aims to study the shapes of three- and four-dimensional spaces and configurations of knotted circles and surfaces in them using an invariant defined by the PI and her collaborator. In another direction, the PI investigates the relationship between different invariants for knotted circles.  The PI plans to organize seminars and conferences and involve undergraduate students in the combinatorial and computational aspects of this project. <br/><br/><br/>Heegaard Floer homology is a collection of algebraic invariants for low dimensional objects (e.g. 3- and 4-manifolds, knots, links, etc.), defined by counting holomorphic disks. In particular, different types of such invariants have been introduced for 3-manifolds with boundary. For example, Eftekhary and the PI defined tangle Floer homology as a generalization of (minus) Heegaard Floer homology. In one direction, this project aims to (1) study embeddings of graphs and homology cobordism group of homology cylinders using tangle Floer homology and (2) introduce invariants for concordances and Seifert surfaces, and get bounds for unknotting number using cobordism maps for tangle Floer homology. In a different direction, the PI intends to (3) give a computationally effective way for detecting handlebodies using bordered Floer homology (different extension of Heegaard Floer invariants for 3-manifolds with boundary defined by Lipshitz-Ozsvath-Thurston) with the hope of providing a new way for detecting homotopically ribbon fibered knots.  This project also proposes to study the properties of an invariant for knots and links, called symplectic sl(n) homology. This invariant is conjecturally equal to sl(n) homology, and the PI plans to (4) investigate spectral sequences for specific involutions in symplectic sl(n) homology and establish a better understanding of this conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rigid geometric notions such as distance and curvature play no role; instead, at heart is the notion that one space can be continuously deformed into another. Over the last 50 years the methods and scope of homotopy theory have been significantly generalized and expanded as mathematicians have realized that there are many situations where analogous notions of ""continuous deformation"" can be found or defined. Indeed we now know that there are many different homotopy theories to be found in mathematics and that they arise in a wide range of mathematical disciplines. In this project, the PI aims to apply the methods of tensor triangular geometry to four distinct but thematically-related problems in classical, equivariant, and motivic homotopy theory. The problems the proposal aims to solve are significant questions in their respective subjects and yet the techniques proposed to tackle these problems are not mainstream methods from the heart of algebraic topology. The general approach used is extremely interdisciplinary, using the platform of tensor triangulated categories to pass ideas and techniques between diverse mathematical subjects. Indeed, the proposed work will strengthen the interconnectedness of modern mathematics by transferring ideas and techniques between algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and representation theory. Moreover, the proposed research program will extend and develop the techniques of tensor triangular geometry, a broad research program which aims to develop algebro-geometric methods for reasoning about a wide variety of homotopy theories arising throughout mathematics.<br/><br/>In the first project, the PI aims to continue recent momentum in understanding the spectrum of equivariant stable homotopy theory with the goal of completing the computation of the spectrum for all finite groups and for pursuing generalizations to the case of compact Lie groups. The second project proposes a method to prove a twenty-year-old conjecture of Palmieri concerning the classification of modules over the Steenrod algebra, an important object of classical algebraic topology that has been intensely studied for over sixty years. In the third project, the PI shall use a strategy to compute the spectrum of an important piece of the motivic stable homotopy category. Finally, the PI will also use a categorical approach to the Picard group of motivic stable homotopy categories, which has the potential to clarify what little is known about these groups. A common theme in the proposed methods is the generalization and application of methods which have been successful in modular representation theory by passing through the unifying world of tensor triangulated categories. A second common theme is the use of an analogue of the etale topology in tensor triangular geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the research will focus on four families of objects. The first are the Torelli groups associated to the mapping class groups of surfaces, which are basic objects in the study of surface topology, encoding certain symmetries of a surface. The second are the configuration spaces of points in a manifold, which are topological spaces that parameterize collections of ""particles"" in a given space - these configuration spaces have long history in algebraic topology, as well as more recent connections to physics and robotics. The third are the congruence subgroups of general linear groups, which play a role in algebra and number theory. Finally, the fourth family of objects are the special linear groups, which play an essential role throughout mathematics, and are of particular interest in number theory. The PI will study certain algebraic invariants of these objects, called homology or cohomology groups. Although these (co)homology groups cannot currently be computed directly for these families of objects, the PI will use tools from category theory and commutative algebra to detect patterns in these groups, and study their long-term behavior. Torelli groups, configuration spaces, congruence subgroups, and special linear groups each have a rich literature around their stability behavior. This project will broaden the scope of this literature, often by strengthening the algebraic machinery we have to establish and to interpret stability patterns in more general contexts.<br/><br/><br/>This research builds on recent work completed jointly by the PI. In work with Miller and Patzt, the PI proved a central stability result for degree-2 homology groups of the Torelli groups of genus-g punctured surface, and the analogous Torelli groups of the automorphism groups Aut(F_n) of the free groups, which the PI plans to extend to higher homological degree. The strategy is to realize these homology groups as modules over certain categories, denoted SI(k) and VIC(k), which encode both symplectic group actions (or general linear group actions in the case of Aut(F_n)) as well as additional algebraic structure on these groups. The key to extending these results will be to establish finiteness results for free resolutions of modules over SI(k) and VIC(k). ?Representation stability? results are known for the n-point configuration spaces of a manifold as n grows, and in work with Miller, the PI established ?secondary? stability results among the unstable homology groups in the configuration spaces of a surface. This appears to be a first result in a much broader and richer pattern of higher-order stability phenomena in configuration spaces of manifolds, which the PI will pursue. The PI will also investigate whether secondary stability patterns hold in the homology of the congruence subgroups GL_n(R,I) as n grows. Finally, the PI will study the algebraic structure of the Steinberg representations of the special linear groups SL_n(O) of a number ring O. These Steinberg representations govern the rational cohomology of SL_n(O) in degrees close to the virtual cohomological dimension. The PI will study these Steinberg representations by analyzing the connectivity of certain associated simplicial complexes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these data sets are notably complex, particularly because they often involve interdependencies which are difficult to identify. In the field of cancer genomics, thousands of measurements can be obtained with the objective of discovering molecular signatures that characterize biological processes. However, advances in this area have been limited due to major computational challenges involved in identifying the structures that are present in both healthy and cancerous cells. This project aims to develop new topological methods to detect hidden dependencies within and across different types of data obtained from breast cancer patients. The project will intensively train three graduate students each year in these novel methods and expand the undergraduate and graduate curricula in data analysis and applied topology. Results and materials will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community through publications in open access and standard journals, conference presentations, and open source software. Results will be also shared with the public, including teachers and students in grades 10th to 12th, through training courses and art exhibits. <br/><br/>Genomic technologies have revolutionized the field of genetics over the past decade, providing new methods for identifying thousands of genetic/molecular signals associated to specific phenotypes. Among these methods, Genome Wide Association Studies have accelerated the identification of specific genetic elements by testing thousands of genetic loci simultaneously. These approaches, however, are less useful for identifying co-occurrences of and interactions among genetic elements, conditions that appear to be ubiquitous in living organisms. To address this gap, the PIs will develop new mathematical methods to enable the identification of interactions among genetic elements in cancer, thereby testing the hypothesis that many cancer phenotypes are regulated by co-occurring genetic events. Using the combined tools of modern topological and data analyses, including machine learning techniques, the research team will identify such co-occurrences by: analyzing generators of homology groups, implementing a computational data-driven theory of fiber bundles, and developing new models of cancer evolution using Khovanov-type categorification methods. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop new computational tools in time series analysis that help identify hidden interdependencies of data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One approach to study them is to realize them as geometric objects and then use the geometry to study the spaces. The three most common geometries are first, the classical Euclidean or flat geometry, and then the non-Euclidean: spherical and hyperbolic geometries. It has been known since the late 1800s that most two-dimensional spaces, or in other words: surfaces, exhibit hyperbolic geometry. Thurston's groundbreaking work in the 1970s showed that ""most"" three dimensional spaces, called three-manifolds, also have hyperbolic geometry.

It includes many sub-projects suitable for training graduate students to work in this area.<br/><br/>This project will study several questions on the geometry of hyperbolic three-manifolds building on PI's prior work.

Surfaces can be flat, like a piece of paper, or curved, like the outside of a ball, a donut, or a saddle, and the various shapes they can take often strongly constrain the shapes of the higher dimensional manifolds in which they inevitably occur.  An outstanding and ubiquitous example of this phenomenon is a surface bundle, which, like a donut, is a higher dimensional manifold which can be sliced so that the cross-sections are surfaces.  Unlike a donut, however, as one moves through most surface bundles, the surface cross-sections can twist and deform in complicated ways.  This twisting is encoded in the geometry of the mapping class group, which, among other things, is the collection of all symmetries of the space of shapes that a surface can take.<br/><br/>The central aim of this research program is to develop new tools for deepening our understanding of the geometry of the mapping class group and its connection to surface bundles, including by analyzing the geometry of important classes of 4-dimensional bundles coming from dynamics.  In more detail, this project will investigate the coarse geometry of the mapping class group, Teichmuller space, and surface bundles over surfaces using the tools of geometric group theory.  A unifying aspect of the various parts of the project is the hierarchical nature of these objects and the hyperbolicity of the curve complex.  The PI will employ ideas from CAT(0) cubical geometry to study the local coarse geometry of the mapping class group.  Using related ideas, the PI will investigate whether the mapping class group satisfies certain conjectures from K-theory.  In another direction, the PI will study surface bundles over Teichmuller curves with the aim of developing a new theory of geometrical finiteness for surface bundles.  Finally, the PI will study various algorithmic problems in the mapping class group, some of which have applications to surface bundles and symplectic topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research is concerned with more complicated algebraic structures, in which we not only have operations, but operations between operations, and so forth. Such structures have a number of applications, but there are many possible ways to describe them, and much of the project is concerned with developing such descriptions and showing that they are essentially equivalent to one another.  In a related project, The PI will use these kinds of foundational tools to make new connections between the fields of algebraic K-theory and representation theory.  In the latter, certain algebraic structures called Hall algebras bear several similarities to those that appear in K-theory, yet a precise relationship is still unknown.  Some new examples suggest a path for making a more explicit comparison.  A third project, which is being done in collaboration with four other women through the Women in Topology program, is concerned with applying some of these methods to structures which resemble the Taylor series which appear in calculus.  In addition to this program for supporting junior women researchers, the activities of this proposal also include supporting graduate students, developing research with undergraduate students, and participating in programs to promote further diversity in the mathematics community.<br/><br/>This research is concerned with developing and applying different models for homotopical categorical structures in three main directions. In the first, the PI will seek to give a full description of all models for higher homotopical categories given by multisimplicial and globular diagrams of simplicial sets. Such models are given by Segal conditions and either discreteness or completeness conditions; most current work emphasizes completeness but we seek to incorporate models with discreteness, and in particular consider in which cases we can use a combination of the two kinds of conditions.  The second direction is to look at applications of 2-Segal spaces in algebraic K-theory. These structures are known to arise via the Waldhausen S-construction, but how they can actually be used in algebraic K-theory is yet to be investigated. The PI will give an explicit comparison between 2-Segal spaces and the CGW-categories of Campbell and Zakharevich, and to develop the analogues of their abelian CGW-categories. Because 2-Segal spaces are also deeply connected to Hall algebra constructions, we seek to understand how CGW-categories fit into this picture, and more broadly just what Hall algebras have to do with algebraic K-theory.  Finally, the PI will look at model category structures in discrete and abelian functor calculus, with the goal of comparison to other kinds of functor calculus for which model structures have also been developed, as well as of strengthening classification results for homogeneous functors.  This last project will be done as part of the Women in Topology workshop, in collaboration with four other women, three of whom are junior researchers.

One of the primary goals of this project is to use ideas from logic in order to compare topology and algebra. An area of topology called chromatic homotopy theory studies spaces by ``factoring"" them into prime parts in the same way that an integer has a prime factorization. Using ideas from logic, we can understand the collection of prime spaces as the prime tends to infinity. It turns out that the resulting collection of spaces can be completely understood using only algebra. This idea is quite new and we hope to develop it into a full theory. This will allow for purely algebraic results to have important topological consequences.  Another primary goal of this project is to use topology to build a new bridge between geometry and algebra. This is a familiar story to mathematicians. Classically, certain geometric objects called vector bundles were used to produce an important algebraic invariant of spaces. This algebraic invariant was generalized in the 80's, but in the process of generalization the connection to geometry was somewhat lost. On the other hand, the generalization has a beautiful relationship to an area of algebra called arithmetic geometry. Further developing this relationship with arithmetic geometry should expose part of the geometry that was lost.<br/><br/>The PI plans to develop new tools in chromatic homotopy theory that provide both conceptual and computational insight while revealing chromatic homotopy theory as the support for a bridge between geometry and arithmetic geometry. These tools include a geometric construction of Morava E-theory in terms of Stolz--Teichner field theories, a description of the asymptotic behavior of chromatic homotopy theory that introduces Drinfeld elliptic modules into chromatic calculations, and a fusion-system-like combinatorial description of the classifying spaces of finite groups when localized at a chromatic prime leading to the resolution of a conjecture of Ravenel's. These tools are all built on insights gained from the PI's work on and applications of transchromatic homotopy theory. Because of this, the PI will also continue to develop transchromatic homotopy theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The spheres, which are among the simplest geometric objects, are building blocks for more complex entities. The homotopy groups of spheres are collections of continuous functions between spheres considered up to deformations. They are used to study the connections between these basic components. These groups and the tools used to study them have deep connections with other fields. For example, there are connections with number theory as interesting functions and sequences appear as patterns and structure in the homotopy groups of spheres. There are connections with differential geometry, as these groups are used in the classification of geometric objects. Recently, the tools used to study the homotopy groups groups of spheres have also been used in physics in the classification of phases of matter. Although the study of the homotopy groups of spheres is notoriously difficult, a bridge has been built between algebraic geometry and algebraic topology that allows us to use sophisticated algebraic theory to enable calculations of the homotopy groups of spheres. This bridge is known as chromatic homotopy theory and is the central theme of this project. Duality and invertibility are ubiquitous concepts in mathematics which are central to understanding relationships between mathematical objects. The project supported by this award studies these phenomena within chromatic homotopy theory. The project also proposes theory and computations that will provide data to help study these fundamental phenomena.<br/><br/>At the heart of chromatic homotopy theory is the study of a higher analogue of the homotopy category of spectra local with respect to mod p K-theory: The K(n)-local stable homotopy category. It is equivalent to the homotopy category of K(n)-local E-modules in G-equivariant spectra, where Morava E-theory E is a higher analogue of p-complete K theory and the stabilizer group G is a generalization of the group of Adams operations. The strategy of the proposal is to restrict problems to finite subgroups F of G and use the theory of finite resolutions to pass from information obtained from finite subgroups to information about the K(n)-local category. An important circle of ideas in the proposal concerns duality and invertibility. The PI and collaborators study K(n)-local Spanier-Whitehead duality using techniques from equivariant homotopy theory. They use an analogue of the J-homomorphism to compute the duals of homotopy fixed point spectra for the action on E of some finite subgroups F of G. This homomorphism is also used to study Picard groups of categories of K(n)-local E-module F-spectra. The PI is an expert in computations at chromatic height 2 for p = 2 and proposes projects to further our understanding in this difficult case. These include the computation of the Picard group of the K(2)-local category, the study of K(2)-local Brown-Comenetz duality and computations of K(2)-local homotopy groups for finite spectra. Advancements in chromatic homotopy theory at height 2 have informed our understanding of K(n)-local phenomena. The PI proposes various projects to generalize this insight at higher heights. Finally, the project also examines one of the most important problems in chromatic homotopy theory, the chromatic splitting conjecture, which plays a central role in the relationship between chromatic homotopy theory and the algebraic geometry of formal groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knots are used both to construct 3- and 4-dimensional spaces, and as a tool in their study. From its very inception over a century ago, surfaces have played an indispensable role in the study of knots, but only recently has this connection between the two broadened to include non-orientable surfaces.  This project explores several novel connections between knots and the non-orientable surfaces they bound. While there has been a flurry of results in this direction in the past few years, still relatively little is known about their interplay, making this fertile ground for new research.  A substantial portion of this proposal was inspired by problems stemming form DNA biology. Naturally occurring groups of enzymes in cells have the ability to either switch a crossing in a DNA strand, or to resolve that crossing. This naturally prompts the question of which knot types can become particularly simple after as few as possible alteration of these two types. While this research is not framed in terms of DNA biology, its results directly relate back to this question, and the PI expects his research to have application in the study of DNA recombination.  Additionally, the  research project will enhance visibility of mathematics in Nevada, and at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) in particular. This is especially relevant given the recently started Ph.D. program in mathematics at UNR, a program very much in its infancy. The award includes funding for graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>These research projects follow a wave of recent results involving the use of non-orientable surfaces in the study of knots. Some of this work had the potential of having been completed decades earlier, but a preference of topologists to work with orientable surfaces (a former preference of the PI as well) has left these stones unturned. This has dramatically changed in the last decade, and non-orientable surfaces are being recognized as powerful tools in low-dimensional topology.<br/>The research project concerns<br/>(i) Non-orientable Ribbon Conjecture, which compares embedded Moebius bands in the 4-ball with ribbon immersed M?bius bands in the 3-sphere.<br/>(ii) The Generalized Non-orientable Ribbon Conjecture which does the same for nonorientable surfaces of higher first Betti number.<br/>(iii) The notions of O-slicing number and O-concordance unknotting number, and consequences for the study of how knot concordance classes can change under O-moves on knot diagrams.  <br/>(iv) Chiral smoothings of knots, a phenomenon by which a knot can be rendered equal to its own mirror image after a single crossing smoothing.    <br/>The above problems fall into two broad categories. The first category aims to extend existing proofs of the (Orientable) Ribbon Conjecture for special families of knots, to the non-orientable setting, and touches on generalized analogues of both (Parts (i) and (ii)). The second category uses an entirely new approach to studying how local operations on knot diagrams impact the concordance class. The PI will study this problem for an infinite family of diagram moves, distinguished by the property that it includes many other local moves (Part (iii)).<br/>The tools used to study these problems contain aspects of gauge theory (of the Donaldson and Heegaard-Floer varieties), classical knot invariants, and explicit knot diagram modifications. Several of the research projects have aspects suitable for undergraduate and graduate student involvement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research training seminars will organize focused groups of early-career graduate students, and occasionally advanced undergraduates, to study a topic and then transition to working collaboratively on a research project. The award will also support several conferences, including three organized in collaboration with the University of Utah chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), as another aspect of the grant's efforts to identify and encourage traditionally under-supported mathematical talent.<br/><br/>The University of Utah has an active group of researchers in algebra, geometry, and topology, including such areas as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, geometric group theory, number theory, representation theory, and topology.  This array of research interests will feed into the grant's programs at all levels, as the pre-REU, research training seminar, and conferences all are organized around rotating subjects within the faculty's areas of expertise. Finally, this RTG grant will vertically integrate its training programs, with graduate students assisting with the pre-REU, post-docs engaging with the research training seminars, and a full range, from undergraduate to post-doc, of young researchers participating in conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It was Charles Ehresmann in 1935 who started the study of deformation spaces of geometric structures, asking which ""shapes"" can be ""locally modeled"" on a certain geometry. In 1982 William Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture, now a theorem, thanks to Grigori Perelman, renewed the interest in locally homogeneous spaces, that is spaces that look the same at each point. The PI proposes to study families of structures on manifolds and how they change when one perturbs them, focusing in particular on geometric and dynamical aspects. As a broader impact, the PI wants to develop a more inclusive environment for undergraduate students, graduate students, postdocs and early career mathematicians. She proposes to organize: a Directed Reading Program which pairs undergraduate students with graduate mentors for independent projects; a Women in Geometry and Topology network with a website, annual dinners at conferences and summer retreats where participants will start mutual collaborations; a Mid-Atlantic Math Alliance Program to build a regional community of mentors who will work with underrepresented minority students to help them succeed in their careers; Log Cabin Conferences gathering a small group of researchers (many early career) in a remote location to learn a new topic in a collaborative atmosphere. In addition, she plans to continue organize the Diversity Lecture Series, an annual Sonia Day for middle school girls, the Math Club for undergraduate students at UVa, to be faculty advisor for the AWM Student Chapter, mentor for the AWM program and for the Math Alliance program, to organize the Geometry Seminar, the Virginia Topology Conference and annual graduate reading courses.<br/><br/>Hyperbolic structures are the prototypical example of geometric structures with interesting deformation spaces. The PI wants to use results and techniques developed in the context of hyperbolic structures for studying other geometric structures. For example, she plans to investigate analogue structures in anti-de Sitter space. A lot of deformation spaces arise from spaces of representations of the fundamental group of a manifold into a Lie group, so the PI is also planning to continue the study of the dynamical decomposition of character varieties of free groups, and of fundamental groups of hyperbolic manifolds with compressible boundary. Finally, the PI wants to study ""higher Teichmueller theory,"" that is ""nice'"" representations of a surface group into Lie groups of higher real rank, and Anosov representations, which are a dynamical analogue of locally homogeneous geometric structures. Since Anosov representations turn out to be generalizations of convex cocompact subgroups of rank one Lie groups to the context of discrete subgroups of Lie groups of higher rank, the PI plans to use techniques developed for Kleinian groups in order to study limits of Anosov representations. Differently from classical Teichmuller theory, it is not known, in general, if these representations are holonomies of geometric structures. The PI wants to study this question, together with the description of limits of these representations and a different topology on these spaces, the geometric topology. The PI thinks that results and techniques coming from differential geometry and low-dimensional topology will inspire new research directions with deep connections with dynamical systems, Lie theory, complex analysis, and even algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory, and physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A donut and the spatial universe are both examples of three-manifolds. These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other natural sciences, and can be used to model many interesting phenomena. The main goal of this project is to study the mathematical properties of three-manifolds. The PI plans to investigate some central questions in a branch of mathematics, known as low dimensional topology. These questions are concerned with how three-manifolds change under certain maps as well as operations called surgeries. The major tool that the PI uses is a topological structure called Heegaard splitting, which is a decomposition of a complicated three-manifold into simpler pieces along a two-dimensional surface. This research targets some of the fundamental questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory. It also has a potential impact on other areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological structures of DNA.<br/> <br/>In this project, the PI will study the topology of three-manifolds. The project has three major parts. The first part is to explore a new approach to proving the Berge Conjecture. The Berge Conjecture can be divided into two halves: the first half is to prove the Berge Conjecture for knots with tunnel number one, and the second half is to show that if a nontrivial knot in the three-sphere admits a lens-space Dehn surgery, then the knot must have tunnel number one. The PI and his collaborators have carried out an in-depth study on the first half. The same approach may lead to a proof of the second half of the Berge Conjecture. The second part of the research is to study a long-standing conjecture concerning Heegaard genus and degree-one map. The PI will investigate this conjecture using special type of surgeries. The objective of the last part of the research is to study several fundamental questions in three-manifold topology concerning Heegaard splittings and curve complex. The PI plans to develop new tools and use techniques from his previous work to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have been studied by many mathematicians and seem to touch on diverse areas of mathematics and physics, but only in the last few decades have they moved into the foreground of mathematics. This is due to the remarkable breakthroughs in field, resulting in a rich and beautiful theory with many applications both inside mathematics and to science and engineering. In this project the PI will consider a variety of questions about various spaces with contact structures, focusing on objects inside of them, relations between them, and other structures on them. This will not only further our understanding of the field, but also its impacts on other areas of study. The PI will also devote significant time to helping graduate students and postdoctoral scholars become productive researchers in the field.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate contact and symplectic structures through a variety of techniques, but focusing on their submanifolds and connections to Riemannian metrics. Recall that in dimension 3 understanding Legendrian and transverse knots in a contact manifold has gone hand in hand with advances in our understanding of contact structures and their subtle links with topology. For example the first proof of existence of contact structures came from surgery on transverse knots and the famed tight versus overtwisted dichotomy comes down to the types of Legendrian or transverse knots a contact structure supports. The PI will continue his investigations of such knots in 3 manifolds, focusing on qualitative features of them. Also recall, that many important concepts in contact geometry are expressed in terms of submanifolds of the contact structure (for example, Giroux torsion, open book decompositions, etc). Trying to understand how these various submanifolds interact and how various surgery constructions affect them will be another focus of the PI. The PI will also consider higher dimensional contact manifolds where much less is known. Here, basic questions about the existence and isotopy classification of contact submanifolds (a generalization of transverse knots) and isotropic submanifolds will be considered - as will surgery constructions and how they affect various properties of contact manifolds. Riemannian metrics have long been known to have deep connections with the smooth topology of manifolds and more recently it has been shown that contact structures do as well. The PI will continue to explore relations between these two geometric structures with the goal of seeing key properties of a contact structure (such as tightness) reflected in Riemannian metrics that are adapted to them. This will hopefully lead to a more complete understanding of the general picture of contact structures on 3 manifolds and create new tools for studying higher dimensional contact manifolds. The PI will also explore recent conjectures of Eliashberg about the existence of symplectic structures by explicitly verifying them in some nontrivial cases and exploring inductive approaches to proving them in some general settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Following the format of the WIT I (2013) and WIT II (2016) workshops, both held at the Banff International Research Station, the main feature of the meeting is engagement in collaborative group projects for teams of 5-6 participants, each including senior and junior researchers.  The workshop is designed to help junior researchers develop collaborations and networks in the field.  Participants are based in thirteen different countries and include graduate students, postdocs, and faculty from a range of types of institutions, including four-year colleges.  <br/><br/>Homotopy theory is a thriving field of algebraic topology. Previous workshops in the WIT series resulted in significant research contributions. In a similar spirit, participants in the WIT III workshop will work on team projects in the months leading up to the workshop, then work intensively together during the workshop period, with the goal of producing published papers.  Workshop organizers will serve as editors of the conference proceedings.  The past outcomes of this program indicate that it is successful not only in producing new results in the field, but also in the retention and success of the women who participate in it.

Such unification makes research more efficient overall, reduces duplication, and fosters creativity. The transposition of technical methods from one field to another, in potentially unexpected ways, not only strengthens research but often inspires new ideas that lead to breakthroughs. This project is concerned with such a unification, known as ""Tensor-Triangular Geometry,"" that merges aspects of topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory and of other areas of mathematics under a single umbrella. In this project, Tensor-Triangular Geometry will be deployed at the interface of modular representation theory of finite groups and the theory of motives in number theory. The explicit nature of the former enhances our understanding of the latter, providing classification results among other applications. Graduate students will be trained through the research.<br/> <br/>The specific objectives of this project are the classifications of objects that appear in two categories in two distinct areas. On one hand, one can consider Artin-Tate motives over various ground fields in Voevodsky's derived category of motives, and on the other one can consider complexes of filtered representations over pro-finite groups, typically the absolute Galois groups of the above fields. Thanks to tensor-triangular geometry, such classifications are equivalent to the computation of a space (the spectrum) associated to the categories in question. The proposed methods involve etale extensions in tensor-triangular geometry. These extensions are a new development that have incarnations in both settings, as finite extensions of the ground field in the motivic case and as the corresponding restriction to finite-index subgroups in the equivariant case.

Recent years have seen spectacular advances at the intersection of number theory, specifically problems asking how many solutions an equations has, and topology which studies mathematical properties of shapes and spaces. While mathematicians have understood for several decades that individual equations have an associated space whose properties reflect the equation, many natural equations (and many natural spaces) come in infinite sequences.  The last decade has seen spectacular advances (leading in part to Venkatesh's 2018 Fields Medal, highest honor in mathematics) in our understanding of how the asymptotic behavior in natural sequences of equations (""arithmetic statistics"") governs and is governed by the asymptotic behavior in natural sequences of spaces (""homological stability"").

In mathematics, knots that cannot be transformed into one another without cutting and regluing the strings that form the loops are considered to be different from each other, or in other words, inequivalent. Key tools for distinguishing inequivalent knots are called knot invariants and these are essentially the properties of a knot that are preserved by continuous transformations of the space. In this project the PI will study the relationship between quantum knot invariants, a relatively less understood family, constructed from the ideas of quantum physics and mathematics. Central questions in quantum topology are broadly connected to the geometric topology of three-dimensional spaces, number-theoretic properties of polynomials assigned by quantum invariants, and the algebraic structures of quantum groups defining the theory. The project includes research plans for undergraduate and Master's students. The PI will also engage with ""Girls Who Code"" club meetings in service to the local community.   <br/><br/>The colored Jones polynomial is an important knot invariant that comes from the representation theory of quantum groups and lies at the heart of quantum topology, low-dimensional topology, and hyperbolic geometry.

It centers on questions lying at the intersection of two fields of mathematics called contact geometry and low-dimensional topology. Contact structure are geometric objects on certain spaces known as manifolds that arise naturally in physics through differential equations, optics, and dynamics. Pioneering work of Eliashberg first showed that contact structures play an essential role in determining geometric and topological properties of three- and four-dimensional manifolds. Contact geometry has since entered a renaissance after featuring prominently in the resolution of several long-standing problems in low-dimensional topology. It is in this context that this project broadly seeks to better our understanding of how characteristics of contact structures determine either geometric properties of the spaces they live on, or influence powerful invariants used in their study. The project will have immediate impact in several fields, such as: low-dimensional topology, symplectic and contact topology, dynamics, and mathematical physics. The PI will also devote time to helping mentor graduate students and postdoctoral scholars as they transition to being independent researchers.<br/><br/>Recall that contact structures fall into one of two categories: tight or overtwisted. Understanding which three-manifolds support tight contact structures and the number of tight contact structures supported by a given three-manifold are the paramount goals of modern contact geometry.  Accordingly, a primary goal of this project is to develop effective and computable invariants capable of determining tightness and distinguishing contact structures. Since the inception of these invariants, strong evidence has steadily built suggesting deep connections between contact structures on three-manifolds and their associated Floer-theoretic invariants.  For instance, each of the various Floer homologies support an invariants which are capable of detecting tightness and distinguishing contact structures.  An important goal of this project is to develop and explore refinements of these invariants which are simultaneously more effective in detecting tightness, and are more easily computable. In a parallel direction, according to work on the PI and others, much of the formal algebraic structure underpinning Floer theory appears to mirror natural geometric characteristics and constructions involving contact structures.  In turn, another key goal of this project is to clarify connections and correspondences between the algebraic structure of Floer-theoretic invariants and natural contact geometric phenomena and constructions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topology has several real-world applications, such as studying DNA knotting, constructing new data encryption algorithms, analyzing large data sets, motion planning for robotics, and developing quantum field theories in physics, to name a few. Due to a famous theorem by Smale, topology in higher dimensions is somewhat simpler than topology in lower dimensions. Therefore, it is interesting to concentrate only on spaces up to dimension four; this sub-field is called low-dimensional topology. These low-dimensions also correspond to the spaces that we live in---we live in a three-dimensional space, and if one includes time, in a four-dimensional spacetime---making low-dimensional topology even more pertinent. In low-dimensional topology, we are specifically interested in knot theory, where one studies one-dimensional objects inside three-dimensional spaces, such as knotted pieces of strings. Knot theory is a fundamentally important topic in low-dimensional topology, and it is also an integral part of many of the real-world topological applications. Knot theory studies whether a knot can be transformed into another without tearing or crossing itself (such a transformation is called an isotopy), and if not, what sort of modifications need to be made to ensure they become isotopic.  Knot invariants are mathematical objects (such as numbers or groups) associated to knots which remain unchanged during such an isotopy, and consequently, are extensively used in studying knots. The current project is focused on knot theory and will explore existing knot invariants and construct new ones.<br/><br/>This project will concentrate on two modern families of knot invariants in low-dimensional topology, knot Floer homology and Khovanov homology, which have been employed for a variety of applications ever since their discovery at the turn of the millennium. The main aim of the project is to construct new extensions, such as spatial refinements, of various versions of these existing invariants. Specifically, the project has the following four goals: construct further spatial refinements of Khovanov homology invariants and their perturbations; construct a spatial refinement of knot Floer homology using grid presentations; study group actions on Lagrangian Floer homology; and construct new combinatorial spectral sequences from Khovanov homology. Additionally, several activities combining research with educational and other broader impacts will be organized as part of this project, such as increasing mathematical awareness and interest among children at Los Angeles Math Circle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low-dimensional topology is the study of three- and four-dimensional spaces, which are the dimensions that are substantially least understood. One-and two-dimensional spaces are ""small"" enough that nothing interesting can happen; five-dimensional spaces are ""large"" enough that interesting things have room to become uninteresting. A major question in low-dimensional topology is the structure of the homology cobordism groups, groups of three-dimensional spaces with many algebraic features in common with the three-dimensional sphere. This group has deep connections to the substantial difference between the topological and smooth categories in four-dimensions, and to structural issues in higher dimensional topology. In the past thirty years, substantial progress on this and other central topological questions has been made using invariants from gauge theory (which deals with solutions of partial differential equations from physics) and Floer theory (which deals with rigid curves in spaces with a notion of area). This project will use tools from Floer theory to study the homology cobordism groups and other topological questions, and to undertake new theoretical work in Floer theory that will produce useful tools for low-dimensional topology. In parallel to the research component, the project includes plans to further the PI's mentoring and outreach efforts, with a focus on increasing the accessibility of mathematics at early stages and on building pedagogical and mentorship skills in young researchers.  These plans include an extending Michigan State University's existing undergraduate research program, running mathematics day camps for middle school students, and arranging for workshops for building academic communication skills. <br/><br/><br/>The tools of this project are equivariant versions of invariants from Floer theory. The first part of the project uses an equivariant version of the three-manifold invariant Heegaard Floer homology constructed by the Principal Investigator and C. Manolescu, which gives new invariants of homology cobordism. The Principal Investigator plans to construct a refinement of this theory, in analogy with work done in parallel gauge-theoretic invariants, and use it to address questions of torsion and indivisibility of elements in the homology cobordism group. The second part of the project focuses on Lagrangian Floer homology, the symplectic geometry construction underlying Heegaard Floer homology and many other topological invariants. Equivariant versions of Lagrangian Floer cohomology that incorporate the information of a Z/2Z-symmetry have been extensively and fruitfully developed in the past six years, including by the Principal Investigator. However, the literature lacks an analogous theory for Z/pZ-symmetries. With R. Lipshitz and S. Sarkar, the Principal Investigator plans to construct one, and to use it to study many situations in low-dimensional topology that possess natural symmetries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Central to the fields of geometry and topology is the study of surfaces, for example the surface of a spherical solid like a planet, or the surface of a donut or of a more complicated three dimensional solid. A key objective in Teichmuller theory is to understand all possible geometric forms that a fixed type of surface can admit. For example, an astrophysicist might be interested in cataloging all possible topographies of a hypothetical planet. The possibilities are countless: there could be hilly or mountainous terrains, highlands, valleys of varying elevations, and so forth. Miraculously, Teichmuller theory gives a way to package the entire plethora of possible topographies into one geometric object which can then be studied. The practical applications of Teichmuller theory and of its mathematical relatives abound, from computer visualization and graphics design, to evolutionary biology and genetics, and to many other important disciplines in between.<br/><br/>In more technical detail, the principal investigator proposes a three part plan for studying Teichmuller and hyperbolic geometry, the mapping class group, and more general classes of finitely generated groups and metric spaces. First, the PI plans to develop dynamical and combinatorial tools for studying the Teichmuller space, the mapping class group, and hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and to use these tools to analyze fundamental questions at the intersection of combinatorics and dynamics, such as lattice point counting problems, and the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds from a combinatorial perspective. For example, the PI plans to demonstrate relationships between the curve complex of a surface S and the geometry of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over S, in such a way that is sensitive to the topology of the underlying surface S.  Next, the PI will generalize and extend these tools to other groups and spaces, such as the outer automorphism group of the free group and the Outer space; for instance, the PI will initiate a study of metrics on moduli spaces of graphs that are inspired by the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space. Finally, the PI plans to pose analogs of counting and other types of dynamical problems in a wider class of groups and of spaces, and use the generalized tools to attack these questions in their respective contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A surface is a space which looks locally like the two-dimensional plane. Examples are the surface of a football or a donut. Surfaces arise naturally in the mathematical fields of topology, complex analysis, and dynamics. Classical Teichmuller theory is an area of mathematics that studies the space of all geometric shapes on a fixed surface. It also interacts with other scientific fields, e.g. through its connections with string theory in theoretical physics. The PI's research lies in two types of generalizations of Teichmuller theory. Three-dimensional generalizations of surfaces are called three-manifolds, and these are locally like the three-dimensional space we live in. The PI will continue a long-term project to classify and understand possible shapes of three-dimensional manifolds. In Higher Teichmuller Theory, the PI will study deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces with an emphasis on understanding the metrics, or distance functions, on these spaces. The PI will also contribute to the mathematical community through involvement in the Inquiry Based Learning Center at the University of Michigan, curriculum development for undergraduate courses, serving as editor of mathematical journals, organizing conferences, and mentoring undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral assistant professors.<br/><br/>Higher Teichmuller theory studies geometric representations of hyperbolic groups into semi-simple Lie groups, usually of rank at least two. It is guided by inspiration from Teichmuller theory and the overall goal is to create a general theory with some of the beauty and depth of classical Teichmuller theory.  The PI will use dynamical and geometric tools to study pressure metrics on Hitchin components. In particular, the PI will investigate an analogy between augmented Teichmuller space and an augmented Hitchin component introduced by Loftin. The PI will also study deformation spaces of finite area projective surfaces, Liouville currents associated to Hitchin representations, the class of groups which admit Anosov representations of specified type and the structure of spaces of Anosov representations. In the field of Kleinian groups, the PI will use tools developed in the proof of the Ending Lamination Conjecture to build combinatorial model manifolds for hyperbolic three-manifolds with freely indecomposable fundamental group. This project is expected to yield a finer understanding of Thurston's skinning map and to allow the PI and his co-authors to establish an iterated bounded image theorem, which was used by Thurston in the original proof of the Geometrization Theorem for Haken 3-manifolds, but whose proof remains elusive. The PI will also use dynamical tools to study deformation spaces of geometrically finite groups, with the goal of proving analyticity of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and producing pressure metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One direction relates to quantum physics, and the other to molecular biology. In 2016, physicists won the Nobel Prize for applying topology to research in condensed matter physics, and the underlying mathematical framework is called a topological quantum field theory (TQFT).  The first part of the project focuses on topological constructions from TQFTs and conjectures about them.  The PI aims to further advance the basic understanding of the connections between the mathematical and the theoretical physical sides of the subject.  This work may be relevant to practical applications, such as the theoretical foundations and development of a topological quantum computer.  The second part of the project is about the topology of proteins, which are long and flexible enough to exhibit knotting or linking.  It is believed that such topological characteristics affect a protein's functionality, which is governed by its three-dimensional placement.  However, little is known about how the proteins fold into a knotted state, and this project analyzes theories of protein folding from a topological viewpoint.  In particular, knotted proteins are implicated in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's and are found in bacteria used for bioremediation; a better understanding of the molecular knotting mechanism may lead to novel ways to target topological characteristics which affect specific biological functions.  The award also supports undergraduate students participating in this research.<br/> <br/>Specifically, the research in quantum topology centers around the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface, especially its representations.  The skein algebra is related to quantum constructions, such as the Jones polynomial and the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev topological quantum field theory, as well as hyperbolic geometric constructions, particularly the SL(2,C)-character variety.  The research will explore this relationship, and to exploit it for better understanding other invariants in geometric topology.  With similar aims, the project also investigates recent generalizations of the skein algebra that includes arcs.  In the second line of research, techniques from topology will be used to analyze evidence from laboratory and computer simulation experiments about knotted proteins, in order to develop new theories for how proteins might fold into a knotted configuration.  The theoretical folding pathways can then be compared against widely available structural data in order to identify the most likely folding pathways for specific families of proteins.  Thus, while providing valuable insights into folding pathways for all knotted proteins, this research aims to simplify the analysis for molecular biologists studying specific knotted proteins as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is not hard to show that the rotation x*x is again random, and every angle has the same probability to appear as the angle of rotation of x*x. Surprisingly, this is false in three dimensions: if x is a random rotation in space (each such looks like a rotation around some axis) chosen in such a way that each rotation has the same probability to appear, then some rotations have a higher probability of being x*x and some have lower probability, although this probability is never zero. Similarly, one can take two random rotations x and y and consider other expressions such as x*y*x*x*y and understand their distributions. More generally, one can ask similar questions replacing the collection of rotations by the collection of symmetries of other mathematical objects.

The project  will describe and distinguish rigid behavior, where small perturbations to a system of transformations do not qualitatively change the long-term outcome, versus unstable or chaotic behavior, which is highly sensitive to perturbation.  Variations on this problem arise all around us, as we seek to understand the long-term behavior of mathematical models of real world objects ranging from weather patterns, to ocean currents, to the configuration space of a mechanical system.

For example, we do not yet understand all of the surfaces that can be found inside these spaces. This project will explore such fundamental questions and develop new techniques for understanding symplectic spaces and for extracting their properties. The PI will share these new techniques with diverse groups of young mathematicians to bring the entering generation of students into cutting edge research. Activities included in this project will provide training in effective communication for students, to promote global collaborations, to engage the public in mathematics, and to ensure our scientific progress can effectively build off of work done by our predecessors and peers.<br/><br/>There are three main scientific goals of this project. The first is to make progress on the longstanding symplectic isotopy problem, studying symplectic surfaces in the complex projective plane. The new approach proposed is to reduce to singular surfaces, which allow one to obtain large degrees without large genus and thus avoid the technical roadblock that stalled progress in the early 2000s. The second goal is to utilize Lefschetz fibrations to study questions arising in algebraic geometry and singularity theory from the symplectic topological perspective. Lefschetz fibrations have been an effective tool to construct and calculate invariants of symplectic manifolds, and the PI plans to apply this effective tool to open conjectures and new lines of research related to complex algebraic geometry. The third goal is to develop the emerging technique of arboreal skeleta to study Weinstein manifolds through topological methods utilizing a simple collection of singularity types. The PI has begun initial stages of this program in a recently published paper and will continue development of the theory and applications particularly in low dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will draw upon ideas and techniques from group theory, number theory, geometry and topology in order to study arithmetic groups and the geometry of their associated locally symmetric spaces. Special attention will be paid to arithmetic hyperbolic reflection groups. Reflection groups are ubiquitous in mathematics and, like arithmetic groups, have been studied since the nineteenth century. Poincare's work on hyperbolic reflection groups in dimension 2 played a prominent role in the work of Klein on discrete groups of isometries of the hyperbolic plane, and analogous results for hyperbolic three-space played an important role in Thurston's work on the geometrization of three-dimensional manifolds. Throughout their history hyperbolic reflection groups have been an important source of motivating examples for those studying more general classes of discrete groups of isometries. This project will employ recent advancements in algebraic and analytic number theory in order to further our knowledge of reflection groups.<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator's (PI) work as part of this project will study arithmetic locally symmetric spaces in two contexts: (1) the case of hyperbolic reflection groups, and (2) systolic geometry. Seminal work of Vinberg in the 1980s initiated a program to classify those hyperbolic reflection groups which are arithmetic. By bringing together tools from the spectral theory of hyperbolic manifolds, analytic number theory and the arithmetic theory of quadratic forms the PI and his collaborators will make progress towards the complete classification of congruence arithmetic hyperbolic reflection groups. The PI will also study the systolic geometry of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds. The systole of a manifold is the least length of a closed geodesic on the manifold. One of the biggest open problems concerning the systolic geometry of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds is the Short Geodesic Conjecture, which asserts that there is a universal positive lower bound for their systoles. As part of this project the PI will prove that the probability that a commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds contains a representative with systole less than any fixed threshold is zero.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, group theory provides an algebraic language and a set of techniques for studying problems throughout mathematics.  In recent years, some of the most important problems in 3-dimensional geometry (such as the Virtual Haken Conjecture) have been solved by Agol, using results from geometric group theory, and particularly the work of Wise, as well as that of Kahn, Markovic, Haglund, Hsu, Bergeron, Manning and the principal investigator.  A key organizational principle is to understand spaces by cutting them along subspaces of one lower dimension.  For example, one understands 3-dimensional spaces by cutting along surfaces (two dimensional spaces).  This is the context of ""Haken"" 3-manifolds and of the Virtual Haken Conjecture.  It turns out that the way to arrange the cutting subspaces of one lower dimension is via spaces made out of cubes.  The major focus of this project is to understand the symmetry groups of these cube complexes, to build new tools to study them and to apply these new tools to many problems in geometry and group theory. The award provides support of training graduate students through research.<br/><br/>In the first two parts of the project, we study relatively hyperbolic groups acting cocompactly on CAT(0) cube complexes. In the case the action is proper, Manning and the principal investigator intend to prove a version of Agol's Theorem, that all such groups are virtually special.  Along with Einstein, the principal investigator will develop the theory of ""relatively proper"" actions of relatively hyperbolic groups on CAT(0) cube complexes, a context much more broadly applicable than the setting of proper and cocompact actions.  We intend to prove versions of Agol's Theorem, and of Wise's Quasi-convex Hierarchy Theorem in this setting, and also to show that the proper and cocompact theory is a subset of the relatively proper theory.  In the final part of this work, we will pursue applications of this theory to questions about hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups with planar boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This last step is often very difficult, as there are multiple ways of gluing the pieces of the solution together.  The mathematical area of K-theory studies different ways of putting such solutions back together, as well as the relations behind differently-assembled pieces.  The invariants constructed by K-theory can be found in many fields, from number theory to algebraic geometry to topology.  This National Science Foundation award investigates novel connections between fields through a K-theoretic perspective, by studying how geometric objects, known as polytopes, varieties and manifolds, can be cut apart and reassembled.  By analyzing these geometric cut-and-paste problems using traditional K-theoretic techniques found in algebra, the project hopes to shed light on longstanding conjectures relating geometry and algebra.  The PI also intends to establish a K-12 math circle available to all local children, and the organization of a district-wide math club for 3-5 graders.  Currently, math clubs at schools are heavily dependent on parental involvement and are therefore only available when interested parents have students at the school; organizing such clubs under a central organization would help with institutional memory and make it available to more students.  <br/><br/>The research project consists of three parts. The first is an in-depth exploration of the scissors congruence of polytopes as it relates to the algebraic K-theory of the real and complex numbers.  Using Rognes' stable rank filtration the PI and collaborator Jonathan Campbell intend to construct maps between the filtered parts of Rognes' filtration and the derived scissors congruence of polytopes; the long-term goal of this project is to investigate the connections between scissors congruence groups and the Beilinson--Soule conjecture.  The second part of this project investigates the construction of derived motivic measures on the Grothendieck spectrum of varieties.  There are two main flavors of motivic measure: the cohomological measures, which involve structures on the cohomology of the variety, and the Hermitian measures, which involve enriching the Euler number.  These measures have proven extremely fruitful in studying the Grothendieck ring of varieties; the project proposes to lift these to the Grothendieck spectrum of varieties and use them to study the higher invariants of cut-and-paste problems on varieties.  The cohomological project is joint work with Jonathan Campbell and Jesse Wolfson; the Hermitian project is joint with Kirsten Wickelgren.  The third part of this project is an investigation of ""squares K-theory"", which uses four-term (instead of three-term) relations.  Such relations---for example, the principle of inclusion-exclusion [P] + [Q] = [P u Q] + [P n Q]---appear frequently in geometric cut-and-paste problems such as SK-invariants, Bittner's presentation of the Grothendieck ring of varieties, and the definitions of McMullen's polytope algebra.  The project proposes to extend the definition of K-theory to such relations, thus allowing the construction of higher derived invariants for these (and similar) problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Euclidean geometry, we study objects such as circles and rectangles. A circle is highly symmetric; for example, any rotation about the center of the circle preserves the circle. A rectangle, though still symmetric in some ways, has less symmetry than the circle; its two sides may have different lengths. In low-dimensional topology we study more complicated objects or spaces of two, three, and four dimensions. A central aim of this National Science Foundation funded project is to understand these spaces through symmetries. Topological objects arise naturally in other fields, including biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering.  At times, the best way to understand one is via its relationship with another through what is known as a ""covering map"". A second project is to analyze covering maps. A challenge in studying more intricate three or four dimensional spaces is that one cannot always visualize or draw these even using a computer. It is therefore helpful to break them into building blocks. One of the projects is to do so with objects called hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  In addition to the mathematical research, the PI has demonstrated a strong dedication to outreach, mentoring, and advocating for underrepresented individuals in the STEM disciplines. With the NSF travel funds she will continue to engage in opportunities inside and outside the academia directed at promoting mathematical research and education. <br/><br/><br/>The focus of this research project is to understand the finite degree covering spaces, the group of symmetries, and the combinatorics of hyperbolic manifolds in low dimensions.

Homotopies and sweepouts are methods of continuously moving between two objects, such as two curves in the plane. In this context, we can ask questions such as how long the intermediate curves must be, or how many times the intermediate curves must come into contact with themselves (self-intersect).  Since the mid-twentieth century, numerous problems have been solved by reducing them to the study of homotopies and sweepouts; by exploring the minimal complexity of these objects, we are able to build upon and improve these results.  The principal investigator will also work on several important problems in geometric analysis that are inspired by physical phenomena, such as why soap bubbles are round (the isoperimetric inequality).  Many of these problems will involve collaboration with other scientists across a number of fields, as well as involvement of more junior academics such as graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>This project seeks to find homotopies and sweepouts of minimal complexity subject to constraints, where the notion of complexity is geometric and/or topological in nature.  In addition, the principal investigator will explore applications of these results to a variety of problems in metric geometry and geometric analysis.  One type of problem that is particularly of interest is when a homotopy or sweepout satisfying limited geometric constraints can be replaced by one possessing much stronger properties, such as when a homotopy can be replaced by an isotopy.  This project will also seek to develop quantitative h-principles; by combining the techniques described above with topological h-principles used to prove existence, we will be able to prove not only existence but quantitative bounds on the geometric complexity of the objects that are produced.  Lastly, this project will study stability problems for nonlocal geometric inequalities, especially those related to the Coulomb energy, and will endeavor to solve the isoperimetric problem for certain classes of manifolds with density.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditionally, one studies geometric objects via their symmetries. In geometric group theory the situation is reversed: one starts with a group of symmetries of an algebraic object (for example, another group) and constructs a geometric object with the same symmetries. This research project focuses on the study of symmetries of a free group. Surprisingly, its geometry is to a large degree governed by hyperbolic geometry that goes back to Gauss, Lobachevski, Poincare and others, most recently to Gromov and Thurston. The goal of the project is to better understand this phenomenon. The award includes funds for graduate student support.<br/><br/>The study of the large-scale geometry of the outer automorphism group Out(Fn) of the free group Fn has made great strides in recent years, but several fundamental questions are still open.

The strategy is modelled on the proofs of corresponding conjectures for mapping class groups, taking into account the extra complications present in Out(Fn). The steps in the strategy provide concrete questions the PI plans to attack. More specifically, a goal is to prove that Out(Fn) has finite asymptotic dimension, to better understand the boundary of the complex of free factors and its local connectivity, and to isolate the part of large scale geometry of Out(Fn) not governed by hyperbolicity by proving a distance formula for a natural electrification of Out(Fn). In a different direction, the project attempts to construct infinitely many quasi-isometry types of hyperbolic free by cyclic groups with fully irreducible monodromies, providing a phenomenon opposite from the situation for hyperbolic 3-manifolds that fiber over the circle with pseudo-Anosov monodromies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The dynamical systems in the real world, like those just mentioned, are often extraordinarily complex.  The principal investigator will study a simple class of dynamical systems modeled on ideal billiards in polygons with a view towards understanding the complicated dynamical systems that occur in applications.  The principal investigator will work to uncover and categorize the range of dynamical behaviors possible in billiard systems, and will continue his research exploring connections between billiards and the theory of numbers.  In addition, the principal investigator will continue his educational, mentoring, and outreach activities to promote the broader impacts of his work.  <br/><br/>This project seeks to address fundamental challenges in the study of dynamics on Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces. These subjects have connections with many areas of mathematics and important applications to the classification of mapping classes, the dynamics of rational maps and trajectories of a ball moving in polygons in polygons. Of particular importance are the special subvarieties of moduli space which are invariant under the geodesic flow.  Such subvarieties are rare and their origins are mysterious.  The principal investigator will pursue two lines of research. First, the principal investigator and his coauthors will give new constructions of special subvarieties.  Second, the principal investigator will investigate connections between special subvarieties and number theory, with the particular goal of understanding the arithmetic geometry of these spaces."

More specifically, it is situated within the methodological tradition of algebraic topology, in which varying concepts of space are compared and contrasted through a battery of ""invariants,"" which take the form of numbers and generalizations thereof. This project is primarily concerned with one of the oldest of these invariants, namely singular homology, which is fundamentally a matter of counting holes---the hole through the center of a rubber tire, for example, which distinguishes it from a basketball. Rather than applying this tool directly to the space of primary interest, which would yield rather coarse information, we apply it here to a family of spaces derived therefrom, called configuration spaces. These spaces measure the possibility of multiple occupancy without collision; for example, there is a configuration space parametrizing all possible positions of five ants on the surface of the tire or that of the ball. The study of configuration spaces is fundamental science contributing to the continued vitality of topology and mathematics as a whole.<br/><br/>We propose to study configuration spaces as structured local-to-global invariants of the background space, combining themes from the theories of factorization homology and representation stability. We propose the following specific projects, extending the current and past research of the PI and his collaborators. <br/><br/>1) Study the homology of the ordered and unordered configuration spaces of graphs. Understand stability and asymptotic behavior of Betti numbers. Interpret homology in terms of graph invariants. Perform explicit computations.<br/><br/>2) Exploit a connection to Lie algebras and the theory of factorization homology to study configuration spaces of manifolds. Compute positive characteristic homology and Morava E-theory using Lie algebra homology for spectral Lie algebras. Strengthen the connection between coalgebra structures and stability phenomena. <br/><br/>3) Compute (stable) multiplicities of irreducible symmetric group representations in the homology of the ordered configuration spaces of the torus using the representation theory of combinatorial categories. Extend knowledge of this theory into higher dimensions and study other product manifolds. Study configuration spaces of fiber bundles. <br/><br/>The (co)homology of configuration spaces is a classical topic of perennial interest in a diverse array of subfields of mathematics. New points of view on this old subject are possible in light of the geometric, categorical, homotopical, and algebraic insights and advances emerging from the recent development of factorization homology and the flowering of the study of stability phenomena. This work will turn these new points of view into substantive theoretical and computational advances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particularly successful approach, which has produced innumerable results since the 1950's, is computing algebraic invariants which are then studied through algebraic means.  However, in many situations this way of transforming the problem hides some inherent geometric complexity -- for example, one can deform one object to another, but only by making it very complicated somewhere in the middle.  In such a case, the existence of a deformation may not be particularly meaningful from a physical, application-oriented point of view.  In other cases, in contrast, one can always find a reasonably straightforward deformation, validating the use of algebraic methods for applications.  The purpose of this project is to investigate these phenomena.<br/><br/>The project will enrich our understanding of the ideas of geometric topology by proving results of three types: quantitative results, measuring the size and complexity, in various senses, of objects whose existence is known via algebra; algorithmic results, showing that certain problems can be resolved algorithmically while others cannot; and stochastic results, describing the properties of random objects. One can think of many such results as answering questions about the geometry of function and moduli spaces. Closely related questions are studied in geometric group theory, knot theory, the combinatorics of expander graphs, and the theory of topological data analysis. However, the study of high-dimensional and simply connected manifolds and complexes requires a different set of tools which have only begun to be developed.

This space captures all of the ways one may deform these surfaces.  The proposed research will explore the geometry of this space, its analogs in spaces of deformations of certain three-dimensional spaces called hyperbolic manifolds, and their interrelationships.

A better understanding of this function sheds light on the geometry of three-manifolds and its relation to topology.  In particular, the PI will continue an ongoing project with collaborators Bromberg and Minsky to establish effective bounds on the diameter of this map and its relation to the notion of renormalized volume.

On a complex surface defined by algebraic equations, a cusp-like sharp point in an otherwise smooth region is called an isolated singularity. In nature, singularities occur when sudden changes or catastrophic events happen, thus the study of singularities from various viewpoints is important to all branches of science. In geometry, an object known as the link of singularity encircles the sharp point on the surface; this object resembles a sphere in the absence of a sharp point but typically has a complicated shape encoding properties of the singularity.  The PI will study the properties of such shapes and the additional structures they support. A particular focus will be on collections of planes called contact structures that arise in physics. Plamenevskaya's research will contribute to several areas of mathematics: low-dimensional topology, symplectic and contact topology, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.  Her other activities related to the project will make significant contributions to undergraduate education and graduate and postdoctoral training. Plamenevskaya is working to increase awareness of current research in topology among undergraduate students, as well as contribute to participation of women in mathematics. She co-organizes research seminars, conferences, and workshops for a diverse audience, from graduate students to distinguished researchers. <br/> <br/>Specifically, the PI will work with the canonical contact structure induced by the complex tangencies on the link of singularity. A particular goal of the project is to understand the relation between Stein fillings/cobordisms of such contact structures and smoothings/deformations of the surface singularity, and to address a variety of questions concerning the interplay of the singularity theory and symplectic and contact topology. The PI's previous work (with Ghiggini and Golla) shows that rational surface singularities with reduced fundametal cycle, whose deformation theory is well-understood, correspond precisely to the class of planar contact structures, whose fillings can be studied via surface diffeomorphisms. This opens the door to extending certain results from algebraic geometry to symplectic topology as well as to applications of symplectic topology to singularity theory.  Plamenevskaya will pursue these questions using a range of tools, including low-dimensional constructions such as open book decompositions and symplectic caps, complex and symplectic line arrangements, and certain Floer-homological and combinatorial invariants. She intends to discover further connections between the aforementioned constructions and ideas, which may additionally lead to new results on mapping class groups and combinatorics of line arrangements. Plamenevskaya will also study a number of related questions, such as certain constructions in lattice cohomology (a combinatorial theory introduced by Nemethi for links of singularities) and their relation to Heegaard Floer homology.

The deep connections between the integers and a broad range of mathematical areas from geometry to number theory have direct analogues for lattices in Lie groups, and the way in which lattices in Lie groups sit at the interface of so many fields has made them of fundamental importance since the late 19th century. The primary motivation for this project is to deepen our understanding of these connections. There is a special class of lattices that are called ""arithmetic"", where the connections to number theory are particularly strong, and this an overarching goal of this project is to use techniques from dynamics and geometry to understand when a lattice is arithmetic, and moreover deepen our understanding of the geometric consequences of arithmeticity. The project provides summer support for graduate students allowing them time for research and collaboration.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project aims to understand the geometry and topology of locally symmetric spaces, particularly real and complex hyperbolic manifolds, inspired by the fundamental problems in low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory that have dominated the fields since the pivotal work of Thurston and Gromov. On the one hand, it is of significant interest to learn the extent to which the Gromov-Thurston program pushes into this more general setting. More importantly, the questions studied in dimensions 2 and 3 for the last forty years are closely related to classical problems about discrete subgroups of Lie groups, and real and complex hyperbolic lattices are precisely the cases where many of the basic questions remain open, e.g., Betti numbers and problems related to (non)arithmeticity.

It involves applying homotopy theory (a branch of algebraic topology) to study arithmetic and geometry,  using coarse aspects or invariants of spaces to study arithmetic phenomena.  A generalization of the number of d-dimensional holes in a space is used to control the solutions to certain polynomial equations. When d is equal to one, this has applications to a program of Grothendieck to control solutions using the loops on a space.  Maps between certain spaces induce maps between the d-dimensional holes giving rise to a notion of degree. A generalization of degree due to F. Morel is used to study arithmetic properties of singularities. This project furthermore includes the design and implementation of a series of four week-long summer math jobs for gifted high school students from diverse backgrounds. During each of four summers, approximately eight high school students will work on an important mathematical problem which has an elegant or useful known solution, learning the background material as necessary, and then creating learning materials for other students of the same age group. The students will be accompanied by a teacher from their high schools. In addition to the work on the specific mathematical problem, career options in mathematics will be presented and support and mentorship will be provided for students interested in pursuing mathematical careers.<br/><br/>Certain arithmetic and geometric phenomena which appear delicate are invariant under appropriate notions of homotopy. Such phenomena motivate the use of homotopy theory to study arithmetic or geometry. The sub-projects contained in this project share the perspective wherein problems in arithmetic or geometry are approached by using Morel-Veoveodky's A1-homotopy theory and applying realization functors. Sub-project 1 studies an enrichment of the Section Conjecture and an approach to proving it. Running the same methods backwards produces results on the differential graded algebra of the absolute Galois group. Sub-project 2 applies an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence in tale homotopy to compute (co)homology of branched covers. This has applications to the study of the non-abelian Galois representation given by the fundamental group of the projective line with three points removed, and has applications to sub-project 1. The first step of sub-project 3 is to prove a joint conjecture with Jesse Kass that the quadratic form appearing in the Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili Signature Formula can be interpreted as a local degree in A1-homotopy, where the natural notion of degree is a quadratic form. We then enrich the Milnor number and use this enrichment to study arithmetic properties of singularities."

It will promote the interaction between researchers in high and low dimensional topology.  The meeting is structured as follows:  mini-courses in the first week by world experts and a conference in the second week. Both weeks focus on open problems and collaborative work. This structure will greatly benefit early career researchers. Another feature of the meeting that will make it accessible is the theme of the program: promoting interactions high and low dimensions will mitigate the tendency of technical talks and problems. There are two main research aims for this meeting.  The first is to identify settings for synergy from the interaction between high and low dimensions and to make progress on problems in these settings. The second is to produce a high-quality problem list to guide future research in manifold topology. It is expected that a well-crafted and publicized problem list arising from the collaboration during the meeting will be of long-term benefit to the mathematical community.<br/><br/>An n-manifold is a space which locally resembles n-dimensional Euclidean space. Manifolds of dimension less or equal than 3 are studied using geometric techniques. Manifolds of dimension greater or equal than 5 are studied via surgery theory, which involves a mix of algebraic and differential topology, algebra, and analysis. Dimension 4 is in between; both the high dimensional Whitney Trick and the low-dimensional geometric techniques are only partially successful. The need for the program is that these areas have diverged in the last several decades, to the extent that, often researchers in low/middle/high dimensional topology are not always aware of the current research/techniques in other dimensions. This program is expected to lead to a synergy, benefiting both the experts and the new generation of early career researchers.

This summer school features a distinguished collection of geometers and geometric group theorists who have been chosen both for their mathematical excellence and their outstanding expository skills. The summer school will attract talented early career mathematicians from around the world. The support from this project shall expose US-based graduate students and postdoctoral assistant professors to a broad spectrum of topics in geometric group theory at an early stage of their career development and to foster intellectual relationships, both with the lecturers and with other graduate students, which will benefit the students throughout their careers. These relationships will have a long-term positive impact on the interactions between the mathematical communities in geometric group theory in the U.S. and Europe. The organizing committee and the principal investigators are committed to funding a diverse group of mathematicians.<br/><br/>Geometric group theory is devoted to exploring connections between algebraic properties of groups and topological and geometric properties of the spaces on which they act. Geometric group theory closely interacts with low dimensional topology, hyperbolic geometry, Lie groups and homogeneous spaces, algebraic topology, computational group theory, and differential geometry. There are also substantial connections with complexity theory, mathematical logic, dynamical systems, probability theory, K-theory, and other areas of mathematics. Geometric group theory is a very broad area, and this project shall focus on geometrical aspects of group actions, for example, actions on trees, curve complexes, cube complexes, and discrete groups arising in geometry, topology and dynamics.

The Principal Investigator (PI) will study basic mathematical objects by studying their symmetries, and by studying how the objects change under transformations: this is the study of group actions.  The project  will describe and distinguish rigid behavior, where small perturbations to a system of transformations do not qualitatively change the long-term outcome, versus unstable or chaotic behavior, which is highly sensitive to perturbation.  Variations on this problem arise all around us, as we seek to understand the long-term behavior of mathematical models of real world objects ranging from weather patterns, to ocean currents, to the configuration space of a mechanical system.  When the objects of interest are highly complex or not easily parametrized, these problems are difficult to approach, and the PI's program centers on several new techniques to render rigidity problems tractable.  The project also involves the introduction of active-learning courses for undergraduate mathematics students, including a program to train graduate students in teaching methods, and a major workshop on effectively communicating mathematics across research areas with the aim of increasing communication between mathematicians in disparate fields.  <br/><br/><br/>A major guiding principle in the PI's work is that rigidity of group actions, in the sense of topological dynamics, is often the result of an underlying geometric structure. One example of this phenomenon is the PI's recent results on foliated circle bundles over surfaces, where it is shown that every rigid such bundle is geometric. This project builds on this success of this program, extending this theme to new contexts and applications. The PI will continue work on flat bundles and rigid monodromy group actions, using techniques from foliation theory and coarse geometry in negative curvature to study boundary actions.  Another strand of this project involves an investigation of rigidity of infinite discrete groups acting on the circle through the topology of spaces of circular orders, following work of A. Navas.  Finally, the PI will adapt techniques from geometric group theory to the new context of non-locally compact groups, applying this this to study the dynamics of group actions on surfaces, and refining the notion of distortion and growth in transformation groups introduced by Gromov.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The STDC is one of the longest standing regular conferences in general topology, having started in 1967 and continuing as an annual conference.  It attracts participants nationally and internationally.  The STDC regularly attracts over 150 participants, and often over 200.  There are 7 plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks in most areas of topology and its applications by established researchers.  Talks bridging two or more research areas are encouraged.  In a highly technological society like the USA, a high level science research, and in particular mathematics research, is crucial for further progress. Conferences are an essential part for developing successful and competitive research programs in mathematics and for the education of young researchers. The STDC has played an essential part in the success and education of many of its participants. The conference will include contributed talks by PhD students, post-doctoral students, as well as junior mathematicians, and will encourage diversity among speakers.  There are six special sessions in subareas of topology including a new session in Topology and Graph Theory. More information and an invitation to participate may be found at the conference website:  http://www.uab.edu/cas/mathematics/mathnews/stdc<br/> <br/>The 53rd Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will run six special sessions: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Topology, Geometric Group Theory, Set<br/>Theoretic Topology, and Topology and Graph Theory that will include most topics of contemporary research in topology as well as highlighting connections between topology and other mathematical subjects. The session on Topology and Graph Theory is being included for the first time this year.  The winner of the Mary Ellen Rudin Award for a beginning mathematician will be announced at this meeting, and will be invited to give a plenary address.  The conference has succeeded in strengthening major connections between areas which normally do not interact. Particularly effective have been interactions between dynamical systems and continuum theory, between geometric topology and continuum theory, between geometric topology and geometric group theory, and between set theoretic topology and continuum theory. The interaction between these areas and graph theory is being encouraged by particularly inviting speakers who can bridge between the former areas and graph theory. The STDC encourages these interactions by providing travel support to students, post-docs, and junior mathematicians, by encouraging the special session organizers to seek diversity in those they invite to speak in a special session, and by welcoming unsolicited submissions for speaking in a special session.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Insights from mathematical physics have led to powerful tools, collectively called Floer theory, for extracting properties of such systems (for instance the number of periodic orbits associated to a system with given kinetic and potential energy); unfortunately the appearance of difficult differential equations makes these tools  challenging to apply.  This project seeks to simplify the study of Floer theory of a large class of spaces by developing systematic rules for computation (via e.g., cut and paste) and by establishing new relationships between different types of Floer theory.  Using these, the project aims to solve open problems about the structure of Floer theory and find new applications to mirror symmetry (a remarkable geometric duality first arising in string theory) and the study of singularities (abrupt changes) in symplectic geometry. The PI will also train and encourage mathematics students through workshops, new course and seminar content, and judging of K-12 science fairs.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new structural results in Floer theory and mirror symmetry using input from (and with applications to) the study of singularities of various forms in symplectic geometry.  In one direction, the project aims to show that wrapped Fukaya categories satisfy expected van-Kampen style locality properties, and deduce as a consequence axiomatic and sheaf-theoretic characterizions of Fukaya categories of Stein manifolds (using in part the singular structure of their Lagrangian skeleta).  In a related direction, the project aims to geometrically calculate the Hochschild invariants of Fukaya categories associated to certain Landau-Ginzburg models (i.e., holomorphic functions), and deduce new applications to the study of singularities of such functions.  The third and final direction is to understand the effect of hidden singularities (in the sense of having a singular mirror) on Fukaya categories, with computational and structural consequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More specifically, it is situated within the methodological tradition of algebraic topology, in which varying concepts of space are compared and contrasted through a battery of ""invariants,"" which take the form of numbers and generalizations thereof. This project is primarily concerned with one of the oldest of these invariants, namely singular homology, which is fundamentally a matter of counting holes---the hole through the center of a rubber tire, for example, which distinguishes it from a basketball. Rather than applying this tool directly to the space of primary interest, which would yield rather coarse information, we apply it here to a family of spaces derived therefrom, called configuration spaces. These spaces measure the possibility of multiple occupancy without collision; for example, there is a configuration space parametrizing all possible positions of five ants on the surface of the tire or that of the ball. The study of configuration spaces is fundamental science contributing to the continued vitality of topology and mathematics as a whole.<br/><br/>We propose to study configuration spaces as structured local-to-global invariants of the background space, combining themes from the theories of factorization homology and representation stability. We propose the following specific projects, extending the current and past research of the PI and his collaborators. <br/><br/>1) Study the homology of the ordered and unordered configuration spaces of graphs. Understand stability and asymptotic behavior of Betti numbers. Interpret homology in terms of graph invariants. Perform explicit computations.<br/><br/>2) Exploit a connection to Lie algebras and the theory of factorization homology to study configuration spaces of manifolds. Compute positive characteristic homology and Morava E-theory using Lie algebra homology for spectral Lie algebras. Strengthen the connection between coalgebra structures and stability phenomena. <br/><br/>3) Compute (stable) multiplicities of irreducible symmetric group representations in the homology of the ordered configuration spaces of the torus using the representation theory of combinatorial categories. Extend knowledge of this theory into higher dimensions and study other product manifolds. Study configuration spaces of fiber bundles. <br/><br/>The (co)homology of configuration spaces is a classical topic of perennial interest in a diverse array of subfields of mathematics. New points of view on this old subject are possible in light of the geometric, categorical, homotopical, and algebraic insights and advances emerging from the recent development of factorization homology and the flowering of the study of stability phenomena. This work will turn these new points of view into substantive theoretical and computational advances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particularly successful approach, which has produced innumerable results since the 1950's, is computing algebraic invariants which are then studied through algebraic means.  However, in many situations this way of transforming the problem hides some inherent geometric complexity -- for example, one can deform one object to another, but only by making it very complicated somewhere in the middle.  In such a case, the existence of a deformation may not be particularly meaningful from a physical, application-oriented point of view.  In other cases, in contrast, one can always find a reasonably straightforward deformation, validating the use of algebraic methods for applications.  The purpose of this project is to investigate these phenomena.<br/><br/>The project will enrich our understanding of the ideas of geometric topology by proving results of three types: quantitative results, measuring the size and complexity, in various senses, of objects whose existence is known via algebra; algorithmic results, showing that certain problems can be resolved algorithmically while others cannot; and stochastic results, describing the properties of random objects. One can think of many such results as answering questions about the geometry of function and moduli spaces. Closely related questions are studied in geometric group theory, knot theory, the combinatorics of expander graphs, and the theory of topological data analysis. However, the study of high-dimensional and simply connected manifolds and complexes requires a different set of tools which have only begun to be developed.
