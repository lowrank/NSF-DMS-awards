Moreover, the latency and its standard deviation are<br/>quite independent of frequency and decibel level over large<br/>ranges.  This behavior is exceptional since the inputs to these<br/>cells come from octopus and other cells in the contralateral<br/>cochlear nucleus, a nucleus which is ennervated by auditory nerve<br/>fibers that have much larger standard deviations and high<br/>dependence on frequency and decibel level.  Thus, this system is<br/>an example of how the brain can use relatively sloppy and<br/>variable devices (neurons) to perform surprisingly accurate<br/>calculations.  Professor Michael Reed, with colleague physiologist<br/>Joseph Blum, investigates this system with three research<br/>projects: (i) They create and investigate by machine computation<br/>a large scale mathematical model of the whole system using known<br/>physiological properties of auditory nerve fibers and recently<br/>discovered properties of octopus cells; (ii) They use<br/>mathematical analysis investigate of the improvement of the<br/>standard deviation of latency in converging networks where the<br/>target cells require coincident inputs within time windows in<br/>order to fire;  (iii) They use partial differential equations to<br/>understand the special properties of dendritic information<br/>processing in octopus cells.<br/>     Using mathematics and machine computation, Professor Michael<br/>Reed continues  to study how groups of cells (neurons) in the<br/>auditory brainstem perform calculations that individual cells can<br/>not do by themselves.  Neurons are inherently sloppy and variable<br/>devices that perform differently even under (apparently) the same<br/>conditions with the same inputs.  Nevertheless, large groups of<br/>these neurons are able to perform together, reliably, highly<br/>accurate calculations.  This project tries to understand this<br/>apparent paradox.  The project sheds light on how and why human<br/>brains are organized the way they are and it suggests new<br/>mechanisms for the development of man-made thinking devices.<br/>"

Disciplines include mathematics,<br/>biomedical engineering, aerospace/mechanical engineering,<br/>biology, psychology, and physics.  Training extends beyond the<br/>usual classroom activities by engaging participants in a variety<br/>of research projects as well.  One of the major topics is dynamics<br/>of the nervous system.  The projects, which involve experiments,<br/>modeling, and analysis, all deal with the variety of rhythms in<br/>the nervous system and the potential functions of these rhythms<br/>in key cognitive states and processes such as attention,<br/>awareness, learning, and recall.  A second major topic is<br/>dynamics of gene expression.  Progress in genomic research is<br/>leading to maps of the building blocks of biology and fueling the<br/>study of gene regulation, where proteins often regulate their own<br/>production or that of other proteins in a complex web of<br/>interactions.  CBD projects focus on using techniques from<br/>nonlinear dynamics, statistical physics, control theory, and<br/>molecular biology to model, design, and construct synthetic gene<br/>regulatory networks, and to probe naturally occurring gene<br/>regulatory networks.  The third major topic is the dynamics of<br/>patterns and waves.  Training activities include two weekly<br/>working seminars, extra journal clubs and reading groups,<br/>seminars to educate the CBD members in the research going on<br/>within the Center, and a CBD-initiated team-taught course.<br/>     The Center for BioDynamics (CBD) helps to advance<br/>understanding of difficult interdisciplinary problems at the<br/>intersection of mathematics, biology, and engineering, and it<br/>trains mathematicians, scientists, and engineers for the 21st<br/>century workforce.  It does this by combining traditional<br/>classroom education with significant engagement of students and<br/>postdocs in interdisciplinary teams working on current problems.<br/>The disciplines involved are mathematics, biomedical engineering,<br/>aerospace/mechanical engineering, biology, psychology, and<br/>physics.  One of the major topics is dynamics of the nervous<br/>system.  The projects in this topic seek to shed light on the<br/>origin of the electrical activity in the brain, and how the brain<br/>uses this activity to process sensory information, to think, and<br/>to regulate movement.  A second major topic is dynamics of gene<br/>expression.  The web of interactions among the proteins that are<br/>produced by genes is complex; the projects associated with this<br/>topic involve the design and construction of artificial gene<br/>regulatory networks, and techniques to better understand<br/>naturally occurring gene regulatory networks.  The third major<br/>topic is the dynamics of patterns and waves, occuring in a<br/>variety of applications.  Training activities include two weekly<br/>working seminars, regular sessions to read scientific journals,<br/>seminars to educate the CBD members in the research going on<br/>within the Center, and a CBD-initiated team-taught course.

This extends the theory of bifurcation in generic<br/>families of dynamical systems to those with two time scales.<br/>Emphasis is placed upon relaxation oscillations, periodic orbits<br/>that have both slow and fast segments.  The initial stages of the<br/>work seek a classification of degenerate decompositions appearing<br/>in periodic orbits of one parameter families with relaxation<br/>oscillations.  Geometric methods are used to determine<br/>bifurcations associated with each degenerate decomposition.<br/>Numerical investigation of examples is used to motivate the work<br/>and to ensure that the results are directly applicable to<br/>biological models.  Together with collaborators Kathleen Hoffman<br/>and Warren Weckesser, the investigator is reexamining a classical<br/>example, the forced van der Pol system that gave birth to the<br/>discovery of chaos for dissipative dynamical systems, and expects<br/>to give a full description of the bifurcations that occur within<br/>this system.  He also develops algorithms for the computation of<br/>structures that are difficult to compute with existing methods.<br/>     Rhythmic phenomena are ubiquitous in biological systems.<br/>Examples include the heartbeat, the cell cycle, circadian<br/>rhythms, legged locomotion, and electrical signals in the nervous<br/>system.  Most of these involve multiple time scales.  The<br/>investigator pursues new mathematical theory and computational<br/>methods that apply to dynamical systems with multiple time<br/>scales.  Emphasis is given to models of neural systems, an area<br/>in which the presence and importance of complex dynamics are<br/>manifest.  The investigations draw upon decades of research in<br/>characterizing generic phenomena observed in dynamical systems<br/>with a single time scale.  The resulting body of mathematics,<br/>sometimes called chaos theory, needs extension and modification<br/>to fully explain the behavior of systems with multiple time<br/>scales.  Those extensions are the goal of this project.  On a<br/>longer time frame, the project lays foundations for coming<br/>generations of biological models for cellular processes such as<br/>gene expression and signal transduction.  New biotechnology leads<br/>to ever more complicated reaction networks that are simulated as<br/>dynamical systems.  This project produces results that aid the<br/>implementation and interpretation of such simulations of complex,<br/>multiple time scale dynamical systems.<br/><br/>"
