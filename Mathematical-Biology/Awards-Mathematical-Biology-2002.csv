Computational models are developed that couple the internal molecular motors and elastic mechanisms of motile microorganisms with a viscous, incompressible fluid. A unified computational approach is adopted to model the internal axoneme mechanics of cilia and spermatozoa, the action of the internal periplasmic flagella of spirochetes, as well as mucociliary interactions. In addition to modeling the dynamics of a single organism, the collective hydrodynamic interactions of groups of organisms and their environment can be examined. The moving boundary problem posed by a flexible, swimming organism is very difficult to analyze, even when an organism's waveform is assumed to be known. In fact, the waveform of a microorganism is an emergent property of the coupled nonlinear system consisting of the organism's force-generating mechanisms, its passive elastic structure, and the external fluid dynamics. The investigators develop a mathematical model and a numerical method designed to study this coupled mechanical system. Modern methods in computational fluid dynamics are used to create a controlled environment where the measurement and visualization of locomotive effects can be made.<br/><br/>The motion of microorganisms in fluid is of fundamental importance in physiology. Human reproduction requires the successful journey of spermatozoa through both the male and female reproductive tracts. The robust locomotory ability of pathogenic spirochetes enable these bacteria to efficiently move through viscous fluids and mucosal surfaces. A multidisciplinary research team of mathematicians, computational scientists and experimental biologists coordinates their efforts to investigate the fundamental mechanics of cell motility in a number of systems. These systems include cilia and flagella, spirochetes (such as those that are the causative agents of Lyme disease and syphilis), bacterial biofilms and mucus-ciliary transport in the respiratory tract. A greater understanding of how the internal biochemistry and biophysical mechanisms of microorganisms are coupled to the fluid environment in which they move can have an impact on drug design for bacterial infection as well as infertility treatment. This project draws ideas from many disciplines such as fluid mechanics, scientific computing, cell biology, and numerical analysis. Our multidisciplinary approach enables significant progress in the understanding of microorganism motility. Furthermore, the algorithms and methods developed are useful in studying other biofluiddynamic problems and contribute to expertise in high performance computing. <br/>"

For QTL results to be incorporated into existing theory, a crucial task is to develop models of quantitative trait variation that allow for a finite number of loci with finite effects. In this project, such models are developed and analyzed. Our theoretical work focuses on diffusion models, i.e. models in which both time and allele frequencies are continuous. The models developed are compared with previously-derived models, with the results of simulations, and with experimental data, with the aim of identifying models useful for predicting quantitative trait evolution in natural and agricultural populations. The results of the analysis and simulations are used to create statistical tests for the action of selection on quantitative traits in populations. <br/> Quantitative traits are among the most conspicuous features of organisms, features that we immediately recognize. Examples abound, including the height of humans, the number of ears on a corn plant or the weight of piglets in a litter. The study of quantitative traits and their genetic basis is fundamental to our understanding of evolutionary biology as well as to applied genetics such as animal and plant breeding. Using recently developed technology, it is now possible to identify regions of the genome that contribute to quantitative traits. Such ""QTL mapping"" studies have revealed discrepancies between the data and classical theories intended to explain the contribution of individual genes to such traits. This project aims to extend our theoretical understanding of quantitative traits, and to use the theory developed to create practical statistical methods for analyzing quantitative trait data.

The objectives of the project include: 1) development of statistical algorithms and methodology for the rational design of antisense oligos and ribozymes; 2) experimental testing and improvement of antisense design method with experimental feedback data; 3) development of a statistical RNA folding software Sfold for RNA folding prediction and design of antisense oligos and ribozymes; and establishment and maintenance of a Sfold Web server for RNA folding and antisense oligo and ribozyme design.

Through gene down-regulation, antisense oligos and ribozymes are important tools for the assignment of gene functions and for the validation of human therapeutic targets. There is compelling experimental evidence that the accessibility of the messenger or viral RNA by antisense oligos or ribozymes is most constrained by the secondary structure of the target. Recently, statistical approaches to the prediction of RNA secondary structure and antisense targets have shown promise and advantages over established methods. It is thus important to explore fully the advantages of statistical approaches to RNA folding prediction and antisense oligo and ribozyme design.

Deterministic and stochastic structured epidemic models with host and pathogen genetics will be developed, analyzed, and numerically simulated. Discrete and continuous time structured models are based on difference equations, differential equations, Markov chains, and stochastic differential equations. The mathematical models will be used to study how disease affects persistence, duration, onset of an epidemic, and population size, and how host and pathogen coevolve in response to various control strategies and to different selection pressures. The models will be applied to specific amphibian populations on the Southern High Plains. The proposed research includes a three-year experimental investigation (two years of intensive fieldwork) to determine amphibian abundance, disease prevalence, and immunological characteristics of two common species of amphibians on the Southern High Plains, the tiger salamander and the plains spadefoot toad. The study sites consist of twelve playa lakes on the Southern High Plains. Mathematical and statistical analyses of the data collected from this study address some basic biological questions about the relationships among amphibian abundance, immune response, disease prevalence, life cycle stage (larvae, juvenile, and adult), landuse practices (grassland versus cropland), and climatic conditions. This study provides important information for determining critical factors that are significant in the transmission and persistence of diseases in amphibians. <br/> The emergence of infectious diseases in humans and wildlife is a major threat to public health and to the conservation of global biodiversity. Increased population densities, changes in agricultural and livestock practices, dam building, deforestation, encroachment into wildlife habitat, climate change, environmental pollution, and introduction of pathogens into new areas are some of the factors leading to the emergence of infectious diseases. Understanding the dynamics of the pathogens responsible for the emergence of these diseases and the complex and changing relationship between their host and their environment is needed for potential control of these diseases. A variety of human and environmental influences have caused many host-pathogen systems to evolve and to adapt to these changing influences, making control an even more difficult task. Theoretical studies which contribute to our understanding of the evolution of host-pathogen systems are urgently needed. It is the purpose of this investigation to develop, analyze, and simulate mathematical models based on principles from epidemiology, genetics and population dynamics, to apply these models to host-pathogen systems, and to conduct an experimental investigation on a particular host-pathogen system. The host population models developed in the proposed investigation are applied specifically to amphibian populations. The global decline in amphibian populations is thought to be one of the most pressing and enigmatic environmental problems today. Recent evidence indicates that emerging diseases (viral and fungal pathogens) are responsible for mass die-offs of frogs, toads, and salamanders. Indeed, recent outbreaks of diseases in amphibians should be given serious attention as they may signal environmental change on a global scale that may threaten many organisms. A major part of the proposed research involves a two-year field and three-year laboratory investigation. The purpose of the experimental investigation is to assess amphibian abundance, disease prevalence, and immunological characteristics of two common species of amphibians on the Southern High Plains. This study lays the groundwork for future studies on causes of population declines in amphibians.

The design and prediction work aims to expand the set of RNA sequences and structures available, and hence our knowledge of RNA functions. By representing RNA secondary structures as tree or pseudoknot graphs, we exploit the mathematical results in graph theory for graph comparison, enumeration, and construction. This approach allows us to enumerate all possible RNA graphs which may represent both natural and hypothetical RNA topologies. Our proposed investigations consist of three related stages: (1) survey and analyze existing RNAs; (2) design RNA sequences for novel RNA tree topologies; and (3) predict the three-dimensional structures of designed RNA sequences. In survey and analysis (goal 1), we will systematically search for the occurrence of RNAs within a larger RNA system, especially for ribosome structures; use RNA topological characteristics to survey and classify functional RNA families; and develop graph theory algorithms to estimate the probable size and diversity of various functional RNA groups within genomes. Our RNA search tools, survey results, and classification methods will be made available to the public through the Nucleic Acid Database. To generate novel RNA topologies for three-dimensional structure prediction (goal 2), we will apply two strategies: sequence mutation of known RNAs and de novo sequence design. Finally, our goal of predicting the three-dimensional structures of designed sequences (goal 3) will be accomplished through the development of empirical force fields and folding algorithms for reduced RNA models. For this challenging goal, we will consider several computational approaches, including the use of elastic energy models with Brownian dynamics as employed for long DNAs. <br/> RNA molecules play vital and diverse biological roles in the cell. In parallel with protein genomics efforts, the development of RNA genomics or ribonomics --- a systematic analysis and prediction of RNA sequence/structure relationships --- will help advance our understanding of the biological functions of RNAs. In marked contrast to proteins, only a small number of distinct RNA structures is currently known. The methodologies currently used to search for novel functional RNAs are either restricted to small RNAs or to known RNA classes. In an effort to overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel approach based on an area in mathematics called graph theory and computational biology methods to allow comprehensive search through RNA's structural possibilities. Since known RNA structures represent only a small subset of all distinct structures, we postulate that some of the missing structures represent novel functional RNAs which may occur naturally in cells or be generated in the laboratory, but as yet unidentified or do not exist. The three-dimensional structures of novel RNAs will be predicted through design and folding methodologies. Our approaches will likely expand the number of RNA types and lead to the identification of unknown RNA families. Designed RNAs with novel properties have potential applications as catalysts, molecular sensors, and therapeutic agents in biotechnology and molecular medicine. In addition to RNA structure prediction, graph theory will allow us to systematically characterize, classify and establish structural/functional relationships between existing RNAs. The results and tools developed for this analysis will be made available through the publicly accessible Nucleic Acid Database. Our proposed investigations will contribute to the development of RNA genomics, a field currently lagging behind protein genomics or proteomics.

In this Stokesian multiphase area of biological fluid dynamics, there is no inertia, but there are forces across interfaces and transfers of forces between the fluids and fibers embedded in the fluids. In some applications, the models have multiple viscous fluids separated by active interfaces, and in others, the models have a single fluid whose motion and material properties are coupled with the motion of contractile fibers. The models will be used to gain a better understanding of the anisotropic behavior of cylindrical hydrostats (trunks, tentacles, and tongues). They will be used to increase understanding of the mechanical instabilities and pattern formation which can emerge when cells modify their extracellular matrix by moving through it or pulling on it. They will also be used to help define the developmental implications of mechanical hypotheses about how branched tubular structures (like lungs) form in the body. Some results will generate interpretations of theories, some will suggest experiments to test the implications of theories, and some will suggest industrial applications of biomechanical principles. The project will also develop the finite difference numerical methods necessary to solve the partial differential equations arising from modeling the physical forces in these tissues. The development of robust three-dimensional algorithms for the solution of biological fluid dynamics problems will be key to the effective modeling of dozens of problems in the mechanics of cell motion and tissue remodeling.<br/><br/>This project involves several biomedical problems in the dynamics of tissues. At all stages of an organism's existence there are mechanical forces at work.

There are genes that switch on and off, but that is not the whole story. An airplane has switches too, but to understand how it really works, we need to study fluid mechanics - the physical forces that lift, stabilize, and occasionally disturb the craft. Fluid dynamics is equally relevant to biology. As an organism - or part of it - is growing, it creates physical forces, and is shaped by physical forces. The science of Tissue Dynamics is relatively new, and requires expertise in many areas. A biological modeler, a numerical analyst, a developmental biologist, and an industrial researcher have teamed up to study the biomechanics of tissues which are changing their shape, size, strength, orientation, and function.

Major goals are to obtain statistical estimates of the number of events with associated measurements of uncertainty, test hypotheses concerning for example, constancy of mutation rates among lineages, and to compare the likelihood of various genome duplication scenarios in Arabidopsis thaliana, maize, and other organisms. Mathematical results and statistical techniques will also be developed to distinguish the causes of observed levels and patterns of DNA sequence variation across genomes, concentrating on the effects of the fixation of advantageous mutations (""selective sweeps"") and of spatial population structure. Statistical work will include the development of composite likelihood methods for data from large genomic regions for which full likelihood or Bayesian methods are not tractable. <br/><br/>Research supported by this grant will focus on quantitative studies of variation in genomes within and between organisms. Two scales are considered. The first is the evolution of genomes due to large-scale processes which rearrange gene order on chromosomes or exchange genetic material between them. An understanding of the rates and sizes of these changes will be important for improving comparative maps between species. These maps which, for example, identify the mouse homologues of human genes or give the relative order of genes in cattle and sheep are important in medicine and agriculture. A second scale is the level of DNA variation observed within species. Mathematical and statistical studies will focus on distinguishing the effects of adaptation (natural selection) and spatial (geographical) population structure on shaping patterns observed in DNA sequence data from humans and other organisms. These results will provide insights into how organisms respond genetically to novel environments and challenges (including pathogens and environmental stress), and can help identify those genes important in that adaptation.

In this research, Liquid association (LA) is introduced as a method to quantify changes in correlation. A preliminary study showed that LA can help identify functionally related genes that have no profile similarity. This development is harbored on three fronts: biological motivation, large scale computation, and statistical theory. The specific aims of the LA system include (1) to identify a small list of master expression genes- genes that have more expressional influence than others; (2) to help understand how genes regulate each other through important metabolic intermediates; (3) to analyze the co-expression pattern for genes associated with a known pathway; (4) to help the functional prediction of unknown genes; and (5) to provide an expression network through master genes. <br/> Large scale gene expression profiling has become increasingly more popular in tumor research and many other biological areas. Microarrays enable the full genome mRNA measurement. They have been applied to monitor gene activities under various physiological or environmental conditions. Investigations on differential expression between normal and disease tissues or cell-lines have also led to the identification of genes with potential diagnostic and clinic values.
