In cell biology, many biological functions require the generation and coordination of complex mechanical events distributed throughout individual or populations of cells. This includes the generation and control of cellular motions in response to environmental signals of toxins or nutrients, generation of forces during cell division, and regulation of growth within tissues. Understanding of the roles of conditions arising in diseases, development of therapeutics and vaccines, engineering of bioreactors, and development of novel materials calls for advanced quantitative methods for studying cell mechanics. A central challenge in cell mechanics is to understand the principles by which larger scale mechanics arise from the smaller scale molecular-level events. This project develops new mathematical modeling paradigms and simulation software tools for investigating cell mechanics over multiple scales. This includes contributions from cell membranes and the cytoskeleton, which are structures providing the mechanical support maintaining the cell shape and internal organization. The methods capture contributions including the roles of the geometry, elastic structures, fluid mechanics, and fluctuations. Outreach activities are planned for engaging diverse and under-represented students at the University of California Santa Barbara and in the local community. This includes working with local area K-12 schools and colleges on programs to engage students on topics in the sciences, mathematics, and computation. Educational activities are also planned providing unique opportunities to train the next generation of researchers and students on recent emerging quantitative methods at the interface of mathematics and biology. <br/> <br/>The project addresses challenges in cell mechanics by providing new theoretical and computational stochastic approaches for handling molecular-level interactions and kinetics spanning over a hierarchy of scales. This includes regulation of the viscoelastic mechanics of protein-laiden lipid bilayer membranes, cytoskeletal filament rearrangements driven by cross-linked motor proteins, and cytoskeleton-membrane interactions. The project develops new stochastic computational methods for capturing both continuum and discrete contributions from the elastic mechanics, hydrodynamic coupling, geometry, and fluctuations. Stochastic numerical methods and efficient solvers and samplers are developed for handling the geometry of curved surfaces and general bulk domains. The methods draw on results from differential geometry and formulate unstructured discretizations building on finite element methods and meshless approaches. The methods will be used to study mechanisms underlying the mechanics of cytoskeleton-membrane interactions and in vitro active soft materials consisting of reconstituted cytoskeletal elements. This includes processes playing important roles in blebbing during initiation of cell motility and the generation of cytoskeletal forces. For the introduced modeling approaches and computational methods, software tools also will be developed and released with C++/python interfaces allowing for performing general simulations and analysis of phenomena in cell mechanics, complex fluids, and soft materials.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology and Computational Mathematics Programs at the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program at the Division of Physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, in contrast to past data of this type, current practices involve the collection of multiple single cell datasets (e.g., for each patient in a large cohort), which can represent data over time or in different conditions and can be analyzed computationally as point clouds. There is a great need for new mathematical and machine learning techniques to be able to process these types of complex data to gain meaningful and predictive insight on healthy and disease processes. While the majority of machine learning techniques used in the biomedical domain have been supervised techniques arising from language or vision (image) models, this project focuses on developing multiscale geometric and topological representations of more complex data structures. Such representations allow us to combine advances in several fields at the forefront of data science, including geometric deep learning, manifold learning, and harmonic analysis in order to analyze and predict from this data in an interpretable way. The research will include several biomedical applications, such as characterizing immune response in COVID-19, tracking the progress of metastatic cancer, predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy, and understanding differentiation. Furthermore, the challenges addressed by these methods will enable new advances in a wide range of fields where complex high throughput data is collected in varying experimental environments. <br/><br/>The project will provide representation learning techniques to explore and featurize high dimensional and complex datatypes including point clouds, graphs collected in a variety of conditions in order to perform machine learning tasks. Thrust 1 will involve the development of data geometric features to characterize point cloud data, based on which a novel class of neural networks will be created for regression on single cell data from a variety of systems. Thrust 2 will focus on methods for preserving directed information, by constructing asymmetric kernels and using these kernels for embedding, inference, and feature prediction. This will lead to the creation of directed graph neural networks that utilize geometric scattering as defined on a directional graph Laplacian of point cloud data. This will be used to learn and process data from gene regulatory and metabolic networks. Thrust 3 will focus here on inferring dynamics for interpolation of continuous dynamics from static snapshot single cell data using optimal transport-regularized neural ODEs and PDEs and producing interpretations of the underlying generative models. Further, it will involve representing dynamics quantitatively using data geometry and topology for prediction and classification, and will be validated on cancer and calcium signaling data from epithelial cells. The techniques developed here will provide fundamental advances in the use of neural networks to represent and make predictions on point cloud data, as well as enable new ways to tackle the problem of tracking dynamic biological processes over them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People?s movements determine who is at risk of the disease and whether new cases are counted by local public health agencies. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people?s movements changed drastically and, in addition to COVID-19, influenza and Lyme disease cases also dropped nationwide. These drops in cases may be because people spent less time in high risk areas, or simply because people traveled to healthcare facilities less frequently, and so fewer cases are reported. Distinguishing between these alternatives is critical for understanding disease control and predicting disease spread, but is made difficult when travel patterns change dramatically. This problem is especially challenging because communities may modify travel patterns in response to local disease, which can, in turn, change how diseases spread in communities and how public health monitors disease. To determine the cause of case reductions as human movements changed, the Investigators will develop new mathematical models that account for the ways travel impacts both risk and detection, using data from mobile phones to inform transmission risk and using local surveys to inform underdetection rates. By developing this new collection of models, the Investigators will better understand how transmission and detection of various non-COVID-19 infections changed throughout the pandemic, recognize how this depends on the biology of the disease being considered, and predict how case numbers may change during future periods of significant community-level changes in travel.<br/><br/>Community-level travel patterns have multifactorial effects on the dynamics of any infectious disease. Major changes to travel patterns affect both transmission, as people spend more or less time in high-risk places, and detection, as people change their propensity to visit healthcare facilities. These factors also influence individual behaviour, because local increases in reported cases can cause people to change their travel further. This creates critically important feedback loops between transmission, detection, and travel. Depending on the interactions between these factors, changes to travel or transmission could lead to undercounting of cases or a harmful population-level response that leads to communities being exposed to more infections. As changes in community-level travel patterns become more likely with global factors such as climate change and emerging infectious disease threats, it becomes increasingly important for models to integrate their effects on both detection and transmission. The project addresses this need by developing novel models that account for the ways in which travel can simultaneously affect both transmission and detection, and be affected by reported and perceived disease risk. The Investigators will combine the models with mobility data obtained from SafeGraph and use local surveys to inform underdetection rates of key notifiable diseases across the New River Valley Health District of Virginia, and to develop a framework for predicting transmission and detection changes during future large-scale changes in travel.

Such models are often encoded as chemical reaction networks (CRNs), involving large collections of reactions that describe how constituents of the system, such as proteins, change their states over time. CRN model components are often only partially known, and thus methods which mix theoretical physics-based models for known components, with techniques that estimate unknown components and their dynamics from experimental data, can improve their predictive capabilities. This is the domain of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). This project will develop new SciML methods for constructing, simulating, and analyzing CRN models that include randomness in the evolution of protein states, an important feature to accurately predict the behavior of chemical systems within individual biological cells. The new methods will be applied to problems in systems and synthetic biology (the understanding of native, and the development of novel, cellular systems), but will also be applicable across a wide range of fields involving CRNs (including epidemiology, physical chemistry, and pharmacology). Via their incorporation into widely used open source software libraries of the SciML organization, the methods will be freely available for use by any researcher studying problems across science and engineering. Training opportunities will be provided for a postdoctoral scholar and an undergraduate researcher, who will gain experience working in interdisciplinary teams, developing SciML methods, integrating these methods into open source software, and applying the new software to study biological systems.<br/><br/>This project extends the mathematical understanding of discrete stochastic derivative estimators to facilitate scaling Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) training techniques to chemical reaction networks (CRNs). One distinct difficulty in extending SciML to cellular systems is their proneness to noisy behaviors, as they are modeled as discrete stochastic jump processes via stochastic simulation algorithms such as the Gillespie method. Such processes are problematic for many SciML workflows which critically depend on automatic differentiation (AD) to scale training techniques. This is because there previously existed no general method for applying AD to them in an unbiased manner with low variance estimators. This project builds on a recent extension of AD to discrete stochastic processes which is capable of generating unbiased low variance derivative estimators. The rigorous connection between the generated stochastic process for the derivative estimator and the derivative probability evolution given by the sensitivity equations will be proven, thus establishing a firm theoretical underpinning for the unbiasedness and variance of the derivative estimator in the context of CRNs. The feasibility to deploy discrete stochastic AD (DSAD) on cellular models to perform model calibration will be demonstrated, and SciML universal differential equation methods for model discovery will be generalized to the theory-based data-driven discovery of missing reactions in CRNs. Finally, the applicability of these methods will be demonstrated on a range of cellular systems (including the B-cell antigen receptor signaling system, the ?V lysozyme stress response system, and a mixed feedback oscillator).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators of this project hypothesize that human behavior may also play a key role in why diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, such as dengue and Zika, have been so difficult to control. Aedes mosquitoes lay eggs in household water storage containers, meaning that behaviors related to water storage, water consumption, and water container management impact mosquito populations and, thereby, diseases transmitted by these mosquitoes. The central objective of this project is to understand how humans make decisions about preventive actions against Aedes-borne diseases and how those actions in turn affect disease dynamics and subsequent individual-level decision-making. The project will focus on the city of Ibagué, Colombia, where public health officials have long used behavioral approaches to intervene against Aedes-borne diseases. Empirical social science research will investigate how individuals respond to these interventions and characterize differences among individuals in their responses. Mathematical modeling research will estimate the effectiveness of these interventions at the population level. Throughout the project, a close connection with community members and local public health officials will be cultivated to ensure the effective translation of project outcomes. Training and capacity building activities will extend the impacts of the project to settings beyond Ibagué.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a mechanistic understanding of the role of behavior in infectious disease dynamics and mathematical modeling tools that are capable of accounting for those mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of enabling more effective use of public health interventions. The project will be grounded in empirical social science research in Ibague?, a city in Colombia with one of the highest urbanization rates and Aedes-borne disease transmission rates in the country. A combination of observational and experimental approaches will be used to characterize heterogeneity in the adoption of mosquito prevention behaviors in and around the home and to understand the cues that drive the adoption, or neglect, of those behaviors. These empirical findings will be used to develop a mathematical model of individual decision-making around the use of mosquito prevention behaviors in response to individual-level behavioral dispositions that change over time as cues arise and subside. This decision-making model will then be incorporated into an agent-based model of Aedes-borne disease transmission that will be used to infer the effectiveness of behavioral interventions that public health officials use to control Aedes-borne diseases in Ibague?. Finally, a suite of simpler macroscopic models will be developed and assessed with respect to their ability to capture effects of behavioral interventions on epidemiological dynamics simulated with the agent-based model. The ultimate outcome of the project will be the development and validation of minimally complex mathematical models that are capable of predicting responses of epidemiological dynamics to behavioral interventions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is widely accepted that gap junctional coupling is the primary mechanism for the electrical conduction. Nevertheless, recent experimental observation raised the concern of whether conduction can be sustained in the absence of gap junctions. Ephpatic coupling (EpC) is an electric field effect developed at the intercalated disc (ID) between adjacent cells, which has been suggested as an alternative way in mediating intercellular electrical communication when gap junctions are impaired.

This framework seamlessly bridges biophysical responses of different space and time scales, which helps understand the potential impact of EpC on arrhythmogenesis in the heart. Therefore, the proposed research is highly inter- disciplinary and provides a bridge between mathematical modeling and cardiac electrophysiology.

In response to vessel injuries, blood will clot to prevent bleeding. The clotting response is complex and involves numerous biochemical and biophysical components working together under the influence of flow. Certain diseases or drugs may cause clots to form improperly, resulting in life-threatening bleeding or pathological clot growth with vessel occlusion. Due to the intricate biochemical and biophysical aspects of the clotting system, predicting its responses and identifying the regulatory mechanisms underlying these responses is difficult. Mathematical models of blood clotting provide powerful tools for designing new drugs, experiments, and patient-specific therapies, but there are still great challenges in formulating such models. This research focuses on developing new mathematical models of essential biochemical players and their involvement in complex biophysical processes. These models will be used to test hypotheses related to regulation of blood clotting and optimal drug design. Additionally, graduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary research and help to organize summer workshops in mathematical biology. The workshops will be offered to local community college students, with the goal being their recruitment and retention into four-year programs by offering active learning, faculty and graduate student mentoring, peer networking, and timely advising. <br/><br/>This research will build a comprehensive modeling framework coupling the biochemistry, biophysics, and biomechanics of blood clotting. It will address mechanistic questions about regulating the generation and sequestration of thrombin, the most important enzyme in the clotting process. Specifically, the research will focus on (1) development of a mathematical model that accurately describes thrombin's binding to fibrin (the polymer that stabilizes growing blood clots) and explains the extended periods of time that thrombin has been observed to stay bound to fibrin under flow, (2) development of a mathematical model that incorporates a new, platelet-dependent mechanism to inhibit thrombin generation and explains observed inhibition under flow, and (3) development of a new numerical method to model platelets as discrete objects immersed in a fluid, interacting elastically, responding to molecules in the surrounding fluid, and carrying information via molecules bound to their surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER proposal will evaluate and develop reliable shape analysis methods that can harness the recent bio-imaging data explosion, advance our understanding of the fundamental rules of life, and enable breakthroughs in data-driven biomedicine. Tightly integrated with the research activities, the education and outreach objective is to engage diverse audiences in shape analysis and bioscience through novel art-science performances for high-school students, pioneering courses on geometric machine learning for shape analysis, training of graduate students, and free community outreach lectures for the wide audience.<br/><br/>Despite impressive advances in the field of shape analysis, its deployment to biosciences is prohibited by computational and statistical hurdles. This yields challenges related to the interpretation of results, where inconsistent analyses bear the danger of driving scientific conclusions in the wrong direction ?a serious drawback for a discipline that ultimately researches human health. In mathematics, (biological) shapes can be represented as shapes of key points, shapes of curves, or shapes of surfaces. The associated shape data spaces present common abstract geometric structures of non-Euclidean manifolds. This project will utilize these commonalities to establish a consistent numerical framework to systematically and exhaustively evaluate the possible inconsistencies of machine learning algorithms on shape spaces.

A key hypothesis underpinning both of these aims is that mathematical and statistical theories of randomness can unlock longstanding mysteries surrounding ovarian function and cessation of function. In one example, even though women are born with around one million primordial follicles (the basic reproductive units that contain eggs), they will only ovulate a few hundred eggs during adulthood. For this reason, ovaries in mammals are sometimes called ""wasteful."" By developing mathematical models and theories that are closely integrated with biological experiments, this project seeks to explain this and other perplexing features of ovarian biology. In addition, menopause presents women with a number of challenging symptoms and health consequences. Cardiovascular health, bone density, muscle mass, body fat composition, and other measures all worsen as menopause approaches. This has led to a recent surge of interest and investment in pharmacological biotechnologies which aim to delay menopause. However, there is currently no theory to predict how such interventions will affect menopause timing. This project aims to develop such a theory, which will be guided, modified, and validated by biological experiments.<br/><br/>Mathematically, this proposal seeks to develop extreme value theory for random variables which are not independent and identically distributed (iid). Such a theory would constitute a major advance in stochastics theory and find immediate application in a wide range of areas of science. Extreme value theory deals with extreme events in the tails of probability distributions. Such statistical ""outliers"" are critical to ovarian biology because the lifespan of ovarian health depends on the last few tenths of a percent of primordial follicles to growth activate. While there are classical results for the iid case, extreme value theory for non-iid random variables is severely limited. Biologically, the proposal contains innovative approaches to address a very long-standing problem in the field: how are individual dormant primordial follicles selected for growth activation while the majority remain dormant over long periods of time? If validated, the hypotheses of this proposal would transform our understanding of ovarian aging, including the landmark stages of the menopausal transition, and menopause. Though stochasticity is often viewed as an obstacle in physiology, this work can help us to determine how random processes function to ensure robust, reliable female reproductive aging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these migratory cycles are potentially disrupted as the timing of these resources are impacted by global climate change. To address the above knowledge gap, the interdisciplinary team of principle investigators (PIs) comprising a mathematician, biologist, and data scientists will develop novel mathematical models such as stochastic dynamic programming and agent-based models to gain mechanistic understanding of how migratory animals determine their routes and timing in response to environmental cues, and how those can be affected by climate change. The project will promote the use of the eBird database, which is a grassroots effort enabling citizens to directly contribute bird observations data using a mobile app. The project is a collaboration between Ohio State University and Oklahoma State University and offers valuable educational, training, and outreach opportunities.  In addition to training of PhD students, the PIs propose to establish a K-12 program with a daylong workshop to engage the public and raise awareness of bird conservational efforts and impacts of climate change, as well as a summer undergraduate research program targeting underrepresented groups (ROMUS program at Ohio State). At the professional level, the PIs will organize synergistic activities to facilitate exchanges between mathematicians and biologists. These include a confirmed week-long workshop at Banff International Research Station in October 2024, for over 100 virtual and in-person participants. This research will improve our understanding of the effects of climate change on migrating bird populations and inform future conservation and management of wildlife. <br/><br/>A critical question for understanding ecological responses to global change and conserving biodiversity in a changing world, is whether migrating animals can adjust their migration routes and schedules to track key resources even as the phenology of these resources shifts with climate change. In the case of birds with seasonal migratory routes crossing hemispheres, past studies have detected asynchrony between spring vegetation green-up and their arrival at breeding areas. This raised the concern that migrating birds may be negatively impacted by climate change. This interdisciplinary team of mathematician, biologist and data scientists will address the above knowledge gap by developing stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) models and agent-based models (ABM) for migrating animal populations. First, the aim is to develop an SDP model with switching costs in a continuous-time framework, in the context of optimal migration problem. The PIs will formulate and analyze the resulting Bellman equations and address the theoretical challenge of connecting individual migration decision to emergent population patterning. In addition, the PIs will also use spatially explicit agent-based modeling in parallel with and to extend the proposed mathematical modeling. Finally, the PIS will leverage remote sensing data on spring green-up across the Western Hemisphere with population level migration data for bird species from eBird database, for parameter estimation and model result comparison.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Key steps in the phage growth process include: the packaging of the viral DNA inside a preformed icosahedral volume (called capsid), the three-dimensional arrangement of DNA inside the capsid and the delivery of the DNA molecule, from the capsid into the bacterial cell, at the time of infection. These three steps are all highly influenced by the biophysical properties of the DNA molecule in spatial confinement.  In this project, the investigators will combine experiments and mathematical modeling to provide a thorough characterization of DNA organization inside phage capsids and its delivery at the time of infection. The research will bridge several mathematical disciplines including continuum mechanics (theory and simulations) of liquid crystals, analysis of free boundary problems, dynamics and knot theory. The interaction between the theoretical and experimental work is fashioned following the ideas of the Materials Genome Initiative, that fostered a systematic interconnected approach between mathematical modeling and experimental work, aimed at improving efficiency in the design and discovery of new materials. The project will train two graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigators will focus on a paradigm shift in the field of DNA knotting due to spatial confinement by hypothesizing and rigorously proving, according to the theory by Landau and de Gennes, that DNA knots observed are line defects of a tensor field associated to liquid crystal configurations. This paradigm shift is aimed at better capturing the three-dimensional arrangement and topological properties of packaged DNA, the formation of DNA knots, and their dependence on the environmental ions. In parallel with the development of mathematical theory, new experimental work will be pursued. In particular, the research will explore the generation of knotted conformations exclusively driven by the liquid crystalline structure of confined DNA.  The investigators will also develop models to study genome release from bacteriophages at the time of infection. The investigators will apply methods previously developed in the study of polyelectrolyte gels combined with tools from protein binding to develop a state-of-the-art approach to genome release. The mathematical problem consists of a constraint system of partial differential equations for an ionic two-phase media: water and DNA, that includes activation by ratchet forces.  By combining modeling, analysis, and computation, the investigators aim at characterizing the time scales associated with the different mechanisms of genome delivery and simulate a full infection process for specific viruses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Human behaviors relevant to disease spread such as social distancing, wearing face coverings, or testing when asymptomatic depend on a host of factors including risk perceptions, physical ability as well as the availability of resources and opportunities. Policy interventions by health agencies or other decision makers can impact these factors to alter human behaviors. Using decision models to tailor these interventions by time and sub-population can ensure efficiency (e.g., low cost), effectiveness (e.g., less hospitalizations), and equity (e.g., fairness in access to pharmaceuticals). The overall goal of this project is to incorporate behavior change driven by public health interventions into mathematical epidemiological models to inform decision making and policy evaluation during infectious disease outbreaks. The investigators consider respiratory diseases in general, and use COVID-19 as an example to validate the approach and quantify impact. The proposed methods can be generalized to other applications where policy makers target behavior change, such as medication adherence.<br/><br/>In Aim 1, the investigators will trace the impact of policy interventions on infection-preventive behaviors through mechanisms of action (i.e., capability, opportunity, and motivation). Nine types of policy interventions will be considered (education, persuasion, incentives, coercion, restriction, training, nudging, modeling, and enablement) in relation to two types of preventive behavior ? interpersonal protection (i.e., social distancing, wearing a face mask) and service utilization (i.e., testing, vaccination). The empirical work involves a dynamic meta-analysis of interventions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, supplemented by Delphi methods. The investigators will develop an online tool that will enable researchers to contribute to the meta-analysis and use the resultant weighted-average effect sizes as inputs for agent-based modeling. The results of Aim 1 will be operationalized by integrating adaptive human behaviors into an agent-based model (ABM). However, realistic ABMs with a large number of agent types and complex behavioral and social processes are computationally intensive to simulate, analytically intractable, and may not be generalizable. These drawbacks may inhibit the comprehensive analysis and validation of ABMs and thereby prevent their utilization for decision- and policy-making during a pandemic. Thus, in Aim 2, the investigators propose an equation learning framework to derive ordinary differential equation (ODE) models from ABMs. The investigators also introduce novel regularization techniques that incorporate biophysical constraints to provide interpretable results for decision-makers. These ODE models and the learned functional forms approximating the impact of interventions on behavioral and social processes that drive disease spread will be used in Aim 3 to inform policies through bilevel optimization models.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several studies provide evidence that climate change can influence the frequency and occurrence of zoonotic spillover. Nonetheless, current mathematical models have largely overlooked the effects of climate change on zoonotic spillover. By enhancing the modeling approaches, the researchers of this multidisciplinary project seek to understand what challenges zoonotic pathogens must overcome to transmit from wild animal hosts to humans or other animals, how climate change can reduce these challenges and make it more plausible for zoonotic pathogens to live within and between new species, and what kinds of environments have a higher likelihood of zoonotic spillover in the view of climate change. <br/><br/>The research team will use decades of weather, wildlife population, and zoonotic disease data to identify significant variables that can be incorporated into the models and to accurately estimate epidemiological predictors of spillover (e.g., the force, speed, and direction of disease spread and the basic reproduction number) as functions of significant weather and environmental factors.  The numerical simulations of the calibrated models will help the researchers elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing the ecology of zoonotic disease and predict possible influences of climate change.  Furthermore, this study builds on the existing wave theory of pathogen and population dispersal to advance the theoretical knowledge of traveling and stationary waves, including their existence, uniqueness, stability, and asymptotic behaviors.

From social distancing and mask-wearing in response to perceived risk of infection to changes in non-pharmaceutical Interventions under economic pressures, human responses altered the COVID-19 pandemic outcomes. In this project, foundational steps are taken toward the vision of merging behavioral and epidemiological models. This line of research leads to epidemiological models that represent human behavior and the spread of the disease in interconnected structures, contribute to more accurate forecasting of an epidemic, and enhance policy-making with major impacts on societal well-being.

Mathematically, the system dynamics approach builds on ordinary differential equation models and various statistical methods for estimation and validation. The modeling approach and validation techniques rely on multiple data sources on human behavior and the spread of the disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon building and validating coupled behavior-disease models, the central hypothesis of the study is tested: Models that incorporate human behavioral changes endogenously outperform those that lack such feedback mechanisms in long-term forecasting tasks, and offer distinct policy recommendations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The consequences of human-induced transformations on our environment and the reciprocal impact of the changing global environment on humanity have been profound. To address these challenges and improve human well-being, researchers, scientists, and engineers are generating large amounts of data on the evolving condition of our world and its inhabitants in novel, multidimensional forms. Unfortunately, existing mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques offer only partial tractability in comprehending these complex datasets. New, thoughtfully developed mathematical methods and modeling approaches are desperately needed to gain a deep and robust understanding of these data for human benefit and to mitigate human harm. The successful completion of this project will result in a robust and scalable computational framework for constraining large parameter spaces in agent-based models with real-world data. Agent-based models are widely recognized as a powerful computational framework for advancing our understanding of human disease, human-society interactions, and environmental systems. However, their inherent stochasticity and prohibitive computational expense pose significant barriers to integrating such models with real-world data. The new approach will provide a much-needed platform for exploring parameter uncertainty and sensitivity in multiscale agent-based models representing complex biological phenomena. Ultimately, the new methods developed here will result in a scalable mathematical tool for operationalizing computationally complex models designed to solve formidable biological problems that are of great interest to biologists, ecologists, clinicians, and health policymakers.<br/><br/>Unlocking the full potential of computationally complex mathematical models to advance our understanding of interconnected biological systems urgently requires techniques for integrating these models with multifaceted real-world data.  Multiscale agent-based models (ABMs) are widely recognized as a powerful computation framework for advancing our understanding of systems ranging from molecular, cellular, and tissue dynamics to human-society interactions, infectious diseases, and ecological systems.  However, to make meaningful, reliable quantitative predictions and to gain mechanistic insight, ABMs must be integrated with real-world data through model parameterization and calibration. Unfortunately, robust, scalable techniques for addressing the challenges posed by the inherent stochasticity and heavy computational requirements of an ABM in integrating it with real-world data are sorely lacking. Hence, there is a critical need to develop new theoretical and computational approaches to bridge this gap between ABM parameters and real-world data.  This project develops a new computational framework for parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis of multiscale ABMs informed by noisy, sparse, and multifaceted real-world data.  The method utilizes explicitly formulated and mechanistic surrogate models simultaneously inferred from both the ABM formulation and the data to link the two in previously impossible ways. The approach will open new possibilities for ABMs representing complex biological phenomena to uncover how data sets can hide unexpected or counter-intuitive underlying mechanisms that have profound implications for predicted outcomes and planned interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Alongside the ebb and flow of the disease, societal emotions, behaviors, and public health policies changed leading to a complex feedback loop: people?s behaviors shaped disease transmission, but as disease prevalence changed, so too did people?s behaviors. For example, a COVID-19 surge may trigger people?s anxiety and lead them to reduce their in-person interactions and put in place policies such as stay-at-home orders or mask mandates. Combined, these changes transiently control the surge until policies and behaviors relax and transmission rebounds again. Unlike many of the previous COVID-19 studies that have focused only on the unidirectional relationships within this feedback loop, such as the way policies impact behavior and the way pandemic trends impact policies, this project will develop models that can provide a holistic understanding of the complex interrelations between emotions, behavior, policies, and infection trends using the available COVID-19 data in the US and other countries. This effort will helpful for comprehensively understanding complex disease transmission dynamics, which will improve the abilities to anticipate infectious disease trends and enact meaningful public health policies for future infectious disease threats.<br/> <br/>In more concrete terms, the team will focus on two understudied socio-behavioral components that complement each other to form the feedback loop of COVID-19 dynamics. Thrust 1 will examine the role of psychological processing and decision-making using a collection of aggregated time-series data of SARS-CoV-2 infections, policies, emotions, and behaviors from 20 major metropolitan regions in the US (e.g., Reddit conversational data for tracking emotions). The goal will be to integrate psychological and behavioral processes mechanistically into COVID-19 epidemiological models and statistically estimate the time-varying relationships across the first two plus years of the pandemic. Thrust 2 will examine the role of dynamic and heterogeneous social contact patterns in infectious disease modeling in relation to social, behavioral, and political factors. Existing and newly obtained social mixing surveys that collect people?s contact data along with socio-behavioral variables will be analyzed to identify factors that characterize people?s contact patterns and responses to policies.

The investigators of this project hypothesize that human behavior may also play a key role in why diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, such as dengue and Zika, have been so difficult to control. Aedes mosquitoes lay eggs in household water storage containers, meaning that behaviors related to water storage, water consumption, and water container management impact mosquito populations and, thereby, diseases transmitted by these mosquitoes. The central objective of this project is to understand how humans make decisions about preventive actions against Aedes-borne diseases and how those actions in turn affect disease dynamics and subsequent individual-level decision-making. The project will focus on the city of Ibagué, Colombia, where public health officials have long used behavioral approaches to intervene against Aedes-borne diseases. Empirical social science research will investigate how individuals respond to these interventions and characterize differences among individuals in their responses. Mathematical modeling research will estimate the effectiveness of these interventions at the population level. Throughout the project, a close connection with community members and local public health officials will be cultivated to ensure the effective translation of project outcomes. Training and capacity building activities will extend the impacts of the project to settings beyond Ibagué.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a mechanistic understanding of the role of behavior in infectious disease dynamics and mathematical modeling tools that are capable of accounting for those mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of enabling more effective use of public health interventions. The project will be grounded in empirical social science research in Ibague?, a city in Colombia with one of the highest urbanization rates and Aedes-borne disease transmission rates in the country. A combination of observational and experimental approaches will be used to characterize heterogeneity in the adoption of mosquito prevention behaviors in and around the home and to understand the cues that drive the adoption, or neglect, of those behaviors. These empirical findings will be used to develop a mathematical model of individual decision-making around the use of mosquito prevention behaviors in response to individual-level behavioral dispositions that change over time as cues arise and subside. This decision-making model will then be incorporated into an agent-based model of Aedes-borne disease transmission that will be used to infer the effectiveness of behavioral interventions that public health officials use to control Aedes-borne diseases in Ibague?. Finally, a suite of simpler macroscopic models will be developed and assessed with respect to their ability to capture effects of behavioral interventions on epidemiological dynamics simulated with the agent-based model. The ultimate outcome of the project will be the development and validation of minimally complex mathematical models that are capable of predicting responses of epidemiological dynamics to behavioral interventions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

People?s movements determine who is at risk of the disease and whether new cases are counted by local public health agencies. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people?s movements changed drastically and, in addition to COVID-19, influenza and Lyme disease cases also dropped nationwide. These drops in cases may be because people spent less time in high risk areas, or simply because people traveled to healthcare facilities less frequently, and so fewer cases are reported. Distinguishing between these alternatives is critical for understanding disease control and predicting disease spread, but is made difficult when travel patterns change dramatically. This problem is especially challenging because communities may modify travel patterns in response to local disease, which can, in turn, change how diseases spread in communities and how public health monitors disease. To determine the cause of case reductions as human movements changed, the Investigators will develop new mathematical models that account for the ways travel impacts both risk and detection, using data from mobile phones to inform transmission risk and using local surveys to inform underdetection rates. By developing this new collection of models, the Investigators will better understand how transmission and detection of various non-COVID-19 infections changed throughout the pandemic, recognize how this depends on the biology of the disease being considered, and predict how case numbers may change during future periods of significant community-level changes in travel.<br/><br/>Community-level travel patterns have multifactorial effects on the dynamics of any infectious disease. Major changes to travel patterns affect both transmission, as people spend more or less time in high-risk places, and detection, as people change their propensity to visit healthcare facilities. These factors also influence individual behaviour, because local increases in reported cases can cause people to change their travel further. This creates critically important feedback loops between transmission, detection, and travel. Depending on the interactions between these factors, changes to travel or transmission could lead to undercounting of cases or a harmful population-level response that leads to communities being exposed to more infections. As changes in community-level travel patterns become more likely with global factors such as climate change and emerging infectious disease threats, it becomes increasingly important for models to integrate their effects on both detection and transmission. The project addresses this need by developing novel models that account for the ways in which travel can simultaneously affect both transmission and detection, and be affected by reported and perceived disease risk. The Investigators will combine the models with mobility data obtained from SafeGraph and use local surveys to inform underdetection rates of key notifiable diseases across the New River Valley Health District of Virginia, and to develop a framework for predicting transmission and detection changes during future large-scale changes in travel. Central Appalachia is a key region for this work, as it experiences relatively high incidence of respiratory and Lyme diseases, and intervention adherence was especially low during the later stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such models are often encoded as chemical reaction networks (CRNs), involving large collections of reactions that describe how constituents of the system, such as proteins, change their states over time. CRN model components are often only partially known, and thus methods which mix theoretical physics-based models for known components, with techniques that estimate unknown components and their dynamics from experimental data, can improve their predictive capabilities. This is the domain of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). This project will develop new SciML methods for constructing, simulating, and analyzing CRN models that include randomness in the evolution of protein states, an important feature to accurately predict the behavior of chemical systems within individual biological cells. The new methods will be applied to problems in systems and synthetic biology (the understanding of native, and the development of novel, cellular systems), but will also be applicable across a wide range of fields involving CRNs (including epidemiology, physical chemistry, and pharmacology). Via their incorporation into widely used open source software libraries of the SciML organization, the methods will be freely available for use by any researcher studying problems across science and engineering. Training opportunities will be provided for a postdoctoral scholar and an undergraduate researcher, who will gain experience working in interdisciplinary teams, developing SciML methods, integrating these methods into open source software, and applying the new software to study biological systems.<br/><br/>This project extends the mathematical understanding of discrete stochastic derivative estimators to facilitate scaling Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) training techniques to chemical reaction networks (CRNs). One distinct difficulty in extending SciML to cellular systems is their proneness to noisy behaviors, as they are modeled as discrete stochastic jump processes via stochastic simulation algorithms such as the Gillespie method. Such processes are problematic for many SciML workflows which critically depend on automatic differentiation (AD) to scale training techniques. This is because there previously existed no general method for applying AD to them in an unbiased manner with low variance estimators. This project builds on a recent extension of AD to discrete stochastic processes which is capable of generating unbiased low variance derivative estimators. The rigorous connection between the generated stochastic process for the derivative estimator and the derivative probability evolution given by the sensitivity equations will be proven, thus establishing a firm theoretical underpinning for the unbiasedness and variance of the derivative estimator in the context of CRNs. The feasibility to deploy discrete stochastic AD (DSAD) on cellular models to perform model calibration will be demonstrated, and SciML universal differential equation methods for model discovery will be generalized to the theory-based data-driven discovery of missing reactions in CRNs. Finally, the applicability of these methods will be demonstrated on a range of cellular systems (including the B-cell antigen receptor signaling system, the ?V lysozyme stress response system, and a mixed feedback oscillator).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ecological processes depend on the flow and balance of essential elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. These essential elements can affect juvenile consumers differently than adult consumers. Such age/stage-specific effects affect population dynamics, suggesting age/stage-structured mathematical models are needed to accurately capture and understand population dynamics. The development of age/stage-structured population models over the decades has significantly contributed to understanding energy flow and population dynamics of ecological systems. However, current models fail when fertility and maturation play important roles in nutrient recycling and ecosystem function.  Here, investigators will design and conduct laboratory experiments in conjunction with developing mathematical models that incorporate age/stage-specific nutritional constraints on growth, time to maturation, and reproduction. This will result in the development of new theoretical applications in ecology that investigate how varying nutrient levels help shape ecological communities. The project is a collaboration between Texas Tech University, Haverford College, and California State University Northridge, and offers valuable educational, training, and outreach opportunities. Specifically, undergraduate and graduate students will receive interdisciplinary training and mentorship in the fields of mathematics and ecology to gain the ability to ask, answer, and achieve broad understandings of scientific problems, that is necessary to communicate effectively across disciplines. Investigators and students will be involved in K-12 outreach initiatives. <br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the interactive effects of stoichiometric constraints and population dynamics, particularly, how organismal stage structures and ecosystem function influence each other. To this end, the investigators will develop and analyze a series of empirically testable and robust mathematical models of population dynamics structured under the framework of Ecological Stoichiometry. The theory of Ecological Stoichiometry emphasizes the balance of essential elements throughout ecological interactions.  Compartmental systems of ordinary differential equations and delayed integro-differential equations will be developed to address complex questions about stage-specific nutritional constraints, and their consequences on maturation and reproductive output. Dynamical systems theory and tools will be used to interpret and analyze the models including analytical, numerical, as well as bifurcation analysis.  The synthesis of the models and experiments will integrate the field of structured population mathematical modeling with the theory of Ecological Stoichiometry.

Project INSIGHT addresses two sets of questions about behavioral responses to social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) How does compliance with isolation policies drive disease mitigation outcomes? and (2) Does social isolation lead to unanticipated negative social outcomes, and if so, how?  Social isolation and individual distancing are key tools in mitigating large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, social interactions are crucial for the health and prosperity of individuals and their communities. Social isolation is associated with negative outcomes such as substance use and abuse, domestic violence, and reduced mental and physical health. These negative effects are often pronounced in rural, low-income, and older communities. The primary goal of INSIGHT is to model both positive and negative effects and thereby improve our understanding of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and its long-term effect on society.

Using a classical segmentation of populations into compliant and non-compliant groups, a switching function is defined to account for changes in behavior. Games with appropriate payoff functions that inform individuals? behavioral choices are used. (2) Opioid misuse treatment adherence. A model according to severity of substance use disorder is created, implementing treatment adherence with game-derived utility functions and incorporating drug-seeking behavior of affected individuals, Model parameters like recovery and deaths are accounted for via well-defined behavioral functions. (3) Domestic violence. Focusing on intimate partners, economic-dependent functions are used to capture partners? choices such as abuse, forgiveness, seeking help, or leaving the domestic violence cycle. The modeling efforts use data from several national and local sources.

Researchers analyze patterns in DNA sequences to piece together organisms' evolutionary histories, and the estimation of these relationships has diverse applications. Examples include characterizing the evolutionary patterns of metastatic colorectal cancer or determining the relationship between different viral strains. The evolutionary history is often represented by a phylogenetic tree that displays the ancestry and descent relationships among organisms; however, genetic information is not always transferred vertically, and in these cases, the relationships should be represented by a network. For example, two viral genomes can co-infect the same host cell, leading to the exchange of genetic segments, called recombination, and thus contributing to their diversity. Additionally, organismal evolution occurs at two distinct levels: at the level of individual genes and at the level of species, which constrains the histories of the individual genes. Accurate estimation of evolutionary trees and networks is a major problem in mathematical and statistical inference since the precision of their estimation has a direct impact on fields such as epidemiology, forensic medicine, biosecurity, and cancer biology. The main objective of this project is to improve the scalability and accuracy of current methods and develop new methods for inferring phylogenetic species networks. The project is a collaboration between the American University and University of Florida and offers valuable educational and outreach opportunities. Specifically, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in phylogenetic methodologies as part of the process, resulting in a vertical transfer of knowledge.<br/> <br/>The work for inferring species-level relationships from multigene alignments are specific to models that simultaneously account for variability in individual gene histories due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, gene flow, hybridization, and recombination. The focus is on site-based species methodologies, with the goals of (1) improving quartet species inference and scalability; (2) implementing inference of rooted species trees from rooted triples; (3) developing more efficient site-based methods for identifying hybrid species or recombination events without the need for an outgroup; and (4) implementing site-based species network inference from quartets and 4-taxon networks.  To achieve these goals, the PIs will extend multiple mathematical ideas from Markov models in the single gene tree setting to models under coalescent and gene flow, such as leaf transformations and a measure based on paralinear distance, which so far have not been formally described, tested, or implemented under the species tree model. The method for hybrid species identification is based on deriving functions whose ratio approaches the ratio of the mixing parameter, which is distinct from current algebraic methods that look for vanishing polynomials over networks.

However, these migratory cycles are potentially disrupted as the timing of these resources are impacted by global climate change. To address the above knowledge gap, the interdisciplinary team of principle investigators (PIs) comprising a mathematician, biologist, and data scientists will develop novel mathematical models such as stochastic dynamic programming and agent-based models to gain mechanistic understanding of how migratory animals determine their routes and timing in response to environmental cues, and how those can be affected by climate change. The project will promote the use of the eBird database, which is a grassroots effort enabling citizens to directly contribute bird observations data using a mobile app. The project is a collaboration between Ohio State University and Oklahoma State University and offers valuable educational, training, and outreach opportunities.  In addition to training of PhD students, the PIs propose to establish a K-12 program with a daylong workshop to engage the public and raise awareness of bird conservational efforts and impacts of climate change, as well as a summer undergraduate research program targeting underrepresented groups (ROMUS program at Ohio State). At the professional level, the PIs will organize synergistic activities to facilitate exchanges between mathematicians and biologists. These include a confirmed week-long workshop at Banff International Research Station in October 2024, for over 100 virtual and in-person participants. This research will improve our understanding of the effects of climate change on migrating bird populations and inform future conservation and management of wildlife. <br/><br/>A critical question for understanding ecological responses to global change and conserving biodiversity in a changing world, is whether migrating animals can adjust their migration routes and schedules to track key resources even as the phenology of these resources shifts with climate change. In the case of birds with seasonal migratory routes crossing hemispheres, past studies have detected asynchrony between spring vegetation green-up and their arrival at breeding areas. This raised the concern that migrating birds may be negatively impacted by climate change. This interdisciplinary team of mathematician, biologist and data scientists will address the above knowledge gap by developing stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) models and agent-based models (ABM) for migrating animal populations. First, the aim is to develop an SDP model with switching costs in a continuous-time framework, in the context of optimal migration problem. The PIs will formulate and analyze the resulting Bellman equations and address the theoretical challenge of connecting individual migration decision to emergent population patterning. In addition, the PIs will also use spatially explicit agent-based modeling in parallel with and to extend the proposed mathematical modeling. Finally, the PIS will leverage remote sensing data on spring green-up across the Western Hemisphere with population level migration data for bird species from eBird database, for parameter estimation and model result comparison.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although less than one-fifth of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, these areas encompass about 97% of the total land area in the United States and thus the population density for rural areas is low. Traditionally, mainstream epidemiological models focus on settings with high population density, such as major U.S. cities. To study rural epidemiology, it is necessary to develop epidemiological models and analyses tailored to the unique demographics and geographic isolation of rural areas. This grant brings together expertise in mathematical modeling, high-performance computing, geographic information systems, and medical sociology to develop a framework for reliable and accurate real-time epidemic forecasts for mountain-West States, such as Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and Colorado. The project involves constructing a data-driven multiscale mobility network, using the combination of de-biased mobile phone data, American Community Survey (ACS), and census data in these regions. With a multiscale mobility network, the principal investigators (PIs) will be able to examine how containment policies during a pandemic, such as mobility reduction interventions, stay-at-home orders, and State border lockdowns, impact the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, and how such policies may exacerbate the disparities of public health and social inequalities in rural areas. The study will help government health officials develop equitable policies and mitigation strategies for rural places in the future epidemic. Furthermore, the proposed community outreach will raise awareness of disease prevention in Wyoming.<br/> <br/>This grant offers solutions to three research questions in rural epidemiology: Q1. How to construct a metapopulation mobility network tailored to rural places? Human mobility is one of the factors driving the spread of infectious diseases across wide geographical ranges. The project introduces a metapopulation model embedded in a multiscale data-driven mobility network tailored to the unique structures of rural population density and human moving patterns for simulating infection dynamics of the front-range States. For this metapopulation mobility model, the PIs will adapt and improve the efficiency of Gillespie?s event-driven algorithms and derive a proper time step for large-scale stochastic simulations. The PIs will also implement an efficient particle filter algorithm for data assimilations to estimate local transmission parameters at two scales. Q2. How to detect and correct mobile phone data bias? If the bias of the mobile phone data used to construct the mobility networks is not addressed, infection dynamics simulations may incorrectly estimate the severity and speed of disease transmission. The project will investigate the bias of mobile phone data used to construct the mobility network and develop a method to offset the data bias. Q3. What are the impacts of containment measures on disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups? The PIs will use the proposed unbiased multiscale metapopulation mobility model to study the impacts of temporary mobility reductions and their lasting behavior-modifying effects on the disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups in the front-range States.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program, the SBE Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES), and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key hypothesis underpinning both of these aims is that mathematical and statistical theories of randomness can unlock longstanding mysteries surrounding ovarian function and cessation of function. In one example, even though women are born with around one million primordial follicles (the basic reproductive units that contain eggs), they will only ovulate a few hundred eggs during adulthood. For this reason, ovaries in mammals are sometimes called ""wasteful."" By developing mathematical models and theories that are closely integrated with biological experiments, this project seeks to explain this and other perplexing features of ovarian biology. In addition, menopause presents women with a number of challenging symptoms and health consequences. Cardiovascular health, bone density, muscle mass, body fat composition, and other measures all worsen as menopause approaches. This has led to a recent surge of interest and investment in pharmacological biotechnologies which aim to delay menopause. However, there is currently no theory to predict how such interventions will affect menopause timing. This project aims to develop such a theory, which will be guided, modified, and validated by biological experiments.<br/><br/>Mathematically, this proposal seeks to develop extreme value theory for random variables which are not independent and identically distributed (iid). Such a theory would constitute a major advance in stochastics theory and find immediate application in a wide range of areas of science. Extreme value theory deals with extreme events in the tails of probability distributions. Such statistical ""outliers"" are critical to ovarian biology because the lifespan of ovarian health depends on the last few tenths of a percent of primordial follicles to growth activate. While there are classical results for the iid case, extreme value theory for non-iid random variables is severely limited. Biologically, the proposal contains innovative approaches to address a very long-standing problem in the field: how are individual dormant primordial follicles selected for growth activation while the majority remain dormant over long periods of time? If validated, the hypotheses of this proposal would transform our understanding of ovarian aging, including the landmark stages of the menopausal transition, and menopause. Though stochasticity is often viewed as an obstacle in physiology, this work can help us to determine how random processes function to ensure robust, reliable female reproductive aging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such communities are key players in all geochemical cycles; they are present in all multicellular organisms, including humans, where in addition to possibly harmful effects, they also have essential beneficial roles. They are ubiquitous in engineered systems as well where, again, they can be beneficial (e.g., waste water treatment) or harmful (e.g., drinking water distribution). In large part, microbial communities interactions with their environments are metabolic through chemicals they take in, products they make with these inputs, and byproducts they excrete, so understanding these metabolic capabilities is essential for understanding how microbes effect their surroundings. Advances in genetic sequencing are making it easier and easier to determine microbial ""machinery"" (enzymes); researchers are becoming increasingly adept in predicting how this ""machinery"" combines into ""assemblage lines"" (metabolic pathways). Armed with this knowledge, the next step is to understand how these ""assembly lines"" fit into their environment into a sort of large scale ""distribution system"" that determines overall microbial community function. At large scale, this becomes a challenging computational problem, and current methods are not adequate. This project aims to accelerate these computations by introducing machine learning tools into key bottlenecks in the algorithms. The project is a collaboration between Temple University, Montana State University, and the University of  California, San Diego and offers valuable educational, training, and outreach opportunities. <br/> <br/>Activity funded by this proposal would center on development of computational methods, based on machine learning and artificial intelligence assisted optimization, that are sufficiently efficient so as to make it possible to embed complex cell-scaled models of microbial behavior (metabolic and gene expression models, so-called ME modes) into environmental scale PDE-based models of microbial community activity. In support of this effort, ME models of several specific organisms (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis) will be adapted for use in specific environmental-scale models (basic biofilm communities and built-environment subaerial communities). In complement, environmental-scale continuum-mechanics-based (partial differential equation) models for these systems will be constructed and adapted for use with the new computational methods.

Capturing human behavior is complex and challenging, as new and unexpected behavioral patterns emerge constantly. This is especially evident during epidemics, which are shaped by a wide variety of behaviors and, in turn, accelerate the speed of behavioral changes. For example, the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic was greatly shaped by behaviors such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and vaccination, and these behaviors also emerged and changed dramatically over the course of the pandemic in response to changing disease risks, social norms, government decisions, and incentives. The aim of this project is to develop epidemiological models that can make predictions based on real-world behaviors and capture feedback loops between behaviors, epidemics, and government decisions, thus enabling more effective public health decisions.<br/><br/>The aims of this project are accomplished by improving mathematical and machine learning methods for dealing with real-world epidemics and introducing novel approaches to the capture of real-world human behavior and integration of behavioral responses into epidemiological models.  First, novel methods are proposed to denoise and derive meaning from multimodal, real-world sensors, such as mobile phones and search engine logs, the data from which is often highly imperfect but which provide unique opportunities to capture human behavior.  This allows the capture of complex human behaviors in real time.  Second, to bridge epidemiological models and real-world behaviors, agent-based models of disease dynamics are coupled with models of human behavior that capture how individuals choose behaviors based on perceived costs and benefits.   Such models are computationally complex and require new methods to calibrate and validate on real data to enable realistic forecasting of epidemics. Finally, to evaluate the complex effects of public health decisions on behavior and epidemic outcomes, new scenario modeling tools and causal inference methods are developed to estimate effects of such decisions in the presence of confounders and interference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mechanistic mathematical models are powerful tools to understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases, evaluate the impact of various control measures, and forecast the trajectory of cases and deaths. Lack of empirical data on social contact patterns and their temporal variation, however, has hindered progress and application of these models. Specifically, there is a dearth of social contact data from individuals with acute infections and their close contacts, such as household members, as behavior data have traditionally been collected from healthy individuals. Consequently, transmission models for acute infections often rely on simplistic assumptions that infected individuals perfectly isolate themselves or that contact patterns remain unchanged throughout the infectious period. These unrealistic assumptions in model structure and parameterization can introduce bias into the results. To address this issue, in this project the temporal changes in contact patterns among individuals with acute infection and their close contacts is measured.  Long-term benefits of the project include the building of capacity in infectious disease modeling, thus providing decision makers and public health officials with more informed decision-making tools to develop interventions. <br/><br/>To achieve research objectives, clinic-based approaches are employed to recruit U.S. cases with acute respiratory infections and acute gastroenteritis and household members of these cases. Daily changes in their contact patterns are captured over a two-week period using an online contact diary and how these patterns vary by disease severity is assessed.  Household members of these cases are recruited to evaluate how close contacts modify their behaviors following exposure. This enables development of transmission dynamic models (susceptible-infectious-recovered models and appropriate elaborations), which are structured and parameterized based on the behavioral realism investigated in this study. SARS-CoV-2 is used as an example of acute respiratory infection and rotavirus is used as an example of acute gastroenteritis. How the estimation of key model parameters as well as the impact of interventions differ (i.e., improve) after incorporating behavioral feedback into these mechanistic models is quantified.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there has been a recent explosion of new techniques developed for the analysis of data sets and networks that have potential application to the analysis of neural spike trains.

Given this, a useful approach is to base ideas on measurements that have the most information, even when the accuracy is not great, which suggests using dynamics that vary both in space and time. This proposal builds on this premise to develop models from statistical physics combined with data obtained from remote sensing. The underlying correspondence between ecological dynamics and statistical physics models is accomplished by coarse graining the ecological data and using models that permit only a small number of states of the population. This approach complements more traditional mathematical approaches based on dynamical systems and is well suited to crude data. The overall goal will be to predict the features that either facilitate or prevent synchrony in dynamics across space through time. This will yield new understanding of ecological dynamics with potential for improving conservation and agricultural practices.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to develop novel mathematical approaches for spatio-temporal dynamics in ecological systems, with a focus on relevant time scales. Understanding the processes that have led to spatial synchrony in ecological populations across space and at multiple temporal scales is a substantial challenge, made more urgent by the need to understand and predict the impacts of a changing climate. Most of the longstanding mathematical tools for ecological dynamics focus on asymptotic behavior, but real ecological systems are likely strongly influenced by transient behavior. In addition, ecological data are often very noisy, generating substantial uncertainty to which our methods much be robust. The Investigators will apply novel and highly complementary quantitative methods to questions about the origins and consequences of ecological synchrony. First, the Investigators will use the idea of Ising universality ? well established in statistical physics but severely underdeveloped for its potential biological applications ? to consider synchronization in a detail-independent manner. The Investigators will then apply modern machine learning techniques to better understand the details of how actual synchrony patterns arise, using remotely sensed orchard data as a case study. Mechanistic models of intermediate complexity will serve as a bridge. By connecting the simplified but universal Ising model description with the data-intensive machine learning methods the Investigators seek to validate, improve and better understand both approaches to understanding ecological synchrony. Synchrony and spatial patterning are central to conservation biology and public health, and uncovering universal rules for pattern formation will open a path to new insights in these fields.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Environmental Biology (DEB) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Population and Community Ecology Cluster (PEC).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, one can induce a cell to change from one type (e.g., skin cells) to another type (e.g., neurons or heart muscle cells) for curing various diseases such as Alzheimer?s disease. Current advances of single cell techniques and machine learning algorithms lead to development of data-driven mathematical equations to describe how a large number of genes regulate each other to regulate the cell types. The funded research is to apply mathematical tools originally developed in other fields to analyze these equations. Such mathematical analyses will provide mechanistic insights on understanding how genes coordinately regulate cell types, and guide experimental designs to effectively accelerate or slow down transitions between different cell types, which are of high biomedical significance.

The research aims to address a new challenge to expand the tools for downstream analyses of the dynamical equations and apply tools developed in other contexts to single cell data analyses. In mathematical biology researchers have toolkits to analyze the behaviors of a biological system described by a set of dynamical equations. These tools, such as phase-plane analyses and bifurcation analyses, are typically restricted to either a system with a few degrees of freedom or a few selected parameters. Thus, new tools are needed for analyzing dynamical equations with a large number (e.g., > 20) of degrees of freedom. The investigators will use the recently developed discrete graph representation of a vector field together with discrete Hodge decomposition and other network analysis methods for characterizing multi-dimensional vector field and system dynamics including cyclic transitions on developmental and cell fate transition processes.

Researchers analyze patterns in DNA sequences to piece together organisms' evolutionary histories, and the estimation of these relationships has diverse applications. Examples include characterizing the evolutionary patterns of metastatic colorectal cancer or determining the relationship between different viral strains. The evolutionary history is often represented by a phylogenetic tree that displays the ancestry and descent relationships among organisms; however, genetic information is not always transferred vertically, and in these cases, the relationships should be represented by a network. For example, two viral genomes can co-infect the same host cell, leading to the exchange of genetic segments, called recombination, and thus contributing to their diversity. Additionally, organismal evolution occurs at two distinct levels: at the level of individual genes and at the level of species, which constrains the histories of the individual genes. Accurate estimation of evolutionary trees and networks is a major problem in mathematical and statistical inference since the precision of their estimation has a direct impact on fields such as epidemiology, forensic medicine, biosecurity, and cancer biology. The main objective of this project is to improve the scalability and accuracy of current methods and develop new methods for inferring phylogenetic species networks. The project is a collaboration between the American University and University of Florida and offers valuable educational and outreach opportunities. Specifically, graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in phylogenetic methodologies as part of the process, resulting in a vertical transfer of knowledge.<br/> <br/>The work for inferring species-level relationships from multigene alignments are specific to models that simultaneously account for variability in individual gene histories due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, gene flow, hybridization, and recombination. The focus is on site-based species methodologies, with the goals of (1) improving quartet species inference and scalability; (2) implementing inference of rooted species trees from rooted triples; (3) developing more efficient site-based methods for identifying hybrid species or recombination events without the need for an outgroup; and (4) implementing site-based species network inference from quartets and 4-taxon networks.  To achieve these goals, the PIs will extend multiple mathematical ideas from Markov models in the single gene tree setting to models under coalescent and gene flow, such as leaf transformations and a measure based on paralinear distance, which so far have not been formally described, tested, or implemented under the species tree model.

Ecological processes depend on the flow and balance of essential elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. These essential elements can affect juvenile consumers differently than adult consumers. Such age/stage-specific effects affect population dynamics, suggesting age/stage-structured mathematical models are needed to accurately capture and understand population dynamics. The development of age/stage-structured population models over the decades has significantly contributed to understanding energy flow and population dynamics of ecological systems. However, current models fail when fertility and maturation play important roles in nutrient recycling and ecosystem function.  Here, investigators will design and conduct laboratory experiments in conjunction with developing mathematical models that incorporate age/stage-specific nutritional constraints on growth, time to maturation, and reproduction. This will result in the development of new theoretical applications in ecology that investigate how varying nutrient levels help shape ecological communities. The project is a collaboration between Texas Tech University, Haverford College, and California State University Northridge, and offers valuable educational, training, and outreach opportunities. Specifically, undergraduate and graduate students will receive interdisciplinary training and mentorship in the fields of mathematics and ecology to gain the ability to ask, answer, and achieve broad understandings of scientific problems, that is necessary to communicate effectively across disciplines. Investigators and students will be involved in K-12 outreach initiatives. <br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the interactive effects of stoichiometric constraints and population dynamics, particularly, how organismal stage structures and ecosystem function influence each other. To this end, the investigators will develop and analyze a series of empirically testable and robust mathematical models of population dynamics structured under the framework of Ecological Stoichiometry. The theory of Ecological Stoichiometry emphasizes the balance of essential elements throughout ecological interactions.  Compartmental systems of ordinary differential equations and delayed integro-differential equations will be developed to address complex questions about stage-specific nutritional constraints, and their consequences on maturation and reproductive output. Dynamical systems theory and tools will be used to interpret and analyze the models including analytical, numerical, as well as bifurcation analysis.  The synthesis of the models and experiments will integrate the field of structured population mathematical modeling with the theory of Ecological Stoichiometry. The resulting theoretical frameworks and their findings will help shed light on the interplay between elemental constraints and stage-structures within ecological systems and broaden the types of ecological questions that models can answer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Obesity and type 2 diabetes accelerate the progression of deadly, age-related neurodegeneration like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact, by 2050, AD will impact every American family; 1 in 7 Americans over 65 will have AD, and there is no clear, effective pharmaceutical treatment regime in sight.  In the absence of practical pharmaceutical treatment strategies for AD, understanding how AD can be delayed through modifiable risk factors, such as diet and exercise, is of paramount importance.  NSF-funded mathematicians and nutritional scientists from Texas Tech University are coming together to develop new methods for studying how the modifiable risk factors in obesity and diabetes, like the types of food one chooses to eat or how much exercise and sleep one can get, affect AD.  To do this, the investigators are developing new mathematical models to relate factors like brain inflammation and metabolic stress to AD progression and producing the necessary computer software to solve these types of problems on large, complex human brain graphs generated from medical data.  The research aims to identify what modifiable factors matter the most for delaying AD, and the team of investigators is partnering with rural community leaders to bring their results straight into the lives, and onto the dinner tables, of American families. This project will provide training for graduate mathematics students and one part-time summer undergraduate. Additionally, this project will allow the investigators to partner with Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service to bring the results of this research directly to under-served populations in Lubbock and surrounding counties through Better Living for Texans.<br/><br/>Oxidative stress, brain insulin sensitivity and neuroinflammation are salient mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and known associates of modifiable AD risk factors.  What mediation of modifiable factors delay the pathogenesis and progression of AD? Detailed studies that investigate modifiable risk factors for AD in human subjects face significant ethical, technical or financial barriers.  To avoid these challenges, the research team will employ an agile approach based on mathematical models that describe the evolution of AD-associated amyloid-beta and tau protein pathology on complex human brain networks generated from medical data. The goals of the interdisciplinary project are threefold.  First, to devise novel, high-dimensional network dynamical systems (NDS) that express the evolution of AD protein pathology in the presence of perturbed insulin homeostasis, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.  Second, to construct effective computational software, based on high-performance libraries such as PETSc and SUNDIALS, that instantiates and solves large NDS models via an accessible, high-level programming interface.  Third, to analyze the NDS models using techniques from the theory of differential equations, networks and data science in addition to performing large computational simulations of AD pathology on brain graphs derived from patient neuroimaging data.  Combining these research outcomes will develop an understanding of the efficacy of altering modifiable AD risk factors and enable high-level recommendations for the public to mitigate the risk of developing AD in their lifetime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With unlimited nutrients and space, a single E. coli cell can multiply into the size of planet Earth in two days. In reality, population growth is a complex nonlinear process influenced by environmental cues and constrained by numerous factors. All cell growth is dependent upon the availability of various essential nutrients and space. The complex dynamics of life is thus shaped by ubiquitous multiple resource limitation (MRL) from gene expression up to the global ecosystem level. Such dynamics may be described in the forms of nonlinear mathematical models based on laws of conservation that govern nutrient limitations. These models may embody rules of life that exhibit emerging systematic properties applicable to multiple temporal and spatial scales. Discovering such rules is the goal of this team of researchers. This project will generate a variety of biological and mathematical modeling resources for the scientific community. The project will produce uniquely trained graduate students and undergraduates with experiences in integrating studies across ecology, evolutionary biology, and applied mathematics fields. The research will further advance society's ability to predict, design and engineer controllable population dynamics in laboratory and natural settings. In addition, the project's intimate association of modeling with experimental work affords the scientific community an opportunity to develop both modeling and experimental approaches in synchrony to better understand the complexity observed in experiments.<br/><br/>Motivated by and based on complex time series data sets from existing and ongoing experiments of flour beetle (Tribolium) populations, it is anticipated that this proposed work will address one specific and compelling question about how the MRL shapes the spatiotemporal organization of life. More specifically, the investigators seek to classify complex population dynamical patterns according to three main stages: 1) the transient and seemingly chaotic dynamics characteristic of the initial exponential growth stage that may be subject to influence by random factors to 2) the stable intermediate growth stage, and 3) final or asymptotical growth stage. It is expected that new hidden interactions will emerge between organisms and these stages due to competition for shared limiting resources, leading to complex and highly nonlinear properties that are rare under a single resource limitation concept but could lead to catastrophic problems in real-world ecosystems. Understanding the rules of behavior of these emergent properties consisting of the nutrient state of living individual, living systems, their environments and interactions will help the society to identify early-warning signals and formulate control strategies to address the issues of resilience and sustainability in evolving environments. The main objective of this proposal is to formulate a family of MRL population growth models, validate them via experimental data and understand their complex dynamics with the help of emergent mathematical theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This estimation is challenging because different genomic regions evolve under processes that make their evolutionary histories (i.e., gene trees) discordant. This issue is exacerbated by widespread gene tree estimation errors in modern phylogenomic analyses. To address this challenge, this project's primary objective is to devise innovative mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to analyze phylogenomic datasets without relying on gene tree estimation. This approach will produce more reliable species tree estimates in the presence of confounding processes. Species trees provide an evolutionary and comparative context in which many biological questions can be addressed. They play a vital role in understanding gene evolution, estimating divergence dates, detecting adaptation, studying trait evolution, etc. The developed methods will enhance the precision of biological discoveries based on species trees, advancing research that utilizes phylogenies. The project includes interdisciplinary research training for graduate students as well as the involvement of undergraduate students recruited through local initiatives. New course materials based on the proposed research will be developed for existing graduate courses and be made available through the PI?s website. The project will leverage connections to NSF-funded interdisciplinary institutes.<br/><br/>It is well established that different regions of a genome can evolve under different gene trees, due to processes such as incomplete lineage sorting, gene duplication and loss, and lateral gene transfer, complicating the estimation of species trees. Many methods that first estimate gene trees and then combine this information to estimate a species tree are known to have good theoretical guarantees, under the assumption that the true gene trees are known. That assumption is not satisfied in practice. Accounting theoretically for gene tree estimation error has proved challenging and few results are available. Building on prior work by the PI on the rigorous study of stochastic processes arising in this phylogenomic context, the proposed research will establish much-needed theoretical foundations for the analysis of multi-locus, multi-site datasets and the estimation of species trees without gene trees, including the development of novel estimators, the derivation of impossibility results and matching finite sample bounds, and the investigation of the effect of intra-locus recombination. This project will also enable the development of statistically rigorous, scalable algorithms.

These multifaceted cells fight infections, repair damage, remove debris, and are central to maintaining brain health.  However, these cells can go rogue and contribute to neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's Disease.  This is linked to a shift in their cellular metabolism, but how and why this metabolic reprogramming occurs and its impact on disease progression remains unknown.  This project will develop and analyze multi-scale mathematical models to better understand the role of various molecular mechanisms in microglia behavior and how this behavior influences and orchestrates further cellular activity in the brain.  This project will incorporate and train undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research techniques.  Additionally, the project will assess the impact of an undergraduate research experience on students' science identity and persistence in STEM.    This project aims to accomplish three specific goals: 1) Modeling microglia metabolism in a single healthy cell and understanding how the metabolism corresponds to phenotype commitment and behavior through ordinary differential equation modeling and analysis; 2) Incorporating crosstalk between microglia and other cell types and mathematically describing a potential lactate shuttle which may occur under inflammatory conditions through ordinary differential equation modeling and analysis; and 3) Incorporating a spatial component and cell heterogeneity by using agent-based models.  The primary tools to be used for this project include numerical simulation, global sensitivity analysis, and parameterizing models by using data from biological experiments conducted by collaborators in parallel with the mathematical work.  Cross-talk and agent-based models will specifically consider pathways linked to Alzheimer's Disease.  The project will also evaluate the impact of the undergraduate research experience with a mixed method study to assess changes in students' sense of belonging, science self-efficacy, and science identity.

This research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships that drive ecological systems and contribute to the development of effective conservation strategies. Two important questions regarding biology of interacting species are considered: 1) do predators affect the relationship between density and prey emigration, Allee effects and local or regional stability of prey species? and 2) does the presence of predators affect occurrence or strength of competition-dispersal, competition-reproduction or dispersal-reproduction tradeoffs and therefore coexistence of competitors?

These spiking patterns exhibit a striking level of variability, even in neural network that are driven by identical sensory stimuli. Owing to this variability, neural networks have been thought to operate in the asynchronous state. In the asynchronous state, neurons fire independently from one another, so that the probability that a neuron experience synchronous synaptic inputs is exceedingly low. This neglect of synchrony has been further supported by the apparent weakness of spiking pairwise correlations. However, recent experimental and theoretical works seriously challenge this view. Specifically, large-scale spiking recordings have revealed weak but nonzero spiking correlations. At the same time, the levels of voltage variability observed in single-cell recordings cannot be explained without some degree of input synchrony, compatible with weak but nonzero spiking correlation. To address the challenge posed by these recent findings, the PI will characterize how synaptic synchrony can stably emerge in networks that are otherwise plagued with biological noise. Specifically, the PI will (1) model synchrony-based input correlations via jump processes, (2) elucidate how noisy spike-generation mechanisms can propagate synchrony to output neurons, and (3) characterize how synchrony-based correlations can stably emerge in limit neural networks. The payoff of (1) will be characterizing how activity correlations can explain the high degree of observed neural variability. The payoff of (2) will be estimating the temporal information content of a spike. The payoff of (3) will be identifying the network features stabilizing synchrony-based correlations. While reaching for his research goals, the PI will design an original undergraduate flipped course mixing mathematics and neuroscience audiences. Within the research center that he animates, the PI will also kickstart a service offering for affiliates who want to acquire theoretical support in their research project. <br/><br/>Cortical spiking patterns can exhibit exquisite time precision of behavioral relevance. This supports the prevalence of time codes for which neuronal spiking is synchronized. However, the maintenance of spiking precision is at odds with typically observed level of cortical noise. This supports the prevalence of rate codes, for which neurons spike asynchronously. That said, such a coding dichotomy is misleading as the same neuron can jointly acts as a synchronous coder and as an asynchronous coder. The PI will resolve the synchronous/asynchronous coding dilemma as a matter of degree rather than a matter of alternative, by characterizing collective dynamics in idealized neural circuits with nontrivial spiking correlations. Concretely, nontrivial correlations will arise from synaptic synchrony, whereby synapses to a neuron tend to coactivate over small timescales with respect to the neuron?s time constant. This is by contrast with most theoretical approaches which are rooted in mean-field approximations with trivial correlation structure. To resolve the synchronous/asynchronous coding dilemma, the PI will develop a novel theoretical and computational framework to model, quantify, and analyze the impact of synchrony on neural dynamics. The mathematical challenges at stake will be to perform (1) a stochastic analysis of biophysically-relevant neuronal models when driven by synchronous input, (2) an probabilistic analysis of the spike-generating mechanism viewed as a free-boundary problem, and (3) bifurcation and scaling analyses of the nonlinear partial differential equation capturing the so-called Poissonian mean-field dynamics. In all cases, the methodology will exploit modern analytical and probabilistic techniques in combination with advanced numerical methods.<br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the MPS/DMS Mathematical Biology program and CISE/IIS Robust Intelligence program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop will provide an opportunity for junior researchers, including graduate and undergraduate students, postdocs, early career faculty, as well as experienced mathematicians and biologists to learn innovative research practices on advances in mathematical ecology. Particularly, the workshop will be an interdisciplinary event that brings together researchers from Mathematics and Ecology to discuss the effects of ecological factors such as changes in environmental conditions on species adaptation, migration, and coexistence. These topics will be addressed via talks and poster presentations based on experimental data, modeling approaches, and theoretical and computational mathematics.  As such, the workshop will promote connections across areas of mathematics and facilitate the exchange of ideas between mathematics and other areas such as ecology, natural resource management, evolutionary biology, and computer science. The workshop includes activities for broadening participation of the underrepresented groups and promoting equity and inclusion in the mathematical sciences. Specifically, participants are selected to promote equity and diversity across participants and include researchers and trainees from a diverse pool of career stages, both from local and nationwide institutions. With the speaker's consent, slides and recordings from conference talks will be posted on the conference webpage to achieve an even broader dissemination of results and impact. All participants will be encouraged to submit their work to the Journal of Biological Systems, an open-access platform, which agreed to feature a special issue dedicated to this workshop.<br/><br/>The workshop ?Advances in Mathematical Ecology? aims to increase the research activities and interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers from mathematics, ecology, natural resource management, evolutionary biology, and computer science. Although the mathematical analysis of ecological models often neglects environmental variability to aid in the attainment of analytical results, experimental data suggests that ecologically important traits can evolve rapidly in response to environmental changes/variability.  This may affect species fitness, persistence, migration, and immune systems and highlights the need to incorporate environmental fluctuations into efforts to predict how species will respond to such environmental factors. Indeed, understanding how species respond to changing environments is fundamental for the sustainable management of species and their ecosystems. The workshop will highlight the impact of environmental changes as measured from experimental and analyzed data, techniques for the implementation of environmental fluctuations in ecological and eco-evolutionary models, and methods to study the effects thereof on how species evolve over time. The specific workshop topics will include: i) Methods of implementing environmental fluctuations in spatio-temporal ecological models with a comparison of seasonal forced model parameters and models including probabilistic parameters. ii) The potential and limitations of data-driven models in ecology, and their alignment with theoretical models. iii) Experimentally observed and model-predicted effects of environmental changes on the dispersal of species, on the interaction across species, and on how species respond to diseases. These topics involve links across the areas of Mathematical Modeling, Ecology, Evolution, Nonlinear Dynamical Systems, Stochastic Dynamics, Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations, Calculus of Variations, and Statistics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Visually distinct root shapes of wild tomato can be distinguished by evaluating the root architecture as a network in which lateral root tips, which absorb water and nutrients, need to be connected to the root base, which supports shoot growth. This network design considers two competing objectives: minimizing the building blocks of a network (cost) and minimizing the transport time from root tips to root base (speed). To improve the relevance of the model to the physiology of plants, the model will be expanded to include the effects of gravitational forces and account for anatomical differences between the main and lateral roots. To identify the genes underlying root network design, we will use genetic approaches and generate mutant plants that will be evaluated for network efficiency, as well as plant productivity and resilience. Understanding mathematical and genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture will lead to designing better crops with improved productivity and stress resilience, thereby contributing to increased sustainability of food production. Additionally, an improved understanding of biological networks and how they grow can be applied to transportation networks, allowing transit systems to naturally scale with population growth.<br/><br/>This project will develop methods for explaining and optimizing the structure of natural transportation networks, such as the root system architecture of wild tomato plants. Initial work will involve developing a numerical optimization algorithm for constructing minimal Euclidean Steiner trees that are subjected to non-linear constraints. We will apply the Euclidean Steiner tree algorithms towards quantifying how tomato root architectures optimize trade-offs between conserving material costs and ensuring efficient nutrient and water transport, especially when growth trajectories are constrained by gravitational forces and differential cost/transport qualities imposed by the differences in root anatomy. We will also study measurements of root architecture growth to reverse-engineer an algorithm for constructing optimal Steiner trees using purely distributed computation. Our goal is to use forward genetics to identify genetic components underlying the development of optimal architectures under non-stress and salt stress conditions. The identified algorithms, ideotypes and genetic mechanisms will serve as targets for plant breeding and genetically engineering stress-resilient crops. We anticipate that the methods we develop can be generalized towards explaining, designing, and optimizing transportation networks found in other natural and engineered systems.

Scientists, businesses, governments and independent organizations want to learn from this data so they can understand basic biological mechanisms, invest capital, allocate aid and design coherent policy in a changing world. Evolutionary contagion (Evo-Con) models seek to identify and predict viral variants with heightened rates of spread by jointly modeling viral contagion and evolution. Analyzing spatial patterns of viral contagion is an area of immense scientific interest, but the task requires accounting for the nature of transportation networks that shape the global economy. As a result, big data applications become computationally intensive and benefit from high-performance computing. The project advances knowledge and utility of Evo-Con models in the context of massive amounts of complex, dynamic and geographically distributed data. In lockstep with these developments, the investigator will develop ""Statistical Learning Goes Viral"", a free-access MOOC (Massive Open Online Course), with concomitant free-access expository textbook and further expand his efforts building bridges between UCLA and key historically black colleges and universities.<br/> <br/>The investigator will combine theory, methods and computing in a way that facilitates high-impact data analysis and easy measurement of success. The PI will (1) develop a class of nonlinear and multivariate phylogenetic Hawkes processes that use autoregressive neural networks to maintain both flexibility and scalability. Nonlinear phylogenetic Hawkes process development will capitalize on experience building heavily hierarchical models for joint data, but a pragmatic approach will depart from previous Bayesian implementations to enhance scalability and prediction; and (2) adapt these stochastic process models to complex transportation patterns in a way that responds to spatial data precision by combining nonlinear dimension reduction with convolutional neural networks (CNN). When travel networks explicitly present themselves, the PI will leverage experience building spatial models that account for network structures by incorporating nonlinearities through graph CNNs. More radical within phylogeography, the PI will eschew explicit network representations with the help of spherical CNNs that build implicit representations of global spatial dependencies to model viral contagion with increased flexibility. By hierarchically combining (1) and (2) within the same factor graph, the joint data neural model will fully integrate spatial, genomic, and temporal data. Finally, the investigator will (3) construct high-performance computing techniques that leverage conventional and quantum resources to fit complex, multimodal and high-dimensional model geometries. Computational developments will go well beyond track-record inventions of parallelized Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that use graphics processing units and quantum computers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It proposes novel approaches for combining laboratory experiments and multiscale mathematical modeling to characterize branching morphogenesis in the mammary gland. Branching morphogenesis is a process by which the female mammary gland develops its tree-like structure during puberty. It governs the formation of other tree-like organs such as the lungs, salivary gland, and kidney. Defects in branching morphogenesis can lead to hypertension, chronic kidney failure, and poor lung function. Mechanisms that control branching morphogenesis are circumvented or altered during the development and progression of breast cancer. Understanding the mechanisms that generate branched organs may identify novel ways to treat breast cancer, regenerate organ function, or design artificial organs to combat diseases. At puberty, branching morphogenesis generates an extensive network of mammary gland epithelium ducts. The epithelium ductal network is connected at its base to the nipple and plays a key role in milk synthesis and secretion for neonates. Molecular and mechanical factors in the tissue environment are important for normal branching morphogenesis. Majority of the research in this area has focused on identifying key molecular factors and the mechanisms by which they regulate branching morphogenesis. How mechanical signaling regulates branching morphogenesis remains largely unknown. The mathematical models proposed in this research will contribute to bridging this gap. This project will build novel multiscale mathematical models to predict how the interactions between mechanical and cellular signaling regulate the formation of the mammary ductal network. <br/><br/>Branching morphogenesis occurs through two stages: the first stage is via successive rounds of elongation and splitting of the tip of individual ducts (i.e., tip bifurcation) and the second stage is via budding along the sides of existing ducts (i.e., side branching).  Increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness is known to increase the sites for epithelium ductal branch initiation. However, how the mechanical signaling originating from the ECM affects branch elongation, tip bifurcation and side branching is not fully understood. This project will (1) combine optimal transport theory, agent-based models, and data from laboratory experiments to predict how interactions between ECM and epithelium cells regulate ductal branch elongation and tip bifurcation in the mammary gland, (2) apply topological data analysis and multifractal analysis to predict the role of tensional force and ECM stiffness on ductal tip bifurcation and side branching in the mammary gland. Findings from this research will improve our understanding of how biomechanical forces affect ductal network formation. This CAREER project will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students at San Diego State University (SDSU), a Hispanic Serving Institution. It will integrate mathematical biology research activities in the undergraduate curriculum at SDSU and train students early in their career to approach scientific inquiry in a way that crosses scientific disciplines. Furthermore, this project will provide a summer workshop to guide local teachers-leaders in creating teaching modules that integrate quantitative research and foster critical thinking in high school students in high-need urban schools.<br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the MPS-DMS-Mathematical Biology program, BIO-MCB-Cellular Dynamics and Function program, and MPS-PHY-Physics of Living Systems (PoLS) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
