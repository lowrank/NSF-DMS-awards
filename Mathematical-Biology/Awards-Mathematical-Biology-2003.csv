In so doing it uses recurrence analysis, a method derived from nonlinear dynamics. An important feature of this method is the absence of mathematical assumptions: proteins are relatively short, nonlinear and nonstationary, thus precluding the uninformed use of more traditional signal analysis methods. This strategy seeks to uncover unforeseen ""singularities"" of hydrophobicity in proteins and related function. The main steps of this signal analysis approach can be summarized as follows: 1) use of an hydrophobic code for primary structures; and 2) treatment of the hydrophobicity distribution along the sequence like a time series, with the corresponding use of nonlinear signal analysis techniques, in order to underpin fine position-dependent properties of the hydrophobicity profiles. It is posited that singularities in the code identify important loci at which proteins may fold correctly vs. aggregate. Moreover, the direction chosen is dependent upon local factors, or boundary conditions, which force a stochastic understanding of the process in terms of combinatorial probabilities. There is also a suggestion that these folding choices describe natural processes of aging and/or pathology The main aims of the project are: 1)the development of a preliminary taxonomy of these hydrophobic singularities; 2)a cataloguing of the singularities' protein context; i.e., a determination of their boundary conditions(e.g., secondary structure, absolute values, scaling etc.); and 3)an evaluation of their correlation with physico-chemical properties especially electrostatic variables The entire structure of the protein is fitted to perform many tasks but possibly only local patches (and consequently peculiar local hydrophobicity singularities) may be crucial for a given action or structure.<br/> From a chemical viewpoint, proteins, which are important elements in all forms of life, are made of amino acids. The majority of proteins ""fold"" as relatively small self-contained structures. Each protein found in nature has a specific three-dimensional structure and this structure is determined by the sequence of amino acids and their attendant degrees of aversion for water. This makes the particular linear arrangement of amino acids constituting a protein an efficient recipe for the solution of a chemico-physical problem that basically is the folding to a given unique three-dimensional structure in water solution. What the sequence must attain in order to be a real protein is basically to be water-soluble, having a well-defined (if not necessarily static) three-dimensional structure allowing for motions in solution (proteins do their work in a dynamical way by coordinated motions of their scaffolds) while at the same time maintaining their global shape. This is not an easy task and only a relative minority of linear amino acid arrangements are effective solutions to this problem. This is equivalent to saying that the ""code"" linking a sequence to its particular structure is not immediately apparent. Nevertheless it is known that the three-dimensional structure of a protein is in some (still obscure) way encoded in its amino acid order. Indeed, this question is more intriguing given the evidence that any protein can ""misfold,"" causing possibly diseases such as Alzheimer's, ""mad cow"" or ""aging"" in general. Thus, the most basic problem in the sequence/structure puzzle is: ""What particular linear arrangement of amino acids makes a real protein. This project seeks to answer this question by using unique ""signal analysis"" techniques which may uncover peculiarities in the sequence. Clearly, should distinctive conditions be discovered which promote particular protein folding behavior, enhanced understanding (and control) of pathology, senescence, and therapeutics could result.

It has become clear that the combination of predictive modeling with systematic experimental verification will be required to gain a deeper insight into living organisms, therapeutic targeting and bioengineering.  Although the importance of integrating various types of biological data to address scientific questions is well recognized and appreciated, the potential information carried in different types of data may not be fully realized without a sound and comprehensive statistical framework to integrate these data.  In addition, close collaborations among statisticians, biologists, bioinformaticians, and computer scientists are essential to ensure that these statistical methods provide a reasonable description of the biological processes studied and the validity of these methods should be rigorously tested through biological experiments.  In this project, a team of researchers with expertise in statistics, genomics and proteomics, bioinformatics, and computer science will develop an integrated approach to reconstructing biological pathways.  Statistical and computational methods will be developed to better identify transcription factor targets, to integrate yeast two-hybrid data, protein complex data, protein localization data, and gene expression data to infer protein interaction networks, and to further integrate DNA- protein binding data to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks.  This project focuses on the G1/S transition during the yeast cell cycle to statistically model and experimentally validate inferred regulatory networks.  In addition, parallel computing methods will be developed to overcome the computing bottleneck in the analysis of large-scale networks.  The resources generated from this project, both computer programs and network information will be made available to the scientific community.  It is anticipated that this project will lead to a statistical framework that can be utilized to dissect biological pathways and also will lead to an approach to integrating expertise from diverse disciplines to address important scientific problems in the post-genome era.<br/>With recent progresses in biotechnologies, it has become reality to collect tens of thousands of gene expression and protein expression levels in humans and other organisms.  In addition, scientists now are able to monitor interactions among proteins and interactions between proteins and DNA sequences, to investigate the location that each gene is expressed, and to study the overall effects on the whole organism of individual genes through large collections of mutation strains.  The availability of such data has led to a revolution in biological and biomedical sciences.  Although there is a great potential and an enormous amount of information in these data, the major challenge is how to best integrate, analyze, and interpret these data to understand biological pathways.  In this project, statistical and computational methods will be developed to integrate various types of data in an effort to reconstruct biological pathways with a focus on the understanding of gene regulations in cell cycle.  The statistical models to be developed will be validated with biological experiments.  Computer programs will be developed and distributed to the scientific community after extensive testing to allow biologists and medical researchers to use these tools to study other biological pathways.  This project will also develop high-performance computing approaches to implementing the developed methods and will involve training activities in the general area of computational biology and bioinformatics.

Its objectives are to (1) develop a robust and efficient parallel iterative algorithm for solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation; (2) define a new biomolecular potential-energy function through a large reduction of the number of conformation-freedom variables for a family of particular proteins; (3) develop a new sparse matrix compress scheme for programming an efficient application-tailored preconditioner in an optimal order of memory locations; (4) develop a parallel iterative algorithm for constrained molecular dynamics simulations; and (5) train undergraduate and graduate researchers for the post-genomic era. Specifically, the new algorithms and the new model will be applied to studying the molecular mechanism of membrane damage induced by the protein toxin Cyt1A upon membrane interactions. The theoretical results will also be compared to laboratory data produced by biochemical and biophysical methods such as fluorescence spectroscopy, surface tensiometry, and electron microscopy. Synthesis of the computational and experimental data may bring new insights to the manner of membrane permeabilization and damage by proteins that do not transverse the lipid bilayer.<br/> Efficient algorithms and modeling of protein-membrane interactions can save considerable amounts of time, money, and laboratory effort in biotechnology, medicine, agriculture, and the food, pharmaceutical, or defense industries. The new algorithms and the new model developed in this project can significantly simplify computing complexity in simulations of large protein-water-membrane systems. They can also be applied to various biomolecular simulations. In fact, numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation plays a central role in implicit solvent models. The molecular potential energy function is a cornerstone of molecular modeling, and the minimization of the molecular potential energy function and the molecular dynamics simulation are two fundamental tasks in computational biology. Furthermore, the chosen model protein, the toxin Cyt1A, has been used as an environmentally-safe insecticide specific against mosquitoes and blackflies. Elucidating its mode of action may help the industry increase the toxin's efficacy by targeting specificity and synergism with other insecticides. Additionally, through the collaboration between a mathematician/computer scientist and a biochemist/biophysicist, students involved in this project will be trained in a virtual hub of mathematics, computer science, and the life sciences.

In recent years, non-numerical data and parameters have emerged. The object of this project is to provide ways of averaging, building confidence regions, running Monte Carlo algorithms, doing regression and testing models for rooted binary trees. Currently biologists validate their phylogenetic trees by perturbing the data through a simple bootstrap of the columns of DNA sequences and then summarizing the collection of trees obtained by associating p-values to the branches of a consensus tree. This reduces the problem to a collection of binomial parameters, losing much of the multivariate information. A more geometrical procedure based on confidence regions in tree space is preferable and overcomes the multiple testing problem. The projects extends both Bayesian and frequentist inferential procedures for binary trees to a nonparametric context using a complete geometric construction of the relevant tree space. The mathematical tools include probability theory, topology and algebraic combinatorics. Collaboration with Louis Billera and Karen Vogtmann (Cornell Mathematics Dept.) has enhanced our mathematical understanding of tree space. The space of trees has negative curvature, thus we know we can define geodesics on this space as well as convex hulls. Many of the actual distance computations can have exponential complexity, good approximation algorithms are important for the applications considered. This work helps think about the statistics of biological networks as generalizations or mixtures of trees.<br/> A new type of data has appeared in genetics and molecular biology, these data are not real numbers or vectors, but trees, family trees or phylogenetic trees relating different species and hierarchical clustering trees relating different genes according to their differing expression patterns. This project provides programs for visualizing and doing statistics on these new data, we will provide the biologists with open source computer packages that they can use to analyze their own data. For instance, classical linear regression is based on projections; in the same way if we want to compare two sets of trees, we will use distances and methods for projecting in tree space. The project includes two workshops, one for mathematicians in the first stage, to publicize some of the harder open problems, and another in the last year to teach biologists how to use the geometrical tools developed in matlab or R in practical examples.

Much interesting and new mathematics has been<br/>motivated by disease, because the problems are inherently<br/>nonlinear and multidimensional.  On the other hand, the emergence<br/>of new diseases, the re-emergence of older diseases, and the<br/>potential of bioterrorism require that the mathematics be not<br/>only interesting and new, but applied and applicable.  In most<br/>cases of disease outbreak or emergence, learning about the<br/>parameters of the disease will occur as it progresses.  Thus, the<br/>questions sit at the intersection of the biology of disease,<br/>modeling, and analysis of data.  In this project, the PI<br/>nvestigator seeks to apply the process of ecological detection,<br/>in which different models compete as explanations of process and<br/>the data arbitrate the outcome of this competittion, to emerging<br/>or re-emerging disease.  The mathematical theory of disease leads<br/>to fundamental characterizations such as the basic reproductive<br/>rate of the disease, the critical number of susceptibles for<br/>infectives to initially spread, and the number of infectives in<br/>the population at the time that the first infection/death is<br/>discovered.  These in turn depend on fundamental population<br/>parameters, and those are the focus of the proposed work.  Methods<br/>are developed so that, as a disease progresses, one can learn<br/>about the transmission coefficient of the disease, the<br/>distribution of susceptibles, the level of aggregation in<br/>encounters between susceptibles and infecteds, and the level of<br/>detail needed in the models, for purposes of both understanding<br/>and prediction.  These methods are based on analysis of<br/>appropriate differential equations, computer simulation,<br/>stochastic dynamic programming and Bayesian statistical updating.<br/>Furthermore, real populations exist in networks, rather than as<br/>randomly mixing individuals, about which two kinds of questions<br/>can be asked.  First, given a specific model for the transmission<br/>of disease, what kind of network is created and what are the<br/>properties of that network?  Second, given a network of social<br/>interactions, what can be said about the dynamics of the disease<br/>on this network?  Both sets of questions are investigated.<br/>     The proposed work provides new conceptual and operational<br/>tools in dealing with emerging and re-emerging diseases such as<br/>HIV/AIDS, epidemic behavior of hepatitis C, the outbreak of<br/>foot-and-mouth disease and BSE in the UK, the potential of<br/>smallpox as a bioterrorist agent, and malaria.  The project also<br/>provides training to the next generation of applied<br/>mathematicians and mathematical biologists, who -- more than any<br/>generation before them -- are keen to solve practical problems in<br/>the real world.

Algorithms are developed for treating cross-linking and elasticity of growing actin-filament networks in the presence of several types of cross-linking proteins. These are used to determine the response of a cell to external signals that influence cross-linking and branching rates. The algorithms use a stochastic-growth methodology, which treats actin filament growth, depolymerization, capping, branch formation and detachment, and attachment of filaments to each other by cross-links. Elastic effects are included in the algorithms by the use of a special-points method. The three-dimensional structure of the actin cytoskeleton is followed at a resolution of individual subunits. The values of the rate parameters in the model are obtained from in vitro experiments for simplified cases. The code is also used to evaluate the potential for spontaneous formation of localized protrusions. The model predictions are tested by polymerization experiments with several types of cross-linking and branching proteins. <br/> Practically all types of cells are capable of moving in a way very different from muscle cells: white blood cells chasing bacteria, cells moving to remodel tissue after an injury, and migrating cancerous cells. Such motion is based on the protein actin, which is very abundant in cells, and accumulates in long filaments. These filaments can connect to each other, forming networks or other types of structures, which can push against a cell membrane and thus cause the cell to move. The ""decision"" about whether and how a cell moves is based on external signals, which activate or deactivate various types of filament connections. But it is not known exactly what actin structures form in response to a given set of external signals. The calculations predict these structures using powerful simulation methodologies based on parallel computers. By thus establishing the response of the actin structures in cells to external signals, one can hope to better understand the nature of diseases related to these actin structures. This will also help in understanding the migration of cancerous cells, which could eventually aid the development of cancer treatments.

Presently, image alignment requires the use of fiducial markers and is relatively labor-intensive and error prone. An information theoretic procedure is proposed that performs automatic image alignment without fiducial marks. The proposed solution exploits the rich information content in tomographic images and explicitly accounts for the unique transformation between images. Volume segmentation is one of the most crucial, yet labor-intensive, time-consuming, and subjective steps in electron tomography. Automated segmentation of tubular objects can be very challenging because of extremely low object contrast relative to the surroundings, a highly uneven and irregular surface topology, and significant variations in cellular attachments. The proposed segmentation approach consists of dividing the problem into three major tasks: 1) tubular structure enhancement; 2) tubular structure detection; and 3) tubular surface morphology reconstruction and detection of end structures. Towards the first task, a model-based filter is proposed that will enhance cylindrical structures while de-emphasizing the irrelevant structures. Towards the second task, a robust feature detection technique is proposed to localize the tubular portion of fibers. Towards the third task, a statistical local region growing technique is proposed that will grow the detected underlying cylinder in all directions to produce the surface morphology and internal discontinuities of the actual structure. <br/> The proposed methods will have wide applicability to electron tomography and other forms of medical imaging. The alignment methods are completely general and the prevalence of microtubules and similar tubular or fibrous motifs in cellular and medical imaging ensures wide applicability of the segmentation methods. With appropriate modifications, the proposed segmentation methods could be adapted to membrane and vesicle geometries. By addressing the two bottleneck steps, the proposed methods have the potential to transform electron tomography into a powerful, routine tool for research and diagnostic investigations. These methods also have potential application to other medical imaging projects. Thus, this project is designed to enable electron tomography to realize its full potential for analysis of subcellular structure and function in the post-genomic era.

This research focuses on the development of statistical and computational methods for the analysis of protein interaction data coming from high-throughput proteomic technologies such as yeast two-hybrid assays and mass spectrometry, and protein function data coming from databases of large-scale function annotations. The research involves the study of the following two important problems in biology: (1) identifying domain-domain interactions and protein-domain interactions from a large number of protein-protein interactions, and (2) assigning functions to unknown proteins from the knowledge of the functions of the annotated proteins, gene expression profiles, gene knockouts, protein sequence similarities, and protein-protein interactions. These results obtained for yeast proteins can help us predict interactions and functions of human<br/>proteins. Training postdoctoral associates and graduate students from mathematics, statistics, computer science and molecular biology for proteomic research is an important part of the proposed research. Based on the existing excellent education program in the field of computational biology and bioinformatics within the Center for Computational and Experimental Genomics (CCEG) in USC, the principal investigators plan to train future researchers through rigorous course work, seminars, discussion groups, and participation in the research project.<br/>In recent years, an increasing number of genomes of model organisms have been sequenced. Using these genomic sequences, researchers have been able to make tremendous progress in the study of genomes. Beyond these successes is the far more challenging and rewarding task of understanding proteomes. In addition to genome sequences, many other databases, such as protein-protein physical interactions, genetic interactions, protein-DNA interactions, and gene expressions, have become available. An important problem is how to combine information from the variety of different databases to understand the biological processes and biological functions of proteins. The principal investigators will develop new statistical and computational methods for estimation and prediction of protein functions and for understanding important biological problems integrating several relevant large databases. They will also train graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the field of computational biology and bioinformatics through their participation in research activities related to the proposed project. The proposed project will generate a suite of computer algorithms related to protein-protein interactions and functional predictions. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for basic biological studies as well as for disease related studies from identifying protein functions.<br/>"
