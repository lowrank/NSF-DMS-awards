In the first part of the project the PI will collaborate with scientists who study the basic biology of cystic fibrosis. This disease arises when someone has a variant of the gene making a certain protein.  The behavior of this protein cannot be observed directly.  The PI will help scientists better understand what the cystic fibrosis protein is doing based on the partial measurements available.  In the second part of the project the PI will study molecules called ion channels, located in nerve cells in the brain that allow brain cells to communicate with each other. Ion channels can open and close.  Although the random opening and closing of ion channels cannot be observed directly, their fluctuations can be observed indirectly through their effects on the electrical activity of individual nerve cells.  The PI will provide ways to understand how irregular the electrical activity of certain nerve cells will be, due to the random opening and closing of ion channels. Finally, the PI will work on certain life stages of animals can be directly observed while others cannot.  Ecologists have carefully studied how populations of certain frogs change over time.  The frogs and their eggs can be counted in the ponds where they live, but immature frogs spend a year living on land near the ponds, where they are difficult to observe. The PI will provide mathematical tools that our ecologist collaborators can use to understand fluctuations in populations that can only be partially observed.<br/><br/>Discrete state, continuous time Markov processes occur throughout cell biology, neuroscience, and ecology, representing the random dynamics of processes transitioning among multiple locations or states. Complexity reduction for such models aims to capture the essential dynamics and stochastic properties via simpler representations, with minimal loss of accuracy. Classical approaches, such as aggregation of nodes and elimination of fast variables, lead to reduced models that are no longer Markovian. Stochastic shielding provides an alternative approach by simplifying the description of the noise driving the process, while preserving the Markov property, by removing from the model those fluctuations that have the least impact on observable features of the process. The PI will build on their prior work developing the stochastic shielding framework in three ways. 1. The PI will establish rigorous mathematical foundations for the stochastic shielding approximation by developing a nonlinear master equation description for the evolution of the probability of the unobserved nodes, conditioned on the observable trajectory of the process. 2. The PI will establish the applicability of stochastic shielding to nonstationary hybrid (conditionally deterministic) processes. Prior rigorous analysis of the stochastic shielding approximation was confined to stationary processes, such as stochastic hybrid conductance-based ion channel models under voltage clamp. Under current clamp conditions, each edge makes a distinct contribution to fluctuations in pathwise properties such as interspike interval variance. 3. The PI will extend stochastic shielding from the constant population case, appropriate for noisy ion channels, to the case where populations can grow or decline, as in ecological models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop will strengthen and enrich science personnel in a geographic region that has fewer workshop and conference opportunities. Unlike other, more densely populated areas in the United States, students and junior researchers from the northern states (Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Utah) have fewer opportunities to attend conferences and other academic events, often due to geographical limitations. The scientific focus of this workshop is the discovery of analogies between phenomena for which new techniques and methods for spatial stochastic modeling, analysis, and simulation have been elaborated, and the emerging ecological problems that are explicitly spatial and inherently random. The exploration of similarities between the dynamical descriptions of biological spatial processes potentially creates new and interesting research opportunities emerging from specific insights and perspectives. <br/><br/>It is apparent that modern developments in movement Ecology heavily rely on new theoretical and innovative computational tools that allow a closer look at complex biological processes at different space and time scales. Although current advanced stochastic perspectives have brought progress in mathematical understandings of molecular, genetic, cellular and physiological mechanisms in biology, many of these techniques have not been yet applied at ecologically or environmentally relevant scales.  At the same time, there is a tremendous growth in spatially referenced ecological and environmental data available, driven by advances in remote sensing technology and the capacity to accurately resolve individual motion.  There is therefore a novel opportunity for new research at the boundary between quantitative movement/landscape ecology and modern stochastic mathematical biology.  The theme of this workshop is to introduce a new generation of mathematical biologists to both new stochastic techniques and also to researchers involved with current questions and data in movement and landscape ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the principal investigators will determine how the shape and structure of tulip poplar leaves enhance cooling on nearly-stagnant hot summer days while also reducing drag in tropical storm or even hurricane force winds. The models and tools developed in this project will also be applied to determine under what conditions the waving motion of seagrass augments waste removal and enhances photosynthesis. The scientific results of this project will inform the selection of plants that can survive extreme environmental conditions, including low levels of CO2, high temperatures, or strong wind and wave forces. The significance of the proposed also work extends beyond gaining insight into mechanical adaptation of plants in the natural world. The physical principals discovered could drive innovations in the engineering design of flexible structures such as sails, flags, and cables. Furthermore, the computational tools developed in this project will find immediate application in other systems where exchange occurs across flexible structures in air and water, including gas exchange in the lungs, odor capture and pheromone release in a variety of animals, nutrient uptake in the gut, and heat loss in appendages.<br/><br/>Flexible plants, fungi, and sessile animals are thought to reconfigure in strong wind and floodwaters to reduce the drag acting upon them. In fast flows, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce flutter and drag when compared to paper cutouts of similar shape and flexibility. In light breezes and currents, leaf flutter can be beneficial to heat dissipation and gas exchange. It is not clear how the shape and mechanical structure of broad leaves results in different passive movements across this range of flows. The specific goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms by which 1) single leaves flutter in low winds and flows and roll up into drag reducing shapes in strong flows, 2) leaf flutter enhances heat dissipation and photosynthesis in light winds and flows, and 3) some leaves, such as the touch-me-not, actively reconfigure by changes in turgor pressure initiated by electrical signaling. A combination of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments with real and artificial leaves will be used to quantify both passive and active movements as well as the concentrations of gases and heat. The fluid-structure interaction problem will be solved using the immersed boundary and inviscid vortex sheet methods. A new immersed boundary-style method for modeling the leaf as a source or sink of gases or heat will be developed. Hyperelastic material models will be developed and implemented in the immersed boundary framework to determine how strain-softening or strain-hardening elasticity affects leaf performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical component of these forecasts is understanding how variation in limiting environmental factors such as food, water, or shelter drive population fluctuations. In the absence of specific data on these factors, ecologists must use the properties of the observed variation in the data to make projections about future risk. In ecology, these forecasts often make simplifying assumptions about the underlying biology that may impact their accuracy. The project will integrate new mathematical ideas and models with empirical field observations to study the properties of populations that experience large fluctuations, allowing the PIs to test fundamental assumptions about how populations are structured. This work will focus on populations that experience regular cycles, a common phenomenon arising through factors such as competition for resources among individuals or predator-prey interactions. This work will improve both the tools used in the management and conservation of wildlife and the understanding of how external factors drive variation in nonlinear dynamical systems. The mathematical ideas and models developed in this project will use techniques similar to those that economists use to project stock market fluctuations or meteorologists use to predict paths of hurricanes; thus, the results may have important implications for many areas of general societal interest. <br/><br/>Emerging work has shown that universal laws describe the fluctuations of biological systems, regardless of the biological scale at which these processes operate. A key prediction of these laws is that the fluctuations of many biological systems will increase monotonically in response to increases in extrinsic variability, often termed ?environmental noise?. However, this scaling has only been studied in linearized models that are valid when fluctuations are small. When populations exhibit larger fluctuations, the assumptions underlying this theory break down. This project will develop the mathematics needed to study the variance scaling properties in nonlinear biological systems subject to increased environmental variation. In particular, the PIs will study the scaling properties of extrinsic noise in nonlinear biological systems focusing on how increases in the magnitude of external perturbations may drive declines in total system variance. The goal is to understand how nonlinearities in ecological systems may lead to robust or sublinear responses to environmental noise. The research scope includes developing mathematical theory to model how environmental variation interacts with highly nonlinear population dynamics, mainly for single species.  The PIs will also develop the statistical approaches to better detect the signal of the predicted variance scaling relationships from empirical population surveys. This work will be the first to determine how increases in external variability can drive increases in the stability of biological systems, an essential step in constructing a more nuanced description of how nonlinear biological systems interact with and respond to noisy environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this interdisciplinary collaboration, the PIs will elucidate the rules underlying cellular compartmentalization in bacteria. While compartmentalization within cells is often facilitated by membranes, bacteria do not typically contain membrane-enclosed organelles. Instead, bacteria must rely on alternate mechanisms such as phase separation for spatial and functional organization and regulation of biochemical activity. This mechanism allows for the formation of distinct phases or domains with different structures, functions, and material properties starting from a homogeneous mixture.  Recently, soft-matter theories of phase separation of liquid mixtures have tremendously advanced understanding of the biological organization. However, the bacterial cytoplasm consists of mixtures of complex, structured fluids. Their phase separation and regulation by non-equilibrium processes such as enzymatic activity are not well understood. The PIs will use data-driven mathematical modeling and state-of-the-art experiments to obtain a quantitative understanding of the formation of phase-separated condensates and their impact on the organization of genetic material and protein diffusion in bacteria. The findings will provide insights into how intracellular phase separation drives and determines cellular properties and functions, and connects genotype to phenotype. The PIs will educate and train a new generation of scientists in mathematical modeling and biology, and promote diversity in the STEM workforce. They will co-organize Biophysics workshops to stimulate interactions among scientists and industrial labs and introduce trainees to the local academic and industrial research community.<br/><br/>Cells use compartmentalization to create spatial organization, allowing them to carry out biochemical processes and control biomolecular structures within distinct microenvironments. This collaborative project will test the hypothesis that bacteria use intracellular phase separation to achieve compartmentalization, allowing for rapid exchange of molecules with the cytoplasm without the need for internal membranes. Upon stress, bacterial chromosomes are reorganized by the Dps protein into a tightly compacted condensate with liquid crystalline properties. To determine the biophysical mechanisms underlying Dps-DNA condensates, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy will map the phase diagram of the condensate system as a function of physiologically relevant environmental conditions. These experiments will complement active particle and continuum models that will predict the phase-separated morphologies and the degree of liquid crystallinity of the condensate. The viscoelastic and mechanical structure-function properties of the condensate will be measured via active microrheology; polarized light microscopy will identify any large ordered domains within the condensate. Mathematical approaches will determine the structural and orientational order, allowing for the construction of a microscopic model of the phase separation and phase ordering of the condensate. To evaluate the hypothesis that small molecules can diffuse rapidly within Dps:DNA condensates to promote enzymatic activities including transcription, the diffusion of molecules within condensed droplets will be directly measured by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Mathematical examination of the particle trajectories will reveal the accessibility of different DNA regions and quantitatively characterize the motility of different types of biomolecules, advancing the understanding of how structure-function properties of biomolecular condensates regulate cellular activities.<br/><br/>This award is being co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) through the Systems and Synthetic Biology and the Genetic Mechanisms Programs, and the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Faulty cell polarization contributes to birth defects or diseases such as cancer. The PI will develop stochastic and deterministic models to better understand how biochemical factors in the cell interact and regulate each other for proper cell function. This project will model the segregation of chemical reactions taking place on cell membranes and in the interior of the cell.  Such segregation is thought to give rise to interesting dynamical phenomena, such as oscillations of the central polarity regulator, Cdc42, and establishment of multiple polarity zones.  The effects of compartmentalization and geometry on the dynamics of polarization is just beginning to be explored and may lead to novel biological insights of how cell polarity is maintained in cells. The PI?s long term educational goal is to encourage female undergraduate and graduate students to pursue careers in STEM fields, specifically in Applied Mathematics.  Broader educational impacts will involve organizing a workshop for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Notre Dame. <br/><br/>The PI will focus on establishment of polarity in fission yeast and budding yeast, two model organisms for understanding how cells integrate polarity and spatial coordination of growth. The current mathematical approach to modeling cell polarity using reaction-diffusion equations does not take into effect the spatial segregation of polarity molecules in the cell.  The goal of this project is to model cell signaling occurring during cell polarization by coupling bulk diffusion to active surface-bound chemical species. The PI will apply this bulk- surface PDEs  framework to specific scientific aims: (1) Extend the deterministic bulk-cytosol 1D model framework to a spatial stochastic one that describes the inherent noise in the underlying biochemical system, and compare model findings for increasing cell size and molecule number using compartment based SSA approach, (2) Extend the 1D framework to higher dimensions, where cortical domains are modeled as a thin patches to allow for lateral diffusion and the cytosol is modeled as an enclosed volume, and consider effects of cell geometry on intracellular signaling. The educational objectives of this proposal are: 1) organize a workshop for undergraduate women encouraging them to pursue careers in Applied Mathematics and other STEM fields, 2) participate in Women Leaders in STEM program at Notre Dame, 3) develop new materials for graduate course on Mathematical Cell Biology, which will be open to interdisciplinary students, 4) lecture in existing national educational programs such as the q-bio Summer School that introduces students from diverse disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer science to modeling in biology. <br/><br/>This award is being co-funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and the BIO Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) through the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to complement physical experiments, computer simulation of these forces is critical to advance the understanding of how biological molecules function. This project will contribute new computational tools for electrostatics of solvated biomolecules. The research will focus on charge transport in ion channel proteins with the goal of assisting in the study of neuron-related autoimmune disease. The software developed will be made available in open source format to the scientific community and will be installed in public software packages. Elements of the project research will be included in a mathematical biology course taught by one of the PIs. The results will be disseminated at scientific conferences and academic seminars, and will be published in scientific journals. The project will contribute to the national scientific workforce by training a postdoctoral scholar, as well as a graduate student and several undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The proposed research develops improved computational tools for electrostatics of solvated biomolecules. The project has two components, (1) improving existing computational tools for the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) and 3D-RISM (Reference Interaction Site Model) implicit solvent models, and (2) developing a boundary element method for the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model. In the first component the PIs will upgrade their previous treecode-accelerated boundary integral (TABI) PB solver with more efficient techniques including node patch discretization, NanoShaper molecular surface triangulation, a new preconditioning strategy, and the GPU-accelerated barycentric Lagrange dual tree traversal (BLDTT) fast multipole method. The improved TABI-PB solver will be applied to accelerate computation of the electrostatic free energy of solvated viruses and the long-range asymptotic correlation functions in 3D-RISM. In the second component, the PIs will develop a novel integral equation based method for the PNP model applied to solvated ion channel proteins embedded in a membrane. The method will combine a boundary/volume element approach for the electrostatic potential with a particle method for the drift-diffusion of dissolved ions. The goal is to apply the new computational PNP tool to study the Acetylcholine receptor (AChR), an ion channel protein that plays a significant role in neuron-related autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis and possibly also the Covid-19 coronavirus.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But the details of this process and its regulation have yet to emerge. For example, in the sea squirt -- a simpler system than the human embryo but one that shares a lot of commonalities -- a pair of cells is the starting point of the heart of this organism. These cells must move from their origin to the future location of the heart guided by cues from inside the embryo. As the paired cells move, they must push other cells out of their path to reach their destination, all while not losing contact with each other. Although observational studies of the coordinated movement of groups of cells involved in organ formation advance knowledge of embryonic development and associated congenital conditions, this project will deepen understanding by employing mathematical modeling and computer simulations to tease out the many facets of this process. The project will involve developing new computer simulation schemes for the mechanical interactions between cell boundary and interior dynamics, new models for the biochemistry needed to initiate collective migration, new methods for efficiently solving equations in deforming, moving geometries, and extensions to full three-dimensional domains. The investigators will use the interdisciplinary nature of the project to recruit and train undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The study of collective locomotion of organisms has led to important mathematical models that have guided biological discovery. A distinguishing feature of this project is that the multi-body interaction is achieved through mechanochemical bonds that interact with the cell's biochemistry and biomechanics in an unknown way. We focus on the collective migration of two cells in the early stages of heart development of the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis, an important model organism. Initially, these two cells are indistinguishable, yet at some point they establish leader and follower roles and move with distinct morphologies, squeezing through deformable tissues. Experiments show there is an advantage to move as a cohesive pair rather than a single cell, however, it is unclear why two cells do not slow each other down. These observations lead to the following questions: How are intracellular mechanics integrated to give rise to motility as a cohesive group? Why can two cells move faster together than alone? Is the two-cell system better at polarization and initiating migration than an individual cell? Mathematical modeling can aid experiments in answering these questions, but numerical solutions of the model equations will require development of novel computational methods that will be able to simulate coupled mechanical, transport, and chemical reaction equations in complex evolving geometries. Collaboration with an experimental lab will result in the discovery of a set of minimal yet sufficient interactions underlying the mechanical and biochemical organization of a cohesive cell group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, it is desired to identify mathematically principled solutions that strike an optimal balance between productivity and risk to infection through developing a ?science and engineering for social distancing?. Thus motivated, the PIs will develop (1) novel mathematical theory to better and more rigorously understand epidemic spreading on social-contact networks that undergo weekly and/or daily cycles; and (2) optimization theory to design realistic social-contact networks (e.g., using curfews for community and course scheduling for academic institutions) that both mitigate pandemics and allow an acceptable level of social/economic activity. These techniques will be applied to social-network datasets related to COVID-19 to validate theory and obtain practical knowledge. These mathematical and computational tools and related datasets will support policy makers for educational institutions, large companies, and governing bodies as they manage the economic and health impacts of COVID-19 as well as future pandemics. <br/><br/>The first goal of the project is to extend Floquet theory of ordinary differential equations to (a) characterize epidemic spreading on social-contact networks that are stochastic, time-varying, and periodic; (b) identify and analyze novel behaviors for disease dynamics that arise because the social-network?s periodicity and the disease progression change at similar time scales; and (c) study the effects of network structures that contribute to disease localization (e.g., in hub nodes and communities in the network). These questions remain underexplored for dynamically changing networks.

While the pandemic is unfolding, guidance regarding testing and quarantining strategies in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations is needed in order to control its effects. This project uses a multi-disciplinary approach, merging virological and immunological data with mathematical and computational models to uncover causes for variability in individual infections, their contributions to transmission in the population, markers of severe infections, and best testing and quarantining strategies in the presence and absence of vaccination. These approaches will provide testable hypotheses for targeting specific proteins and types of treatments for severe infections with SARS-CoV-2.<br/> <br/>Suggesting SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies is complicated by limited knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 dynamics inside an individual, the immune responses it elicits, and the uncertainty of whether infections result in no, partial, or life-long sterilizing immunity.

These networks are composed of genes, messenger RNA, proteins, metabolites, and other internal and external chemicals. Any alteration of these networks can lead to pathologies in development, cell proliferation, and other functions.  The study of how networks change in time (dynamics) is the focus of a sustained research effort by the mathematical biology community.  Yet, many fundamental questions remain open.  The central goal of this research is to advance our understanding and develop a theoretical and computational framework for the structural analysis of global dynamical properties of intracellular networks.  The project will involve the participation of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students from the mathematical, engineering, and physical sciences. The results of this mathematical work will have scientific relevance much beyond the molecular realm, because the same formalism can be used to model phenomena at different levels of biological and ecological organization, from cells to tissues to organisms to ecological systems and epidemics.  <br/><br/>This project aims to develop novel analytical and computational approaches to characterize the behavior of highly nonlinear biological systems.  Motivated by a wide variety of applications, it will study core elements of the larger networks that control fundamental cellular processes such as transcription and translation, cell growth and division, migration, and differentiation.  These include processes such as gene regulation, protein post-translational modifications by phosphorylation or methylation, kinetic proofreading in T cell receptor activation, ribosome translation elongation processes, and other regulatory and signaling pathways.  Questions such as set invariance (when do the dynamics preserve a ""safe"" set, not violating physiological constraints?), stability (when does the system return to homoeostasis values after, or even during persistent, perturbations?), and robustness of qualitative behavior under parameter changes can be framed and analyzed through a common mathematical language.   Specifically, the work will provide computationally explicit ""certificates"" that guarantee invariance, stability, or robustness, expressed in the formalism of Biological Interaction Networks (BINs), that allow for the verification of system properties just from the stoichiometric structure, even in the face of substantial uncertainty regarding parameters and even the exact form of the reaction kinetics.  This project will expand the class of networks that can be analyzed with the technique, proving new theorems, finding more efficient constructions of certificates, introducing additional tools, and analyzing the effect of inputs, such as ligands in receptor systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A critical component of these forecasts is understanding how variation in limiting environmental factors such as food, water, or shelter drive population fluctuations. In the absence of specific data on these factors, ecologists must use the properties of the observed variation in the data to make projections about future risk. In ecology, these forecasts often make simplifying assumptions about the underlying biology that may impact their accuracy. The project will integrate new mathematical ideas and models with empirical field observations to study the properties of populations that experience large fluctuations, allowing the PIs to test fundamental assumptions about how populations are structured. This work will focus on populations that experience regular cycles, a common phenomenon arising through factors such as competition for resources among individuals or predator-prey interactions. This work will improve both the tools used in the management and conservation of wildlife and the understanding of how external factors drive variation in nonlinear dynamical systems. The mathematical ideas and models developed in this project will use techniques similar to those that economists use to project stock market fluctuations or meteorologists use to predict paths of hurricanes; thus, the results may have important implications for many areas of general societal interest. <br/><br/>Emerging work has shown that universal laws describe the fluctuations of biological systems, regardless of the biological scale at which these processes operate. A key prediction of these laws is that the fluctuations of many biological systems will increase monotonically in response to increases in extrinsic variability, often termed ?environmental noise?. However, this scaling has only been studied in linearized models that are valid when fluctuations are small. When populations exhibit larger fluctuations, the assumptions underlying this theory break down. This project will develop the mathematics needed to study the variance scaling properties in nonlinear biological systems subject to increased environmental variation. In particular, the PIs will study the scaling properties of extrinsic noise in nonlinear biological systems focusing on how increases in the magnitude of external perturbations may drive declines in total system variance. The goal is to understand how nonlinearities in ecological systems may lead to robust or sublinear responses to environmental noise. The research scope includes developing mathematical theory to model how environmental variation interacts with highly nonlinear population dynamics, mainly for single species.  The PIs will also develop the statistical approaches to better detect the signal of the predicted variance scaling relationships from empirical population surveys. This work will be the first to determine how increases in external variability can drive increases in the stability of biological systems, an essential step in constructing a more nuanced description of how nonlinear biological systems interact with and respond to noisy environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this day, how the complex interactions found in biological systems produce their emergent properties and behaviors remains elusive (and is considered one of the grand challenges of biology). Theoretical mathematics offers a possible route forward, and one that could, in time, have a profound influence on biology. This research project aims to cut through the complexity of biological models and elucidate the mechanisms that determine cellular behavior. Further, this project develops a mathematical framework for the algorithmic construction of chemically implemented neural networks, which are a popular means of performing machine learning and ""artificial intelligence."" Finally, this project aims to develop new computational methods that can address currently infeasible problems related to the long-term behavior of biological processes. The project will not only greatly enhance our understanding of biological systems but will also serve as a fertile training ground for the next generation of scientists at the intersection of mathematics and biology. A key focus is on building research teams that involve faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates, with a special emphasis towards the recruitment of women and underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>Discrete-space, continuous-time Markov chain models are commonly used to model biological interaction networks, including gene regulatory networks, viral infections, signaling systems, neuronal networks, etc. These models can be depicted via a reaction graph, which is a graphical representation of the interactions between the constituent molecules of the model. Interaction networks can be extraordinarily complex; for example, there are over 20,000 genes in the human genome and the proteins they encode may be modified in myriad ways. Further, cellular systems often have different sub-systems that operate on multiple different scales (both temporally and in terms of copy numbers), with the species operating at one scale greatly influencing those at a different scale. Hidden within this complexity there are often underlying structures that, if properly quantified, give great insight into the dynamical or stationary behavior of the system. The first part of this project aims to develop mathematical theory that relates the emergent properties of these systems with easily checked properties of the associated reaction graphs, and their sub-graphs. A second part focuses on the development of biochemical reaction networks that implement neural networks and machine learning algorithms. Here the goal is not solely rooted in the algorithmic construction of such networks, but also in developing a proper mathematical framework for this research area. A final part focuses on algorithm development (and analysis) for the unbiased estimation of stationary distributions for the stochastic models commonly utilized for biological interaction networks. The primary tools and methods utilized by the investigator and his students are from probability theory, stochastic analysis, dynamical systems theory, chemical reaction network theory, and computational mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MB takes a seemingly opposite approach to ML by carefully matching experimental data and reconstructing the physiology of biological systems. So far, the tools of ML and MB have been mainly distinct. In this project, the Principal Investigator (PI) will seek synergies between these two different methodologies and build mathematical tools that bridge these two approaches.

One of the primary goals is to build ML tools based on biophysically accurate models of neurons. These models will use the formalism developed by Hodgkin and Huxley. The key problem to be addressed here is how learning can occur with highly nonlinear models and time dependence through improvements on the backpropagation technique. Additionally, the PI will develop approaches that use predictions from currently developed models to enhance classification in ML.

The phenomenon is the focus of much modern biological and biomedical research, and is found at all scales, from the molecular and cellular, to tissues, organisms, populations, and ecosystems. For example, at the cellular level, persistence in gene and protein networks plays a key role in the establishment of homeostasis, which is the ability of the cell to regulate key variables, so that internal conditions remain relatively constant. Persistence at the population-dynamics level plays a role, for example, in the spread of infectious disease. This project aims to develop new mathematical methods and computational algorithms for analyzing persistence. This will allow biologists and biomedical scientists to better investigate persistence properties of diverse biological networks of interest. A more complete characterization of persistent systems will improve our understanding of the conditions that allow an infectious disease to become endemic and of the changes that may drive it to extinction. The project involves training of undergraduate and graduate students through involvement in the research.<br/><br/>Persistence is one of the most important features of biological interaction networks. Understanding the role played by specific biological interactions (for example the role of a signaling pathway in a cell, or the effect of introducing a foreign species in an ecosystem) can be challenging due to positive and negative feedbacks, nonlinear interactions, and other complex signaling between the nodes of the network. These challenges are due to the inherent complexity of the dynamics of nonlinear systems. This project will analyze persistence as a fundamental theoretical concept that traverses levels of biological complexity and will develop mathematical and computational tools to understand persistence in general biological interaction networks. The project will especially focus on population dynamics models, with the aim to provide mathematical and computational tools for drawing precise connections between the structure of the network of interactions between populations and the persistence properties of its associated dynamical system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The evolutionary mechanisms for bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics are multifactorial and differ widely with the bacterial species, antibiotic classes and generations, route of administration, and the specific antibiotic-bacteria combination. This project will combine experimental data and mathematical models to quantify and simulate treatment dynamics for specific antibiotic-bacteria pairs. The primary objective is to seek optimal antibiotic use protocols on the patient level and validate theoretical conclusions with experiments.

In vitro experimental data will be generated and linked with the models to estimate the bacterial growth and evolutionary parameters under different antibiotic concentrations. Second, considering the immune response and the periodical drug concentrations, within-host bacterial dynamic models will be developed with periodic coefficients. The investigators will study the nonlinear dynamics of these models and evaluate the effects of four major antibiotic protocols: (i) mono-drug therapy, (ii) combination therapy, (iii) sequential cycling therapy, and (iv) de-escalation therapy. Third, the investigators will develop novel bacterial population models formulated in terms of semilinear partial differential equations and structured with respect to two physiological features: bacterial age and plasmid copies.

Analysis of cell-free DNA from blood samples is a promising avenue for early non-invasive detection of cancer, as cell-free DNA from patients with cancer often contains DNA fragments carrying tumor-specific mutations. The goal of this research is to inform optimal strategies for early detection of colorectal cancer using analysis of cell-free DNA from patient blood samples. This will be achieved through developing novel mathematical and computational models of cell-free DNA shedding during colorectal tumor evolution, and using them for evaluating diverse strategies for early detection. A common mathematical theme underlying this work will be the study of stochastic evolution on graphs.

The fundamental problem addressed in this project is to understand the connections between structure, dynamics, and function of the cytoskeleton. It is not yet known if microscopic filaments can self-organize into the macroscopic chiral structures responsible for left-right asymmetry seen in some tissues, or why networks of actin gels are typically contractile (with or without molecular motors like myosin). The stochastic nature of sub-cellular processes coupled with the ever-changing topology of cytoskeletal networks make these questions difficult or impossible to interrogate through lab measurements or existing simulation techniques.  This project will develop computational tools required to close this knowledge gap; tools which carefully capture the microscopic features of cellular fiber networks, at the extraordinary computational scale required to probe their macroscopic structure. The goal is to derive a macroscopic hydrodynamics-like theory from the numerical simulations of the cytoskeletal gels that will allow PI to simulate whole-cell mechanochemical phenomena, like cytokinesis. Education and outreach activities related to this project will include learning modules focused on cell mechanics simulation and biological fluids, implemented in both summer research experience programs for undergraduates and after school programs at New York area middle schools.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to answer five fundamental questions in cellular biology: (1) What are the (hydro)mechanical properties of cross-linked actin networks? (2) Why are actin-myosin gels usually contractile? (3) Can microscopic twists of actin filaments self-organize into macroscopic chiral structures? (4) How much do thermal forces contribute to the viscoelastic gel moduli? (5) Can thermal forces transduce random microscopic twists and bends of actin filaments into macroscopic gel contraction without myosin? To interrogate these questions, the team will develop novel numerical methods which utilize creative representations of fibers to directly enforce their inextensiblity and describe the local twist along their length. The methods will reconcile the hydrodynamics of both passive and active filaments with fluctuations from the surrounding cytosol, in addition to carefully accounting for intra-network dynamics from the motion of molecular motors and dynamically binding/unbinding cross-linkers. The team will employ efficient, iterative linear algebra to compute fiber dynamics in linear time in the number of fibers, enabling unprecedented simulations of the cellular cytoskelton. The team will develop spectrally-accurate Chebyschev discretizations of semi-flexible fibers that dramatically reduce the total degrees of freedom needed to describe a single filament, and implement them in efficient, parallel, public-domain codes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, over 30% of our proteins have regions that are not rigid, but rather are floppy tethers that connect the chemically-active regions. Two examples of tethers are: immunoreceptors, the proteins involved in how immune cells receive signals from other cells; and formins, proteins that maintain the cell's architectural skeleton and are hijacked by invading bacteria including cholera. Tethers are easy to overlook. In part, this is because the mathematical descriptions that allow understanding of rigid proteins do not work for tethers. Therefore, mathematically characterizing tethers may lead to novel avenues of research in biology and medicine that were missed by focusing only of the rigid regions of proteins. This project will develop a mathematical description of tethers. The mathematics will be used to, first, develop a rapid computational algorithm to simulate the first few steps of how immune cells respond to external signals, including how they respond to off-switch signals through the protein PD-1, signals that is exploited by cancers to evade immune detection. Second, the mathematics will be used to study the tethers in formins. The resulting mathematics will create new connections between two separate fields of mathematics: stochastic process theory, and polymer physics. The project will also result in the training of graduate students with skills in immunology, cell biology, applied mathematics, computational science, and biophysics. Open-access resources for enabling computational science researchers will also be developed. These will have a special focus on creating tools for research in the remote era, including tutorials for high school and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>Many proteins (around 30% in humans) have regions that lack well-defined structure, but rather fluctuate through an ensemble of configurations characterized by high intrinsic disorder. Many of these act as tethers that connect chemical reaction sites. Examples include immunoreceptors like the T Cell Receptor, PD1 and CD28, and formins, which regulate cytoskeleton assembly. Tethered reactions are ubiquitous; they have properties that are fundamentally distinct from standard solution reactions, requiring novel mathematical characterization; they are exploited by biology; and, in some cases, they provide novel avenues for therapeutics. This project exploits and extends a long-known mathematical correspondence between stochastic process theory and polymer physics to study tethered reactions. The mathematical theory aims to resolve biological mysteries, first, concerning the formin tethers and their ability to assemble the cytoskeleton even when bound at both termini, in a force-responsive manner. Second, the project addresses experimental data on immunoreceptor tethered signaling that cannot be explained by models that omit volume exclusion (crowding).

However, many biological processes have shaped the genomes in complicated ways, so extracting relationships from genomic data is far from straightforward. Hybridization and other forms of gene transfer between lineages pose a particular challenge, as a simple depiction of organism relationships by an evolutionary tree becomes inadequate, with a web-like network more accurately describing their history. Current computational methods for analyzing genomes in this setting are inefficient, are only able to process small datasets, and leave unexamined the wealth of potential information even in already collected data. In this project, new computational and statistical methods to infer network-like relationships will be developed and implemented in practical and efficient software tools. Based on detailed mathematical models of evolving genomes, and implemented for easy use by scientists, these new methodologies will yield sound statistical conclusions. They will be applicable to a broad range of biological studies, such as for understanding the network of life, agriculturally important crops, conservation biology, and biomedically relevant pathogens. Further project work includes interdisciplinary training of graduate students in mathematics and biology and outreach to high school students through a summer research academy.<br/><br/>While network relationships between organisms lead to the evolutionary history of individual genetic loci being represented by different trees, this signal of reticulation is confounded with that of incomplete lineage sorting, a population genetic process that produces differing gene trees even when the species-level relationships are tree-like. These processes will be investigated jointly, through use of the mathematical network multispecies coalescent model. Since its use with standard likelihood and Bayesian statistical approaches to data analysis pose excessive computational demands, this project will develop faster, more feasible approaches. One difficulty arises from the size of the space of potential networks, which is vastly larger than the already large space of trees. By utilizing new distance-based approaches, however, this project develops methods circumventing slow explorations of network space, while still obtaining statistically-consistent network estimates. In particular, quartet and rooted-triple based network distances will be used to leverage the inference of small network units to yield large network estimates through appropriate interpretation of a splits graph.  Subprojects include development of coalescent-based network inference from concatenated genomic sequences, thereby avoiding inference of individual gene trees; extension of theory and practice beyond the class of level-1 networks; and better addressing covariances between quartet or rooted-triple statistics arising from the model.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology program and Life Science Venture funds in DMS, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PIs anticipate the research agenda developed in the workshop will facilitate the research communities to discover new mathematical methods and modeling approaches to jointly forecast epidemiological, economic and social patterns so that future pandemics are mitigated with lower social and economic cost.<br/><br/>The conventional approach to the modelling of infectious diseases is to collect basic life-cycle data on the disease, and to overlay that onto structured population data to predict prevalence patterns, health outcomes, using differential equations, networks, agent-based simulations, or another related modelling approaches. These approaches are quite successful at day-ahead prediction, but aside from largely ad hoc parametric adjustments, these standard approaches have almost no ability to connect to behavioral based interventions. These means that the models are not helpful for measuring the benefits and costs (broadly defined) of non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are critical when novel pathogens emerge.  There is expert knowledge and modeling work, related to epidemics, in economics and social sciences that can be used to better describe transmission, while providing internally consistent connections to society and the economy. But the disciplinary divides are difficult to bridge. There are limits in data collection, including scale, precision, and representativeness. This difficulty has been amplified by the fast growth of the scholarly literature over the last few years. Bringing together a diverse group of scholars, scientists, and modelers will help everybody interested in the field better understand what has been accomplished so far and produce a research agenda for improving mathematical models in human epidemiology in the future.

The disease, which is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium parasites, is spread between humans via the bite of infected adult female mosquitoes and creates severe public health and socio-economic burdens in regions inhabited by almost half of the world?s population. Each year, malaria infects an average of over 230 million people and causes over 400,000 deaths (mostly in children under the age of five) in endemic areas globally. The widescale use of insecticides-based interventions, notably in the form of long-lasting insecticidal (LLINs) nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS), during the period 2000-2015, has resulted in a dramatic decrease in malaria burden in endemic areas, prompting a concerted global effort to eradicate the disease by 2040.  Unfortunately since 2015, the malaria mosquito has developed widespread resistance to all five chemicals used in LLINs and IRS.  Insecticide resistance and changes in climatic variables are two of the main impediments to malaria eradication. Since LLINs and IRS are the cornerstone interventions for malaria control, one of the most crucial challenges in the malaria ecology community is to determine whether insecticide resistance affects malaria epidemiology. This project will use mathematical modeling approaches, backed by novel empirical data collected in the laboratory as well as in the field, to provide realistic insight into the impact, control and mitigation of the impediments. The project will provide strategies for realistically achieving malaria eradication using existing insecticides-based control resources.  The methodologies and results generated will be made available for broad application, and for studying the transmission dynamics and control of other vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, Lyme disease, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the participation of local high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>The project will develop a genetic-epidemiology modeling framework for providing realistic insight into the malaria transmission dynamics and control, subject to insecticide pressure. The modeling framework extends the classical Ross-Macdonald compartmental modeling framework for malaria by adding, inter alia, the detailed lifecycle and population genetics of malaria mosquitoes (i.e., genetics of insecticide resistance) and the complex host-vector-parasite interactions. The models will allow for the assessment of the impacts of local changes in climatic variables (notably temperature) on the population abundance of the malaria mosquitoes by genotype. The approach of modeling the host-vector-parasite dynamics, in the context of malaria, will offer significant advances in applied mathematics and numerical analysis, particularly in designing and applying dynamical systems and numerical discretization theories and techniques for studying the transmission dynamics and control of diseases caused by vectors (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Specifically, PIs will (i) design a modeling framework for assessing the role of insecticide resistance on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance at different environmental conditions, (ii) evaluate the role of insecticide resistance on the ability of resistant mosquitoes to transmit malaria and (iii) assess the role of natural environmental factors on the abundance of insecticide resistance genotypes and how it relates to malaria incidence. This project will generate hard-to-get data on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance and impact of resistance on malaria parasite development in mosquitoes, which are so invaluable to the design and parametrization of realistic mathematical models for studying the role of insecticide resistance on the dynamics of malaria mosquitoes and disease. This will provide a realistic framework for the design and testing of resistance management strategies for malaria-endemic areas that only have a small chemical arsenal left to fight the disease. Ultimately, this project will generate conditions, in parameter space, for the effective control or elimination of malaria using existing insecticides-based resources, thereby contributing to the global malaria eradication efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global climate change models predict increasing temporal variability in temperature, precipitation and storms in the next century. Random environmental fluctuations have been shown to drive populations extinct, promote persistence, change genetic diversity, and modify the spread of infectious diseases. It is therefore urgent to develop tools for understanding the effects of random temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions on species. The PIs will develop mathematical theory, in conjunction with analytical and numerical approximation methods, to help theoretical ecologists pinpoint how environmental fluctuations affect the long-term dynamics of ecological communities. In collaboration with the Gore lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology the PIs will test theoretical results by comparison with microbial ecology experiments. The investigators plan to involve high school and undergraduate students in projects allowing them to develop programming skills and diversify their mathematical and ecological knowledge. For outreach, the investigators will organize seminars and conferences and promote the participation of women and members of traditionally underrepresented minorities within the sciences.<br/><br/><br/>The PIs will investigate continuous and discrete time models of interacting populations that experience random temporal environmental variations. In the continuous time setting the research will focus on Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes - processes that switch between different systems of ordinary differential equations at random times. In the discrete time setting stochastic difference equations will be analyzed. New methods for checking when species persist and converge to their invariant probability measures (which describe the 'random equilibria' of subcommunities of species) will be developed, and conditions under which species go extinct exponentially fast determined.  Since all theoretical models are merely approximations of natural systems, the PIs will study how the persistence/extinction results change under small, density-dependent, perturbations of the model parameters. The extinction/persistence criteria will involve Lyapunov exponents, which usually cannot be computed explicitly. In order to resolve this issue analytical and numerical approximation methods for estimating the Lyapunov exponents will be developed. Finally, together with the Gore lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the PIs will run experiments in order to see how analytical results qualitatively compare with multi-species microbial systems under environmental fluctuations.

For example, common sources of non-genetic heterogeneity such as epigenetic phenomena and environmental noise have been shown to induce transient or reversible drug-resistant states in tumor cells.  Since these phenotypic switches often operate at significantly faster time scales than genetic evolution, they can exert large influences on the course of tumor evolution and response to therapy.  These observations have generated tremendous interest in the clinical potential of novel drugs, such as epigenetic therapies, that target the cellular machinery controlling these phenotypic switches; however, the success of these therapies has been limited so far. One obstacle to these efforts has been an inadequate mechanistic understanding of how stochastic phenotypic transitions at the level of individual cells arise and influence tumor population-level responses to therapy.  This project aims to elucidate these questions through the development of mathematical theories that link the mechanisms of phenotypic transitions at the subcellular level to population-level tumor evolutionary dynamics, within the context of a changing tumor microenvironment. This framework will be applied to understand the development of therapeutic resistance in leukemias and colorectal cancers, and to explore novel treatment strategies for preventing treatment failure.  Since analogous phenomena occur in the context of bacterial populations treated with antibiotics, such models can also be leveraged to provide insights into antimicrobial therapy resistance.<br/><br/>In the first part of the project, the PI will develop and analyze a continuous-time Markov process model of drug resistance driven by reversible phenotypic transitions in response to stromal cell-secreted factors in the tumor microenvironment. In the second part of the project, the PI will develop a novel multiscale modeling framework using branching random walks to link stochastic subcellular epigenetic dynamics to population-level evolutionary dynamics, and use this model to explore the impact of epigenetic processes on the evolution of drug resistance in cancer. These models will be analyzed to elucidate how the underlying processes driving non-genetic heterogeneity in a population influence overall evolutionary shifts towards drug resistance and tumor recurrence.  This  work will involve the analysis of state-dependent branching random walks on nonstandard geometries as well as branching process approximations of continuous time Markov processes. In particular, analyses of the limiting behaviors of these models, stochastic hitting times (e.g. recurrence time, gene silencing/activation times), and extinction probabilities will be conducted. The PI will work closely with experimental collaborators to apply these models and results to understand specific cancer systems in which drug resistance is driven by non-genetic mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The response of an ecological system to environmental changes can shape the future of the goods and services associated with the ecosystem. Important examples include desertification and changes from high to low productivity regimes in fisheries, among others. Modeling the ecosystem state and predicting future shifts to other states requires the identification of measurable quantities that represent the state of the ecosystem. However, when the ecosystem shows spatial structure (for example, vegetation aggregates separated by bare soil, typical of semi-arid ecosystems), standard choices to represent the ecosystem state lead to erroneous predictions, unable to capture features shown by these systems across space and time. This project will combine concepts and techniques from mathematics and statistical physics to provide a novel theoretical framework able to describe reliably state shifts occurring in structured ecological systems. Such a framework will enable theoretical tools to diagnose ecosystem health and resilience as environmental conditions change and, therefore, facilitate preparedness, such as conservation strategies, against ecologically and economically costly shifts. Because aggregation occurs frequently in nature, the results of this project will be applicable to a wide variety of systems of socio-ecological importance (for instance, vegetation in ecosystems close to desertification). The project includes training through research involvement for junior researchers, to help develop the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>Transitions between different states of a focal ecosystem often can be described with a single order parameter (observable representing the state of the system) and a single control parameter (factor whose change triggers the transition). For a given value of the latter, the order parameter enables the calculation of the stability landscape, a manifold that reveals key information such as potential ecological states, their basins of attraction, and the possibility of alternative stable states. When an ecosystem shows spatial regularity, however, standard approaches yield misleading results: a system-averaged order parameter neglects the underlying spatial patterns, and using the spatially-explicit population density as order parameter produces a stability landscape that erroneously detects the empty space between population aggregates as signs of extinction (and possibility of alternative stable states) even for healthy ecosystems. This project aims to offer the first framework able to represent reliably, for any dynamical system that shows spatial regularity and undergoes a phase transition, the key interactions between population dynamics, formation of non-trivial spatial aggregates, and changes in resilience occurring around the transition. The investigator will use existing theoretical models to identify an associated transition and the main features affected by it and aims to combine them in a single order parameter able to describe holistically the transition. The project involves innovative combination and development of concepts and tools associated with statistical physics and bifurcation theory (e.g. stability and perturbative analyses, numerical renormalization, Fourier transforms), typically used independently in the study of phase transitions or pattern detection. The results of this project will improve predictions and early warning signal tools for transitions in systems that show regularity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reasons for neurological disorders among COVID-19 patients in the U.S. and other countries are not clear, but the data indicate that some of COVID-19 patients have issues with their awareness, consciousness, and cognizance.

In this interdisciplinary collaboration, the PIs will elucidate the rules underlying cellular compartmentalization in bacteria. While compartmentalization within cells is often facilitated by membranes, bacteria do not typically contain membrane-enclosed organelles. Instead, bacteria must rely on alternate mechanisms such as phase separation for spatial and functional organization and regulation of biochemical activity. This mechanism allows for the formation of distinct phases or domains with different structures, functions, and material properties starting from a homogeneous mixture.  Recently, soft-matter theories of phase separation of liquid mixtures have tremendously advanced understanding of the biological organization. However, the bacterial cytoplasm consists of mixtures of complex, structured fluids. Their phase separation and regulation by non-equilibrium processes such as enzymatic activity are not well understood. The PIs will use data-driven mathematical modeling and state-of-the-art experiments to obtain a quantitative understanding of the formation of phase-separated condensates and their impact on the organization of genetic material and protein diffusion in bacteria. The findings will provide insights into how intracellular phase separation drives and determines cellular properties and functions, and connects genotype to phenotype. The PIs will educate and train a new generation of scientists in mathematical modeling and biology, and promote diversity in the STEM workforce. They will co-organize Biophysics workshops to stimulate interactions among scientists and industrial labs and introduce trainees to the local academic and industrial research community.<br/><br/>Cells use compartmentalization to create spatial organization, allowing them to carry out biochemical processes and control biomolecular structures within distinct microenvironments. This collaborative project will test the hypothesis that bacteria use intracellular phase separation to achieve compartmentalization, allowing for rapid exchange of molecules with the cytoplasm without the need for internal membranes. Upon stress, bacterial chromosomes are reorganized by the Dps protein into a tightly compacted condensate with liquid crystalline properties. To determine the biophysical mechanisms underlying Dps-DNA condensates, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy will map the phase diagram of the condensate system as a function of physiologically relevant environmental conditions. These experiments will complement active particle and continuum models that will predict the phase-separated morphologies and the degree of liquid crystallinity of the condensate. The viscoelastic and mechanical structure-function properties of the condensate will be measured via active microrheology; polarized light microscopy will identify any large ordered domains within the condensate. Mathematical approaches will determine the structural and orientational order, allowing for the construction of a microscopic model of the phase separation and phase ordering of the condensate. To evaluate the hypothesis that small molecules can diffuse rapidly within Dps:DNA condensates to promote enzymatic activities including transcription, the diffusion of molecules within condensed droplets will be directly measured by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Mathematical examination of the particle trajectories will reveal the accessibility of different DNA regions and quantitatively characterize the motility of different types of biomolecules, advancing the understanding of how structure-function properties of biomolecular condensates regulate cellular activities.<br/><br/>This award is being co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) through the Systems and Synthetic Biology and the Genetic Mechanisms Programs, and the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The disease, which is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium parasites, is spread between humans via the bite of infected adult female mosquitoes and creates severe public health and socio-economic burdens in regions inhabited by almost half of the world?s population. Each year, malaria infects an average of over 230 million people and causes over 400,000 deaths (mostly in children under the age of five) in endemic areas globally. The widescale use of insecticides-based interventions, notably in the form of long-lasting insecticidal (LLINs) nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS), during the period 2000-2015, has resulted in a dramatic decrease in malaria burden in endemic areas, prompting a concerted global effort to eradicate the disease by 2040.  Unfortunately since 2015, the malaria mosquito has developed widespread resistance to all five chemicals used in LLINs and IRS.  Insecticide resistance and changes in climatic variables are two of the main impediments to malaria eradication. Since LLINs and IRS are the cornerstone interventions for malaria control, one of the most crucial challenges in the malaria ecology community is to determine whether insecticide resistance affects malaria epidemiology. This project will use mathematical modeling approaches, backed by novel empirical data collected in the laboratory as well as in the field, to provide realistic insight into the impact, control and mitigation of the impediments. The project will provide strategies for realistically achieving malaria eradication using existing insecticides-based control resources.  The methodologies and results generated will be made available for broad application, and for studying the transmission dynamics and control of other vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, Lyme disease, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the participation of local high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>The project will develop a genetic-epidemiology modeling framework for providing realistic insight into the malaria transmission dynamics and control, subject to insecticide pressure. The modeling framework extends the classical Ross-Macdonald compartmental modeling framework for malaria by adding, inter alia, the detailed lifecycle and population genetics of malaria mosquitoes (i.e., genetics of insecticide resistance) and the complex host-vector-parasite interactions. The models will allow for the assessment of the impacts of local changes in climatic variables (notably temperature) on the population abundance of the malaria mosquitoes by genotype. The approach of modeling the host-vector-parasite dynamics, in the context of malaria, will offer significant advances in applied mathematics and numerical analysis, particularly in designing and applying dynamical systems and numerical discretization theories and techniques for studying the transmission dynamics and control of diseases caused by vectors (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Specifically, PIs will (i) design a modeling framework for assessing the role of insecticide resistance on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance at different environmental conditions, (ii) evaluate the role of insecticide resistance on the ability of resistant mosquitoes to transmit malaria and (iii) assess the role of natural environmental factors on the abundance of insecticide resistance genotypes and how it relates to malaria incidence. This project will generate hard-to-get data on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance and impact of resistance on malaria parasite development in mosquitoes, which are so invaluable to the design and parametrization of realistic mathematical models for studying the role of insecticide resistance on the dynamics of malaria mosquitoes and disease. This will provide a realistic framework for the design and testing of resistance management strategies for malaria-endemic areas that only have a small chemical arsenal left to fight the disease. Ultimately, this project will generate conditions, in parameter space, for the effective control or elimination of malaria using existing insecticides-based resources, thereby contributing to the global malaria eradication efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But the details of this process and its regulation have yet to emerge. For example, in the sea squirt -- a simpler system than the human embryo but one that shares a lot of commonalities -- a pair of cells is the starting point of the heart of this organism. These cells must move from their origin to the future location of the heart guided by cues from inside the embryo. As the paired cells move, they must push other cells out of their path to reach their destination, all while not losing contact with each other. Although observational studies of the coordinated movement of groups of cells involved in organ formation advance knowledge of embryonic development and associated congenital conditions, this project will deepen understanding by employing mathematical modeling and computer simulations to tease out the many facets of this process. The project will involve developing new computer simulation schemes for the mechanical interactions between cell boundary and interior dynamics, new models for the biochemistry needed to initiate collective migration, new methods for efficiently solving equations in deforming, moving geometries, and extensions to full three-dimensional domains. The investigators will use the interdisciplinary nature of the project to recruit and train undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The study of collective locomotion of organisms has led to important mathematical models that have guided biological discovery. A distinguishing feature of this project is that the multi-body interaction is achieved through mechanochemical bonds that interact with the cell's biochemistry and biomechanics in an unknown way. We focus on the collective migration of two cells in the early stages of heart development of the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis, an important model organism. Initially, these two cells are indistinguishable, yet at some point they establish leader and follower roles and move with distinct morphologies, squeezing through deformable tissues. Experiments show there is an advantage to move as a cohesive pair rather than a single cell, however, it is unclear why two cells do not slow each other down. These observations lead to the following questions: How are intracellular mechanics integrated to give rise to motility as a cohesive group? Why can two cells move faster together than alone? Is the two-cell system better at polarization and initiating migration than an individual cell? Mathematical modeling can aid experiments in answering these questions, but numerical solutions of the model equations will require development of novel computational methods that will be able to simulate coupled mechanical, transport, and chemical reaction equations in complex evolving geometries. Collaboration with an experimental lab will result in the discovery of a set of minimal yet sufficient interactions underlying the mechanical and biochemical organization of a cohesive cell group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It directly addresses deep societal concerns, such as the maintenance of endangered ecologies, the effective prevention of the loss of biodiversity, and stemming the rise of antimicrobial resistance. To this end, one must address the coupled eco-evolutionary dynamics of fluctuating populations, namely the interdependence and combined effects of (i) random internal variability in population numbers, composition, and each species? traits and (ii) sudden, gradual, or repetitive external changes in environmental conditions on the evolution of an ecological system. This transdisciplinary research is situated at the interface of biology, mathematics, physics, statistics, and computer science and will combine a set of advanced theoretical and mathematical tools from these fields that so far have rarely been utilized together. It will be pursued in an international collaboration, funded jointly through National Science Foundation ? Division of Mathematical Sciences and the U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and provide advanced training for a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Leeds and a graduate student at Virginia Tech. Conceptual and technical advances in the basic understanding of complex interacting systems in general, and specifically of spontaneous pattern formation under the combined influence of intrinsic noise and environmental variability, are anticipated, and will be disseminated to the scientific community at tailored workshops to be organized alternatingly at Leeds, U.K. and Blacksburg, Virginia.<br/><br/>While population dynamics traditionally ignores fluctuations and considers static and homogeneous environments, demographic noise arising from randomly occurring birth or death events as well as external environmental variations play a crucial role in understanding the eco-evolutionary dynamics of a population in time. The interdependence of external environmental variability and internal demographic noise is poorly understood to date, but it is of eminent importance, for example in microbial communities, which are often subject to sudden and extreme environmental changes. In particular, modelling populations of varying size and composition subject to changing external factors is crucial to gain a full understanding of the evolution of microbial antibiotic resistance. Standard theoretical techniques, like mean-field approximations or system-size expansions cannot be straightforwardly used, and new mathematical approaches are needed. A suite of novel theoretical methods, based on and combining evolutionary and nonlinear dynamics, deterministic and stochastic partial differential equations, agent-based computer simulations, and tools from non-equilibrium statistical physics such as dynamical scaling theory, renormalization group approaches to critical phenomena, and mathematical representations of stochastic kinetics in terms of continuum field theories, will be developed. The goal is to design and quantitatively characterize biologically relevant evolutionary models of increasing levels of complexity, which incorporate both switching environmental features and fully account for the underlying stochasticity. These theoretical advances will be utilized to generate directly testable predictions for laboratory experiments to further explore how demographic noise and environmental variability conjointly influence the emergence of collective features and affect species coexistence and their organization into spatial patterns.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and the LS-BioTech Venture Fund, and the Division of Materials Research (DMR) through the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical models can inform scientific understanding of these complex and ever-changing systems, as well as public health policy. In particular, mechanistic models, mathematical models that describe the key processes that drive dynamic, real-world systems, along with empirical data, can be useful for assessing the efficacy of different control strategies, or testing different hypotheses about the underlying biology. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored both the importance of mechanistic models and the challenges of implementing these models to inform policy. One of these challenges, which spans disciplines, arises when there is a mismatch between the data available and the data required to inform these models and  reduce uncertainty in model outputs and predictions. A model-data mismatch could lead to erroneous conclusions about which control policies will be most effective at achieving a particular goal. This project aims to create a methodology that finds the most cost-effective approach to data collection for a given mathematical model, such that the model produces reliable outputs and measures of uncertainty. Applying these methods to recent case studies like COVID-19, Zika, and Ebola can inform appropriate responses to, and improve preparedness for, future pandemics. These methods will also be applicable to areas of ecology and physiology, where the overarching goal of integrating modeling and empirical studies is critical to progress. Integral to the research objectives is a new education program targeting undergraduate students, with unrecognized potential in STEM. A series of educational <br/>modules will engage students in the fundamentals of mathematical modeling, coding, and visualization, using a collaborative and inquiry-based approach. Participants will hone these skills by working with epidemiological models related to the proposed project, and will use their creativity and unique perspectives as novice modelers with diverse backgrounds to promote model literacy in the general public.<br/><br/>One way to address the problem of a model-data mismatch is first to evaluate the practical identifiability of a model, that is, the ability to estimate model parameters unambiguously from data, given a particular data set.  Conclusions derived from a practically unidentifiable model may not be robust.  Furthermore, commonly used methods to determine practical identifiability of epidemiological models rely on simple likelihood models (functions proportional to the probability of observed data given the model parameters) that make unrealistic assumptions about epidemiological data, which in reality are highly correlated and complex.  A poor approximation to the true likelihood model can lead to inaccurate estimates of uncertainty in model outputs.  Using appropriate identifiability metrics and improved (yet tractable) likelihood models, control theory can be leveraged to derive data sampling strategies, constrained by finite public health resources, that render a model practically identifiable.  The approach is to find sampling protocols that jointly minimize the identifiability metric and the cost of the sampling strategy.  These new methods will be tested using synthetic data, and applied to recent outbreaks to determine what data sampling strategies would have been sufficient to reduce the uncertainty in model parameter estimates, and therefore, reduce uncertainty in model outputs.<br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and the BIO Division of Environmental Biology through the Population and Community Ecology (PCE) Cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing methods for network analysis partition the brain into a few hundred regions. Functional or structural information is then overlaid on top of the parcellation for further analysis. However, the parcellation of a few hundred regions cannot fully characterize potential differences in the brain anatomy and function among individuals. This project will tackle the challenge by developing computationally efficient mathematical models for building continuous brain networks. We will demonstrate the various uses of the new models including the prediction of individual cognitive abilities. The project will produce new algorithms in network models, deep learning and accompanying codes and processed data that will serve as a testbed for the development of more advanced methods. The impact of the project goes beyond the intended applications and will support more advanced methods in other areas. The project has great potential to reshape the research on how networks are constructed and analyzed. We expect that the continuous brain networks characterize the fundamental nature of individual brains and improve the predictive power to individual differences in terms of cognitive abilities. The project will also provide versatile an open-source toolbox of algorithms for modeling and visualizing large-scale functional and structural brain networks continuously.<br/><br/>Researchers who use existing brain parcellations for building and analyzing brain network models face several challenges: 1) the inherent limitations of using predetermined parcellations for understanding brain organizations in multiple spatial scales; 2) conflicting network topology over the choice of parcellation; 3) decreased sensitivity over multimodal integration. These have been raised as major challenges for the connectome-based prediction of individual cognitive abilities. The prediction models may not perform optimally if the boundary of the brain parcels does not fit the data well. Further, the specific choice of brain parcellations may bias prediction outcomes. Given these limitations, the main goal of the project is to develop computationally efficient mathematical models for building continuous functional and structural brain networks without using existing brain parcellations. Using these novel network constructions, we will develop new computationally efficient deep learning approaches that incorporate the proposed network geometry and predict individual cognitive abilities without relying on predefined parcellations. We will demonstrate the use of the continuous networks to understand brain organizations in multiscale levels and predict individual cognitive abilities such as intelligence, working memory, attention and cognitive controls.<br/><br/>This award is being co-funded by the CISE Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) through the CRCNA and BRAIN Programs, and the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The nucleus is a particular organelle where scaling is tightly regulated and aberrations are often hallmarks of disease. Consequently, a better understanding of these fundamental mechanisms may lead to novel treatments. The Principal Investigators (PIs) will iterate between wet-lab experiments and mathematical modeling to uncover the principles underpinning scaling in the model system Xenopus Laevis (frog). The PIs posit that the dynamics of nuclear growth and ultimately the steady-state size of the organelle depend upon multiple, interdependent processes including (i) nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediated import of soluble proteins, (ii) osmotic/oncotic pressure differences, (iii) microtubule-dependent transport of vesicular membrane building blocks, and (iv) regulated exchange between the outer nuclear membrane and the contiguous endoplasmic reticulum. Using parameter estimation and Bayesian model selection criteria, The PIs will delineate the roles played by each of these processes. The outcomes of this award will provide a framework for data driven discovery in a vast range of biological problems. This award will enable the training of the next generation of biophysical researchers who will be immersed in both theoretical and experimental environments.<br/><br/>The PIs will determine the mechanisms of nuclear scaling using the model system X. laevis within an iterative experimental and modeling approach. On the experimental end, the PIs will combine microfluidics, photolabile hydrogels, and cell-free cytoplasmic extracts derived from X. laevis eggs.  This platform enables recapitulation of nuclear assembly and growth under controlled experimental conditions in which variables such as cytoplasmic volume, cytoplasmic shape, and cytoplasmic composition can be independently modulated. To complement this experimental framework, the PIs will develop a hierarchy of mathematical models ranging from analytically tractable (single nucleus, radially symmetric), to computationally demanding (multiple interacting nuclei, complex cell geometry). These models will take the form of free boundary partial differential equations (reaction-advection-diffusion PDEs) and describe the transport of proteins by unbiased diffusion, directed motion along microtubules and active fluid flow. To incorporate surface details of the nuclear envelope, particularly the arrangement and dynamics of NPCs during nuclear growth, macroscopic laws describing rates of import and growth will be obtained using asymptotic analysis and homogenization theory.

Infectious diseases alter the United State's economy, society, and culture in complex ways, and these economic and social changes influence the way a pandemic develops. For example, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic is having substantial economic, educational, social, and societal consequences, including changes in work and housing habits, labor markets, and social justice dialogues. Similarly, the HIV epidemic had a major impact on our society in the 1980's, far beyond those immediately impacted by the virus. Mathematical models help make sense of these complex interactions. Constructing models of such complex socio-economic-epidemiological systems requires experts from the constituent fields to work together. The PIs anticipate the research agenda developed in the workshop will facilitate the research communities to discover new mathematical methods and modeling approaches to jointly forecast epidemiological, economic and social patterns so that future pandemics are mitigated with lower social and economic cost.<br/><br/>The conventional approach to the modelling of infectious diseases is to collect basic life-cycle data on the disease, and to overlay that onto structured population data to predict prevalence patterns, health outcomes, using differential equations, networks, agent-based simulations, or another related modelling approaches. These approaches are quite successful at day-ahead prediction, but aside from largely ad hoc parametric adjustments, these standard approaches have almost no ability to connect to behavioral based interventions. These means that the models are not helpful for measuring the benefits and costs (broadly defined) of non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are critical when novel pathogens emerge.  There is expert knowledge and modeling work, related to epidemics, in economics and social sciences that can be used to better describe transmission, while providing internally consistent connections to society and the economy. But the disciplinary divides are difficult to bridge. There are limits in data collection, including scale, precision, and representativeness. This difficulty has been amplified by the fast growth of the scholarly literature over the last few years. Bringing together a diverse group of scholars, scientists, and modelers will help everybody interested in the field better understand what has been accomplished so far and produce a research agenda for improving mathematical models in human epidemiology in the future.
