"1411411","Interpreting Data from Trapping of Stochastic Movers","DMS","MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY","08/15/2014","08/16/2014","Jeffrey Schenker","MI","Michigan State University","Standard Grant","Junping Wang","07/31/2019","$300,000.00","James Miller","jeffrey@math.msu.edu","426 AUDITORIUM RD RM 2","EAST LANSING","MI","488242600","5173555040","MPS","7334","","$0.00","This collaboration between mathematical physicist Prof. Jeff Schenker and entomologist Prof. James Miller aims at a fundamental understanding of the science of trapping of insects, particularly agricultural pests.  Capture of individual insects in traps baited with a lure, often a pheromone, has long been a critical measurement technique in field biology.  The number of individuals caught in a trap can reveal which insects are present and when they active.  However, the difficult problem of converting the number captured into an accurate estimate of pest density (the number of pests to be found in a given region) is at present poorly understood.  This project aims to solve that problem through a combination of field experiments, computer simulations, and theoretical investigations into random movements that approximate insect flight.  Better understanding of trapping will be of use to agricultural pest managers, in the detection and management of invasive species, and in monitoring and controlling the spread of insect disease vectors.  In particular, the aimed-for improvements in population estimation  will be a boon for farmers, allowing pest managers to recommend interventions like insecticide sprays only when there is clear scientific evidence that the cost of application is offset by the potential loss to the grower. <br/><br/>The work will follow an integrated program of mathematical investigations on competitive trapping of stochastic movers and field experiments of marked release/capture of insects.  The aim is to answer two questions: (1) Given an array of several traps what information about the dispersal, mobility and population density may be inferred from the various catches? (2) Given several traps how may we best arrange them to accurately infer estimates on population density from catch data?  In the past, a missing link in regards to both problems has been an accurate representation of the probability of catch as it varies with the distances animals originated from the trap.  The investigators have made considerable progress on modeling catch using computer simulated random walkers.  By bringing mathematical analysis and numerical study of diffusion and random walks to bear on the problem, the research team anticipates being able to extract important scientific measurements from data that can be gathered easily and inexpensively in the field."

In parallel, concentrated efforts were made by both the government and the national universities to educate a new generation of researchers with interdisciplinary expertise in mathematics, statistics and biology. However, the demand for such specialized skills is still to be met as few mathematical and biological scientists are trained in both topics.  The meeting will bring together a mix of senior and junior scientists to report on theoretical methods that proved successful in mathematical neuroscience, and to encourage their dissemination and application to modeling in computational medicine and other biological fields.<br/><br/>In the past two decades, among all biological fields, neuroscience is arguably the most influenced by quantitative methods. Computational models were used to propose anatomical- and functional-related hypotheses and, conversely, novel experimental findings have led to the development of new mathematical theories. While most of these theoretical advancements were driven by the investigation of the nervous system, they are general enough to be successfully translated to modeling problems in other areas of biology and medicine. The meeting will integrate education and research by introducing young investigators to a useful and effective mathematical toolbox for quantitative biology, while presenting at the same time the most recent advancements in the field."

In response, these consumer species must change strategies and behaviors in order to adapt. One change that has been observed in numerous species is an increase in cannibalism. Another is the timing of reproductive activities. Such changes can in turn lead to a cascade of changes throughout an ecosystem, affecting survival of individual species and the well-being of the entire system. El Niño events mimic some features of long-term climate change on short time scales, allowing for tests of some climate-related hypotheses in marine systems. This project will examine the impact of climate-change-related food shortages on organisms both theoretically, using mathematical models, and empirically, at a large colony of seabirds that function as an important indicator species. The work will provide cross-disciplinary training in mathematical biology for undergraduate, masters, and Ph.D. students. The project emphasizes training undergraduates and members from underrepresented groups. Undergraduate students will be involved at every stage of the research process, from data collection and analysis to joint authorship of peer-reviewed publications. The investigators engage the general public and wildlife managers through public lectures and interviews, and by working with biologists and managers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The results of this work have important implications for the management of natural populations responding to climate change.<br/><br/>In previous work the investigators demonstrated (1) a strong positive association between rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and increased egg cannibalism in glaucous-winged gulls (Larus glaucescens), which are important indicators of marine environmental quality; and (2) the existence of every-other-day ovulation synchrony in glaucous-winged gulls, with the degree of synchronization proportional to colony density. Proof-of-concept mathematical models suggest that the two traits may be co-adaptive, and that, in general, rising SSTs may initiate a cascade of changes in life history strategies in colonial seabirds. The objectives of this study are to (1) develop and analyze general mathematical models for exploring the interaction of SSTs, reduced environmental food availability, cannibalism, and reproductive synchrony in terms of population and adaptive dynamic responses to changes in food availability; (2) field test, in a specific system, predictions associated with two general hypotheses suggested by the mathematical models, namely, that cannibalism is an adaptive response to decreased food supply, which can be a consequence of increased SST, and that reproductive synchrony is an adaptive response to cannibalism; and (3) train undergraduate, master's, and Ph.D. students in interdisciplinary STEM research involving mathematical modeling and field research, intentionally emphasizing the training of underrepresented groups."

The purpose of this project is to understand effects of the water flow and inter- and intra- relations in species on population spread and persistence in streams or rivers that may be subject to temporal and spatial variations. Reaction-diffusion-advection equations and integro-difference / differential equations will be studied. Researchers will investigate effects of temporal and spatial heterogeneity on spreading speeds and/or persistence conditions for a single species and for multiple species in different river environments. The relation among hydrological factors of a real river will be incorporated into population models. The optimal control and observer theory will be combined to spatial dynamics theory to study influences of global perturbations of parameters on population invasions of an invasive species. <br/> <br/>Real rivers or streams can never be ideally homogeneous everywhere at all times. It is crucial to introduce temporal and spatial heterogeneity and hydrological relations into population models. It is also interesting to combine the optimal control and observer theory and invasion dynamics. Researchers will derive reliable predictions about influences of the water flow and physical river conditions on population dynamics and provide suggestions on Instream Flow Needs, biological invasion control, river channel design, and water resource management. The following questions could be answered based on the study: How does the total annual flow discharge influence the ecosystem health?  Is it better to have fluctuating flows or a constant flow for population persistence?  How much water can we take from a river without destroying the ecosystem?  How much spatial heterogeneity should be kept for healthy ecosystem while designing a river channel?  Will a species be persistent or extinct in a specific real river?  How to control an invasive species in a river?  More questions than these are likely to be addressed as the project progresses."

When these systems are not optimally aligned, there are negative implications for physical and mental health, job performance, and key tasks such as driving. Investigating these interactions is difficult since they take place on a range of spatial and temporal scales that are not easily addressed simultaneously with current experimental techniques.  Temporal scales vary from the millisecond timing of neuron firing to the 24 hour period of the circadian rhythm to the days and weeks over which misalignment of sleep and circadian rhythms occurs.  Spatial scales range from the intracellular protein transcription and translation dynamics that generate 24 hour rhythmicity in SCN neural activity to synaptic interactions between neural populations involved in the regulation of sleep states to the ultimately observable sleep/wake behavior of the animal.  Recent advances in identifying the anatomy and physiology of circadian and sleep/wake regulatory systems provide the necessary details for constructing physiologically-based mathematical models of these systems. The three aims of this project undertake the development, analysis, and integration of mathematical models to bridge the disparate temporal and spatial scales of the problem. The project will address the following key questions: (1) the role of different sleep states, particularly rapid eye movement sleep, in the synchronization of sleep behavior with the circadian rhythm; (2) how SCN electrophysiology translates neuronal signals into molecular signals that act to shift the circadian clock; and (3) the nature of the indirect synaptic projections between the SCN and neural populations regulating sleep and wake states that govern the 24 hour rhythm in experimentally recorded rat sleep/wake patterning. <br/><br/>The role of different sleep states on synchronization of sleep and circadian rhythms will be investigated by employing a neuronal population model of the sleep/wake regulatory network coupled to the SCN.  To quantify the mathematical basis for synchronization and the characteristics of rapid eye movement sleep cycling that promote desynchronization, phase map based analytical techniques developed in coupled oscillator theory will be applied to the model.  To understand how neuronal and molecular signals are integrated in SCN neurons, a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model for neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus will be linked to a Goodwin-oscillator-based model for the intracellular molecular clock.  Model analysis will identify the mechanisms by which the actions of neuronal synaptic projections on a millisecond time scale, mediated through electrophysiology and resultant intracellular calcium dynamics, perturb the calcium-dependent 24 hour oscillations of the molecular clock.  The feedforward and feedback synaptic projections between the SCN and the sleep/wake regulatory network will be investigated by fitting simulated sleep/wake patterning from neuronal population models of sleep/wake and circadian networks to 24 hour experimental rat sleep recordings.  Results will provide constraints on and predictions for network structure and coupling mechanisms.  Mathematically, the projects will advance techniques for multiscale modeling, provide insights into coupled oscillator systems involving both limit cycle and hysteresis loop oscillators, investigate deterministic and stochastic contributions to model dynamics, and demonstrate novel methodologies for using experimental data to constrain network models.  Two graduate students and at least four undergraduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary research in mathematical neuroscience and dynamical systems through their participation in the projects.  For educational outreach, a sleep/wake modeling teaching module will be developed for high school algebra classes to expose students to modeling in a personal, highly relevant context that relates to issues such as shift work, jet lag, and the well-documented sleep phase delay in teenagers."

Normally, the heart contracts in response to electrical waves that propagate through cardiac muscle; however, deadly arrhythmias can result when disturbances arise in these electrical waves occur and lead to irregular heart contractions. Scientific computing applied to cardiovascular problems is becoming a formidable tool (in addition to in vitro and in vivo studies) not only to understand these pathologies but also to design devices and optimize therapies. For computing simulations to be reliable and accurate in clinical settings, it is crucial that cardiac conductivities and other parameter values utilized in mathematical models are estimated carefully. Unfortunately, there is no common agreement for these parameters, and the uncertainty surrounding their values affects the reliability of quantitative analysis. In this project, we use a combined approach of mathematical methods, computing techniques and experiments to estimate accurately these parameters necessary to perform numerical simulations of cardiac tissue dynamics in normal and diseased tissue correctly. This research has the potential to elucidate arrhythmia mechanisms and to develop therapies by providing a quantified testbed for simulations. It is a truly interdisciplinary project that connects biology, physiology, physics and computation through a mathematical methodology and an integrative approach between theory, simulations and experiments. Results will be made available the public and other researchers via publications and online via TheVirtualHeart.org.<br/><br/>The bidomain model for electrocardiology is the accepted mathematical formalism for modeling the propagation of cardiac action potentials across tissue when including intra- and extracellular components. Numerical simulations of electrical propagation in heart tissue are extremely sensitive to the values used for the conductivity, which is described by a 3D symmetric tensor for each point in space. A precise quantification of the entries of this tensor in practice is still an open and challenging problem from both the mathematical and biological points of view. We formulate the problem of conductivity quantification as a variational inverse problem. The conductivities are regarded as the control variable for the minimization of the mismatch between the activation time computed and the one retrieved from potential measurements. The two challenges addressed by the present proposal are (i) development and analysis of specific computational methods for the solution of the inverse problem including appropriate model reduction techniques to solve the problem in real cases and (ii) extensive validation of the methods in experimental settings for different tissues within the heart, such as right and left ventricles and atria, and for different mammalian tissues. The proposed research will develop new mathematical methods and techniques for inverse problems and will advance our understanding of wave propagation in cardiac tissue for normal and diseased states. It will further allow the use of mathematical models and methods for real applications, particularly when addressing clinical problems."

The predictive mathematical modeling and computational tools are developed on the basis of experimental data.  The experimental data on particle diffusion in mucus and the physical properties that govern mucus flow transport are collected on human bronchial epithelial mucus from lung cultures and clinical patients.   This experimental-theoretical-computational strategy has the promise for direct applications in clinical treatment of humans with diverse lung diseases and disorders, both for assessment of disease and for design of physical therapy and drug treatment strategies.  Mathematically, these models and simulation tools promise to provide insight into mean mucus flow properties from physiological forcing (cilia and air drag from breathing and cough) and also to resolve microstructural changes in the mucus molecular network.  These tools can offer insight into the biophysical differences in mucus during disease and disease progression, which are keys to a predictive design of physical and drug therapies.   When integrated with clinical knowledge, this modeling will provide the capability to infer flow and diffusive transport properties of mucus samples and healthy and disease conditions, and the capability to test therapies to reinstate mucus clearance on an individualized patient basis.<br/><br/>This project develops a data-driven strategy for the modeling of lung mucus transport, linking stochastic molecular kinetic processes, evolution equations for microstructure-based stresses, and momentum equations for flow. The experimental data consists of stochastic (entropic fluctuations) and deterministic (controlled forcing) probes of mucus microstructure, together with high-resolution microscopy of mucus transport in cell cultures derived from human lung tissue. These rich data sets provide unprecedented probes of the broad mucus relaxation spectrum arising from single mucin molecules, their entanglement network in mucus gels, transient mucin crosslinking, and chain scission kinetics. Cell cultures afford insights into cilia-driven flow transport of mucus, and provide a laboratory setting to explore molecular-to-macroscopic consequences of imposed physical stresses and chemical dosing. To translate this remarkable data into a predictive understanding of mucus transport, a modeling platform is studied that resolves molecular-to-continuum processes of mucus, both near and far from equilibrium. Our strategy begins with stochastic time series of passive microbead probes in mucus gels of various concentrations, to solve the inverse and direct problems for linear (near equilibrium) viscoelastic characterization. Next, active microbead data for the same set of concentrations is used over a range of controlled magnetic forces to determine nonlinear thresholds and the signatures of non-equilibrium behavior at the microscale. These data directly feed into the main objective of this project, which is the formulation of a new microscopic-macroscopic constitutive law for mucus. This formulation is proposed to interpret the linear and nonlinear data, and to integrate molecular-to-continuum processes into a new mucus transport model. A numerical strategy is under study for direct numerical simulations and comparison with data from each type of experiment."

For instance, such mutations can be related to bacterial resistance to antibiotics or emergence of viral strains transferable from animal to humans.  Currently, there exist various mathematical models which describe the evolution of bacterial or viral populations, but mathematical tools which can be used to study evolutionary trajectories of large bacterial or viral populations are still lacking. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to develop proper mathematical tools for studying rare mutational events in bacteria or viruses. In particular, the investigators will use the large deviation approach for population trajectories to develop theoretical foundation and practical computational tools to study the evolutionary trajectories of bacterial populations with concrete applications to the analysis of long term laboratory experiments on Escherichia Coli.<br/><br/>The large deviations technique will be developed in a novel context of discrete models for population histograms. In contrast with the classical Wentzell-Freidlin approach for ""small"" diffusions, there is no general derivation of cost functions for discrete Markov chains with continuous state space, so that concrete analytical and numerical results for discrete models are rather scarce. However, large deviations offer significant computational advantages in the context of evolutionary dynamics described here due to the special structure of this problem.  In particular, the cost function for evolutionary trajectories will be derived in an explicit form. This will lead to the development of a novel discretized difference equation for cost minimizing trajectories, thus enabling an efficient numerical ""geodesic shooting"" in reverse time to compute the most likely population evolution between given initial and terminal states.  This novel algorithm will be used to estimate (very small) probabilities of rare genetic events such as the transitions between two successive genotype fixations and to compute the most likely sequence of genotype fixations leading from an ancestor genotype to a currently dominant genotype. Moreover, the numerical codes developed in the course of the proposed research will be used to study various epistasis scenarios. Thus, this work will generate innovative computational and conceptual tools leading to a better understanding of genetic evolution of bacterial or viral populations."

The lack of topographic structure in hippocampus has made it a natural inspiration for associative memory models, such as the Hopfield model, for encoding memories in unstructured recurrent networks. At the same time, studies in rodents have uncovered the critical role of hippocampus in spatial navigation and, more recently, time-tracking. In contrast to associative memory encoding, these functions have been successfully modeled using spatially structured networks. How can these viewpoints be reconciled? The central goal of this research is to develop a mathematical theory of memory encoding in spatially structured networks, and to study the neural codes that arise from such networks.  Specifically, the research will develop mathematical theory to answer the following questions: (1) How can overlapping memory patterns be encoded precisely as attractors of an unstructured neural network, without introducing unwanted ""spurious states""? (2) How can memories be encoded in a spatially structured network, such as a bump attractor network, while maintaining functions that depend on the network's spatial organization?  (3) Aside from error correction, what are the advantages of redundancy in a neural code, such as the hippocampal place field code, that is characterized by heavily overlapping receptive fields? This last question will also be explored via the analysis of cortical and hippocampal data sets provided by collaborating labs.<br/><br/>The hippocampus is often thought of as a ""Swiss knife"" in the brain.  Decades of experimental work have uncovered its essential role in learning and memory, as well as in spatial navigation.  From a theoretical standpoint, it is puzzling how the same neural network can achieve such disparate functions.  In particular, mathematical models of memory encoding are fundamentally quite different from models of spatial navigation.  This work will integrate these two major types of neural network models, with the goal of understanding how the hippocampus can support multiple important functions.  At its core, the research will advance the mathematical theory behind our understanding of network-level computation in the brain."

Through coordinated beating, cilia in the lung and respiratory tract help to clear the airway of potentially harmful particles and mucus. Impaired cilia motion can result in serious respiratory infection. This impairment can be caused by an altered fluid environment, a characteristic of cystic fibrosis, by defects in the cilia themselves as with primary ciliary dyskinesia, or by other respiratory diseases. Similarly, a sperm is only able to reach and fertilize an egg if its flagellum can propel it forward; impaired motility results in infertility. Cilia and sperm beating is highly dependent on the fluid environment, which contains fibrous, protein networks as well as chemical signals. Understanding this relationship between elastic structure and heterogeneous fluid is vital for development of delivery strategies for inhaled drugs and medicines, new contraceptives, and aiding in infertility due to reduced sperm motility.  This project will focus on the development of new computational models and numerical methods that account for these fibrous, protein networks within the fluid to infer in vivo behavior of cilia and sperm.<br/><br/>Recent experiments have shown that i) sperm-flagella waveforms are altered when immersed in fluids containing networks of large proteins and also with flagellar calcium concentration, ii) the previously-considered `watery' fluid surrounding airway cilia actually contains a network of large proteins, or, 'brush'.

Cilia and flagella will be modeled as slender, elastic, structures immersed in a fluid governed by the Brinkman equation. A regularized framework and fundamental solutions will be used to derive new numerical methods for various confined geometries. The new numerical methods will be computationally-efficient and developed for use on high-performance computing systems. This research will identify factors that modulate sperm progression towards the egg, explore various waveforms of cilia and sperm, and investigate how a 'brush' in the fluid surrounding cilia might affect transport of particles within that fluid."

These models will be analyzed to investigate how spatial population structure impacts the cancer initiation process and resulting genetic heterogeneity of the tissue. In its second phase, this project will develop mathematical models of the feedback between the evolving tumor cell population and its environment, using non-Markovian branching processes.

The mathematical frameworks developed in this proposal will also be broadly applicable to understanding similar issues in ecology and disease dynamics, e.g. emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial or viral populations, or the geographic spread of invasive plant species and pesticide resistant weeds. An education goal of this project is to increase the representation of women in mathematics, with an emphasis on recruitment into the mathematical biology and medicine. A week-long summer program will be held each year at the University of Minnesota for local high school girls with the theme of ""Mathematics in Biology and Medicine."" In addition, a workshop will be held to bring together early career women in mathematical biology with the aim of sharing research and discussing emerging areas of the field, and undergraduate students will be integrated into the proposed research efforts for year-long projects.

A key component in the study of species sorting is to understand how local abiotic factors influence the behavior as well as composition of resident communities. For instance, how does the increase in turbulent diffusion in water columns affect the persistence of phytoplankton populations? Can a river organism persist with increased river discharge? If it persists, how will its range limit be changed? Understanding the answers to these questions can facilitate the development of better management strategies for natural resources. The investigators study these and related questions in this project under the framework of evolutionary game theory. Since its inception in the 1970s, evolutionary game theory has proven itself to be invaluable in explaining many complex and challenging aspects of biological processes. However, most studies in evolutionary game theory have, until recently, ignored the effect of space. This is partly due to the mathematical difficulty arising from the analysis of spatially explicit models. The investigators and their colleagues will undertake the investigation of the evolution of dispersal, via discrete as well as continuous mathematical modeling approaches. <br/><br/>More precisely, this project studies the evolutionarily stable strategies in dispersal models. An evolutionarily stable strategy is a strategy which, if adopted by a population in a given environment, assures that the population cannot be invaded by a mutant that is initially rare. This project focuses on finding evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies in homogeneous or heterogeneous environments in two distinct directions: (i) Previous studies have shown that a balanced dispersal strategy for continuous-time and discrete-space models can replace any other unbalanced dispersal strategy. On the other hand, studies have also shown that a balanced dispersal strategy for discrete-time and discrete-space models may not be able to replace some unbalanced dispersal strategies. This project seeks a unified approach to study the evolutionary stability of balanced dispersal in discrete, continuous and nonlocal models, and to resolve the disparities between different modeling approaches; (ii) Unidirectional flow in water columns often pushes individuals away from favorable environments and also induces a net loss of individuals from the habitat. Previous studies show that advection often puts slow dispersers at a disadvantage. The investigators will study whether larger dispersal rates will always evolve or if some intermediate dispersal rate will be selected, in homogeneous or heterogeneous, open or closed environments. Connections between the evolution of dispersal and range limit of species will be investigated. The mathematical tools include variational method, elliptic and parabolic regularity theory, monotone dynamical system theory, and numerical simulations."

Normally, the heart contracts in response to electrical waves that propagate through cardiac muscle; however, deadly arrhythmias can result when disturbances arise in these electrical waves occur and lead to irregular heart contractions. Scientific computing applied to cardiovascular problems is becoming a formidable tool (in addition to in vitro and in vivo studies) not only to understand these pathologies but also to design devices and optimize therapies. For computing simulations to be reliable and accurate in clinical settings, it is crucial that cardiac conductivities and other parameter values utilized in mathematical models are estimated carefully. Unfortunately, there is no common agreement for these parameters, and the uncertainty surrounding their values affects the reliability of quantitative analysis. In this project, we use a combined approach of mathematical methods, computing techniques and experiments to estimate accurately these parameters necessary to perform numerical simulations of cardiac tissue dynamics in normal and diseased tissue correctly. This research has the potential to elucidate arrhythmia mechanisms and to develop therapies by providing a quantified testbed for simulations. It is a truly interdisciplinary project that connects biology, physiology, physics and computation through a mathematical methodology and an integrative approach between theory, simulations and experiments. Results will be made available the public and other researchers via publications and online via TheVirtualHeart.org.<br/><br/>The bidomain model for electrocardiology is the accepted mathematical formalism for modeling the propagation of cardiac action potentials across tissue when including intra- and extracellular components. Numerical simulations of electrical propagation in heart tissue are extremely sensitive to the values used for the conductivity, which is described by a 3D symmetric tensor for each point in space. A precise quantification of the entries of this tensor in practice is still an open and challenging problem from both the mathematical and biological points of view. We formulate the problem of conductivity quantification as a variational inverse problem. The conductivities are regarded as the control variable for the minimization of the mismatch between the activation time computed and the one retrieved from potential measurements. The two challenges addressed by the present proposal are (i) development and analysis of specific computational methods for the solution of the inverse problem including appropriate model reduction techniques to solve the problem in real cases and (ii) extensive validation of the methods in experimental settings for different tissues within the heart, such as right and left ventricles and atria, and for different mammalian tissues. The proposed research will develop new mathematical methods and techniques for inverse problems and will advance our understanding of wave propagation in cardiac tissue for normal and diseased states. It will further allow the use of mathematical models and methods for real applications, particularly when addressing clinical problems."

In response, these consumer species must change strategies and behaviors in order to adapt. One change that has been observed in numerous species is an increase in cannibalism. Another is the timing of reproductive activities. Such changes can in turn lead to a cascade of changes throughout an ecosystem, affecting survival of individual species and the well-being of the entire system. El Niño events mimic some features of long-term climate change on short time scales, allowing for tests of some climate-related hypotheses in marine systems. This project will examine the impact of climate-change-related food shortages on organisms both theoretically, using mathematical models, and empirically, at a large colony of seabirds that function as an important indicator species. The work will provide cross-disciplinary training in mathematical biology for undergraduate, masters, and Ph.D. students. The project emphasizes training undergraduates and members from underrepresented groups. Undergraduate students will be involved at every stage of the research process, from data collection and analysis to joint authorship of peer-reviewed publications. The investigators engage the general public and wildlife managers through public lectures and interviews, and by working with biologists and managers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The results of this work have important implications for the management of natural populations responding to climate change.<br/><br/>In previous work the investigators demonstrated (1) a strong positive association between rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and increased egg cannibalism in glaucous-winged gulls (Larus glaucescens), which are important indicators of marine environmental quality; and (2) the existence of every-other-day ovulation synchrony in glaucous-winged gulls, with the degree of synchronization proportional to colony density. Proof-of-concept mathematical models suggest that the two traits may be co-adaptive, and that, in general, rising SSTs may initiate a cascade of changes in life history strategies in colonial seabirds. The objectives of this study are to (1) develop and analyze general mathematical models for exploring the interaction of SSTs, reduced environmental food availability, cannibalism, and reproductive synchrony in terms of population and adaptive dynamic responses to changes in food availability; (2) field test, in a specific system, predictions associated with two general hypotheses suggested by the mathematical models, namely, that cannibalism is an adaptive response to decreased food supply, which can be a consequence of increased SST, and that reproductive synchrony is an adaptive response to cannibalism; and (3) train undergraduate, master's, and Ph.D. students in interdisciplinary STEM research involving mathematical modeling and field research, intentionally emphasizing the training of underrepresented groups."

Disruptions of these rhythms, due to jet lag or night-shift work for example, have health implications for millions of Americans. The primary goal of this project is to gain a mathematical understanding of the role that the clock's electrical activity plays in circadian timekeeping, in particular the way the clock responds to the external light/dark cycle. This project will contribute to the BRAIN Initiative by discovering principles about the flow of information between the cell membrane and genes. These newly discovered principles will aid in the development of mathematical models of brain processes such as long-term memory formation and the control of neuronal survival and death. This project will also impact areas of mathematical biology beyond circadian rhythms through its development of computer simulation methods that are capable of handling widely disparate time scales. Through this project, the investigator will mentor graduate and undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research at the interface of mathematics and neuroscience, and will participate in educational outreach to under-served urban communities in collaboration with the Urban Scholar Society.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to create a mathematical framework for understanding how dynamic changes in gene expression affect the electrical properties of neurons and ultimately animal behavior. Circadian rhythms offer one of the clearest examples of the interplay between these different levels of organization, with rhythmic gene expression leading to daily rhythms in neural activity, physiology, and behavior. The main output signal of the master circadian clock in mammals has long been believed to be a simple day/night difference in the firing rate of neurons within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Recent findings challenge this theory, and demonstrate that a substantial portion of SCN neurons exhibit a more complex and counterintuitive set of electrical state transitions throughout the day/night cycle. Through data-driven mathematical modeling, simulation, and dynamical systems analysis of the key cell types within the clock nucleus, this project will develop an understanding of the daily transitions in the SCN's electrical state and the functional roles they play in the mammalian circadian clock.  In addition, this project will determine whether the activity patterns of two distinct classes of SCN neurons originate at the cellular or the circuit level by deriving conductance-based mathematical models of membrane excitability for both cell types and their synapses. The transitions in SCN activity patterns that occur throughout the day/night cycle will be explained by developing a multi-scale model of circadian timekeeping that links detailed models of the molecular clocks inside SCN neurons to these models of membrane excitability."

A retinotopic map is a visual of a particular occurrence of neuron activity taking place on a specific location in the brain. By analyzing the stimulus-referred functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response, retinotopic maps of the human visual cortex are generated. It has been hypothesized that human retinotopic maps are conformal mappings, but to date no theoretical models have been developed to quantify these maps. This project uses conformal geometry and fMRI data to study retinotopic maps in an attempt to model visual cortical organizations in the brain. This project will: (i) compute the intrinsic geometrical features that will determine and/or validate the conformality in the human retinotopy; (ii) model the relationships between the retinotopic maps in extrastriate visual areas and those in the primary visual cortex; (iii) develop methods to quantify retinotopic maps of individual subjects. The mathematical models applied in this project combine tools from topology, conformal geometry, complex analysis, optimization, and quasiconformal Teichmüller theory. <br/><br/>Visual processing areas have been estimated to occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex. However, an understanding of visual cortical organizations still remains elusive due to their biological complexity. Retinotopic mapping of the human visual cortex, therefore, can be an important tool for studying the brain's circuitry. This project will produce theoretically sound and practically efficient methods for quantifying retinotopic maps. These methods will lead to non-invasive biomarkers of visual functions and may lead to cures for visual deficits. The computational theories and algorithms developed in this project will have applications in other fields, including computer vision, computer graphics, sensor networks, and geometric modeling.

When these systems are not optimally aligned, there are negative implications for physical and mental health, job performance, and key tasks such as driving. Investigating these interactions is difficult since they take place on a range of spatial and temporal scales that are not easily addressed simultaneously with current experimental techniques.  Temporal scales vary from the millisecond timing of neuron firing to the 24 hour period of the circadian rhythm to the days and weeks over which misalignment of sleep and circadian rhythms occurs.  Spatial scales range from the intracellular protein transcription and translation dynamics that generate 24 hour rhythmicity in SCN neural activity to synaptic interactions between neural populations involved in the regulation of sleep states to the ultimately observable sleep/wake behavior of the animal.  Recent advances in identifying the anatomy and physiology of circadian and sleep/wake regulatory systems provide the necessary details for constructing physiologically-based mathematical models of these systems. The three aims of this project undertake the development, analysis, and integration of mathematical models to bridge the disparate temporal and spatial scales of the problem. The project will address the following key questions: (1) the role of different sleep states, particularly rapid eye movement sleep, in the synchronization of sleep behavior with the circadian rhythm; (2) how SCN electrophysiology translates neuronal signals into molecular signals that act to shift the circadian clock; and (3) the nature of the indirect synaptic projections between the SCN and neural populations regulating sleep and wake states that govern the 24 hour rhythm in experimentally recorded rat sleep/wake patterning. <br/><br/>The role of different sleep states on synchronization of sleep and circadian rhythms will be investigated by employing a neuronal population model of the sleep/wake regulatory network coupled to the SCN.  To quantify the mathematical basis for synchronization and the characteristics of rapid eye movement sleep cycling that promote desynchronization, phase map based analytical techniques developed in coupled oscillator theory will be applied to the model.  To understand how neuronal and molecular signals are integrated in SCN neurons, a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model for neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus will be linked to a Goodwin-oscillator-based model for the intracellular molecular clock.  Model analysis will identify the mechanisms by which the actions of neuronal synaptic projections on a millisecond time scale, mediated through electrophysiology and resultant intracellular calcium dynamics, perturb the calcium-dependent 24 hour oscillations of the molecular clock.  The feedforward and feedback synaptic projections between the SCN and the sleep/wake regulatory network will be investigated by fitting simulated sleep/wake patterning from neuronal population models of sleep/wake and circadian networks to 24 hour experimental rat sleep recordings.  Results will provide constraints on and predictions for network structure and coupling mechanisms.  Mathematically, the projects will advance techniques for multiscale modeling, provide insights into coupled oscillator systems involving both limit cycle and hysteresis loop oscillators, investigate deterministic and stochastic contributions to model dynamics, and demonstrate novel methodologies for using experimental data to constrain network models.  Two graduate students and at least four undergraduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary research in mathematical neuroscience and dynamical systems through their participation in the projects.  For educational outreach, a sleep/wake modeling teaching module will be developed for high school algebra classes to expose students to modeling in a personal, highly relevant context that relates to issues such as shift work, jet lag, and the well-documented sleep phase delay in teenagers."

It has been shown that phenotypic variations can arise without any underlying differences in the genotype or environmental factors. Such ""nongenetic individuality"" is observed in diverse cellular processes, ranging from bacterial persistence to HIV-1 viral infections, and is driven by randomness (noise) in the cellular levels of gene expression products such as mRNAs and proteins. To quantify the effects of noise in gene expression, recent single-cell experiments have obtained probability distributions characterizing protein levels across a population of cells. Correspondingly, there is a need to develop a general analytical framework for modeling and interpretation of the distributions obtained from such single-cell experiments that will lead to quantitative insights into how noise in gene expression is regulated. The goal of this project is to develop new approaches for obtaining analytical results for protein distributions in models of gene expression and its regulation. The project will contribute to a fundamental understanding of the role of noise in gene expression and its regulation in diverse cellular processes. The analysis requires tools and approaches from physics and applied mathematics and will be integrated with teaching efforts to effectively train students and future scientists in this fast-developing field of interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>Noise in gene expression is generally analyzed using coarse-grained stochastic models. However, obtaining exact analytical expressions for the corresponding protein distributions has been a challenging for all but the simplest models.

The approaches developed will be used to obtain both exact and approximate analytical results for models of gene expression and its regulation. The resulting analysis of models with regulatory mechanisms such as bursting, feedback and promoter-based regulation will lead to quantitative insights into noise characteristics of the basic building blocks of genetic circuits.

This experimental-theoretical-computational strategy has the promise for direct applications in clinical treatment of humans with diverse lung diseases and disorders, both for assessment of disease and for design of physical therapy and drug treatment strategies.  Mathematically, these models and simulation tools promise to provide insight into mean mucus flow properties from physiological forcing (cilia and air drag from breathing and cough) and also to resolve microstructural changes in the mucus molecular network.  These tools can offer insight into the biophysical differences in mucus during disease and disease progression, which are keys to a predictive design of physical and drug therapies.

The experimental data consists of stochastic (entropic fluctuations) and deterministic (controlled forcing) probes of mucus microstructure, together with high-resolution microscopy of mucus transport in cell cultures derived from human lung tissue. These rich data sets provide unprecedented probes of the broad mucus relaxation spectrum arising from single mucin molecules, their entanglement network in mucus gels, transient mucin crosslinking, and chain scission kinetics. Cell cultures afford insights into cilia-driven flow transport of mucus, and provide a laboratory setting to explore molecular-to-macroscopic consequences of imposed physical stresses and chemical dosing. To translate this remarkable data into a predictive understanding of mucus transport, a modeling platform is studied that resolves molecular-to-continuum processes of mucus, both near and far from equilibrium. Our strategy begins with stochastic time series of passive microbead probes in mucus gels of various concentrations, to solve the inverse and direct problems for linear (near equilibrium) viscoelastic characterization. Next, active microbead data for the same set of concentrations is used over a range of controlled magnetic forces to determine nonlinear thresholds and the signatures of non-equilibrium behavior at the microscale. These data directly feed into the main objective of this project, which is the formulation of a new microscopic-macroscopic constitutive law for mucus. This formulation is proposed to interpret the linear and nonlinear data, and to integrate molecular-to-continuum processes into a new mucus transport model. A numerical strategy is under study for direct numerical simulations and comparison with data from each type of experiment."

Through coordinated beating, cilia in the lung and respiratory tract help to clear the airway of potentially harmful particles and mucus. Impaired cilia motion can result in serious respiratory infection. This impairment can be caused by an altered fluid environment, a characteristic of cystic fibrosis, by defects in the cilia themselves as with primary ciliary dyskinesia, or by other respiratory diseases. Similarly, a sperm is only able to reach and fertilize an egg if its flagellum can propel it forward; impaired motility results in infertility. Cilia and sperm beating is highly dependent on the fluid environment, which contains fibrous, protein networks as well as chemical signals. Understanding this relationship between elastic structure and heterogeneous fluid is vital for development of delivery strategies for inhaled drugs and medicines, new contraceptives, and aiding in infertility due to reduced sperm motility.  This project will focus on the development of new computational models and numerical methods that account for these fibrous, protein networks within the fluid to infer in vivo behavior of cilia and sperm.<br/><br/>Recent experiments have shown that i) sperm-flagella waveforms are altered when immersed in fluids containing networks of large proteins and also with flagellar calcium concentration, ii) the previously-considered `watery' fluid surrounding airway cilia actually contains a network of large proteins, or, 'brush'. This project will focus on identifying emergent waveforms of sperm flagella and airway cilia when nonplanar bending and internal flagellar biochemistry are taken into account. Cilia and flagella will be modeled as slender, elastic, structures immersed in a fluid governed by the Brinkman equation. A regularized framework and fundamental solutions will be used to derive new numerical methods for various confined geometries. The new numerical methods will be computationally-efficient and developed for use on high-performance computing systems. This research will identify factors that modulate sperm progression towards the egg, explore various waveforms of cilia and sperm, and investigate how a 'brush' in the fluid surrounding cilia might affect transport of particles within that fluid."

Toward this goal, new mathematical models based on differential equations will be introduced, innovative laboratory experiments will be conducted, optimal control study will be carried out, and large-scale high-performance numerical computation will be performed.  The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration between applied mathematics and microbial ecology, integrating mathematical analysis, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulation.  The research will improve our understanding of the fundamental dynamics of cholera, which involve multiple transmission routes and complex interaction among human and ecological hosts, bacteria and viruses, and exhibit complex spatial and temporal variations under global climatic and environmental changes.<br/><br/>Worldwide cholera outbreaks and their increasing severity, frequency and duration in recent years underscore the gap between the complex mechanism of cholera transmission and our current quantitative understanding of the disease and strategies for its control.  The success of this project will not only build a solid knowledge base for understanding cholera dynamics, but also provide important guidelines for public health administration.  Meanwhile, education and training activities of this project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in the theory, methods and application of mathematical epidemiology and disease ecology.  Outreach activities will focus on demonstrating exponential growth and teaching exponentiation in both educational and community settings.

Locomotion originates in central pattern generators: neural networks in the spines of vertebrates and thoracic ganglia of insects that produce rhythmic movements. Some preparations (e.g. lamprey, crayfish) can produce stable, near-periodic rhythms in isolation, others either require sensory feedback to produce functional gaits or are significantly stabilized by it. <br/><br/>Cockroaches and stick insects exemplify these two extremes. They share the same basic neural and biomechanical architecture, but the former run rapidly over rough ground, while the latter are adapted for slow walking on twigs and leaves with varied orientations to gravity. Using existing information and collecting new data, this project will compare these species and address questions such as:<br/><br/>(1) What is the functional organization of feedforward motor coordination: How are neural circuits that drive individual legs and joints coupled to achieve inter-limb coordination?<br/><br/>(2) What is the role of sensory input in coordination: How does feedback affect motor patterns, and how does locomotion modulate incoming sensory information?<br/><br/>(3) How are pattern generators and sensory feedback systems modulated to create appropriate actions as animals change speed, face unexpected perturbations, and maneuver to negotiate complex terrain?<br/><br/>The development of integrated mathematical and computational models is central to answering such questions. New data will improve existing models, and new models will be created to span the morphological and behavioral ranges from stick insects to cockroaches, allowing us to illuminate their adaptive strategies to different environments.

The major challenge is the lack of an appropriate modeling framework for gene family evolution. To address this challenge, the investigators develop a probabilistic model for gene family evolution that is able to describe the relationship between the history of a gene family and the history of species by taking into account the effects of different evolutionary mechanisms of gene retention (neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, dosage balance). The model involves two stochastic processes - a non-homogeneous birth and death process and a mutation process. The probability distribution of a gene family tree given the species tree is derived from a non-homogeneous birth and death process in which a hazard function is employed for modeling the loss rate associated with different evolutionary mechanisms. The probabilistic model provides a systematic way of handling the estimation error of gene family trees when analyzing gene family data and is thus able to more accurately estimate the gene duplication and loss events along the phylogeny of species.<br/><br/>Advanced biotechnologies provide a vast amount of genetic data for the studies on gene family evolution. The main goal of the project is to develop a probabilistic model for gene family evolution, which can be used to effectively analyze gene family data. Gene duplication is the major resource of evolution novelty and plays an important role in gene family evolution. Thus this project will significantly advance our understanding on the process and biological consequences of gene duplication. As gene duplication played a pivotal role in evolution, the outcomes of the project will have significant impacts and important applications on a variety of fields, including evolutionary biology, phylogenetics, and cancer genetics that are closely related to human health and medicine."

This project will develop and analyze new models, compare them with experimental data, explain potential discrepancies generated by new data, and address the implications to therapy and vaccine development. The first part of this project develops multi-scale models to study hepatitis C virus (HCV) dynamics in patients treated with new antiviral drugs. These models include both intracellular viral replication and extracellular cell infection.

The movement of various nonindigenous vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) has resulted in epidemics and the spread of human diseases such as dengue, malaria, and West Nile virus. West Nile virus is a not only a threat to human health, but also to native ecosystems, since vulnerable native species can be driven into extinction by this introduced pathogen, creating detrimental effects that can cascade through an ecosystem. Ecosystems may also be disrupted directly by certain animal invaders. An example is the pike killifish, a non-native  fish in the Everglades that can migrate into freshwater marshes and prey on the small forage fishes that would otherwise support the wading bird community. The emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria is another type of biological invasion and infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are a serious public health threat.  Thus, it is essential to have simulation tools to forecast the spatial spread and effects of such invasions. Each of these biological and epidemiological problems can be studied by using structured population models to determine the birth, growth and death rates of individuals and their interactions with the environment and with each other. The goal of this project is to construct such forecasting tools and to investigate how the essential structuring variables (e.g., age, size, maturity level, location, latency) affect the properties of these invasive systems the associated epidemiological outcomes.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are: (i) Study the transmission dynamics of West Nile virus  in the U.S. and explore useful and effective prevention measures.

(iii) Investigate the invasion by small piscivorous fish in freshwater marsh landscapes in the southern Florida Everglades by constructing and analyzing advection-reaction-diffusion models.

These networks enable the identification of previously unknown macroproperties of biological systems that emerge from interactions of multiple genes. Revealing these emerging properties relies on the precision of network reconstruction from experimental data. The major limitation for network reconstruction is usually the number of samples available for the study.

A retinotopic map is a visual of a particular occurrence of neuron activity taking place on a specific location in the brain. By analyzing the stimulus-referred functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response, retinotopic maps of the human visual cortex are generated. It has been hypothesized that human retinotopic maps are conformal mappings, but to date no theoretical models have been developed to quantify these maps. This project uses conformal geometry and fMRI data to study retinotopic maps in an attempt to model visual cortical organizations in the brain. This project will: (i) compute the intrinsic geometrical features that will determine and/or validate the conformality in the human retinotopy; (ii) model the relationships between the retinotopic maps in extrastriate visual areas and those in the primary visual cortex; (iii) develop methods to quantify retinotopic maps of individual subjects. The mathematical models applied in this project combine tools from topology, conformal geometry, complex analysis, optimization, and quasiconformal Teichmüller theory. <br/><br/>Visual processing areas have been estimated to occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex. However, an understanding of visual cortical organizations still remains elusive due to their biological complexity. Retinotopic mapping of the human visual cortex, therefore, can be an important tool for studying the brain's circuitry. This project will produce theoretically sound and practically efficient methods for quantifying retinotopic maps. These methods will lead to non-invasive biomarkers of visual functions and may lead to cures for visual deficits. The computational theories and algorithms developed in this project will have applications in other fields, including computer vision, computer graphics, sensor networks, and geometric modeling. This project contributes to the BRAIN Initiative by increasing our knowledge of visual cortical organizations in the human brain and by developing laboratory infrastructure for knowledge discovery from brain imaging data. This project will create an interdisciplinary environment for graduate and undergraduate students and will develop interdisciplinary courses at the interface of mathematics and neuroscience."

Individually, these cells can behave like tiny clocks, emitting a steady stream of pulses that communicate with each other.  The synchronization of these oscillators (""clocks"") plays a role in both healthy and diseased brain states.  Deepening the understanding of how groups of brain cells synchronize (""tick"" together) or desynchronize (""tick"" separately) will deepen the understanding of the brain systems underlying motor control, epilepsy, breathing, information processing, and cognition.  This project addresses a conceptual gap in the theoretical understanding of oscillating nerve cells.  Today, most theories about how nerve cells synchronize rely on the assumption that each cell behaves with nearly impeccable precision.  However, real nerve cells have stochastic variability, and their behavior is partly irregular and unpredictable.  In constructing mathematical models of nerve cells that can account for variability, mathematically challenging problems arise.  Solving these mathematical problems can improve the ability to quantitatively describe the clocklike behavior of individual nerve cells.  This project will contribute to the BRAIN Initiative by providing deeper insight into many nervous system disorders.<br/><br/>This project addresses a mathematical problem at the foundations of computational neuroscience and neurophysiology: the reduction of oscillatory systems to a phase oscillator description, in the presence of noise. The asymptotic phase of a deterministic dynamical system possessing a stable limit cycle was introduced in mathematical biology in the 1970s. Today, the biological significance of phase oscillator models is difficult to overstate.  The fundamental notions of phase and phase resetting depend on classical results of invariant manifold theory for systems of deterministic differential equations. But noise is ubiquitous in biological dynamics.  In recasting models of biological oscillators to take into account random fluctuations, the classical ""asymptotic phase"" is no longer well defined. This project develops a new definition for the asymptotic phase of a noisy oscillator, defined in terms of the complex eigenfunctions of the forward Kolmogorov operator, describing the evolution of the density on the state space. This ""stochastic asymptotic phase"" coincides with the classical phase in the case of vanishing noise intensities. However this new definition does not rely on the classical phase of a related deterministic system. Unlike the classical phase, it is equally well defined for systems that require noise for sustained oscillation."

Persistence is found at all scales, from the molecular and cellular, to tissues, organisms, populations, and ecosystems.  At the cellular level, persistence in gene and protein networks plays a key role in the establishment of homeostasis, which is the ability of the cell to regulate key variables, so that internal conditions remain relatively constant.  At the intracellular level, the nodes of these interaction networks could be signaling molecules, genes, and gene products; at the ecosystem level, the nodes could be the various species and energy resources.  Many diseases involve a disturbance of homeostasis in specific types of cells, which corresponds to a loss of persistence in the associated interaction networks.  A more complete characterization of persistent systems may improve the understanding of these diseases.  This project will create software that implements mathematical methods for understanding persistence, and will allow biologists and biomedical scientists to analyze persistence properties of diverse biological networks of interest. <br/><br/>Persistence and permanence refer to the capacity of a system to maintain all of its variables within some fixed limits in a robust way, and this capacity is one of the most important features of biological interaction networks. In order to understand the role played by specific biological interactions (e.g., a signaling pathway in a cell), one often faces great difficulties in trying to interpret the effect of positive and negative feedbacks, nonlinear interactions, and other complex signaling between the nodes of the network. These difficulties are due to the inherent complexity of the dynamics of nonlinear systems. There are significant mathematical challenges to be overcome, whose study will lead to rich new areas of biological insight as well as mathematical theory. This project will analyze persistence as a fundamental theoretical concept that traverses levels of biological complexity. Mathematical and computational tools will be developed to understand persistence in general biological interaction networks. As a concrete step in that direction, this project will focus on biochemical networks, with the aim to provide mathematical tools for drawing precise connections between reaction network structure and its persistence properties. These tools will be applicable to complex networks, and will be able to distinguish between very similar networks having rather different capacities for persistence."

The same molecular machinery that powers voluntary movement, heart contraction and gastric motility is responsible for diverse cellular processes, from cell motility to cell division.  A detailed understanding of this process could revolutionize, among other things, prosthetic design and treatments for heart disease and cancer.  However, understanding muscle contraction is difficult because it spans vastly different size scales.  Contraction starts with molecular interactions that cause the relative sliding of two sets of protein filaments.  This sliding causes subcellular, cellular and macroscopic structures to contract.  Over the past hundred years, measurements have been made at each scale, from classical studies of whole muscle to recent single molecule experiments.  Despite this wealth of data, there is no widely accepted theory of muscle contraction suitable for, say, prediction of locomotor strategies or understanding how molecular defects lead to heart disease.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop a quantitative description of whole muscle, single cells and single molecules.  <br/> <br/>Accomplishing this goal requires the development of 1) models that accurately describe molecular measurements; 2) methods to efficiently simulate these models; and 3) techniques to bridge size scales. This project focuses largely on the first two requirements.  These will be achieved through three specific aims, each to be completed in collaboration with an experimental lab.  The investigators use Monte-Carlo simulations, numerical solution of partial and ordinary differential equations (PDEs and ODEs, respectively) and analytic solution approximations to develop and validate 1) an integro-PDE model of molecular interactions; 2) an ODE model of activation; and 3) an integro-PDE model of myosin binding protein c.  Each step in model development will be tested and refined by quantitative comparisons to experiments. The final result of the project will be a rigorous, experimentally validated molecular model of muscle, which will not only be a critical step toward a bottom-up model of muscle contraction, but will also represent an important contribution to muscle biophysics.  Further, the mathematical techniques and equations used to develop this theory have applications beyond muscle contraction, applying more generally to geometrically constrained chemical reactions that occur in a variety of systems (e.g. adhesion of cells to surfaces, bundling of cytoskeletal filaments and frictional sliding)."

The bacterial chromosome is circular and replication invariably results in the formation of interlinked daughter chromosomes. Error-free unlinking is required to ensure proper segregation at cell division and stable plasmid inheritance. Type II topoisomerases unlink replication links. In Escherichia coli, in the absence of topo IV (a type II topoisomerase credited with chromosome unlinking), the site-specific recombination system XerCD mediates sister chromosome unlinking. This reaction is activated at the division septum by a powerful translocase FtsK, which coordinates the last stages of chromosome segregation. The mechanism by which the XerCD-FtsK complex simplifies the topology of DNA remains unclear. The main objective of the proposed studies is to characterize the topological mechanism of DNA unlinking by the XerCD-FtsK system using knot theory, low-dimensional topology, and computer simulations.  There is evidence that after being activated by FtsK, the enzymes XerCD unlink DNA in a stepwise manner. The tangle method will be used to find possible topological pathways of DNA unknotting and unlinking by site-specific recombination on small substrates. A computer model of DNA recombination will be developed, adapted to the Xer-FtsK system, and combined with the analytical results to analyze experimental data obtained from the Sherratt lab. The research is highly interdisciplinary and involves close collaboration with groups in Japan, Canada and the UK. Such collaborations will facilitate state-of-the-art student cross-training. Basic information about DNA topology will be disseminated to the general public, including elementary school children and visitors to the California Academy of Sciences. <br/><br/><br/>DNA replication is the basis for biological inheritance. In bacteria, reproduction starts with replication of the chromosome into two identical daughter molecules, followed by segregation of the newly replicated chromosomes and division of the parent cell into two daughter cells. In circular chromosomes, problems of entanglement during DNA linking complicate the process of chromosome segregation. In Escherichia coli, DNA unlinking is typically mediated by the enzyme topoIV, which is an important drug target for quinolone antimicrobial agents. Understanding DNA unlinking by Xer recombination, in addition to providing a more complete picture of the chromosome segregation process, is highly relevant for drug design. Mathematical and computational tools are very useful for studying the action of enzymes that change the topology of DNA. In this project such tools will be used to characterize all unlinking pathways and to reveal the mechanism of unlinking by Xer. The educational goal is to develop new and effective ways to disseminate knowledge related to DNA topology and its biological significance, as well as to increase public awareness of the critical role of mathematics in understanding biological processes. The proposed plans include the creation of Math Circles for elementary school children in San Francisco and the development of a series of educational materials for public consumption in collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences. This will culminate in the production of an exhibit on DNA topology for the general public in the California Academy of Sciences Museum."

In viruses proper self-assembly of the viral proteins and of the packaged genome determine the formation of an infective virus. Two critical and interrelated aspects of this pathway that remain mostly unknown in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses are the packing reaction and the subsequent folding of the DNA genome inside the virus. The aim of this project is to make progress towards a better understanding of such DNA packing and folding under a condensed condition in general. The long-term goal of this project is to provide a detailed quantitative description of the DNA packing and folding processes in dsDNA viruses. There are two specific objectives in the proposal. The first one is to revisit and improve current models of DNA folding in bacteriophages. These models of DNA folding will be tested for knotting using computer simulations. The PIs will determine how closely the knot distributions they generate match the distributions of knots observed experimentally in bacteriophage P4. This information will be used to guide the rejection or modification and improvement of the models. Physical parameters such as the chain flexibility of these improved models will be estimated. Resulting models will be validated by the criterion whether they produce DNA density maps that can be compared to cryoEM data. The second objective is to reconstruct the DNA folding inside bacteriophage P4 using topology and stochastic processes. Data from DNA knots observed experimentally implicates a certain degree of randomness in the DNA packing in bacteriophages. Starting from a completely random model and using the knot distribution from P4 as a guide, the PIs will develop a model that accounts for the knots observed experimentally. This model will be compared against models obtained in the first objective and also against DNA density maps from CryoEM data.<br/><br/><br/>Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses cause a number of human diseases ranging from the common cold to certain cancers. If drugs and vaccines are to be developed to neutralize the effects of these viruses, a better understanding of the self-assembly pathway through which infective viruses are produced and replicated is needed. Results obtained in the laboratory have yielded only partial information. Part of the reason is that because the extreme levels of condensation to which DNA is subjected during packing and replication,  the behavior of the DNA is difficult to detect experimentally. Furthermore, though various models of the process of DNA packing have been proposed, none of these adequately accounts for the experimental data that have been obtained. The PIs will employ mathematical modeling, using a tool called knot theory, to develop and test a more refined theory of DNA packing and folding in dsDNA viruses. Computer simulations based on existing models will be tested against experimental data obtained on bacteriophage P4 to determine which features of the models best predict the experimental results. The aim of this work is to generate a revised model which can more fully account for the experimental data. This work will advance knowledge of DNA folding and packing in viruses and will make an important contribution to the study of chromosome structure and dynamics, leading to a better understanding of biological processes of replication, transcription, segregation and repair. Additionally, this work will advance the mathematical and computational theory of random walks under confinement. Since random walk theory is an important and commonly used tool in other scientific studies dealing with random string like objects (such as long polymer chains), this work can potentially benefit other fields of science as well.  Research tools developed through the project will be made freely available to the scientific community.<br/>"
