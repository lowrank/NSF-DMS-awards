From a mathematical standpoint, the project will start with relatively simple descriptions of interactions among species, such as competition and predation, at small spatial scales, coupled with descriptions of connectivity, the way species move between locations.  The mathematical descriptions will then be expanded to include more detailed and realistic descriptions of interactions among species and underlying environmental changes.  The models will be analyzed to determine both long-term behavior and dynamics.  The mathematical models will then be used to answer important ecological questions focused on how changes in habitat quality and availability and connectivity between different habitats will affect the composition and dynamics of these metacommunities.  This, in turn, will provide information about how human activities that affect habitats and connectivity will affect species composition and dynamics and can provide guidance for both conservation and restoration efforts.  <br/><br/>The mathematical models of metacommunities used will be primarily phrased in discrete time with a time step of one year, both to reflect dynamics in seasonal environments and how data is gathered. The simplest models will focus only on species presence or absence and will be difference equations, so a relatively complete analytical treatment will be possible. Equilibria and their stability can be calculated. The more complex descriptions will all be phrased as integro-difference equations where time is discrete, but the state space is continuous.  The underlying dependent variables will be density functions for the abundance of the species under consideration, and the kernels in the integro-difference equations will describe the underlying ecological dynamics.  Initial analyses will be numerical with the expectation that analytic treatment of conditions for persistence and coexistence will be possible, building on recent mathematical work on integro-difference equations.  To treat changing conditions through time, the kernels will be modified to include explicit time dependence.  The mathematical analyses will then be used to answer the underlying ecological questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motivated by applications in ecology we will consider processes that take place in two and three dimensional space. We will also study processes that take place on random graphs, which provide models for social networks. We will consider the spread of information and of diseases through these structures. In addition we will study of the behavior of evolutionary games, which were introduced many years ago to help understand animal behavior and have recently been used to understand the interactions of different cell types in cancer modeling. Despite the fact that it has been clearly established that spatial structure changes the outcome of evolutionary games, most applications assume homogeneous mixing and use the replicator equation to determine the dynamics. Having a well developed theory that predicts the behavior of spatial games will be useful for applications. Much of this theory has been developed under the assumption of weak selection, so it is important to understand whether the results are valid when selection is not weak.<br/><br/>Work will be carried out on evolutionary games, variants of the voter model, coalescing random walk, and epidemics. These processes will in most cases take place on static random graphs generated by the configuration model in which vertices are assigned i.i.d. degrees, but in one situation we will let the states of an SIS epidemic and the graph co-evolve. The degree heterogeneity of random graphs forces the development of new techniques in order to extend results known on the d-dimensional lattice.  In addition,  new phenomena occur on these structures, such as rigorously provable discontinuous phase transitions. Specific research goals include (i) Study the rate of decay of the density of coalescing random walks on a random graph. (ii) Disprove physicists? claim that the critical infection probability on a finite graph is 1 over the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. (iii) Show that the critical threshold of the SIS is positive if the degree distribution has an exponential tail. (iv) Study SIR and SIS models on evolving graphs where susceptible individuals cut their ties to infected neighbors and rewire to a randomly chosen individual. In the SIR version we want to determine the critical value. In the SIS case we want to show that when the rewiring rate is fixed and the infection rate is varied there is a discontinuous phase transition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of the fluids encountered in everyday life, such as water, gasoline, and honey, are well-understood (Newtonian) fluids, but many of the fluids related to industrial and biological applications are not. Common examples of non-Newtonian fluids include paint, multi-grade engine oils, laundry detergent, pediatric liquid medicines, pulmonary mucus, and cell membranes. A distinguishing feature of non-Newtonian fluids is microscopic structures that can be rearranged significantly during flow and consequently alter behavior over time and between circumstances. The goal of this research is to establish mathematical relationships between microstructural processes and flow properties in soft biological matter. Current advances in microscopy, flow measurement, theory and computation will lead to new models, allowing scientists to design and test next-generation biomaterials and investigate biological flows. Undergraduate and graduate students will not only be able to learn how to design and perform wet-lab experiments, formulate mathematical models and perform high-performance computational simulations, but also have opportunities to closely interact with researchers from mathematics, biology, physics and biomedical sciences. STEM students from the South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation program will be recruited as incoming freshmen to participate in a variety of research and educational activities supported by this project.  A second program, the SC Women in Science Luncheon, will bring together female undergraduate and graduate students for vertically-integrated research presentation, discussion and mentoring.  These educational efforts will have a broad impact on educating the next generation of STEM scientists, preparing them for careers that span the boundaries between different fields. <br/><br/>A distinguishing feature of many non-Newtonian fluids is that they have microscopic or molecular-level structures that can be rearranged significantly in flow and as a consequence alter the macroscopic behavior or performance of the material. This project will focus on power-law rheology, which is ubiquitous in many biological and industrial fields. New mathematical relationships will be established by investigating soft matter both in equilibrium, where thermal fluctuations dominate, and for far-from-equilibrium responses. These relationships will be closely informed by experimental findings and are based on the coupling of stochastic, integro-differential equations and deterministic, fractional partial differential equations. The outcomes of these projects include a new understanding of the relation between macro- and micro-scale dynamics in power-law materials, new classes of linear and nonlinear constitutive equations, analytical results describing non-local quantities using fractional calculus, numerical simulations of fractional models under physiological conditions, and new experimental insights into the microstructure of soft matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Drugs that target microbes (antimicrobials) have saved millions of lives. But, because microbes evolve, over time antimicrobials reduce the population of pathogens that succumb to drugs and leave behind those that do not - a process called selection. Consequently, unbridled use of antimicrobials threatens their long-term efficacy - a concern since the discovery of penicillin in 1928. Today, drug resistance is recognized as a serious problem requiring urgent attention. Differential equations can describe mechanisms that drive changes in living systems; control theory can generate the best strategies to use these mechanisms to achieve a desired goal. These tools will help guide drug development and dosing protocols that balance the immediate benefits of administering antimicrobials with the long-term selection pressure imposed by these drugs. A mathematical framework that is adaptable to different disease systems could inform strategies to reduce the threat of resistant pathogens to global health and the attendant cost to society. Furthermore, this project will provide graduate students at Howard, Texas Tech, Lehigh, and the University of Kentucky, with the opportunity to intern at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, fostering connections outside of academia.  University of Kentucky students will also assist the lead investigator in mentoring high school students through a pilot Saturday Morning Math program that will provide hands-on experience with coding, modeling, and visualization of scientific results.<br/><br/>The investigators aim to construct a general mathematical framework, with vector-borne disease serving as a benchmark example, and build the tools needed to bridge the gap between within-host PK/PD (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) and population-level epidemiology, so that others may readily adapt the framework to their own studies of competing pathogens. The investigators will approach the problem of linking the fast dynamics of PK/PD to the comparatively slow population-level dynamics by introducing serial compartments in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations representing the progression of individuals through stages of treatment characterized by different drug concentrations and different durations. A stochastic sub-model is proposed to parameterize one of the functions that links within-host PK/PD to the population-level dynamics.  The proposed research is important because, to date, no general methods exist to analyze a staged-progression model where the stages have different durations. Such a model could provide results and insights that significantly improve the protocols for drug interventions in a way that mitigates the selection pressure leading to drug resistance. For example, it is unknown how the likely existence of backward bifurcation and the staged-progression approach with heterogeneous stages will interact and influence optimal treatment policy. Furthermore, the proposed parameter estimation, uncertainty, and identifiability analyses will likely lead to challenging mathematical and statistical problems requiring advances of existing methodologies.  <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Mathematical Biology Program and Division of Human Resource Development HBCU-UP.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most obvious is a physical membrane, such as the cell membrane that separates the cytoplasm from its surrounding environment or the nuclear membrane that confines chromosomal DNA within the nucleus. Mechanisms for compartmentalization are essential as they override diffusive smoothing of concentration gradients that would otherwise homogenize cellular contents and fail to allow spatial regulation of critical cellular processes. A recently identified and current intense focus in cell biology is on chemical compartments that form in the absence of physical membranes.  This project focuses on a specific example: the binding of cytoplasmic proteins and RNAs into complexes that form protein-rich droplets by way of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). By bringing together mathematical, computational, and biological scientists, the investigators aim to develop a general computational modeling platform to study cytoplasmic droplets and their spatial distributions that arise from LLPS.  The aim is to understand mechanistically how these compartments establish and preserve cytoplasmic heterogeneity in mRNA localization and expression in live cells, and the molecular species, complexes, and kinetic timescales that are responsible. By applications of this platform to other live cells, there is the potential to understand the essential cell-specific molecular ingredients and chemical kinetics for LLPS, thereby contributing to understanding of the diversity of intracellular compartmentalization across cell biology. <br/><br/>There is a rich history in cell biology of the study of membranes and their role in establishing extracellular and intracellular chemical compartments. Yet, relatively little is known about how molecular proteins, organelles, and chromosomal DNA, within the cytoplasm or within the nucleus, chemically interact and self-organize to create, sustain, and evolve localized chemical and macromolecular compartments in the absence of physical membranes. Armed with resolved spatial and temporal experimental data of primary molecular species and species complexes, the investigators in this project focus on three specific aims.  1. A computational modeling platform to explore the input space of primary molecular (proteins, RNAs, protein-RNA complexes) and microscopic (nuclei, membranes) species, chemical species affinities, and spatial confinement conditions.  This platform will produce a phase diagram of outcomes that mimics live cell data (dynamic self-organization of complexes and molecular species, droplet formation due to liquid-liquid phase separation), and that reveals sufficient ingredients and interactions for membrane-less, intracellular chemical compartments, and their robustness. 2.  By way of coupled stochastic and continuum modeling, conditioning on ex vivo and in vivo experimental data, to discover sufficient molecular species, complexes, and hidden chemical affinities that reproduce the chemical compartmentalization of live cells. 3. To extend numerical tools for multiphase modeling to accommodate strong fluctuations and out-of-equilibrium behavior driven by chemical kinetics, viscoelasticity of droplets, and induced flow by liquid-liquid phase separation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

T cells that express different cell surface receptors (or ""clonotypes"") are produced by the thymus and allow an organism to respond to a broad spectrum of pathogens. How many different surface cell receptors and their total numbers present in the T cell pool are critical quantities that determine an organism's ability to neutralize pathogens. Results of the research have the potential to significantly improve understanding of how the immune repertoire evolves with infections and aging, how it can be more accurately measured, and how it is affected by procedures such as thymic transplantation.  As part of the research the investigators will also foster a series of educational activities involving Cal State-Northridge and UCLA students, including joint seminars, student presentations, and summer projects.<br/><br/>Two representations of counting clonotypes, clone-counts and cell-counts, will be further developed to better measure and quantify the adaptive immune system. Clone-counts describe the number of T cell clonotypes represented by a specific number of cells while cell-counts quantify the number of cells within each clonotype. Mathematical models for T cell populations and T cell diversity typically use one of these two representations and often rely on strong physiological assumptions.  The large number of clonotypes, the constant birth and death of each clonotype, the activation of certain clonotypes upon infection, and the slowing down of thymic output associated with disease and aging all render the quantification and prediction of T cell diversity challenging. By exploiting the mathematical connection between these two representations, the investigators will develop hybrid models of T and B cell components of the immune system applicable under a wider range of physiological conditions.  These hybrid models will be pivotal in extending current models to include important physiological processes such as clonotype proliferation, cellular maturation, and regulation. Finally, hybrid models, both deterministic and stochastic, will facilitate more accurate determination of an organism's immune diversity through small blood samples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fibers are active and release signaling molecules that profoundly affect the brain. However, individual fibers do not have well-defined destinations and appear to be randomly oriented within brain tissue, frequently changing their direction. This property makes them very different from point-to-point nerve connections. Because of the unpredictability of individual fiber trajectories, brain research to date has focused on overall fiber ""densities."" These densities vary across brain regions and have been associated with normal and altered functions of the brain. This research project aims to reveal how local, random-like decisions by individual fibers lead to specific fiber densities in brain regions. The research also intends to determine whether the behavior of the fibers has remained fundamentally the same in the last 250 million years of vertebrate evolution. This conceptually-novel, interdisciplinary approach brings together recent developments in high-resolution microscopy, automated image analysis (including machine learning), and stochastic processes. The causal models developed in the project are expected to provide essential tools for the prediction of fiber densities from the dynamics of single fibers and will lay a theoretical foundation for fiber density manipulations in fundamental and applied neuroscience. The project's data and analyses will be used in a newly created interdisciplinary laboratory course and will also strengthen an undergraduate training program in bio-image informatics. The project naturally brings together neurobiology, engineering, and mathematics; this and its visual appeal make it well-suited for planned STEM-oriented presentations for K-12 students, as well as for public talks. Since serotonergic fibers present unique computational challenges, the project will contribute to the development of image analysis algorithms. The project will also build a rigorous theoretical foundation for the structure of ""diffuse"" neurotransmission that is affected in several mental disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder.<br/><br/>Virtually all neural processes in vertebrate brains take place in a dense matrix of fibers that release serotonin, norepinephrine, and other neurotransmitters. This ancient system originates in the brainstem and is known as the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS). Since ARAS fibers do not form well-defined projections and have extremely meandering trajectories, their current descriptions fall outside the scope of connectomics projects and are based on observed fiber ""densities."" This interdisciplinary project seeks to reconstruct the fundamental self-organizing process that builds and supports the ARAS in the brain. In a radical departure from current descriptive approaches, it hypothesizes that the behavior of single serotonergic fibers can be described by a three-dimensional stochastic process, which determines the resultant fiber density (as an emergent phenomenon). Vertebrate brains, spanning some 250 million years of evolution, will be used to elucidate this process. Single ARAS fibers will be visualized with immunohistochemistry (including tissue expansion) and imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Long fiber trajectories in mice will be visualized using tissue-clearing techniques and whole-brain imaging with light-sheet microscopy. An image analysis algorithm will be developed to automatically detect and trace individual fiber trajectories in the 3D-space. The trajectories will be used to build an optimal stochastic model, by taking advantage of advanced computational methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These diverse applications are united because they all involve the motion of small molecules (such as oxygen). Because the molecules are so small, they move by an inherently random process called diffusion. While theoretical work on diffusion dates back to Einstein and others, the biology driving this project requires significant extensions to the classical theory. In particular, this research will construct a mathematical framework to calculate statistics of diffusion inside a randomly changing environment, and the theoretical results and predictions will be compared to empirical measurements. In addition, this project will train new mathematical biologists since graduate students will be closely involved in the research. Additionally this research and its biological applications will enrich pair of new courses that the PI is developing: a graduate course on applied random processes and a course on probability and statistics for secondary math teachers.<br/><br/>In addition to being widely applicable in biology, diffusion in a random environment is a rich mathematical topic. It has two complementary descriptions, either a randomly switching partial differential equation (PDE) or a randomly switching stochastic differential equation (SDE). In either case, the process combines two layers of randomness interacting across spatial scales: Brownian motion at the particle level and a random environment. Analyzing these processes will require combining tools from disparate areas of mathematics to develop new mathematical machinery. In particular, the dual PDE/SDE representation will allow for the combination of PDE methods and probabilistic tools and elucidate new connections between these fields. Furthermore, the mathematical results will provide the tools needed to model a broad collection of biological systems. These models will in turn (i) transform the understanding of a ubiquitous class of biochemical reactions, (ii) uncover basic properties of an essential neural communication mechanism, and (iii) answer a longstanding and fundamental question in insect physiology.

This project will use mathematical analysis and simulations to study a wide range of snake motions, identify those that move the snake body most efficiently, and understand how they depend on physical parameters and constraints. Snakes lack limbs but can nonetheless move efficiently on land. The research will develop accurate simulations of snake dynamics in the presence of friction and contact forces. Measuring the forces on real snakes performing a wide range of movements is difficult in experiments, so mathematical models and simulations are essential. The research will have broader impacts in the ongoing development of robust snake robots to explore, perform inspections and search-and-rescue operations, and assist internal medical procedures, often in confined and/or hazardous environments.

Optimal motions will be identified under constraints including zero time-averaged body rotation and fixed energy consumption. Optimal motions in the presence of walls and obstacles will be computed using penalty forces preventing penetration of the solid barriers and giving additional frictional interactions. Such sharply varying forces will be computed accurately using adaptive quadrature of frictional and barrier forces in the vicinity of contact. The benefits of passive elasticity, well known for aquatic organisms, will be studied in snakes. Accurate computations of contact forces with the ground will allow for the study of optimal snake motions in three dimensions, accounting for the work done against gravity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whenever biological oscillators interact, they mutually adjust their rhythms, that is, they synchronize. This synchronization needs to be fine-tuned. For example, too much of synchronization between neural cells is associated with motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, too little is associated with impaired cognition. This research project will investigate the mechanisms of how biological oscillators go in and out of synch in time, an important problem that has not been extensively studied. Biological systems are very adaptable to the changes in the environment, and this research will explore associations between adaptability and dynamics of synchrony. The study will utilize mathematical and computational models of neural and other biological oscillators, complemented by the analysis of available experimental data. The project aims to clarify the mechanisms of synchronization in neural and other living systems. Importantly, this will not only assist in understanding of healthy normal functioning of biological oscillators, but will also advance understanding of mechanisms of pathologies -- much-needed knowledge for the treatments of several brain disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease, addiction, and schizophrenia) and other pathological conditions. In addition, young scholars will be engaged in this research and will get critical experience in biomathematics, contributing to the preparation of a modern workforce able to tackle life sciences questions with mathematical techniques.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, oscillations and synchrony are recognized as important mechanisms underlying many physiological phenomena, in particular neural ones. Excessively strong or weak synchrony is associated with several neurological and neuropsychiatric dysfunctions. Neural synchrony frequently varies in time. Few long-desynchronized dynamics intervals may be functionally different from many short desynchronizations, although the average synchrony may be the same. Recent studies of different neural systems reported the strong prevalence of short desynchronizations. This research will explore the nature and function of these short desynchronizations in neural systems and analyze temporal patterning of synchrony in other living systems. Several questions will be answered: What are the mechanisms of short desynchronizations in neural systems? What function do they serve? What changes in the patterning of synchrony may lead to what dysfunctions? What are the differences in the temporal patterning of synchrony in neural and non-neural living systems? Mathematical techniques will explain how the patterning of synchrony contributes to the adaptability and efficiency of living systems. From a mathematical standpoint, the project will advance understanding of how some experimentally-relevant universal dynamics may emerge in a class of moderately-coupled neural-like oscillators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some regions, VBDs, such as malaria and dengue, have resurged where previous elimination campaigns have waned. In other places, the novel introduction and spread of vectors and pathogens, for example the Asian citrus psyllid and with it huanglongbing (citrus greening), is occurring due to human facilitated introductions (long distance travel events, shipping containers, etc.). Transmission of VBDs is complex. The patterns of transmission that we observe are determined by interactions between vectors, pathogens, hosts, and their environment. Most disease vectors are small arthropods; they are sensitive to environmental conditions, such as temperature or rainfall. It is vitally important to understand how these factors and conditions affect the dynamics of the vectors in order to better inform strategies for monitoring and mitigation of VBDs. This CAREER project will further a general understanding of how environmentally-mediated traits of vectors (e.g. longevity and fecundity) interact with environmental factors to impact the transmission of VBDs. Improved quantitative methods will be developed for predicting when and where transmission will occur and for estimation of the uncertainty in these predictions.  <br/><br/>This CAREER project addresses three main questions: (1) How do we quantify and model the impacts of environmental drivers on multiple correlated traits of vectors and thus on VBD transmission dynamics? (2) How can we link mechanistic or model-based measures of transmission with statistical models of incidence/transmission to improve predictions of when and where VBD transmission or emergence may occur? (3) How can we integrate multiple sources of uncertainty into our models/predictions and how can we communicate this uncertainty in a way that is useful for decision making? The PI will tackle these questions with a trait-based framework, initially focusing on two very different but data rich study systems, dengue and huanglongbing. More specifically, mechanistic mathematical models that include details on environmentally mediated vector traits, including trait correlation and heterogeneity, will first be developed.  These models will be parameterized and validated with data from open data repositories using a Bayesian approach. Methods and tools will be developed for validating these models, for properly quantifying sources and types of uncertainty, and for testing interventions and making policy decisions under uncertainty. Through an integrated approach to statistical training and collaboration with current researchers in the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), the project will improve the quantitative and statistical capabilities of future researchers and public health officials and policy makers. In particular, the work will include: a) Development of tools and training materials for VDH employees to use cutting edge modeling techniques; b) Training and experience for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in public health collaboration through interactions with the VDH; c) Training of undergraduate biologists in statistics through a revitalized Biological Statistics course at Virginia Tech; d) Undergraduate research experience in quantitative biology with a focus on VBDs; e) Training of graduate students in teaching and mentoring through a seminar course on statistics pedagogy and through opportunities to co-mentor undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The spread of invasive species is a major problem in spatial ecology, and there is a large body of literature on understanding this spread. However, there is far less work on the actual eradication and control of invasive species once invasion has occurred. Currently, there are only a few conclusive eradication measures for aquatic invasive species. The Trojan Y-Chromosome (TYC) strategy is an eradication strategy with the advantage of targeting only the invasive species in question, while protecting native species. The PIs will develop an experimentally tested mathematical model of the TYC strategy. The computational and theoretical analysis of the mathematical model will inform experimental biologists about the viability of the TYC strategy and provide crucial insight into the spatial-temporal population dynamics associated with the TYC strategy and other phenomena associated with such control efforts. Ultimately results of the project will guide experimental research at the USGS Wetland and Aquatic Research Center in Gainesville, Florida.<br/><br/>The TYC strategy is a biological control that introduces a sub-population of genetically modified males with YY chromosomes in order that their offspring are guaranteed to be male. The object of the introduction is to skew the sex ratio in the invasive population to be strongly male biased, driving down the female population density, and ultimately leading to extinction. In developing Peocilia reticulata (guppy fish) YY-males in the laboratory, mesocosm experiments can be conducted that examine the interaction, dynamics, fecundity, and viability of the TYC strategy. The experimental data will then be used to develop the relevant parameter space and refine, verify, and validate reaction diffusion models of the TYC strategy. In addition, numerical designs and implementation procedures will be developed to provide a reliable platform to efficiently simulate the system of partial differential equations that incorporate features such as cross and self-diffusion, non-smooth initial datum, temperature effects and life history traits such as cannibalism. This research and its results will advance our understanding of the use of flexible and reversible passive efforts to eradicate and control invasive species, as modeled via both weakly coupled and strongly coupled reaction diffusion systems."

These methods are needed to help tumor biologists gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of the processes (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and migration) involved in tumor development, at the scales which influence their behavior. Because of this complexity, it has been challenging to functionally link cell and tissue scale processes, the knowledge of which is key to development of predictive multiscale tumor models. However, current models typically use ad-hoc rules to bridge between scales, which limits their predictive capability. This project will address this challenge by developing a new multiscale method where directly measurable quantities at the cell-scale inform the model parameters at the continuum tissue scale through rigorous, mathematical upscaling techniques. The multiscale model will be tested and validated by comparing simulation results against experimentally obtained information about the overall growth rates and spatiotemporal behaviors of the different cells and tumors. The new multiscale method will be used to study pancreatic tumors to elucidate the transition of pancreatic lesions into invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By integrating patient data analysis with quantitative tumor modeling, the project will develop reliable methods that can predict the likelihood of pancreatic cyst progression to PDAC using relatively non-invasive approaches. <br/><br/>The project team will develop a new class of multiscale models that bridge these scales non-phenomenologically through application of rigorous upscaling techniques in order to close the continuum equations at the tissue scale and provide an accurate description of the processes across both cell and tissue scales. Specifically, stochastic agent-based models at the cell-scale and continuum partial differential equation models at the tissue-scale will be developed. Consistent functional relationships between the variables at the tissue-scale and measurements at the cell-scale will be found by upscaling the discrete models by using and extending the framework of dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) to obtain multi-cell scale continuum equations that account for correlations among cells as well as biological processes such cell birth and death. Further upscaling to the tissue scale will be done by identifying and deriving equations for slowly varying variables. The consistency of the different models in domains where the scales overlap will be tested and validated. The new multiscale method will be applied to model the progression of pancreatic neoplasms into invasive carcinomas in order to estimate the probability of this progression. Large-scale human patient datasets of pancreatic lesions, provided by our consultants through a separately funded project, will be used to validate and refine the models. The project will enhance the cross disciplinary training of students."

Drugs that target microbes (antimicrobials) have saved millions of lives. But, because microbes evolve, over time antimicrobials reduce the population of pathogens that succumb to drugs and leave behind those that do not - a process called selection. Consequently, unbridled use of antimicrobials threatens their long-term efficacy - a concern since the discovery of penicillin in 1928. Today, drug resistance is recognized as a serious problem requiring urgent attention. Differential equations can describe mechanisms that drive changes in living systems; control theory can generate the best strategies to use these mechanisms to achieve a desired goal. These tools will help guide drug development and dosing protocols that balance the immediate benefits of administering antimicrobials with the long-term selection pressure imposed by these drugs. A mathematical framework that is adaptable to different disease systems could inform strategies to reduce the threat of resistant pathogens to global health and the attendant cost to society.

The investigators will approach the problem of linking the fast dynamics of PK/PD to the comparatively slow population-level dynamics by introducing serial compartments in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations representing the progression of individuals through stages of treatment characterized by different drug concentrations and different durations. A stochastic sub-model is proposed to parameterize one of the functions that links within-host PK/PD to the population-level dynamics.  The proposed research is important because, to date, no general methods exist to analyze a staged-progression model where the stages have different durations. Such a model could provide results and insights that significantly improve the protocols for drug interventions in a way that mitigates the selection pressure leading to drug resistance. For example, it is unknown how the likely existence of backward bifurcation and the staged-progression approach with heterogeneous stages will interact and influence optimal treatment policy.

Specifically, how do cells rearrange themselves to go from a symmetric object like a round egg cell into an asymmetric object like a nerve cell? Experiments will be performed on budding yeast which can switch from a sphere to an asymmetric projection shape by localizing components to one end, a process termed cell polarization. Examples of polarization include immune cell activation, tumor cell metastasis, and yeast infections in which yeast cells invade human tissue by polarized cell growth. Fungal infections are increasing in prevalence in the U.S. Insights can help researchers discover treatments to halt the invasive growth of yeast infections. The research will investigate the spatial distribution of cellular proteins during polarization using a combination of mathematical modeling and microscopy imaging. Experimental data can be compared to computer simulation data to confirm the models and adjust the model parameters. An important methodological advance will be replacing the model, which can take significant time to run, with a simpler polynomial surrogate model which can be calculated very quickly resulting in a dramatic computational speed-up. Through this process one obtains models that can reproduce and predict the behavior of polarizing cells. In addition, the research will be integrated with outreach activities training graduate, undergraduate, and high school students on how to perform quantitative microscopy experiments and simulate mathematical models.<br/><br/>Cell polarity and morphology define the form and function of individual and groups of cells. A systems biology approach will delve into this subject at a more quantitative level moving beyond arrow diagrams to characterize the spatial dynamics of cell polarity. The investigation will take advantage of the experimental tractability of budding yeast to characterize two classic cell polarity morphologies: the bud and the mating projection. More specifically, the investigation will use microscopy to visualize the spatial dynamics of polarization proteins and process the images into quantitative data. In parallel, a collection of mathematical models of budding and mating projection growth will be constructed based on biological hypotheses. Methodologically, one of the grand challenges of systems biology is to estimate the models/parameters using large datasets. Bayesian inference will be used to select the best models and estimate the parameters based on the experimental data. A central concept in this proposal will be applying techniques from uncertainty quantification (UQ) that replace model evaluations in the Monte Carlo method with a surrogate polynomial function, resulting in a dramatic speed-up of the uncertainty analysis. The combined result will be a systematic investigation of cell polarity leading to model predictions that will be tested by experiments converting one cellular morphology into the other.

The dynamics of virus and immune response within an infected host can be viewed as a complex ecosystem.  During HIV infection, an extensive repertoire of immune cells target the virus, while HIV can rapidly evolve resistance to multiple immune responses.   The ensuing battle precipitates a dynamic network of interacting viral strains and immune response variants.   Understanding the main factors shaping viral resistance pathways and immune dynamics is crucial for designing effective vaccines and immunotherapies.  Mathematical modeling can help elucidate patterns of viral escape from immune attack, however overall system complexity challenges the analysis of such models.  This project develops mathematical models and analytical techniques for understanding the dynamics of multiple virus and immune response populations within infected hosts.  This research uses dynamical systems and computational methods to characterize persistent structures of the evolving virus-immune response network.   Potential HIV vaccine and treatment strategies will be investigated utilizing the mathematical models.  Furthermore, the models will be connected to Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) data in collaboration with biologists.   Also significant are the educational impacts arising from the interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in this research project.<br/><br/>Rapidly evolving pathogens, such as SIV and HIV, can evade the host immune responses via mutations at several targeted epitopes (viral proteins).  The concurrent interaction of diverse virus and immune populations necessitate considering a complex system in order to understand viral escape at multiple epitopes.  This project develops and analyzes mathematical models for virus and immune response variants interacting in a network.  Stability and persistence of viral/immune populations will be characterized in terms of threshold quantities and the structure of the underlying interaction network.   An important question is to determine what mechanisms cause the virus to win this battle in most drug-naive HIV infected patients, and alternatively what leads to long-term viral control in a small percentage of drug-naive HIV infected individuals known as Elite Controllers.  Results from the differential equation models and stochastic counterparts will inform upon viral escape of immune response at multiple epitopes, along with the more complex scenario of virus-antibody coevolution.   From a broader perspective, the methods will be applicable to other predator-prey ecological networks, for example phage-bacteria communities.  Extensions relevant to HIV biology, such as incorporating heterogeneous immune recognition kinetics during the infected cell lifecycle, latent cell infection and different vaccine/immunotherapy strategies, will be investigated.

Properties of the absorption inverse will be studied, and analytical tools developed for understanding disease dynamics on networks with heterogeneous node dynamics.  Biological contributions will include insight into basic questions such as how node dynamics affect core groups and community structure, and how the distribution of core groups within a network affect disease prevalence and outbreak size.

Results of the research have the potential to significantly improve understanding of how the immune repertoire evolves with infections and aging, how it can be more accurately measured, and how it is affected by procedures such as thymic transplantation.  As part of the research the investigators will also foster a series of educational activities involving Cal State-Northridge and UCLA students, including joint seminars, student presentations, and summer projects.<br/><br/>Two representations of counting clonotypes, clone-counts and cell-counts, will be further developed to better measure and quantify the adaptive immune system.

Mathematical models for T cell populations and T cell diversity typically use one of these two representations and often rely on strong physiological assumptions.  The large number of clonotypes, the constant birth and death of each clonotype, the activation of certain clonotypes upon infection, and the slowing down of thymic output associated with disease and aging all render the quantification and prediction of T cell diversity challenging. By exploiting the mathematical connection between these two representations, the investigators will develop hybrid models of T and B cell components of the immune system applicable under a wider range of physiological conditions.

One notoriously difficult problem in evolutionary simulations is the coexistence of very large and very small populations. This is a common occurrence, because random mutations give rise to relatively small clones, which could play an important role in evolution. For example, these small clones could at some later time harbor further mutations that lead to the formation of a 'super-mutant,' which eventually takes over the population. It is the simulation of such scenarios that presents serious computational problems, because the larger the overall population, the slower the computational process. In many realistic scenarios, further complications arise from spatial constraints. Examples include solid tumors and biofilms--bacterial communities with complex spatial structures, implicated both in public health and in industry. To illustrate application of the computational techniques, the optimization of melanoma (skin cancer) treatment will be studied in the presence of resistant mutants that have developed 'addiction' to the drug. Mathematics can guide how the on/off periods of therapy need to be timed to contain resistance. Similar considerations apply to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Complementing the research will be efforts to introduce under-represented minority high-school students to the process of scientific inquiry through a summer school, with the opportunity to work on projects in computational biology. <br/><br/>At the center of enhancing computational speed is the development of a versatile technique capable of efficiently simulating large heterogeneous stochastic populations. Spatial agent-based models of cellular growth will be considered that are common to a wide variety of ecological and evolutionary modeling endeavors. They take into account the processes of cell division and death, as well as mutations and spatial interactions. Deterministic (PDE) approximations of such spatial, stochastic processes generally do not yield accurate time series. In this project, first, deterministic representations of the agent-based models will be constructed by deriving the stochastic master equation of the agent-based model and using the moment closure techniques. This step will provide a fundamental correction to equations based on mean-field behavior. Then, a spatial hybrid stochastic-deterministic algorithm will be developed. The main problem is the 'stiffness' of typical evolutionary systems, resulting from the existence of small, fluctuating populations that can be essential to the final outcome. In traditional methods, this leads to a dramatic decrease of the step size for large populations. Here, a solution to this problem is proposed, by dynamically partitioning the population into small and large subpopulations, with the assumptions that large subpopulations are well described by deterministic laws and are decoupled from the influence of small subpopulations, while the stochasticity of small subpopulations is preserved (and the large populations still affect their dynamics). These approaches will enable simulation of evolutionary processes in large, multi-component, spatially structured evolutionary processes at manageable speeds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RNA, a single-strand molecule derived from DNA, is essential in various biological roles. Besides converting the information stored in DNA into proteins, some RNAs control vital cell processes. RNA chains must fold into specific shapes to serve these roles. However, despite the series of refinements to the commonly-used energy model for predicting RNA structure, the accuracy of folding predictions for longer RNA sequences is not satisfying.  This project will use geometric combinatorics to gain insights into the stability and accuracy of predictions from the current energy model. Addressing these biologically relevant questions leads to important mathematical problems which intersect with active research areas in polyhedral geometry and discrete optimization. Results from this project will be used to improve software predicting RNA folding and assist molecular biologists studying RNA function. Additionally, as part of the project, the investigators will train graduate and undergraduate students in research at the interface of mathematics and biology.<br/><br/>This research will advance biological understanding and mathematical knowledge within the developing field of discrete mathematical biology at the juncture between geometric combinatorics and molecular biology. The affine energy function which governs the entropic cost of branching is a known shortcoming of the current nearest neighbor thermodynamic model. However, this coarse approximation to biochemical reality, which is highly constrained by computational efficiency, is well-suited to mathematical modeling and analysis. Methods from geometric combinatorics (polytopes and their normal fans) will be used to give the first parametric analysis of the branching of biological RNA sequences.  Biologically relevant questions, including the accuracy and stability of the current branching parameters in thermodynamic optimization methods for RNA secondary structure prediction, will be addressed using methods from geometric combinatorics. The similarities and differences of these RNA branching polytopes will then be delineated by addressing the challenges of characterization, comparison, and approximation.  This will provide new insight into the inability of current prediction methods to distinguish native branching characteristics from the large number of suboptimal structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The energy computation for characterizing such interactions is complex because the structures of biomolecules are not completely fixed or rigid, and the surrounding water molecules are also in constant motion. Thus, to deliver quantities that are comparable with experimentally-measurable energies, one must account for these conformational changes in the corresponding mathematical description.  A new theoretical model will be formulated in this project by combining appropriate biophysical considerations with mathematical advances, allowing simulations to mimic the effect of conformational changes in both macromolecule and water atoms. The proposed mathematical development will benefit researchers in molecular biosciences and biophysics. Moreover, the proposed models and algorithms will be implemented in DelPhi, which is distributed free of charge to academic users, to ensure extensive usage by practitioners from mathematics, chemistry, physics, and biology. In addition, this project will provide interdisciplinary research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in biological modeling, computation and mathematical analysis.<br/><br/>Experimentally-observable solvation energies are ensemble averaged. However, direct Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations of such energies require the generation of a representative ensemble of structures in terms of thousands of snapshots, which is computationally very expensive. Tremendous savings in computational time can be achieved if one can calculate the ensemble average solvation energy by employing a single structure by mimicking the effect of conformation changes of macromolecules via heterogeneous dielectric distributions.  In this project, a novel super-Gaussian PB model will be formulated embodying three key innovations: (1) incorporation of environment-dependent atomic characteristics of macromolecules within the continuum electrostatic partial differential equation (PDE); (2) development of a novel, regularized formulation to treat singular charges, with new elliptic PDEs developed through rigorous mathematical analysis: partial charges and water molecules (inside cavities, bonded to the protein, and in bulk solvent) will no longer be modeled as homogeneous spatial regions as in the current Gaussian model, but will reflect the flexibility of the entire solute-solvent system; and (3) elimination of the need to determine a sharp molecular surface, for macromolecules in both vacuum and water environments.  Model benchmarking and biological applications tests will be carried out for validation, and the resulting tool will be incorporated into the widely-used DelPhi program package for computing ensemble-average solvation energies.

The computational tool and the methodology developed in this project can also be used efficiently in a wide range of physical and biological problems. For the educational component, this project will provide an excellent research and outreach platform for promoting female and under-represented groups in Science, Technology,  Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields in a range of educational levels from middle school to young researchers post graduate school. These activities include (1) introducing a heart function module in a summer outreach program to expose middle school girls to science and engineering, (2) providing research opportunities for undergraduate students from primarily undergraduate institutions to promote the students' engagement in scientific studies, and (3) organizing an annual high-performance computing (HPC) workshop and a multiscale/multiphysics modeling topical workshop to promote the participation of female students and researchers in the areas of applied mathematics and scientific computing.<br/><br/>Technically, a central theme of the research component is the development of a computational approach which models the physically realistic process of heart valve degradation under long-term cyclic hemodynamic loading with the objective of understanding tissue fatigue mechanisms. Emphasis will be placed on modeling the fiber-level tissue damage induced by cyclic hemodynamic loading and its long-term progression. Specifically, the computational domain is composed of three subregions: the fluid (blood) simulated as incompressible Newtonian flow, the fracture thin structure (damaged heart valves) modeled by the nonlocal peridynamic shell theory, and the thin structure (undamaged heart valves and aortic walls) described by a classical hyperelastic shell model.

Autoimmune, immunodeficient diseases and cancer arise from a failure of this mechanism. The basic principles of how T cells efficiently discriminate between rare foreign cells and abundant host cells is not completely understood. This project will develop a new generation of theoretical and computational tools to massively accelerate the random sampling of T cell activation times. Working with experimental collaborators, the project will explore (through mathematical modeling, stochastic analysis and large scale computational simulations) the role that the cell-to-cell contact topography plays in immune recognition. This award will support undergraduate and graduate student researchers to work on this project. This project will reach the broader mathematical community through mini-symposia at upcoming conferences and thematic workshops hosted by the American Mathematical Society.<br/><br/>When T cells encounter a cell of interest, they scan its surface for rare diffusing signaling molecules. This search is conducted in a bustling and noisy environment and so T cell activation is a stochastic process described mathematically as a first passage problem. Previous mathematical models of this process assumed the interface between the cells was large and contiguous. Recent experimental work has revealed that T cells extend numerous finger-like projections called microvilli to sculpt a highly transient and distributed interface. This project will build new models of T cell activation that incorporate the recently discovered role of stochastic topography arising from microvilli sampling. Much existing first passage theory has focused on determination of the mean of the distribution. Owing to the sensitivity of T cell activation, this project will require the development of new probabilistic tools to obtain the full distribution of passage times in a variety of narrow escape problems. To complement these theoretical results, the proposal will develop a new suite of computational (deterministic and Monte-Carlo) tools for studying stochastic processes in dynamic and heterogeneous environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Paradoxically, very little is known about these processes due to the extreme density and pressure conditions that the DNA is subject to inside the virus. In the proposed research, the investigators will combine experimental work and the theory of liquid crystals to determine the properties and organization of the DNA molecule inside bacteriophages and of its release.

In the proposed project, the investigators will first build a mechanical model determined by an energy function that incorporates information from cryo-EM data, information from semiflexible polymers, results from Onsager theory of lyotropic liquid crystals and parameters from experiments on chromonic liquid crystals. Next, they will extend their mechanical model by including polyelectrolyte gel features, acknowledging the presence of water with many types of ions and their interaction with the negative charge of the DNA molecule. Third, the investigators will develop models of delivery of genomes with different biophysical properties.

However, mathematical models of such systems become high-dimensional and contain many parameters that need to be determined from existing data. Their mathematical analysis is also not straightforward. As a study system, two Daphnia hosts (waterflea) and four of their pathogens will be considered. The two hosts also act as competitors for food resources and are subject to predation. Hence, they consist a suitable eco-epidemiological system for the development of new models and techniques.

Experiments will be performed on budding yeast which can switch from a sphere to an asymmetric projection shape by localizing components to one end, a process termed cell polarization. Examples of polarization include immune cell activation, tumor cell metastasis, and yeast infections in which yeast cells invade human tissue by polarized cell growth. Fungal infections are increasing in prevalence in the U.S. Insights can help researchers discover treatments to halt the invasive growth of yeast infections. The research will investigate the spatial distribution of cellular proteins during polarization using a combination of mathematical modeling and microscopy imaging. Experimental data can be compared to computer simulation data to confirm the models and adjust the model parameters. An important methodological advance will be replacing the model, which can take significant time to run, with a simpler polynomial surrogate model which can be calculated very quickly resulting in a dramatic computational speed-up.

Knowing the entire wiring diagram is not necessary for understanding the fate of individual nutrients, but the many interconnected circuits make it difficult to isolate only the part of the diagram important for certain activities, such as maintaining iron levels.

While rods detect white light, cones are designed for color vision. Their role is crucial in high acuity vision as underscored by their loss in age-related macular degeneration leading to blindness.  A common feature of these cells is their intricate geometrical structure, consisting of about one thousand thin pancake-like folds (discs) through which light is transformed into electrical pulses (phototransduction) for the brain to ""see.""  Light is captured by receptors/pigments residing on these folds, and transformed into a current between interior and exterior of these cells, by a cascade of biochemical steps. These steps involve amplifiers of the light signal (transducers and effectors) and carriers of the signal (second messengers) diffusing within these folds. A mathematical understanding of these processes is complicated by the numbers of these folds (about one thousand) and their thickness (a few nanometers). The mathematical theory of homogenization seeks to replace the complex geometry with a simpler, cylindrical structure while preserving all the biochemical and biophysical functions of the original system. The transduction cascade must be reliable/stable for consistency of visual perception, and sources of instability and stabilizing mechanisms in the cascade can be broken down and analyzed via mathematical modeling.  This interdisciplinary investigation involves mathematics (homogenization), computational sciences (finite element code writing), biochemistry (activation/deactivation cascades), and physiology (diffusion of second messengers). The project involves students and postdoctoral trainees and will be disseminated through training courses and seminars. This research is funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Mathematical Biology Program and the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program.  <br/><br/>Cones capture light in the red, blue and green wavelength, and as such, besides their geometrical shape, their biochemical and biophysical functions are different than rods. In particular they never saturate, they have a faster and smaller response, they are little sensitive to dim light and have a faster deactivation.  The photoresponse is generated by diffusion of the second messengers calcium and CGMP in the cytoplasm within the lipidic discs. To overcame the intricate geometry of the discs (about a thousand, each a few nanometers thick) we propose an homogenization process, by which the number of discs goes to infinity and their thickness goes to zero, while  the volume available for diffusion remains unchanged, and the biochemical and biophysical functions are preserved in the limit.  The limiting ""homogenized"" cone becomes cylinder-like, with no discs, and the diffusion process is separated into interior and boundary diffusion on the homogenized domain. The activation/deactivation process is modeled by a continuous-time Markov chain tracking the various steps of the cascade. The resulting model is hybrid as it contains a deterministic part (homogenized diffusion of the second messengers) with a random input (stochastic steps of the  activation/deactivation cascade). This permits one to analyze the mechanism by which random deactivation events turn into a stable photoresponse, and identify the causes of variability and variability suppression. A database of parameters will be created to populate the model and effect numerical simulations to be compared with experimental data, including lack of saturation, low sensitivity and faster deactivation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An interface is a transition between regions in a system, each exhibiting different biological properties. The natural world displays a vast gallery of organized systems characterized by complex interface dynamics, including the edges of growing tumors or bacterial colonies, the surface of a growing, hollow embryo, or the transition region between high and low electrical activity in a beating heart. This project will investigate biological systems that involve interfaces with interactions on long length-scales; the behaviors of these interfaces have properties which cannot be predicted by purely local dynamics, as when a bubble popping far away allows other bubbles to grow. The new tools developed will be validated through experimentation with bacterial biofilms and human organoids.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the research at both California State University-Long Beach and Montana State University, and Native American students will be recruited using collaborative outreach programs in existence at Montana State University.<br/><br/>The investigation will focus on studying complex systems characterized by a collection of mutually interacting curves or surfaces. These nonlocal mutual interactions can produce a variety of pattern forming behaviors that typically do not occur in classical interfacial models. For example, nonlocal interfacial models exhibit arrested fronts, which are stationary, dynamically stable interfaces between quasi-homogeneous regions in a complex system. The interactions between certain strains of bacteria provide a concrete instance of such fronts. The evolution of genetically identical sibling colonies lead to competition between these colonies, and this competition produces a collection of mutually interacting interfaces (i.e. the boundary of each colony) that eventually arrest in regions of sibling-sibling competition. The project will introduce a first-principle modeling framework for nonlocal interfaces that offers reduced model complexity from both an analytical and computational perspective. Despite the relative simplicity of this framework, its specific instances still capture the essential pattern forming mechanisms in a variety of biological systems. As a consequence, research under the award will focus on validating this overall approach via experimental predictions in several biological systems. This approach to understanding nonlocal pattern formation appears new at the level of generality introduced in the project, and it opens the door to numerous explorations of the mathematical behavior of the framework and of its applications for different experimental systems. The major aim is to provide researchers with a comparatively flexible, minimalistic framework to study arrested fronts and other interfacial phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to develop strains of double stranded (ds) DNA bacteriophages that can be efficiently used in nanotechnology and for treatment of bacterial infections, a detailed mathematical and biophysical characterization of the packing and delivery of the viral genome is required. Paradoxically, very little is known about these processes due to the extreme density and pressure conditions that the DNA is subject to inside the virus. In the proposed research, the investigators will combine experimental work and the theory of liquid crystals to determine the properties and organization of the DNA molecule inside bacteriophages and of its release. The project will establish a firm theoretical framework for genome delivery in nano-technological applications. In particular, it will produce the first analytical model describing the liquid crystalline phase of DNA in confinement. Two postdoctoral fellows and at least two graduate students will be trained each year. Results and materials will be broadly disseminated, through open access as well as standard journals and conference presentations. Materials developed in this project will be presented at the UC Davis program for high school students COSMOS. Collaborations and contacts with device development laboratories will be established.<br/><br/>The overarching hypothesis of the project is that the DNA molecule inside the viral capsid forms a hexagonal chromonic liquid crystal phase for which mathematical models are lacking. In the proposed project, the investigators will first build a mechanical model determined by an energy function that incorporates information from cryo-EM data, information from semiflexible polymers, results from Onsager theory of lyotropic liquid crystals and parameters from experiments on chromonic liquid crystals. Next, they will extend their mechanical model by including polyelectrolyte gel features, acknowledging the presence of water with many types of ions and their interaction with the negative charge of the DNA molecule. Third, the investigators will develop models of delivery of genomes with different biophysical properties. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that defects in the DNA liquid crystalline ordering are manifested as knots and DNA kinks. The proposed mathematical and computational models will be, both, guided and validated by multiple experimental techniques including cryo-EM, topological analysis, estimation of osmotic pressures and delivery of DNA sequences.

For example, at the cellular level, persistence in gene and protein networks plays a key role in the establishment of homeostasis, which is the ability of the cell to regulate key variables, so that internal conditions remain relatively constant. At the intracellular level, the nodes of these interaction networks could be signaling molecules, genes, and gene products; at the ecosystem level, the nodes could be the various species and energy resources. In this project, the investigator aims to create algorithms that implement mathematical methods for analyzing persistence, which will allow biologists and biomedical scientists to investigate persistence properties of diverse biological networks of interest. Many diseases involve a disturbance of homeostasis in specific types of cells, which corresponds to a loss of persistence in the associated interaction networks. A more complete characterization of persistent systems will improve our understanding of these diseases. <br/><br/>Persistence and permanence refer to the capacity of a system to maintain all its variables within some fixed limits in a robust way; they are among the key features of biological interaction networks. In understanding the role played by specific biological interactions (for example, the role of a signaling pathway in a cell, or the effect of introducing a foreign species in an ecosystem), there are often difficulties in interpreting the effect of positive and negative feedbacks, nonlinear interactions, and other complex signaling between the nodes of the network. These difficulties are due to the inherent complexity of the dynamics of nonlinear systems. This project analyzes persistence as a fundamental theoretical concept that traverses levels of biological complexity and aims to develop mathematical and computational tools to understand persistence in general biological interaction networks. As a concrete step in that direction, the investigator will focus on biochemical networks, with the aim to provide mathematical tools for drawing precise connections between the structure of a reaction network and the persistence properties of its associated dynamical system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will provide mathematical tools needed to understand and then harness the emerging complexity of synthetic biocircuits. A particular focus will be circuits wherein rare events play a crucial role as biological switches.

Motivation arises from the need to understand the dynamics of genetic regulatory networks to inform the design of novel synthetic biocircuits. In many cases, the essential function of such a network involves rare events -- be they transitions between metastable states or sudden bursts of activity. Since proteins serve as regulators, transcriptional delay (the time from transcription initiation to the formation of functional protein) is intrinsic to genetic regulatory networks and has been shown to dramatically affect network dynamics. Mathematically, large deviations theories allow for rare event quantification. What is the most likely transition pathway between one metastable state and another? How often do rare events occur? Large deviations theories can answer such questions, both theoretically and computationally. This project aims to develop a comprehensive theoretical and computational large deviations framework for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with delay, particularly the nonlinear delay stochastic differential equations that model genetic regulatory networks. Synthetic biologists have recently focused on building genetic regulatory networks within synthetic microbial consortia. This distributed approach offers modularity and the potential to build ever more complex biocircuits. However, the resultant dynamics are quite complex, as consortia feature spatiotemporal dynamics, cell cycle effects, chemical signaling, population-level effects, and mechano-sensing. This project aims to build a large deviations theory for spatiotemporal delay systems, including microbial consortia. The investigators have been developing a multi-scale platform for the simulation of consortia dynamics within microfluidic environments, which will provide simulational support for the study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The energy computation for characterizing such interactions is complex because the structures of biomolecules are not completely fixed or rigid, and the surrounding water molecules are also in constant motion. Thus, to deliver quantities that are comparable with experimentally-measurable energies, one must account for these conformational changes in the corresponding mathematical description.  A new theoretical model will be formulated in this project by combining appropriate biophysical considerations with mathematical advances, allowing simulations to mimic the effect of conformational changes in both macromolecule and water atoms. The proposed mathematical development will benefit researchers in molecular biosciences and biophysics. Moreover, the proposed models and algorithms will be implemented in DelPhi, which is distributed free of charge to academic users, to ensure extensive usage by practitioners from mathematics, chemistry, physics, and biology. In addition, this project will provide interdisciplinary research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in biological modeling, computation and mathematical analysis.<br/><br/>Experimentally-observable solvation energies are ensemble averaged. However, direct Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations of such energies require the generation of a representative ensemble of structures in terms of thousands of snapshots, which is computationally very expensive. Tremendous savings in computational time can be achieved if one can calculate the ensemble average solvation energy by employing a single structure by mimicking the effect of conformation changes of macromolecules via heterogeneous dielectric distributions.  In this project, a novel super-Gaussian PB model will be formulated embodying three key innovations: (1) incorporation of environment-dependent atomic characteristics of macromolecules within the continuum electrostatic partial differential equation (PDE); (2) development of a novel, regularized formulation to treat singular charges, with new elliptic PDEs developed through rigorous mathematical analysis: partial charges and water molecules (inside cavities, bonded to the protein, and in bulk solvent) will no longer be modeled as homogeneous spatial regions as in the current Gaussian model, but will reflect the flexibility of the entire solute-solvent system; and (3) elimination of the need to determine a sharp molecular surface, for macromolecules in both vacuum and water environments.  Model benchmarking and biological applications tests will be carried out for validation, and the resulting tool will be incorporated into the widely-used DelPhi program package for computing ensemble-average solvation energies.

Such disturbances can have profound impacts on the structure of ecological communities (e.g. species diversity and abundance) and on the ecosystem services that those communities provide. Given the potential significance of such changes for human well-being, it is essential that we develop effective tools to predict these ecological and ecosystem impacts. Traditionally, the study of the resilience of ecological communities to severe environmental perturbations (e.g. hurricanes, floods) has focused on ecological processes. However, there is mounting evidence that feedbacks between the ecological and evolutionary processes (eco-evolutionary feedbacks) occur over commensurate time scales. This raises the possibility that evolutionary processes may play an important role in community resilience and species persistence. This project tackles the challenges posed by this possibility by developing a mathematical framework for analyzing models of disturbance which account for eco-evolutionary feedbacks and applying this framework to two real world systems whose properties have not been synthetically treated. In addition, this project will also support multiple outreach activities to K-12 education. <br/><br/>The investigators will develop new analytical methods models accounting for environmental stochasticity, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, and demographic stochasticity. Stochastic difference equations (SDEs) will be used to model eco-evolutionary feedbacks in disturbed habitats. For these SDEs, new methods will be developed for verifying persistence of species and exponential rates of convergence to positive stationary distributions (which provides a measure of resilience). For models also accounting for finite population sizes, large deviation methods will be used to prove that stochastic persistence for the mean field SDE implies that the mean time to extinction of any species or genotype increases exponentially with habitat size, and the meta-stable behavior of the system dynamics are characterized by the positive stationary distributions of the mean field SDE. These mathematical methods will be applied to a nested set of common models associated with two prominent empirical systems: Anolis lizards on Bahamian Islands recovering from hurricanes, and stickleback fish in streams on Vancouver Island recovering from catastrophic floods. Using such different model systems provides the unique opportunity to more readily find generalities and plays to the two systems' complementary experimental strengths. Field experiments and observations as well as existing data will be used to parameterize the individual-based eco-evolutionary models. These models will be used to examine the impact of an environmental disturbance on (1) local adaptation of a focal predator (Anolis or stickleback), (2) community resilience, (3) long-term species persistence, and (4) projections about the rate and nature of ecological and evolutionary recovery under present and future climatic conditions. For outreach, the investigators will run and develop material for the modelling in the life sciences cluster of the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science, will develop short educational videos about field research, ecology, and evolution for K-12 students in Austin, and create additional educational opportunities for local Bahamian school children in collaboration with Friends of the Environment (a Bahamian conservation organization)."

Mathematical models in combination with data analysis can help advance the understanding of correlates and mechanisms of protection. This research project provides an interdisciplinary approach into the study of such mechanisms of infection, persistence, and protection.

A major milestone in the understanding of protein behavior emerged with the advent of the ""new view"" of protein folding. This perspective conceives of protein structure, stability, and dynamics as governed by a molecular-level landscape not unlike a relief map describing the surface of the Earth. Each point on the landscape - analogous to latitude and longitude - corresponds to a particular spatial arrangement of protein atoms. The altitude of each point on the map defines protein stability - unstable conformations lie on mountaintops and stable conformations within valley floors. Determining these landscapes is a key goal of protein biology since they are useful in the understanding of natural proteins and design of synthetic proteins as drugs, enzymes, and molecular machines. It is relatively straightforward to calculate these landscapes for small proteins using computer simulations, but it has not been possible to do so from experimental measurements. It is the primary objective of this research to combine mathematical tools from the modeling of dynamical systems with machine learning approaches to analyze high-dimensional datasets to determine approximate protein folding landscapes directly from experimental data. The approach will first be validated in computer simulations of small proteins where the folding landscape is known. Theoretical analyses will place bounds on how close the approximate landscapes are to the true landscapes, and place conditions on the experimental data required for their determination. Ultimately the approach will be applied to experimental measurements of a tuberculosis protein. The computational analysis tool will be released as user-friendly software for free public download. Positive research experiences have great benefits for undergraduate success and retention, and this award will support summer and academic year research opportunities. New educational outreach materials will be developed for the University of Illinois ""Engineering Open House"" to promote awareness of materials science and engineering among middle- and high-school students.<br/><br/>The aim of this work is to integrate nonlinear manifold learning with dynamical systems theory to reconstruct protein folding landscapes from experimental time series measuring a single system observable. The ""new view"" of protein folding revolutionized understanding of folding as a conformational search over rugged and funneled free energy landscapes parameterized by a small number of emergent collective variables, with transformative implications for the understanding and design of proteins as drugs, enzymes, and molecular machines. It is now relatively routine to determine multidimensional folding landscapes from computer simulations in which all atomic coordinates are known, but it has not been possible to do so from experimental measurements of protein dynamics that are restricted to small numbers of coarse-grained observables. This research project integrates Takens' delay embeddings with nonlinear manifold learning using diffusion maps to first project univariate time series in an experimentally measurable observable into a high-dimensional space in which the dynamics are C1-equivalent to those in real space, and then extract from this space a topologically and geometrically equivalent reconstruction of the folding funnel to that which would have been determined from knowledge of all atomic coordinates. The reconstructed landscape preserves the topology of the true funnel - the metastable configurations and folding pathways - but the topography may be perturbed, i.e., the heights and depths of the free energy peaks and valleys. The three primary objectives of this work are to (i) validate the approach in molecular dynamics simulations of small proteins for which the true landscape is known, (ii) place conditions on the sampling resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in experimental measurements for robust landscape recovery, and theoretical bounds on the induced topographical perturbations, and (iii) apply the approach to experimental single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements on the lid-opening and closing dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase (Mtb-PtpB)."

Drugs that target microbes (antimicrobials) have saved millions of lives. But, because microbes evolve, over time antimicrobials reduce the population of pathogens that succumb to drugs and leave behind those that do not - a process called selection. Consequently, unbridled use of antimicrobials threatens their long-term efficacy - a concern since the discovery of penicillin in 1928. Today, drug resistance is recognized as a serious problem requiring urgent attention. Differential equations can describe mechanisms that drive changes in living systems; control theory can generate the best strategies to use these mechanisms to achieve a desired goal. These tools will help guide drug development and dosing protocols that balance the immediate benefits of administering antimicrobials with the long-term selection pressure imposed by these drugs. A mathematical framework that is adaptable to different disease systems could inform strategies to reduce the threat of resistant pathogens to global health and the attendant cost to society. Furthermore, this project will provide graduate students at Howard, Texas Tech, Lehigh, and the University of Kentucky, with the opportunity to intern at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, fostering connections outside of academia.  University of Kentucky students will also assist the lead investigator in mentoring high school students through a pilot Saturday Morning Math program that will provide hands-on experience with coding, modeling, and visualization of scientific results.<br/><br/>The investigators aim to construct a general mathematical framework, with vector-borne disease serving as a benchmark example, and build the tools needed to bridge the gap between within-host PK/PD (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) and population-level epidemiology, so that others may readily adapt the framework to their own studies of competing pathogens. The investigators will approach the problem of linking the fast dynamics of PK/PD to the comparatively slow population-level dynamics by introducing serial compartments in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations representing the progression of individuals through stages of treatment characterized by different drug concentrations and different durations. A stochastic sub-model is proposed to parameterize one of the functions that links within-host PK/PD to the population-level dynamics.  The proposed research is important because, to date, no general methods exist to analyze a staged-progression model where the stages have different durations.

Drugs that target microbes (antimicrobials) have saved millions of lives. But, because microbes evolve, over time antimicrobials reduce the population of pathogens that succumb to drugs and leave behind those that do not - a process called selection. Consequently, unbridled use of antimicrobials threatens their long-term efficacy - a concern since the discovery of penicillin in 1928. Today, drug resistance is recognized as a serious problem requiring urgent attention. Differential equations can describe mechanisms that drive changes in living systems; control theory can generate the best strategies to use these mechanisms to achieve a desired goal. These tools will help guide drug development and dosing protocols that balance the immediate benefits of administering antimicrobials with the long-term selection pressure imposed by these drugs. A mathematical framework that is adaptable to different disease systems could inform strategies to reduce the threat of resistant pathogens to global health and the attendant cost to society. Furthermore, this project will provide graduate students at Howard, Texas Tech, Lehigh, and the University of Kentucky, with the opportunity to intern at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, fostering connections outside of academia.  University of Kentucky students will also assist the lead investigator in mentoring high school students through a pilot Saturday Morning Math program that will provide hands-on experience with coding, modeling, and visualization of scientific results.<br/><br/>The investigators aim to construct a general mathematical framework, with vector-borne disease serving as a benchmark example, and build the tools needed to bridge the gap between within-host PK/PD (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) and population-level epidemiology, so that others may readily adapt the framework to their own studies of competing pathogens. The investigators will approach the problem of linking the fast dynamics of PK/PD to the comparatively slow population-level dynamics by introducing serial compartments in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations representing the progression of individuals through stages of treatment characterized by different drug concentrations and different durations. A stochastic sub-model is proposed to parameterize one of the functions that links within-host PK/PD to the population-level dynamics.  The proposed research is important because, to date, no general methods exist to analyze a staged-progression model where the stages have different durations. Such a model could provide results and insights that significantly improve the protocols for drug interventions in a way that mitigates the selection pressure leading to drug resistance.

To understand brain function, it is therefore paramount to efficiently measure and analyze neuronal network architecture. However, measuring the connectivity of large neuronal networks remains a challenge both experimentally and theoretically. An often more tractable approach to reconstructing connectivity in complex networks is to instead measure the dynamics of neurons of interest, and then use mathematical approaches to infer the network connectivity. This project will utilize the widespread sparsity found in brain networks to develop an efficient mathematical framework for reconstructing neuronal connectivity from limited measurements of neuronal dynamics. Upon accurately recovering the architecture of neuronal networks, this project will investigate how the sparse structure of natural stimuli impacts the early development of neuronal connectivity and what functional implication this has in the encoding of diverse classes of sensory signals. Analyzing the neuronal dynamics that optimally encode network connectivity and stimulus information, this project will provide new insights into sensory processing and abnormal brain function. In formulating novel methodologies for processing dynamic network data, this project will inform advances in artificial intelligence and prosthetics. This work will actively involve undergraduate students in all phases of research, promoting interdisciplinary scientific collaboration and deepening the scope of applied mathematics education for a diverse spectrum of students.<br/><br/>With the increasing prevalence of network models in the mathematical sciences, accurately measuring network structure and understanding its relationship with network function is of broad scientific importance. In neuroscience in particular, efficiently measuring large-scale brain connectivity and determining its impact on cognitive function is inherently challenging yet fundamental in characterizing the nature of computation in the brain. This project will formulate a novel framework for the reconstruction and characterization of neuronal connectivity by taking advantage of the widespread network sparsity found in the brain and utilizing recent advances in compressive-sensing (CS) theory.  Key facets of the project are to: (1) develop a novel CS-based mean-field approach for efficiently reconstructing sparse connections in physiological neuronal networks based on underlying input-output mappings embedded in the nonlinear network dynamics; (2) analyze the role of the balanced network operating regime in CS reconstruction of recurrent network connectivity; (3) investigate the basis for structural motifs in the visual system through supervised learning of neuronal connectivity aimed at optimized compressive encoding of sparse visual stimuli; and (4) characterize the functional role of  receptive field structure in the encoding of natural scenes through compressive network dynamics and the manifestation of related deficiencies in processing non-natural scenes, such as illusory images. This work will underline how the network dynamical regime impacts the inference of structural connectivity and network inputs from neuronal dynamics, improving the scale over which neuronal connectivity can be determined and providing novel insights into abnormal information processing in the brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The most obvious is a physical membrane, such as the cell membrane that separates the cytoplasm from its surrounding environment or the nuclear membrane that confines chromosomal DNA within the nucleus. Mechanisms for compartmentalization are essential as they override diffusive smoothing of concentration gradients that would otherwise homogenize cellular contents and fail to allow spatial regulation of critical cellular processes. A recently identified and current intense focus in cell biology is on chemical compartments that form in the absence of physical membranes.  This project focuses on a specific example: the binding of cytoplasmic proteins and RNAs into complexes that form protein-rich droplets by way of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). By bringing together mathematical, computational, and biological scientists, the investigators aim to develop a general computational modeling platform to study cytoplasmic droplets and their spatial distributions that arise from LLPS.  The aim is to understand mechanistically how these compartments establish and preserve cytoplasmic heterogeneity in mRNA localization and expression in live cells, and the molecular species, complexes, and kinetic timescales that are responsible. By applications of this platform to other live cells, there is the potential to understand the essential cell-specific molecular ingredients and chemical kinetics for LLPS, thereby contributing to understanding of the diversity of intracellular compartmentalization across cell biology. <br/><br/>There is a rich history in cell biology of the study of membranes and their role in establishing extracellular and intracellular chemical compartments. Yet, relatively little is known about how molecular proteins, organelles, and chromosomal DNA, within the cytoplasm or within the nucleus, chemically interact and self-organize to create, sustain, and evolve localized chemical and macromolecular compartments in the absence of physical membranes. Armed with resolved spatial and temporal experimental data of primary molecular species and species complexes, the investigators in this project focus on three specific aims.  1. A computational modeling platform to explore the input space of primary molecular (proteins, RNAs, protein-RNA complexes) and microscopic (nuclei, membranes) species, chemical species affinities, and spatial confinement conditions.  This platform will produce a phase diagram of outcomes that mimics live cell data (dynamic self-organization of complexes and molecular species, droplet formation due to liquid-liquid phase separation), and that reveals sufficient ingredients and interactions for membrane-less, intracellular chemical compartments, and their robustness. 2.  By way of coupled stochastic and continuum modeling, conditioning on ex vivo and in vivo experimental data, to discover sufficient molecular species, complexes, and hidden chemical affinities that reproduce the chemical compartmentalization of live cells. 3. To extend numerical tools for multiphase modeling to accommodate strong fluctuations and out-of-equilibrium behavior driven by chemical kinetics, viscoelasticity of droplets, and induced flow by liquid-liquid phase separation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RNA, a single-strand molecule derived from DNA, is essential in various biological roles. Besides converting the information stored in DNA into proteins, some RNAs control vital cell processes. RNA chains must fold into specific shapes to serve these roles. However, despite the series of refinements to the commonly-used energy model for predicting RNA structure, the accuracy of folding predictions for longer RNA sequences is not satisfying.  This project will use geometric combinatorics to gain insights into the stability and accuracy of predictions from the current energy model. Addressing these biologically relevant questions leads to important mathematical problems which intersect with active research areas in polyhedral geometry and discrete optimization. Results from this project will be used to improve software predicting RNA folding and assist molecular biologists studying RNA function. Additionally, as part of the project, the investigators will train graduate and undergraduate students in research at the interface of mathematics and biology.<br/><br/>This research will advance biological understanding and mathematical knowledge within the developing field of discrete mathematical biology at the juncture between geometric combinatorics and molecular biology. The affine energy function which governs the entropic cost of branching is a known shortcoming of the current nearest neighbor thermodynamic model. However, this coarse approximation to biochemical reality, which is highly constrained by computational efficiency, is well-suited to mathematical modeling and analysis. Methods from geometric combinatorics (polytopes and their normal fans) will be used to give the first parametric analysis of the branching of biological RNA sequences.  Biologically relevant questions, including the accuracy and stability of the current branching parameters in thermodynamic optimization methods for RNA secondary structure prediction, will be addressed using methods from geometric combinatorics. The similarities and differences of these RNA branching polytopes will then be delineated by addressing the challenges of characterization, comparison, and approximation.  This will provide new insight into the inability of current prediction methods to distinguish native branching characteristics from the large number of suboptimal structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Drug-addicted HIV patients often suffer from enhanced HIV-associated pathogenic consequences, such as reduced host defenses against infection and development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).  Despite being a critical problem for both science and society, the HIV infection dynamics in the context of drug abuse currently remains one of the least understood areas of HIV biology.  In the absence of such knowledge, the ability to devise effective strategies to properly manage the virus infection under drug-abuse conditioning remains one of the biggest challenging efforts.  In this project, mathematical and computational models are developed to study HIV dynamics in the circulation and in the brain under drug-abuse conditioning, such as the presence of morphine within the host.  Further complex models are developed to study the effects of pharmacodynamic properties of morphine on HIV infection in the circulation and in the brain.  The developed models are also used for formulating optimal control problems in order to identify ideal antiretroviral treatment as pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-infected drug abusers.  In addition to improving our current knowledge of HIV dynamics, pathogenesis and development of HAND under conditioning of drugs of abuse, this research endures a significant positive and practical impact on developing therapies and vaccines to control the burden of HIV among drug abusers.   <br/><br/>This project produces autonomous models of the HIV dynamics under conditioning of drugs of abuse in the circulation and in the brain, as well as nonautonomous models incorporating the effects of pharmacodynamic properties of drugs of abuse on HIV infection dynamics.  The models are parameterized using experimental data from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections of morphine-addicted macaques (animal model of HIV).  The developed models are extensively analyzed using the tools of mathematical modeling, dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, theory of periodic systems, stability and persistence theory, as well as statistical and numerical methods. Mathematical challenges anticipated in this research offer opportunities to develop new mathematical theories that advance the field of applied differential equations and optimal control theory.  Results, including optimal antiretroviral therapy treatment protocols, help healthcare professionals to mitigate burdens from HIV infection and HAND in drug abusers, thereby, providing the quality of life to drug-addicted HIV infected patients and their families.  In addition, this project provides extensive interdisciplinary collaborative research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from mathematics and biology departments, as well as the School of Pharmacy at University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC).  The research opportunities will be especially extended to a variety of undergraduate research programs that place priority on involving underrepresented students, particularly, undergraduate rural students from Missouri and Kansas.  The research will be incorporated into an interdisciplinary mathematical biology course, cross-listed between graduate and undergraduate levels."

Attention is now moving from identification of components to understanding the emergent, or system, behavior of the connected components.  It has been hoped that general principles would emerge via the study of mathematical models of specific systems, but to date this form of study has not generally proven effective at discovering the hidden principles of biology.  How the complex networks found in biological systems produce their emergent properties and behaviors remains elusive. Theoretical mathematics offers a possible route forward, and one which could, in time, have a profound influence on biology.  This research project aims to cut through the complexity of biological models to elucidate the general principles of cell biology.  Additionally, the project aims to develop new computational methods that can address currently infeasible problems.  There is high demand for well-trained mathematical scientists with the interest and expertise necessary to contribute to the solution of questions arising in biology; this project will provide fertile training ground for graduate students.<br/><br/>Discrete-space, continuous-time Markov chain models are commonly used to model biological interaction networks, including gene regulatory networks, viral infections, signaling systems, neuronal networks, etc. These models can be depicted via a reaction graph, which is a graphical representation of the interactions between the constituent molecules of the model. Interaction networks can be extraordinarily complex; for example, there are over 20,000 genes in the human genome and the proteins they encode may be modified in myriad ways. Further, cellular systems often have different sub-systems that operate on multiple different scales (both temporally and in terms of copy numbers), with the species operating at one scale greatly influencing those at a different scale. The reaction networks currently studied in the literature are typically so complex that numerical simulation is often considered the only way to analyze them. However, hidden within the complexity there are often underlying structures that, if properly quantified, give great insight into the dynamical or stationary behavior of the system. This project aims to develop mathematical theory that relates the emergent properties of these systems to easily-checked properties of the associated reaction graphs. A second aspect of the project is development and analysis of computational methods for stochastic models of biochemical interaction networks. The primary tools and methods utilized will be from probability theory, stochastic analysis, dynamical systems theory, chemical reaction network theory, and computational mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An interface is a transition between regions in a system, each exhibiting different biological properties. The natural world displays a vast gallery of organized systems characterized by complex interface dynamics, including the edges of growing tumors or bacterial colonies, the surface of a growing, hollow embryo, or the transition region between high and low electrical activity in a beating heart. This project will investigate biological systems that involve interfaces with interactions on long length-scales; the behaviors of these interfaces have properties which cannot be predicted by purely local dynamics, as when a bubble popping far away allows other bubbles to grow. The new tools developed will be validated through experimentation with bacterial biofilms and human organoids.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the research at both California State University-Long Beach and Montana State University, and Native American students will be recruited using collaborative outreach programs in existence at Montana State University.<br/><br/>The investigation will focus on studying complex systems characterized by a collection of mutually interacting curves or surfaces. These nonlocal mutual interactions can produce a variety of pattern forming behaviors that typically do not occur in classical interfacial models. For example, nonlocal interfacial models exhibit arrested fronts, which are stationary, dynamically stable interfaces between quasi-homogeneous regions in a complex system. The interactions between certain strains of bacteria provide a concrete instance of such fronts. The evolution of genetically identical sibling colonies lead to competition between these colonies, and this competition produces a collection of mutually interacting interfaces (i.e. the boundary of each colony) that eventually arrest in regions of sibling-sibling competition. The project will introduce a first-principle modeling framework for nonlocal interfaces that offers reduced model complexity from both an analytical and computational perspective. Despite the relative simplicity of this framework, its specific instances still capture the essential pattern forming mechanisms in a variety of biological systems. As a consequence, research under the award will focus on validating this overall approach via experimental predictions in several biological systems. This approach to understanding nonlocal pattern formation appears new at the level of generality introduced in the project, and it opens the door to numerous explorations of the mathematical behavior of the framework and of its applications for different experimental systems. The major aim is to provide researchers with a comparatively flexible, minimalistic framework to study arrested fronts and other interfacial phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

""Q-Bio"" stands for Quantitative Biology and reflects the Summer School's goal to combine biological and mathematical methods to understanding the evolution and function of biological cells in health and disease. Individual cells respond to stimuli such as viruses in different (""noisy"") ways, but their interaction is a coordinated immune response which can be predicted using mathematics. Another example is the effect of chemotherapy on leukemias, which may leave small numbers of residual malignant cells and lead to recurrence of disease.

The q-bio School encourages early career scientists to pursue quantitative systems biology and provides a forum for the exchange of new results and ideas. The unique formula of the School includes active participation in research projects, some of which lead to scientific progress and publications. The Summer School originated in 2007 on the campus of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and past summer schools have been very successful, with over 85% positive reviews and 76% former participants actively engaged in quantitative biology research. The current School at Rice University campus takes advantage of the Houston Health Center, the Baylor College of Medicine and MD Anderson Cancer Center.  The School will be followed by the Annual q-bio Conference at Rice University. Over 11 years the q-bio Summer School has developed an extensive network of 4-500 alumni and actively promotes participant diversity.<br/><br/>Two educational tracks are envisioned in 2018: Cancer Dynamics and Stochastic Cell Regulation. The program will last two weeks and include: ten 1-hour research seminars; ten 1.5-hour general lectures; 30 hours of in-depth breakout discussions, chalk talks and computer lab demonstrations; 8 career-focused panel discussions;  20 student oral presentations; two poster sessions; 20+ hours of mentored project work;  and formal and informal networking opportunities. The Stochastic Cell Regulation track   explores stochasticity and cell-to-cell variability in the measurement and modeling of biochemical systems, concentrating on how small numbers of important molecules (i.e. genes, RNA, and protein) affect dynamics of living cells. The Cancer Dynamics track addresses biological and mathematical issues related to modeling of evolution of cancer. Lectures cover topics spanning many time- and length-scales, from fundamental issues of cell proliferation and mutation dynamics to molecular events affecting specific pathways in cells and population genetics effects.  This section of the summer school includes instructor-suggested group projects, in which students formulate and explore stochastic models of cancer evolution, applying these tools to model experimental and clinical data.
