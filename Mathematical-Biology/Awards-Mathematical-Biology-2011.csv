"1118623","Models for the ecological effects and evolution of dispersal","DMS","MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY","10/01/2011","09/20/2011","George Cosner","FL","University of Miami","Standard Grant","Mary Ann Horn","09/30/2015","$321,879.00","Robert Cantrell","gcc@math.miami.edu","1320 S DIXIE HWY STE 650","CORAL GABLES","FL","331462919","3052843924","MPS","7334","","$0.00","The goal of the project is to use mathematical models to gain insight into the evolutionary causes and ecological effects of the dispersal of organisms.  The individual behavior of dispersing organisms influences the spatial distribution of their population, which influences their ecological interactions with resources, predators, and members of their own species.  Those interactions in turn influence the survival of individuals and populations, and hence create selective advantages for individuals with superior dispersal strategies.   Selection results in evolutionary pressure on the dispersal behavior of individuals.  Mathematical models are used to understand and describe the complex feedbacks at multiple scales involved in the ecology and evolution of dispersal behavior.  The primary modeling approach is based on systems of reaction-advection-diffusion equations with variable and/or density dependent coefficients.  Such equations can be derived from the movement mechanisms used by individuals, but they also make predictions about species interactions and evolution.  Thus, they provide a framework for addressing complex interactions across different spatial and temporal scales and different levels of organization.  They present significant mathematical challenges but recent advances in bifurcation theory and partial differential equations will facilitate their analysis.  The analysis also employs ideas from the theory of dynamical systems.  Patch models and integrodifferential equations with nonlocal dispersal are used in addition to partial differential equations.  Many of the analytic approaches that work for reaction-diffusion-advection models can be applied to them, leading to conceptual unification.  Traditional dispersal models typically view dispersal as an essentially random process that does not depend on environmental conditions or the internal states of individuals, but there have been numerous studies suggesting that conditional dispersal is common and may be advantageous.  Thus, the research focuses on models where the diffusion and advection rates of individuals depend on environmental conditions and/or the population densities of their species and species with which they interact.   That leads to new mathematical research on questions involving the dynamics and equilibria of nonlinear systems of parabolic partial differential equations with coefficients that vary in space and/or time.<br/><br/>The dispersal of organisms influences the persistence and interactions of populations and drives range expansions, biological invasions, and the colonization of empty habitats.   Thus, understanding dispersal is relevant to addressing questions about biological conservation, invasive species, pest control, and other environmental issues, including the response of populations to global change.  The ways that the dispersal patterns of organisms affect their interactions with the environment and with other species are complex and subtle, so it is difficult to assess the effects of variations in dispersal patterns on those interactions.  Also, since dispersal affects survival and thus leads to natural selection, evolution may change the dispersal strategies of organisms inhabiting changing environments. That process involves complex feedback loops which are difficult to understand.  The research addresses those problems by using mathematical models to describe the ecological effects and evolution of dispersal.   The models are based on partial differential equations, which provide a framework for describing how quantities change and influence each other over space and time.  Specifically, the models include terms describing random movements, directed movements, and ecological interactions that may vary in time and space and/or depend on population densities.  The research provides new information about the ways that these processes interact.  Traditional models for dispersal usually describe it as a random process that does not depend on location or environmental conditions, so this research involves the development and analysis of new types of models that may be relevant in studying various phenomena in ecology and related areas."

This is despite  the fact that numerous representative structures of self-assembled viral capsids are available.  In  this project, we are specifically interested in:  a) nucleations, b) autostery, conformational switches and c) scaffolding removal,  all of which are processes driven by configurational and combinatorial entropy, a stumbling block for commonly used computational molecular simulation paradigms including molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods. Multiscale Geometry and Symmetry Constraints (MGSC) is a versatile and computationally highly efficient new modeling paradigm developed by this PI team during a prior NSF project: it complements and integrates with former paradigms while addressing key shortcomings. The project will use the MGSC paradigm to translate key questions about biological processes driven by configurational and combinatorial entropy into diverse mathematical and algorithmic questions that elucidate the influence of geometry and symmetry upon these processes. These questions are independently interesting and are related to longstanding open problems in combinatorial rigidity, algebraic geometry of configuration spaces, algebraic combinatorics, and complexity. Moreover, using MGSC, we will obtain a  systematic modeling procedure not only for extracting the minimal, relevant data (model input) for answering focused questions about these processes (Occam?s razor), but also for interpreting the answers (model output) biologically.  Finally, the project will use existing experimental results (in vitro and in vivo, performed at a co-PI?s lab) on representative families of viruses (such as the Murine Parvovirus (MVM),  Maize Streak Virus (MSV),  Adeno associated viruses (AAV4) to validate its predictions,  for instance, on crucial  inter-molecular interactions whose removal disrupts assembly.<br/><br/>Viral capsid self-assembly from its constituent protein molecules is a phase of the viral lifecycle that is relatively independent of the structure and processes of the host cell. Yet, the self-assembly phase has not been targeted in the design of drugs or vaccines for treating viral infections, nor has it been leveraged in the design and use of viral vectors in gene therapy. This is because the rapidity, efficacy, robustness, spontaneity and mathematically complex orchestration of  viral capsid self-assembly, occurring at the nano-scale,  is extremely difficult to understand. This project aims at bringing new insights into the viral capsid self-assembly process by combining the expertise of two mathematicians, a computer scientist and an experimental structural biologist. <br/>The project will build upon these results to continue the development of  an open source software suite EASAL (Efficient Atlasing and Search of Assembly Landscapes). This has the potential to be used by a wide variety of  disciplines that are interested in isolating the  crucial inter-atomic interactions that drive macromolecular self-assembly. Hence the project will provide outstanding interdisciplinary research experience not only to the graduate students and postdocs involved, but to the PIs as well.  The project will  provide research experience for STEM teachers at local schools and will additionally involve Tertl Studos - a game-based learning software company that is interested in working in the public domain - to creatively incorporate geometric constraint solving algorithms into a wide variety of math and science benchmarks in grades 4-12.<br/><br/>This proposal was submitted to the DMS programs in Mathematical Biology and Computational Mathematics, to CCF/CISE and to MCB/BIO in response to the Dear Colleague Letter: Unsolicited Proposals at the Interface of the Biological, Mathematical and Physical Sciences. <br/>It is co-funded by sevral NSF programs: Mathematical Biology/DMS/MPS, Molecular and Cellular Biology/BIO, Algorithmic Foundations CCF/CISE as well as by the DMS Cyberinfrastructure for the 21st Century (CIF21) fund."

Of particular need is a representation of the spatial domain of a river network in its natural, continuous form.  This project incorporates quantum graph theory as a mathematical framework for modeling river networks.  Developed for problems in quantum mechanics, this theory pairs a metric graph with a differential operator.  Metric graph branches are identified with continuous intervals instead of discrete nodes; functions and operators are defined along these intervals.  Thus, environmental variability can be interpreted as variation in system parameters along branches in the network, and solutions to parabolic and elliptic differential equations describing population dynamics that result from spatial variability can be analyzed globally.  While quantum graphs hold great potential for modeling how branching network structure and environmental variability influence ecological dynamics in rivers, key mathematical demands of the ecological problem have not been adapted to this framework.  This project overcomes these obstacles by accomplishing two objectives: 1) Extending quantum graphs to handle systems of reaction-diffusion-advection equations and their associated integral kernels that typically arise in river population dynamic models; and 2) developing transform methods for solutions on branching networks to describe the response of river populations to environmental variability.  This extension of quantum graphs to ecological dynamics leads to theoretical advances that may also impact a wide range of problems in science involving continuous spatial networks, for example predator-prey dynamics, nerve-signal propagation, and nutrient or drug delivery in body vessels.<br/><br/>How is a river like a tree?  If you look at a river on a map and a tree, they look very similar, with a large main stem branching into smaller branches.  Ecologists studying rivers have long understood the importance of a rivers tree-like structure, yet tools are currently lacking that allow researchers to incorporate this structure into models of important ecological processes.  This hinders, for example, the ability to predict where and how far a pollutant may travel in a river, to investigate the potential impacts of dam placement or removal on populations of endangered species, and to understand the complex effects of land use and climate change in river floodplains.  This project leads to the development of a set of mathematical and computational tools for studying rivers in their branching form. This is done by adapting a mathematical framework, known as the theory of quantum graphs, to ecological problems. Quantum graphs were developed and have been largely studied in the context of quantum physics. However, this focus means that these techniques are not available ""off the shelf"" for application to other fields of science.  This project removes these barriers to application, and expands the ability to represent the special ecological patterns that arise from a rivers branching structure."

Such processes involve biomechanical effects related to bearing load, swelling, growing, and remodeling that are coupled to biochemical effects related to transport of ionic species, electrical transduction, and chemical reaction.   Such processes operate on a variety of time and length scales, and are severely compromised upon transitioning from in-vivo operation to in-vitro examination.  The meeting will address the underlying partial differential equation formulations, the variational structure of equilibrium and steady state models, the treatment of dissipative phenomena, and the handling of multiple time and space scales including consistent coupling to atomistic treatments in the fast and small limit at which the continuum assumption breaks down.<br/><br/>The meeting, to be held on the campus of Michigan State University, is organized under the auspices of both the Society for Natural Philosophy (the 49th such annual meeting since 1963) and the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (under its Participating Institution program).  These organizations are noted for bringing together mathematicians, engineers, biologists, and physical scientists in a workshop atmosphere for the purpose of exploring new directions in mathematical modeling.   The focus of this meeting is on coupled biological processes such as those governed by a combination of mechanical and chemical factors. A more sophisticated modeling treatment of these processes is essential to transforming scientific understanding into cost effective medical care.  For example, recent ideas for modeling swelling in the context of continuum mechanics show great promise for a more accurate description of soft tissue response in both normal function (birth) and abnormal function (edema, asthma). More accurate mathematical models for describing such processes provide useful analytical tools that contribute to the creation of improved diagnostic procedures and medical therapies."

This necessitates an approach that blends algebraic-topological methods with more traditional dynamical systems models.   The research will produce testable predictions about the structure of networks that support stimulus representation, and will deepen our understanding of the relationship between network structure and function.  The theory will be both tested and guided by the analysis of multi-unit electrophysiological recordings in behaving animals.<br/><br/>The brain is a vast collection of interconnected neural circuits. In many brain areas, important neural computations are accomplished by local networks of neurons. However, the structure of local recurrent circuits in the brain is still poorly understood, even in the most studied brain areas such as the hippocampus.  In contrast, neuroscience experiments have been much more successful in uncovering coding properties of individual neurons and, more recently, in characterizing patterns of population activity in local neuronal circuits.  This research develops a mathematical theory that exploits our knowledge of the representational properties of neuronal populations in order to better understand the structure of the underlying networks.  The findings yield new insight into the role of neural circuits in learning and memory, and of how the brain organizes knowledge.  Progress in the basic understanding of neural circuits is essential for improving our understanding of learning disabilities and diseases (such as epilepsy and schizophrenia) that are believed to be related to the malfunction of neural circuits."

The traditional picture is that the spindle assembles as a result of microtubules (long dynamic polymers) randomly capturing chromosomes.  After this, the spindle length is maintained by a balance of inward tension exerted by molecular motors on the microtubules connecting spindle poles and chromosomes, and outward compression generated by other motors on the overlapping microtubules connecting the spindle poles.  This picture is being challenged by mounting evidence indicating that spindle assembly and maintenance rely on much more complex interconnected networks of microtubules, molecular motors, chromosomes and regulatory proteins.  From an engineering point of view, three design principles of this molecular machine are especially important: the spindle assembles rapidly, it assembles accurately, and it is mechanically robust, yet malleable.  How is this design achieved with randomly interacting and impermanent molecular parts?  How does the spindle self-assemble?  What determines its mechanical properties?  Mathematical and computational modeling will be used to examine quantitatively the process of the capture of chromosomes by dynamically unstable microtubules.  Kinetics of the assembly are coupled with mechanical forces, and interplay between forces, movements, chromosome capture and assembly error correction will be investigated.  Then a coarse grained hydrodynamic-like model of a gel of short microtubules and molecular motors is developed to elucidate the self-organization principles for meiotic and in vitro spindles.  The models are tested and refined by comparison of their predictions with quantitative data. <br/><br/>This project uses a novel combination of mathematical analysis, computer simulations and model-driven experiments to develop a novel quantitative model of the mitotic spindle-dynamic molecular machine that the cell uses to segregate chromosomes prior to cell division.  Predictions of this model help reveal the mechanisms the cell uses to segregate the chromosomes fast, accurately and in a mechanically robust way.  The assembly, error correction, and mechanics of the mitotic spindle are simulated simultaneously, generating testable predictions for the experiment.  Such models are crucial for understanding not only the fundamental question of basic cell biology, but also to fine-tune drug design strategies for numerous diseases that stem from aneuploidy, i.e., an abnormal number of chromosomes."

The working hypothesis is that continuous-time Boolean models can efficiently account for three crucial features: the structure of the network, the logic carried out by each element, and the timing of activation events. The models allow the syntheses of results from multiple experiments and checks for consistency of interpretation, and reveals architectural features required for complex networks to perform given tasks.

Mucus layers are propelled by individual cilia, coordinated waves of cilia, as well as by laminar and turbulent airflow.  The diffusion of inhaled viruses, bacteria, environmental particulates and drug carrier particles in lung mucus is observed to depend, indeed dramatically so, on particle size relative to the mesh size distribution of mucus and on particle electrostatic interactions with the mucus gel.

Flow transport projects combine wave-theoretical methods, inertial extensions of standard creep rheology, and stochastic bead-bead fluctuations in order to span the requisite length, time and force scales.  Diffusive transport is inherently stochastic, for which new models and simulation tools are outlined to model and predict the transient anomalous diffusive properties that are experimentally observed. All projects are designed consistent with the functions that mucus performs in lung biology, and the integrated experimental-mathematical tools are designed for clinical applicability to mucus samples.  The tools and approach are developed and tested on two mucus simulants, hyaluronic acid solutions and agarose gels, whose properties can be tuned a priori and independently tested with standard rheological instruments and theory. <br/><br/>This project develops the underpinnings of a new approach to lung health assessment and treatment of disorders and diseases.  The present approach is to treat symptoms based on the statistics of clinical trials and accumulated empirical evidence.   Mechanically, lung infections are the result of a failure of airway mucus to trap, transport and clear pathogens or environmental particulates.  Thus the flow of mucus layers by the action of cilia and airflow, and the diffusion of diverse particles within the mucus layer, are the fundamental mechanisms that underlie lung health.  Contrary to popular belief, antibodies provide a secondary line of defense.  The tools and mathematical theory for assessment, prediction, and understanding of flow and diffusive transport of lung mucus layers in biologically relevant conditions do not exist.  This project incorporates existing experimental methods, instruments, and mathematical theory with the design and construction of new instruments, mathematical theory and numerical algorithms.  When integrated, these tools will provide the capability to infer flow and diffusive transport properties of mucus samples from an individual patient, and the capability to test physical and drug therapies to reinstate mucus clearance."

While there is wide support for the contribution and interactions of specific wake-promoting and sleep-promoting neuronal populations in this network, by contrast, there has been much debate about the network components involved in the regulation of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep.  This project analyzes how the structure of competing proposed sleep-wake regulatory networks determines sleep-wake behavior and dynamics of behavioral state transitions.  The researchers have developed a novel firing rate model formalism explicitly including neurotransmitter dynamics that is uniquely suited to model dynamics of the sleep-wake regulatory network.  Using a reduction of this formalism, models of the current competing proposed structures for the subnetwork governing REM sleep generation are analyzed to determine intrinsic dynamics dictated by the network structure, and the dependence of those dynamics on subnetwork components.  Additionally, state transition dynamics in competing proposed network structures for regulation of wake and sleep states are investigated.  Maintaining the reduced model formalism, the focus is on determining the mechanisms by which the competing network structures generate key features of human sleep patterning that will be characterized from experimental sleep recordings.  Dynamics of competing model networks, using the full model formalism including stochastic components, are fit to the fine temporal architecture of sleep-wake patterning recorded in multiple species, including rodent, feline, and human, with focus on investigating common dynamic features of sleep-wake patterning and variability in sleep-wake regulatory mechanisms across species.  The researchers collaborate with three leading experimental sleep scientists who provide sleep recordings and consultation on the proposed projects.<br/><br/>In mammals, states of waking and sleep are actively controlled by populations of neurons located in the brainstem and hypothalamus.  Currently, in experimental sleep science, the interactions of these populations, mediated by primary neurotransmitters, are believed to form a regulatory network for the control of sleep and wake transitions.  While there is wide support for the contribution and interactions of specific wake-promoting and sleep-promoting neuronal populations in this network, by contrast, there has been much debate about the network components involved in the regulation of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Experimental investigation of the sleep-wake regulatory is limited by the fact that the outcome measurement, namely sleep-wake patterning, only exists in the intact animal.  The experimental techniques available to probe the neuronal regulatory mechanisms are limited to those that can be conducted in vivo without disrupting sleep, or post-mortem studies that can identify anatomy of synaptic projections between populations but not their time-varying interactions that underlie sleep-wake transitions.  This project uses mathematical modeling as an investigative tool to bridge the gaps left by these limitations in experimental studies.  The modeling studies address the physiologically compelling and currently debated question of the structure of the mammalian sleep-wake regulatory network.  Numerous experimental groups have proposed schematics of network structures and provided hypothetical descriptions of how network interactions drive behavioral state transitions.  However, static conceptual models lack the ability to replicate time dynamics of transitions between sleep-wake states or to determine dynamic interactions inherent to network structure.  Construction and analysis of mathematical models of these proposed networks identifies the dynamic interactions of constituent populations and neurotransmitters, and provides quantitative understanding of how network dynamics generate the fine temporal architecture of sleep-wake patterning.  Model solutions are compared to experimental recordings of rodent, feline and human sleep to determine mechanisms contributing to the differences in sleep-wake patterning observed in these multiple species.  Results of the modeling studies identify limitations of each of the proposed network structures in accounting for various characteristics of sleep-wake regulation and will generate predictions suggesting how experimental approaches can refine our knowledge of the physiological network structure."

These include the role of focal adhesions, the spatio-temporal organization of actin flow, the response of the leading-edge membrane to actin polymerization and conversely the role of myosin minifilaments in creating contractile stress at the rear.  It is now an opportune time to combine this knowledge into a mathematical model which can treat the morphodynamics of the whole cell, and correlate motion with both mechanical data (such as traction-force measurements) and sub-cellular signaling information (such as localization data for specific molecular players.)  This proposal aims at constructing and validating such a model for endothelial cells.  From the mathematics side, the novel element includes embedding all of the aforementioned processes into a moving cell geometry, enabled by the phase-field approach; the latter has shown its relevance in many moving boundary problems in fields ranging from solidification to multiphase fluid flow.  Experimental data will be obtained by utilizing state-of-the-art microfluidic devices so as to provide controlled cell environments and will include the measurement of spatial patterns of signaling molecules (location and activation) as well as forces. Model predictions will be tested in a number of different cell lines and in cells subject to a variety of pharamacological treatments.<br/><br/>Obtaining a quantitative understanding of cell motility is of importance for many critical biomedical systems, ranging from cancer metastases to inflammatory response to pathogens.  Biophysical tools have reached the point where one can obtain high-quality data about various parts of the motility mechanism; for example, we can measure the forces exerted by the cell on the substrate on which it moves.  At the same time, advances in computational modeling have shown how to tackle complex problems involving fluid flow and chemical reactions taking place inside a moving domain.  Our proposal aims at combining these two capabilities, experimental biophysics and computational modeling to create a quantitative approach to the motion of a specific type of mammalian cell.  Once successful, our methodology could be extended to other cell types and to cells moving in more complicated spaces.  The eventual payoff would be both an increased fundamental understanding and an increased capability of affecting cell motility, perhaps to prevent cells from a primary tumor from establishing secondary colonies in target tissues.<br/><br/>The proposal was submitted in response to the Joint DMS/NIGMS Initiative to Support Research at the Interface of the Biological and Mathematical Sciences.

This includes models for transgenic mosquitoes, which are resistant to infection by mosquito-borne diseases, and have distinct fitnesses, some of which have advantages over the others.  Combined epidemic models are used to study the interactive dynamics of the mosquitoes, characterizing the fact that transgenic mosquitoes have a selective advantage over non-transgenic mosquitoes, and to investigate the effects of transgenic mosquitoes on the disease transmissions.  Modeling of transgenic mosquitoes with various genes or strains, as well as modeling of two-sex mosquito populations including both males and females, is also part of this project.  All models start with simpler forms, and gradually include more complex structures to better describe the underlying biology.  Within each model category, the investigator determines different formulas for the birth and death functions and the contact rates, which facilitates the ability to connect the modelling with real data.  With the population models for the mosquitoes well established, various epidemic models for both human and mosquito populations will be incorporated to study the transmission dynamics of the mosquito-borne diseases.  The investigator also focuses on modeling of the newly developed paratransgenic technique, which attempts to eliminate a pathogen from mosquito populations through transgenesis of a symbiont, i.e., a genetically modified bacterium, that prevents the mosquitoes from transmitting the pathogen.   The dynamics of horizontal bacteria transmission, as well as vertical transmission between mosquitoes, and their effects on the disease transmissions are investigated.  The goal is to understand the complexity of the dynamics of the interacting wild mosquitoes and the mosquitoes carrying transgenes or genetically modified bacteria, and predict the impact of releasing the modified mosquitoes.   Analysis and numerical simulation is combined to study qualitative and quantitative features of the models, including existence and stability of equilibria, existence of periodic and aperiodic oscillations through bifurcations, and chaotic behavior and transient dynamics.  Model parameters are estimated or derived from real biological data and the mathematical analysis of the models covers all parameter regions.<br/><br/>New developments in biology allow researchers to genetically alter mosquitoes so that they are resistant to malaria infection or other mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever and West Nile virus.  A more recently developed new paratransgenic approach generates mosquitoes carrying genetically modifies bacteria that impairs in the transmission of pathogens in mosquitoes. The mosquito-borne diseases are transmitted between humans by blood-feeding mosquitoes, and their spread and control have been major concerns for public health.  The introduction of modified mosquitoes into wild mosquito populations could be an effective measure in controlling mosquito-borne diseases.  To explore this possibility, the investigator, in collaboration with biologists, develops and analyzes mathematical models that represent the population dynamics of wild and transgenic mosquitoes. The models account for the spread of transgenes or genetically modified bacteria through the mosquito population over multiple generations, and predict the impact on the disease transmissions. They help answer such questions as how effectively mosquitoes carrying transgenes or modified bacteria would be able to compete for partners with their wild counterparts, how long it would take for a new resistance gene or bacterium to penetrate the mosquito population, and how effective it would be in preventing the spread of the diseases. In this way, the results of the project can provide useful guidance for public health measures and for disease prevention strategies."

Because of the importance of the environment and weather on mosquito-borne epidemics, existing models will be extended to be reactive to environmental changes. For mosquito-borne diseases spread by viruses, there is the possibility that an infected mother can transmit the virus to her eggs and her offspring be born infected.  Therefore, vertical transmission will also be included in the modeling and a range of parameters will be identified to determine when vertical transmission is important.  These models are analyzed, validated on field data, and undergo a full uncertainty quantification analysis. <br/>  <br/>Mathematical models based on the underlying transmission mechanisms of the disease can help the public health community understand and anticipate the spread of an epidemic and evaluate the potential effectiveness of different approaches for bringing an epidemic under control.

The objective of the research is to expand the mathematical framework used in the modeling and analysis of synthetic gene networks.  First, the investigators systematically study stochasticity at separatrices of bistable synthetic gene networks. Recently developed yeast bistable gene networks are used for the first time to initialize gene networks on their separatrices.  In particular, the difference between Gillespie algorithm and Chemical Langevin equation (CLE) based algorithms in simulating stochastic processes near bifurcation points is investigated, both analytically and experimentally. With the experience in studying bistable systems, the next step is to mathematically and experimentally analyze nonlinear stochastic dynamics in three potential well systems. Nonlinear stochastic dynamics in multi potential well systems have not been well studied.  This network is constructed using available, well-characterized components and techniques and by combining microfluidics devices, single cell live imaging and stochastic modeling to observe and study noise induced random state switching.  Finally, methods of high dimensional analysis of gene networks are developed.  Tools for dynamical analysis of high dimensional gene networks have been lacking.  This project develops mathematical methods to expand the analysis of gene networks from two dimensions into higher dimensionalities. High throughput network identification methods that utilize parallel computing are developed. Bifurcation analysis of high dimensional dynamical systems with applications in gene networks is tested. <br/><br/>Novel systematic understanding of cell differentiation and reprogramming derives from the study of synthetic multistable gene networks.  Synthetic multistable systems provide unique opportunities to study the core mechanisms of cell pluripotency and differentiation because highly connected small transcription networks regulating cell differentiation have topological similarities with the synthetic gene networks under consideration in this project. Constructing and analyzing small multistable gene network deepens our understanding of multistability, which can arise from similar topologies in stem cell gene regulations.  Additionally, mathematical theories and tools to study high dimensional nonlinear dynamics and stochasticity in the context of gene networks are developed. Currently, theoretical efforts to study cellular multistable systems are lacking.  This research fills the gap between technological progress and available analytical tools to facilitate future biotechnological development. In addition, both undergraduate and graduate students carry out synthetic biology experiments and analysis.  By participating in the international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, these students promote developments of modern biological technologies at Arizona State University.

This proposal aims to develop and analyze models relevant to several examples from biology, ecology, oceanography and epidemiology, that involve interfacial effects defined by discontinuities in values of coefficients in the models. These phenomena occur on highly heterogeneous domains in which sharp or abrupt discontinuities in certain physical, chemical, or biological properties of the landscape occur in the coefficients of the basic equations. The Pis will analyze functionals of the associated processes, both for fragmented or patchy domains and for discrete graphical structures, to quantify the effects that smaller scale interfacial discontinuities have on macro scale variables, such as resident and occupation time functionals. In the first part of the proposal, the PIs will develop stochastic approaches to the advection-dispersion-reaction equations with discontinuous coefficients that model different biological processes. Unlike more classical physical models where the micro-scale interface conditions can be determined by macro-scale conservation laws, data on biological responses to interfacial boundaries can be quite different. The determination of the appropriate models requires the development of new micro-scale methods of analysis involving local time and the Ito-Tanaka stochastic calculus to uncover the appropriate macro-scale equations governing population densities and characteristic functionals of dispersion. In the second part of the proposal the Pis will develop numerical methods, Monte-Carlo stochastic particle schemes, and new methods of statistical parameter estimation for advection-dispersion equations involving discontinuous coefficients with special interface geometries relevant to key biological field data.<br/><br/>Natural physical processes, as well as certain anthropogenic activities, result in fragmented habitats to which species (animal, plants and bacteria) adapt or modify their behavior. Changes in the habitat configuration and/or its conditions, present new challenges and pose important broad new questions to scientists, policy makers and resource managers concerned with natural resources. Several contemporary problems in the biological and environmental sciences and engineering where such effects are reported to occur include: Bio-remediation of contaminated sediments in heterogeneous landscapes; Spread of infectious disease over fragmented habitats causing shifts in community structures possibly leading to invasion by exotic species; Species dispersal and sustainability in a heterogeneous environment affecting persistence of endangered species; Spatial localization of oceanic chlorophyll blooms impacting the fisheries industry. The specific mathematical issues common to these examples involve appropriate modeling of interfacial processes,<br/>i.e., mathematical discontinuities in the coefficients of the model equations, that affect the large scale behavior of species movement. The mathematical framework to be developed in this research is particularly aimed at assessing and quantifying interfacial effects on the large scale caused by these abrupt small -scale changes.

This extends the classical ""gating variable"" approach to modeling the opening and closing of ion channels - introduced by Nobel prize winners Hodgkin and Huxley - to account for the short range of action of intracellular calcium and local coupling of intracellular calcium channels.  Traditional models of coupled local and global calcium responses involve stochastic simulation methods that are computationally intensive and often prohibit both mathematical analysis and large-scale parameters studies.

Gregory Smith (William & Mary) and students develop, validate, and benchmark this mathematical modeling framework and, subsequently, deploy it in the laboratories of Eric Sobie (Mount Sinai) and Sandor Gyorke (Ohio State) to interpret live cell calcium imaging experiments that probe how beat-to-beat calcium cycling in heart muscle cells changes in response to drugs, mutations, and disease.<br/><br/>User-friendly software is produced to assist other laboratories in their development of more realistic and predictive models of calcium responses in cardiac, smooth, and striated muscle, neurons, and non-excitable cells.

The main goal of this research project is to develop a mathematical theory of intrinsic and extrinsic noise in neuronal population dynamics, adapting analytical methods from the study of chemical master equations such as Langevin approximations, stochastic hybrid systems, and large deviation theory.  It is assumed that intrinsic noise at the network level arises from fluctuations about an asynchronous state due to finite size effects, whereas extrinsic noise arises from fluctuating external inputs.  The theory is applied to a variety of neurobiological phenomena where noise is thought to play a crucial role, including the stimulus-induced synchronization of neural oscillators during sensory processing, and the generation of oscillations and waves during binocular rivalry. The latter forms the basis for non-invasive studies of human vision.<br/><br/>Noise has recently emerged as a key component of many biological systems including the brain.  Randomness arises at multiple levels of brain function, ranging from molecular processes such as gene expression and the opening of ion channel proteins to complex networks of brain cells (neurons) that generate behavior. Indeed, the presence of noise has direct behavioral consequences, from setting perceptual and decision thresholds to influencing movement precision.  Noise also contributes to the generation of spontaneous activity patterns during resting brain states, which are thought to play an important role in cognition.  From one perspective, neuroscientists are interested in how, in spite of significant levels of noise, the brain appears to function reliably, consistent with the idea that it has evolved under the constraints that are imposed by noise.  From another perspective, neuroscientists are interested in situations where the presence of noise can either be harmful to or, in certain cases, actually enhance brain function.  The main goal of this project is to use mathematical and computational modeling to develop our understanding of how noise that is present at the molecular and cellular levels affects dynamics and information processing at the network level, both in healthy and diseased brains.  <br/><br/>Numerous behaviors ranging from locomotion to cognitive tasks rely on oscillatory activity generated by networks of neurons in the brain.  Despite the predominance and indispensability of brain oscillations, few theoretical tools are available for understanding how such oscillations are generated or controlled.  A novel approach is used that combines biological experiments and mathematical analysis to break apart the complex interactions present in network components into simple building blocks.  This allows core elements that are important in the generation of oscillations to be extracted and will clarify the role of other existing components in sculpting behavior using mathematical models.  The models are tested through experiments that connect real time computer-simulated neurons to small oscillatory network in the crab central nervous systems.  This project provides a framework for developing neural-based control systems with potential applications in robotics and bio-inspired computing."

As a result there is an explosion of interest in understanding the patterns of activity that emerge in entire neuronal populations and relating these patterns to the function of the nervous system.   However, the overwhelming range of different sensory inputs that these populations receive -- and the vast range of different responses that these inputs evoke -- make it impossible to achieve this goal based on empirical observations alone. This challenge is compounded due to the nonlinearity of neuronal network dynamics, which makes it difficult to predict patterns of activity by extrapolation from observations of simpler systems.  Predictive mathematical modeling and a deeper understanding of the dynamics of neuronal circuits is therefore required.  With previous NSF support, the investigators developed numerical and analytic tools at the interface of statistics, stochastic analysis and nonlinear dynamics, to understand the genesis and impact of correlations in simple, but fundamental microcircuits.  They build on these results by extending the underlying mathematical theory to more complex and realistic networks.  Using this approach, the team of researchers examines how collective activity is controlled by network architecture, cell dynamics, and stimulus drive in a set of neural networks that typify structures across the nervous system.<br/><br/>Answering these questions will open the door to contemporary biological applications and will meet key theoretical challenges posed by recent technological developments in experimental neuroscience. The key innovation lies in the understanding the collective dynamics of large neural networks that cannot be decomposed into their isolated parts. Through continued interactions with a broad set of experimental collaborators, these ideas are introduced and tested by a broad community of neuroscientists.  In the longer term, results on coding in the presence of collective network dynamics will impact the design of neural prosthetics, which code sensory signals via cortical, retinal, and thalamic implants."

There exist various mathematical methods and techniques (e.g., dynamical systems, optimal control) that apply to both major areas, while often only one or the other is being used by researchers in a specific field.  In this workshop these groups are brought together together to initiate new and nurture existing collaborations while at the same time bringing new mathematicians and scientists into this exciting interdisciplinary field. <br/>    <br/>The organizing committee believes that mathematics has much to offer to the medical and biological communities and that methods and techniques from mathematics can deepen the understanding of many problems in systems biology, epidemiology and population dynamics. The workshop is expected to have an exceptional educational impact because of the unique character of AIMS, which is a center for graduate studies in the mathematical sciences in Africa with emphasis on mathematical biology. Thus the participation of researchers and students from various African countries is guaranteed.  Special efforts are made to recruit as participants U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral researchers and enable interactions that will catalyze collaborations between these groups.  The presence of both senior and junior researchers and students from both U.S. and Africa will provide a great opportunity for mentoring activities within the workshop.  The results of the workshop will be disseminated through published proceedings and further research contacts."

The focus of the research work will be on the devel-<br/>opment and analysis of mathematical models that describe at the continuum scale avascular growth<br/>of tumors, i.e. in the absence of nearby blood vessels, and aim at predicting the evolution of large tu-<br/>morous regions while ignoring the behavior of individual cells. Continuum models of tumor growth<br/>can be derived from first principles through the continuum theory of mixtures. Mixture theory pro-<br/>vides an elegant and general framework for modeling multicomponent media such, as living tissue,<br/>composed of several species of interacting constituents. A remarkable property of phenomenological<br/>models based on mixture theory is that, when considering the concentration gradients of various<br/>constituents into the Helmholtz free energy functionals, one obtains diffuse-interface models that<br/>introduce smooth transitional boundaries between the various constituents. The resulting equa-<br/>tions are systems of the Cahn-Hilliard type, namely complex systems of nonlinear time-dependent<br/>fourth-order partial-differential equations. Such diffuse-interface tumor-growth models have been<br/>proposed only recently in the literature and the mathematical analysis and development of efficient<br/>discretizations for such systems are only in the initial stage. The main objectives in this research<br/>project are thus to address several important open issues related to the development of spatio-<br/>temporal diffuse-interface phase field models for computer predictions of tumor growth, including:<br/>(1) development of formulations that satisfy thermodynamical properties of the system; (2) devel-<br/>opment of a rigorous mathematical framework for the analysis of tumor-growth models based on<br/>gradient ow theory; (3) development of new stable and high-order accurate time-stepping schemes<br/>by using semi-implicit splitting approaches; and (4) development of efficient goal-oriented error<br/>estimation algorithms for the control of spatial and temporal discretization errors for the highly<br/>nonlinear time-dependent coupled problem embodied by the proposed tumor-growth models.<br/><br/>Cancer is a disease of the genome, characterized by uncontrolled cellular growth and invasion,<br/>that afflicts every year millions of Americans from all age categories. The primary motivation<br/>of the research project is thus concerned with one of the grand challenges of our times, that<br/>is, to understand the mechanisms of cancer so that reliable treatments, or better, preventative<br/>measures, can be determined to relieve the impact this disease has on so many people. It has<br/>turned out to be a difficult endeavor, due to many reasons, but the most important ones could<br/>be that there are more than one hundred different types of cancer and the causes and effects of<br/>each type occur on a wide range of scales-specific mutations happen at the molecular scale while<br/>tumors may invade a significant portion of the human body. It is not too uncommon to believe<br/>that biologists or medical physicians are the main players in cancer research; however, more and<br/>more scientists from other disciplines, such as mathematics or physics, are getting involved in<br/>the investigation of possible causes of tumor development and behavior. It is in fact our hope<br/>that mathematical and computational tools could provide new insights that could help guide more<br/>fundamental research issues to be addressed by biologists and medical physicians.

Since sperm motility is an emergent property of a complex system, we need to have multiscale models that account for chemical signaling, mechanics, and hydrodynamics. For marine invertebrate sperm, a chemoattractant is able to guide sperm to the egg by initiating a signaling pathway that results in an increase in calcium. This increase in calcium modifies the waveform, and ultimately the trajectory. This project will develop a hierarchy of models that will be used to investigate the relevant biochemistry of chemotaxis, how and where calcium is acting to modify the flagellar waveform, and how this couples to trajectories that allow the sperm to reach the egg.  A model for the chemotactic signaling pathway will be developed and the Geometric Clutch Hypothesis will be implemented to have an accurate model of how calcium effects dynein arm activation (active force and torque generators in the axoneme of the flagellum). Multiscale models will be developed to couple the relevant biochemistry at the cellular level to trajectories and flagellar bending at the macroscale. In order to accurately account for nonplanar bending of the flagellum in a 3-dimensional fluid governed by the Stokes equations, we will develop a new regularized formulation of the generalized immersed boundary method. This method will provide a framework to numerically solve a coupled system that includes an immersed structure in a viscous fluid, where the force and torque that the sperm flagellum exerts on the fluid can depend on the biochemistry. <br/><br/>Through the development of integrative, multiscale models, we will examine how chemotaxis and the resulting increase in calcium concentration within the flagellum enables invertebrate sperm to reach and fertilize the egg in a marine environment. The modeling framework that will be developed will allow us to test different hypotheses about where calcium is acting in the flagellum to understand how this couples to emergent waveforms and trajectories of sperm. This research lies at the interface of mathematics and biology, as it is necessary to account for the relevant biochemistry, mechanics, and hydrodynamics to model sperm motility. Students involved in this research project will receive interdisciplinary training and will gain experience in model development based on the relevant biology and computational aspects of the project. Although the main focus of this project is on studying aspects of invertebrate sperm motility, the new numerical method that will be developed will also be applicable to study aspects of motility in other microorganisms such as Escherichia coli. The aim of this project is to develop mathematical models to understand how sea urchin sperm reach and fertilize the egg in a marine environment. This research will also shed light onto aspects of mammalian sperm motility and will be relevant to diagnosing infertility and developing contraceptives."

Recent evidence suggests that this property can be maintained down to the subcellular level, in the form of topographically organized inputs onto the extended arborizations (dendrites) of single cells (neurons). The goal of this project is to identify the key principles underlying the processing of such topographic inputs in the dendrites of a prototypical neuron.  The project focuses on a nerve cell that is most sensitive to objects approaching on a collision course with the animal and that is implicated in generating collision avoidance behaviors.  The investigators use tools developed to study partial differential equations to determine the detailed dendritic distribution of the cell's ion channels.  Next, techniques designed to reduce the complexity of mathematical models are used, as well as to simultaneously respect the topography of inputs, to extract a simplified representation of the neuron?s signal processing characteristics.  This allows the investigators to characterize the role played by the neuron's dendrites in generating the responses of the neuron to objects approaching on a collision course.  Particular focus is on understanding the invariance of responses to objects approaching from different directions.<br/><br/>The survival of all animals, including humans, critically depends on the neuronal processing of impending dangers. This project sheds light on how the brain accomplishes this feat in a particular model system ideally suited for this purpose.   Mathematical tools are generated and are made available to other researchers to analyze neurons with similar properties in other contexts.  Additionally, the project contributes to our basic understanding of brain function that may eventually lead to better cures for diseases affecting sensory perception.

Nonlinear regenerative inward currents are thought to be important in producing slow oscillations and bursting.  This project uses a novel approach where the nonlinear inward current is replaced with a linear current of negative conductance.  This approach exposes the multiple roles played by regenerative inward currents and simplifies the investigation of the contribution of other ionic currents to oscillatory activity.  It also allows for a simpler mathematical analysis of the mechanisms that generate neuronal oscillations.  This methodology is used to investigate the role of specific ionic currents in the generation and shaping of oscillations in individual neurons, to examine how synaptic interactions between neurons cooperate or compete with intrinsic properties to produce oscillations in networks of heterogeneous neurons, and to determine if the mechanisms that give rise to oscillations in isolated cells remain unchanged when the neuron is part of a network.  These aims are pursued using techniques of dynamical systems and bifurcation theory in reduced mathematical models as well as simulations of detailed biophysical models, and electrophysiological experiments on bursting neurons of the crab pyloric network.  These three methods are developed in parallel allowing for continual exchange of findings between the theoretical and experimental approaches.<br/><br/>Numerous behaviors ranging from locomotion to cognitive tasks rely on oscillatory activity generated by networks of neurons in the brain.  Despite the predominance and indispensability of brain oscillations, few theoretical tools are available for understanding how such oscillations are generated or controlled.  A novel approach is used that combines biological experiments and mathematical analysis to break apart the complex interactions present in network components into simple building blocks.  This allows core elements that are important in the generation of oscillations to be extracted and will clarify the role of other existing components in sculpting behavior using mathematical models.  The models are tested through experiments that connect real time computer-simulated neurons to small oscillatory networks in the crab central nervous systems.  This project provides a framework for developing neural-based control systems with potential applications in robotics and bio-inspired computing."

Consequently, the immune system attempts to build a response that is broad enough to handle the diversity of virus strains present. Biological experiments have shown that neutralizing antibodies fail to offer long-term protection because they are primarily strain-specific and lag behind viral evolution. The proposed research presents a thorough investigation of the antibody mediated immune responses against HIV with an emphasis on their neutralizing and non-neutralizing activity. Novel mathematical models of antibody responses following infection with HIV are developed, analyzed using asymptotic analysis, bifurcation analysis and numerical analysis, and validated against biological data in order to quantify the relative importance of biological processes in influencing disease evolution. The investigator aims to discover which factors (host or virus specific) influence the outcome of the infection. The specific goals are in understanding (1) the roles of competition and cross-reactivity between families of neutralizing antibodies in the presence and absence of virus evolution; (2) the necessity of antibodies to neutralize every viral spike; and (3) the role of non-neutralizing antibodies. All these questions will have implications for vaccine development as well as for disease prognosis.<br/>The ability of HIV to persist in an infected individual and eventually cause AIDS depends on its avoidance of the immune system. Of the two immune mechanisms present, the cellular response is better understood, while the antibody response is still under investigation. Understanding of how antibodies respond to the virus is crucial for the success of any future vaccine candidate, especially since current therapeutic vaccines focus on inducing both arms of the immune response. The goal of this proposal is to investigate how particular biological interactions can lead to an efficient antibody response during both immunization and natural infection with HIV. Given the difficulty and cost of experimentally examining all of the biological interactions involved, we consider alternative methods for testing new hypotheses. They consist of the development, analysis and validation against biological data of mathematical models, with the goal of providing insight into the dynamics of antibody responses. This knowledge may eventually guide treatment and prevention, and assist in establishing immunological goals for an effective AIDS vaccine. The research aims to promote the advancement of mathematical and biological knowledge, provide an opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers in the mathematical and medical communities, and lead to the training of graduate and undergraduate students. The PI plans to incorporate ideas and results from the proposed research into a first year graduate Mathematical Biology course, as well as a summer course directed at undergraduate mathematics majors across Louisiana, and to engage with graduate and undergraduate students to incorporate this research as part of their dissertation and summer research programs."

The dearth of tractable methods of analysis for such datasets is a major bottleneck in the collection and analysis of molecular variation data. The focus is on a method that has arisen in response to the size of modern genetic variation datasets: approximate Bayesian computation [ABC]. The use of ABC has grown rapidly over the last decade, but is generally conducted in a relatively ad-hoc manner in that key choices are made in a subjective way. Aiming to put the method onto firmer foundations, they develop approaches that systematize some of the key choices of an ABC analysis. For example, they suggest that improvements are achieved by introducing a weighting scheme for summary statistics, and by systematically choosing those weights, along with other features of the analysis, as well as automatically constructing efficient low-dimensional summaries of the data. Such approaches are much needed in the ABC world. They then apply these methods to a system that represents a perfect test-bed: the parameterization of agent-based models of fly group behavior. This application is to an experimental framework considerably more complex than most current behavioral studies.<br/><br/>We are in the midst of the Information Age, arguably the third great revolution experienced by humankind. In the agricultural revolution, a radical change in the way in which food was obtained led to great increases in its production rate and consequent great increases in population levels. In the industrial revolution, the wide-scale introduction of industrial machinery led to vastly increased industrial output and efficiency. Both of these prior revolutions have led to exponential increase in the rate at which their products (food and goods, respectively) were produced, and this eventually led to significant improvements in quality of life for the human species. The Information Age is also resulting in an exponential increase in the rate at which its product, information, is gathered, and holds forth the same hope of great improvements in our quality of life. However, the vast amounts of information now being generated can only be fully utilized once the ability to successfully deliver those data in understandable forms - i.e., analysis machinery - is developed. For this reason the investigators here develop systematic mathematical approaches that can successfully analyze datasets of extremely high dimension and thereby make intelligible the large numbers of higher order interactions that are likely to exist within such data. The approach the investigators develop here helps transform many aspects of analyses of behavior and well-being."

A hallmark of cell polarity is spatial localization.  From a modeling point of view, spatial localization cannot be understood without proper modeling of the spatial dynamics governing its creation and time evolution.  At the same time, spatial dynamics are profoundly influenced by stochastic events that manifest as cellular noise. Therefore, deep understanding of cell polarity inevitably requires the proper modeling, simulation, and analysis of stochastic spatial dynamics.  The fundamental problem limiting work in this area in the past has been the computational complexity of stochastic spatial simulations.  This project develops the experimental data and algorithms for modeling, simulation and analysis of spatial stochastic dynamics arising in cell polarity in the yeast pheromone response system.  A novel algorithm is developed to address the computationally intensive task of spatial stochastic simulation.  The algorithm is then further developed and then integrated into a powerful software infrastructure to enable its widespread use.  Experiments capable of capturing stochastic variability inform model development and analysis.<br/><br/>Software developed as a result of this project enables routine simulation of highly complex spatial stochastic phenomena across the sciences and engineering.  All software will be made widely available.  Tutorial courses and presentations at meetings and workshops will be given to ensure the accessibility of the research.  Graduate students involved in this project are provided with a unique, highly multidisciplinary research experience.  Students at UCSB work as a tightly-knit team co-advised by Petzold and Khammash, with extended visits to UCI to work in Yi's experimental lab, learning about the possibilities and limitations of the experimental techniques.  UCI students focused on experiment spend significant time at UCSB working with the modelers, learning first-hand what the systems-level approach can bring to biological research."

Molecular studies of embryogenesis have identified morphogen gradients in systems as diverse as body axes specification in insects and patterning of mammalian neocortex. Current studies of morphogen gradients move in an increasingly quantitative direction and demand the development of a rigorous theoretical framework that can be used to interpret experimental results and guide systems-level analyses of pattern formation mechanisms. This project develops such a framework, emphasizing the dynamics of morphogen gradient formation. This research combines rigorous mathematical and computational analysis of a general class of reaction-diffusion models of morphogen gradient formation and application of these models to a specific pattern formation event in Drosophila embryo.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of proposed work include the development of a general mathematical framework for a highly conserved biological process. One of the main outcomes of proposed activity is a set of analytical results that can be used for the back-of-the-envelope analysis of pattern formation dynamics in a wide range of developmental systems. The proposed theoretical and experimental studies go hand-in-hand with the development of educational program that provides interdisciplinary training in the emerging field of developmental systems biology."

While researchers are only just beginning to understand the complex roles that these microbes play in human biology, it is clear that specific changes in microbial flora are associated with and sometimes cause or cure disease in the host. Most microbiome research to date has focused on describing the taxonomic composition of communities in different body sites (e.g., gut, mouth, elbow skin) or in a single site across disease groups. The goal of this project is to move microbiome research from descriptions of ""who is out there?"" towards characterizations of ""what they are doing?"". To do so the investigators will develop new methodology for analyzing shotgun metagenomic data, which is a pooled sample of DNA extracted and sequenced from the various microbes in a community. Because the sequences represent short segments of the genomes of many organisms, metagenomics provides a snapshot of the protein repertoire of a microbiome community. This rich data holds great promise and also presents many challenges for data analysis. To meet these challenges, the investigators will first design and validate a bioinformatics pipeline to classify metagenomic sequences into protein families. The key component of this tool will be hidden Markov models describing the evolutionary profile of every known microbial protein, enabling accurate characterization of the protein functions present in a sample. Second, they will derive novel stochastic models to predict the occurrence of protein families in a metagenomic sample given data about the demographic and clinical characteristics of a patient. These models, based on concepts from ecology and convex geometry, will allow the investigators to estimate, draw, and statistically compare the shapes of protein niches in high-dimensional phenotype space. Finally, they will produce a medical Niche Atlas that will link protein distributions to disease states via a publicly accessible, user-friendly visualization tool and database. This project will produce new mathematical theory and novel computational tools for microbiome research, drug development, and bioprospecting. In addition to immediate impacts on microbiome research, our mathematical results will be useful for spatial modeling in other fields, such as ecology, sociology, and epidemiology.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to develop computational resources and stochastic models that will shed light on the complex relationship between the health of an individual and the activities of the microbes living in and on his/her body. This research will generate a medical Niche Atlas that will map the distributions of microbial protein functions across individuals with different clinical characteristics (e.g., diseases, diets, or treatments). Just as a geographic atlas makes cartographic expertise accessible to a layperson, our Niche Atlas will allow researchers, students, clinicians, and any curious person to easily explore the functional capabilities of the human microbiome from a computer terminal. Its protein niche maps will visually display the range of patient characteristics at which each microbial protein is likely to occur and how these ranges differ across disease states. We will leverage this capability as a graduate teaching tool, for outreach and communication through public media, and to establish experimental collaborations to test the hypotheses we generate about the roles of microbiome proteins in human diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease. These investigations will aim to identify new disease biomarkers, including microbiome proteins that can be used to diagnose onset of disease in patient subpopulations where early diagnosis is currently difficult. The Niche Atlas will also enable development of personalized treatments and preventions based on knowledge of an individual?s microbiome. Together, these freely accessible resources will significantly broaden access to cutting-edge medicine."

The bacterial chromosome is circular and replication invariably results in the formation of interlinked daughter chromosomes. Error-free unlinking is required to ensure proper segregation at cell division and stable plasmid inheritance. Type II topoisomerases unlink replication links. In Escherichia coli, in the absence of topo IV (a type II topoisomerase credited with chromosome unlinking), the site-specific recombination system XerCD mediates sister chromosome unlinking. This reaction is activated at the division septum by a powerful translocase FtsK, which coordinates the last stages of chromosome segregation. The mechanism by which the XerCD-FtsK complex simplifies the topology of DNA remains unclear. The main objective of the proposed studies is to characterize the topological mechanism of DNA unlinking by the XerCD-FtsK system using knot theory, low-dimensional topology, and computer simulations.  There is evidence that after being activated by FtsK, the enzymes XerCD unlink DNA in a stepwise manner. The tangle method will be used to find possible topological pathways of DNA unknotting and unlinking by site-specific recombination on small substrates. A computer model of DNA recombination will be developed, adapted to the Xer-FtsK system, and combined with the analytical results to analyze experimental data obtained from the Sherratt lab. The research is highly interdisciplinary and involves close collaboration with groups in Japan, Canada and the UK. Such collaborations will facilitate state-of-the-art student cross-training. Basic information about DNA topology will be disseminated to the general public, including elementary school children and visitors to the California Academy of Sciences. <br/><br/><br/>DNA replication is the basis for biological inheritance. In bacteria, reproduction starts with replication of the chromosome into two identical daughter molecules, followed by segregation of the newly replicated chromosomes and division of the parent cell into two daughter cells. In circular chromosomes, problems of entanglement during DNA linking complicate the process of chromosome segregation. In Escherichia coli, DNA unlinking is typically mediated by the enzyme topoIV, which is an important drug target for quinolone antimicrobial agents. Understanding DNA unlinking by Xer recombination, in addition to providing a more complete picture of the chromosome segregation process, is highly relevant for drug design. Mathematical and computational tools are very useful for studying the action of enzymes that change the topology of DNA. In this project such tools will be used to characterize all unlinking pathways and to reveal the mechanism of unlinking by Xer. The educational goal is to develop new and effective ways to disseminate knowledge related to DNA topology and its biological significance, as well as to increase public awareness of the critical role of mathematics in understanding biological processes. The proposed plans include the creation of Math Circles for elementary school children in San Francisco and the development of a series of educational materials for public consumption in collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences. This will culminate in the production of an exhibit on DNA topology for the general public in the California Academy of Sciences Museum."

Models of both individual vessel segments and networks of multiple vessels will be developed in coordination with a systematic analysis of experimental data that employs parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis techniques. The highly integrative and interdisciplinary nature of this study will yield outcomes that can lead to new standards for modeling cardiovascular dynamics in vessel networks.

Although HAART can often suppress the plasma viral loads of HIV-infected individuals to below the detection limit of current standard assays, it cannot eradicate the virus from patients.  HIV can be identified in resting memory CD4+ T cells (the latent reservoir) and persists at a low level in the presence of HAART for a prolonged period of time.  These latently infected cells decay slowly, but can produce virions when activated by their relevant antigens.  The mechanisms underlying low viral load persistence and extremely slow decay of the latent reservoir are not fully understood.  The first part of this project is to develop novel mathematical models to study the long-term dynamics of both virus and the latent reservoir during HIV treatment.  Models will be analyzed and predictions will be compared with data to test the mechanisms.  Since HIV infection requires lifelong therapy at present, efficient control strategies are urgently needed to reduce treatment cost and toxicity associated with long-term drug use.  The second part of the project is to develop control strategies using the models of HIV persistence we developed in the first part.  Practical treatment schedules such as structured treatment interruptions are also obtained using the developed models.  <br/><br/>The project represents an effort to develop control strategies based on mathematical models whose predictions agree with much of our knowledge about HIV infection and prolonged treatment.  Results improve our understanding of the biological events underlying HIV persistence and may have important implications for the management of HIV infection in the era of HAART.  If the control strategies, particularly those interrupted treatment schedules, can be shown to provide similar treatment benefits as the continuous therapy with maximum drug use, they will significantly reduce the financial burden, minimize drug toxicity, and improve the life quality of HIV patients.  Additionally, the project provides extensive interdisciplinary training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from the math and biology departments, as well as the new medical school at Oakland University.  The research will be incorporated into a graduate mathematical biology course and a variety of undergraduate research programs, most of which place priority on involving minority students."

Recent evidence suggests that this property can be maintained down to the subcellular level, in the form of topographically organized inputs onto the extended arborizations (dendrites) of single cells (neurons). The goal of this project is to identify the key principles underlying the processing of such topographic inputs in the dendrites of a prototypical neuron.  The project focuses on a nerve cell that is most sensitive to objects approaching on a collision course with the animal and that is implicated in generating collision avoidance behaviors.  The investigators use tools developed to study partial differential equations to determine the detailed dendritic distribution of the cell's ion channels.  Next, techniques designed to reduce the complexity of mathematical models are used, as well as to simultaneously respect the topography of inputs, to extract a simplified representation of the neuron?s signal processing characteristics.  This allows the investigators to characterize the role played by the neuron's dendrites in generating the responses of the neuron to objects approaching on a collision course.  Particular focus is on understanding the invariance of responses to objects approaching from different directions.<br/><br/>The survival of all animals, including humans, critically depends on the neuronal processing of impending dangers. This project sheds light on how the brain accomplishes this feat in a particular model system ideally suited for this purpose.   Mathematical tools are generated and are made available to other researchers to analyze neurons with similar properties in other contexts.  Additionally, the project contributes to our basic understanding of brain function that may eventually lead to better cures for diseases affecting sensory perception.   Finally, the results of this project could potentially find applications in the design of autonomous robots."

A common problem, and the focus of this project, is how to elicit the properties of such a graph when only pairwise distances between objects are available.  This project responds to the case when there is missing data; that is, when there exist pairs of objects for which pairwise distance information is not supplied.  To do so, it introduces the concept of partially-supplied graphs and develops their mathematical properties.  Emphasis is on uncovering the spectral properties of Laplacian matrices that represent partially-supplied graphs, with the goal of relating eigenvectors to the underlying graphical structure.  Subsequently, this research will exploit a connection between the Laplacian matrices of partially-supplied graphs and pairwise distance matrices with missing data.  Doing so will provide a missing link between larger graphs of biological objects and smaller matrices representing a subset of vertices of these graphs.<br/><br/>This project has an arc spanning more than fifty years.  It is motivated by a particular type of data and a particular type of analysis that recurs, decade after decade, throughout the biological sciences.  As a result, this project will address a number of long-standing questions.  One such question concerns evolutionary trees, which are graphs whose vertices are species, including those that are extinct.  Fossils aside, only extant species yield data, and thus evolutionary trees can be thought of as partially-supplied.  Using this observation, the project will rectify two major branches of biological systematics that represent extant species data in seemingly different ways.  Simultaneously, this research contributes a new perspective to the mathematical literature on graph theory by introducing graphs with missing data.  Thus, this project sits directly at the interface between mathematics and biology, and it supports a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher to be trained as interdisciplinary scientists. More broadly, this research serves as an example of the synergy between fields, showing how biology can advance mathematics while mathematics is advancing biology.  As such, it is hoped that dissemination of this work will motivate mathematically gifted students toward the biological sciences."

These pathways, which control all aspects of cell physiology, have turned out to be very complex, with many interactions and feedbacks between different parts of the network.  How can we move beyond identifying new network components and interactions and develop a detailed, quantitative understanding of their behavior?  How can we translate the static biochemical description of molecular regulatory networks into a dynamic, functional one?  Questions like these gave birth to the interdisciplinary field of computational cell biology, which applies the mathematics of dynamical systems with computer simulations to develop new insights and understanding of fundamental biological processes.  This discipline is focused on combining quantitative experimental data with mathematical models and simulation of the molecular machinery (genes-proteinsmetabolites) that underlie the physiological behavior of living cells.  The proposed conference on Computational Cell Biology is intended to bring together a diverse group of scientists, studying various molecular, structural, and functional aspects of cellular processes, using computational approaches.  This meeting is intended to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas, information, and approaches, and to discuss the latest research findings and technical advances towards understanding cells at a quantitative and theoretical level.  The size and location of this meeting facilitates interactions between experimentalists and theoreticians, which are vital for an interdisciplinary field such as computational cell biology.

Controlling inflammation, while a key focus of clinicians, is a challenging endeavor.  The complexity of the inflammatory response makes it extremely difficult to predict the effects of therapeutic interventions. Much needed effort has been put toward the creation of mathematical models to better understand the mechanisms that orchestrate a systemic inflammatory response.  However, little work has been done to develop strategies to control the process and restore a dysfunctional inflammatory response to a healthy equilibrium by delivering appropriate interventions in the correct amounts and at the right times.  The main goal of our proposal then is to modify existing and develop new techniques to address this need."

The PI proposes to introduce a novel unified statistical framework to handle large-scale genetic data, and to study its theoretical properties. Within this unified framework, a number of relevant problems can be addressed. The PI will investigate a series of association testing strategies with rare genetic variants that complement and generalize available methods for case-control designs to general designs involving individuals related in an arbitrary fashion. Moreover, the PI will develop an analytic theory to investigate the most powerful statistical designs for association studies with rare variants. The proposed methods will be tested on a broad range of simulated data, and real data from the PIs' collaborators.<br/> <br/>The recent progress in genomic technologies has lead to large amounts of genetic data being generated. The emergence of such large-scale, sparse genetic data poses great statistical challenges that require novel and powerful approaches to efficiently extract the information contained in the data. While theoretical, the statistical methods proposed here have the potential to directly contribute to the understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex human traits. To maximize their impact, the proposed methods will be implemented into a software package to be made available to the larger scientific community. Beyond its scientific importance, the project has the potential to contribute to the higher goal of improving the public health. The project also has a strong educational component, and will provide valuable research experience for students and postdoctoral fellows."

The objective is to derive an effective surface approximation for the partition, after which multiple-scales will be used to derive an asymptotic approximation of the nonlinear waves propagating in the cochlea.  The objective is to be able to achieve quantitative agreement with the known properties of these waves, including the apical shift in the tuning curve at low intensity levels, the decrease of the relative contribution of the amplifier with increasing stimulus level, the odd-order distortion tones, the observation that the temporal position of the zero-crossings on the basilar membrane remain largely unaffected by stimulus intensity, and the dearth of harmonic distortion in the basilar membrane response to pure tones at low to moderate sound pressure levels in the basal portion of the cochlea.<br/><br/>The fundamental open question in understanding how we hear concerns the role of a nonlinear feedback  mechanism known as the cochlear amplifier.  One of the reasons why progress in delineating the exact mechanism responsible for amplification is so slow is that it requires the solution of a three-dimensional, coupled, nonlinear, time-dependent system.  The PI proposes to develop approximation methods that can be used to help study this problem, both the mechanistic basis for amplification as well as its effects on wave propagation in the cochlea.  The results from this study will provide a rigorous framework to help answer the amplifier question."

The field encompasses several topics that have been studied long enough to be well established in their own right such as calcium signaling, molecular motors and cell motility, the cell cycle, and gene expression during development. In addition to providing a recognizable larger community for topics such as these, this course will provide a base for the development of newer areas of inquiry -- for example the dynamics of intracellular second-messenger signaling, of programmed cell death, of mitotic chromosome movements, and of synthetic gene networks. Unlike computational genomics or bioinformatics, computational cell biology is focused on simulation of the molecular machinery (genes-proteins-metabolites) that underlie the physiological behavior (input-output characteristics) of living cells.<br/><br/>The three week course in Computational Cell Biology will incorporate a series of didactic lectures on the mathematics of dynamical systems, computational simulation techniques, cell biology and molecular biology. Practicing theoreticians and experimentalists will rotate in for 1-3 day visits during the course to give lectures and interact with the students. Midway through the course, students will select an area for independent study, and the focus of the last week of the course will largely be on these projects, supplemented by continued visiting lecturers."
