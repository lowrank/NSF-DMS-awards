In doing so, this research will bring together two complementary perspectives on what controls neural activity in sensory systems: receptive fields and neural network dynamics.  In joint work with Carina Curto, we have developed a novel theoretical approach that enables building stimulus spaces directly from neural activity, thus circumventing knowledge of network connectivity and of receptive fields that may be difficult to communicate from one area of the brain to another.  This is achieved using some elegant ideas from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry that are largely unknown to neuroscientists, and opens up a new avenue for the analysis of the structure and function of recurrent neural networks.  By investigating compatibility conditions between patterns of activity emerging from recurrent neural networks and experimentally observed receptive fields, this project will find constraints on recurrent network connectivity, ultimately generating experimentally testable predictions.  The theoretical framework will also be translated into novel data analysis tools that will be useful for in analyzing large-scale electrophysiological recordings. <br/><br/>A central question in neuroscience is to understand how the brain creates representations of the external world.  Although a great deal of experimental work has uncovered correlations between neural activity and sensory stimuli, there is very little understanding of how the brain encodes relationships between distinct stimuli of similar type.  This research develops a novel theoretical framework to investigate this question by studying the interplay between stimulus encoding and the structure of recurrent neural circuits, typical of mammalian brain areas such as neocortex and hippocampus.  The findings will yield new insight into the role of neural circuits in learning and memory, and of how the brain organizes knowledge.  Progress in the basic understanding of neural circuits is essential for improving our understanding of learning disabilities and diseases (such as epilepsy and schizophrenia) that are believed to be related to the malfunction of neural circuits."

The first two projects are primarily concerned with stimulus representation via recurrent networks, while the third project focuses on spontaneous activity.  Project 1 formalizes and develops an algebra-geometric framework previously introduced in joint work with Vladimir Itskov. The main idea is to associate geometry and topology to population spike train data -- primarily from electrophysiological recordings in cortex and hippocampus.  Project 2 explores the relationship between stimulus space topology and recurrent network connectivity.  The goal of this project is to find experimental predictions about the connectivity of recurrent networks in cases where either the stimulus space structure or the topographic structure of the underlying network is known.  Project 3 investigates the interaction between the activity of single neurons and the population activity of the local network.<br/><br/>Building accurate representations of the world is one of the basic functions of the brain.  When a stimulus is paired with pleasure or pain, an animal quickly learns the association.  However, we also learn the (neutral) relationships between stimuli of the same type.  For example, a bar held at a 45-degree angle seems closer to one held at 50 degrees than to a perfectly vertical one.  Upon hearing a pair of distinct pure tones, one seems higher than the other.  We do not perceive the world as a stream of unrelated stimuli; rather, our brains organize different types of stimuli into structured stimulus spaces.  Regardless of immediate relevance to survival, it appears to be beneficial for the brain to reflect as much structure as possible of the outside world.  The main goal of this research is to improve our understanding of how stimulus spaces are represented via recurrent networks in the brain.  To this end, we develop ideas and techniques coming from geometry and topology to extract novel insights from neuroscience experiments.  How the brain represents the world is a fundamental and age-old question.  Progress in understanding how the structure of neural circuits underlies representational functions may also provide clues in the study of neurological disease."

All organisms must respond to changes and stresses in their environment to survive and reproduce.  Such environmental stresses include changes in nutrient or oxygen availability, changes in osmolarity or pH, the presence of reactive oxygen species or other damaging agents, and sudden or large changes in temperature.  Organisms respond to environmental stresses through characteristic programs of gene expression.  Among the most interesting and challenging problems in understanding this environmental stress response is the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks within the cell.  The careful regulation of these networks is a fundamental activity of the organism.  The objectives of this project are (1) to identify the network of transcription factors that regulate the response to cold shock in budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, through a combination of mining of publicly available data, the genetic screening of systematic yeast deletion strains and the analysis of in-house microarray data, and a Bayesian approach to network reconstruction based on our model; (2) to analyze the model, comparing it to deterministic chemical kinetic and dynamic Bayesian network models in development and use in the research community; (3) to develop models of the additional exogenous perturbations of multiple temperature shifts and the resultant affect on growth rate for integration into the stochastic dynamic network model; (4) to test the model predictions experimentally using qRT-PCR and DNA microarrays on both total RNA and transcriptionally active mRNA, in both wild type and gene deletion strains, improving the model through successive rounds of simulation and experiment; and (5) to develop and analyze a general mathematical modeling framework suitable for studying a wide variety of gene regulatory networks. <br/><br/>The invention of high-throughput genomics methods has transformed 21st century biology from a ?one gene at a time? approach to the analysis of whole systems.  Baker?s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is an ideal model organism to study because it grows quickly and the expression of all 6000 genes can be measured in a single experiment.  While this ability to measure the expression of all the genes at once is a significant first step towards understanding fundamental cellular processes and the defects that lead to disease, it is still only a ?parts list?.  Just as listing the numbers and kinds of boards, nails, bricks, and mortar it takes to build a house does not explain how the house is put together, simply measuring all of the genes does not explain how cells function and respond to environmental stresses.  Instead, to understand cell function, we need to understand the rules that govern which genes are expressed under what circumstances and how the genes interact with each other.  In short, we need to understand how this complex gene regulatory network changes over time.  In this project, we will build a mathematical model that can be used to make testable predictions about cell function.  Our approach offers the potential to synthesize a number of seemingly disparate techniques of gene regulatory analysis currently being used.  The research program will also yield biological insight into the overall regulatory mechanism of the response to cold shock in yeast, which is poorly understood.  Our work will determine the particular regulatory factors involved, the extent of environmental stress response pathway overlap, and will provide a measure of the direct and indirect effects of individual factors.  The mathematical techniques we develop should provide a fruitful framework for the integration of dynamic modeling and statistical analysis of gene expression data and should be broadly applicable to the biology of complex organisms.  In particular, a model that explicitly deals with the indirect effects of genes in a regulatory network should provide insight into the causes of complex diseases such as cancer where multiple genes and environmental effects are involved.<br/><br/>"

New advances in the applications of game-theoretic methods to epidemiology problems show how large-population approximations can be used to predict the limitations of specific public health measures.  By leveraging the substantial body of existing research on the dynamics of populations distributed in space, including metapopulations and reaction-diffusion equations, this project applies and extends the recent research to explain patterns the daily activities of individuals.  In particular, the investigators are addressing epidemiological questions of how geographically heterogeneous risks of infection influence prophylactic measures.  The team seeks to understand how spatially explicit mixing alters Nash equilibrium strategies and determines how far the influence from hot spots of risk can extend.  We are also undertaking studies to expand classical theories like that of Isaacs so that we can study basic behaviors in few-player games like predation avoidance which are potentially important in the dynamics of ecosystems.  These explorations should reveal foundational challenges regarding the specification of problems and their solution, and translational challenges like algorithm development and numerical approximation.  The project as a whole opens up new exciting avenues of applied mathematics research in spatial ecology and sustainable management that intersects the fields of ecology, economics, sociology, and epidemiology, which can attract talented junior and senior mathematicians in analysis, dynamics, and numerics.  The graduate student training funded by the grant is highly valued in both industry and government.<br/><br/>The theory of the sustainable management of resources, ecosystems, communities, and our environment is complex, requiring the simultaneous accounting of economic processes, natural processes, and the feedbacks between the two.  One aspect of sustainable management theory needing more attention is the identification of how geography and spatial distributions of resources and risks mediate the feedbacks between economic and natural processes; from pollution to water supplies to agriculture, the actions of economic agents can have unintended consequences for near-by and distant neighbors.  Geographic effects can make it hard to anticipate the full consequences of an economic activity or regulatory action, to the extent that important information is often missing in the policy-design process.  Mathematical models like the ones under development are valuable supplements to this missing information, and help us allocate scarce community and government resources efficiently.  This project contributes to the development of some basic predictions of how populations should react to the geographically dispersed risks, allowing more rational risk mitigation.  These results and the research they stimulate lead to a better understand ecological processes so that the nation may confront the long-term environmental challenges that now exist."

A quantitatively predictive model that describes the bulk motion of many cells will have broad impact across many areas of biology and biophysics.  This research will combine the general physical features of single cell crawling with a physiologically realistic description of cell-cell adhesion and cell-cell interaction in order to develop a mathematical model for the collective movements of cells in tissue.  Specifically, the model will address a number of experimentally-measured behaviors that occur in wound healing assays.  For example, recent experiments have shown that there are complex motions and long-range correlations of the movements of cells in epithelial monolayers.  In addition, during wound healing assays it is observed that the wound edge undergoes a fingering-like instability, and the average progression of the wound border expands at a supra-linear rate with respect to time.  This research will develop and test a continuum model for the collective migration of eukaryotic cells in tissue, with an emphasis toward explaining the dynamics of epithelial cell monolayers during wound closure.  Most of the model parameters will be set using existing experimental data; however, some parameters are currently unknown.  Therefore, comparison of the model with existing experimental data will allow us to set ranges on these unknown parameters and will suggest new experiments to test the predictions of the model. Analytic and numerical methods will be used to analyze the model for free boundary problems corresponding to two different wound closure experiments, and the model will be used to explore three-dimensional motility in bulk tissue.<br/><br/>To build an organism out of a vast number of cells requires coordination and the ability to move cells from one place to another.  Therefore, during development of an organism, it is not surprising that groups of cells often migrate together, as a semi-cohesive unit.  Similar migratory behavior is also seen during wound healing and cancer metastasis.  This project explores the physics of this motility and the mechanism by which the physical behavior of cells helps maintain the overall coordination of the group.  A mathematical model will be developed that takes into account the gross behavior of motile cells, considering the forces generated by an individual cell and the interactions between neighboring cells.  This model will be used to describe the behavior of a wounded layer of cells, and the predictions will be tested by comparing them to data from experiments that mimic wounded tissues.    The results from this project will provide a deeper understanding of many important biological processes, such as organism development, cancer metastasis, and even the motions of dense communities of swimming bacteria.  The strong interdisciplinary nature of the research makes it ideal for training graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to be able to work at the interface between biology, mathematics, and physics."

Most phylogenetic model-based methods implicitly assume neutral evolution of molecular sequences. However, selection often drives genetic material to the same state, making phylogenetic methods erroneously conclude that some sequences are more closely related than they really are. Although it is widely accepted that such selection-driven convergent evolution biases phylogenetic estimation, no statistically rigorous treatment of this problem exists. The investigators of this project develop a radically novel neutral phylogenetic reconstruction method that remedies the convergent evolution problem by excluding signatures of selection from observed data. The method is based on a new framework for estimating partially observed continuous-time Markov chains. Although the focus of this proposal is evolutionary biology, the novel estimation principle opens a new direction in the field of inference for stochastic processes and covers a wide range of  Markov chain applications. The investigators apply the newly developed framework to several important problems in evolutionary biology. First, they infuse neutral phylogenetic reconstruction into population genetics, which critically depends on the assumption of neutrality. Next, the authors use their new estimation framework to distinguish recombination and convergent evolution, an urgent problem in evolutionary studies of human pathogens. Lastly, the investigators employ their neutral phylogenetic reconstruction method to study the functional role of convergent evolution in the core genes of Escherichia coli. This last analytical task is accompanied by deep sequencing of hundreds of genes across a large number of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains.<br/><br/><br/>Viruses and bacteria can rapidly adapt their genetic material in response to changes in the environment. This amazing genetic plasticity enables many human pathogens to develop drug resistance and escape our immune system even when the latter is assisted by the infusion of appropriate vaccines. Therefore, understanding evolution of viruses and bacteria is critical for developing therapies and vaccines aimed at suppressing harmful effects of these pathogens on the human body. The investigators of this proposal develop novel statistical tools aimed at improving our ability to reconstruct evolutionary histories of rapidly evolving pathogens. These new methods, implemented in freely available software packages, will find extensive use in biological laboratories that study human pathogens such as hepatitis, influenza, human immunodeficiency  virus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella. In addition to the theoretical part of the project, the investigators will undertake an extensive analysis of Escherichia coli genes in order to illuminate evolutionary mechanisms that allow this bacteria to adapt to new environments. This new knowledge will allow the investigators to shed light on biochemical processes that transform Escherichia coli, normally a harmless resident of the human intestine, to a dangerous pathogen in other parts of the human body."

This project is concerned with a mathematical and computational investigation of such complex interactions in two systems during Drosophila embryonic development.  The first part of the project is to investigate roles of the Dally-like protein, a membrane bound and non-diffusive protein, on Wingless morphogen distribution and signaling in the imaginal wing disc.  The second part of the project is to investigate roles of certain feedback loops in sharpening morphogen gradients and noise reduction during dorsal-ventral patterning in early development.  In addition, the investigator will develop efficient and accurate numerical methods with adaptive mesh refinement for stiff reaction-diffusion equations in complex geometries, in order to meet the computational challenges arising in the mathematical models of such complex biological systems.<br/><br/>Many patterns of cell and tissue organization are specified during development by gradients of morphogens, substances that instruct cells to adopt different fates at different spatial locations.  The work seeks to provide better understanding on embryonic tissue patterning and formation of morphogen gradients through mathematical modeling and computational analysis.  The models are based on known experimental observations, and they explicitly incorporate the key morphogens, their regulators, and the important processes that are known from experiments to influence morphogen-mediated patterning.  The project addresses how robust embryonic tissue patterns arise from complex interactions of many components and processes, and how the embryo shape affects morphogen-mediated patterning as embryonic development usually occurs in three-dimensional spatial geometries.  The study requires development of new computational tools that can efficiently handle complex systems of equations arising from modeling embryonic development.  The developed framework and models will be applicable broadly to various morphogen systems in different animal models.  Quantitative theories of morphogenesis, based on mechanistic models with close integration with experiments, will advance our understanding of embryonic development.  Such studies may lead to better understanding and treatment of birth defects and other human diseases related to abnormal embryonic development.  The research project is interdisciplinary and hence will enhance interdisciplinary training at the interface between mathematics and biology for the students associated with the project."

These oscillations are crucial for the normal regulation of blood glucose levels, and loss of oscillations is linked to type II diabetes. Rhythmic insulin secretion from pancreatic islets of Langerhans is due to rhythmic bursting electrical activity in the beta-cells, and a consequent rhythm in the intracellular calcium concentration.  Both the intracellular calcium and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) feed back onto the cell's electrical subsystem, opening or closing ion channels and thus affecting the cell's electrical activity. This project focuses on the metabolic subsystem that produces ATP, and on a mathematical analysis of previously-developed models of metabolismdriven bursting and the fast electrical bursting that occurs in single beta-cells that are isolated from the islet.  The central hypothesis is that the slow electrical bursting oscillations and episodic bursting that are often exhibited by pancreatic islets, and that have the same period as insulin oscillations observed in vivo, are driven by oscillations in metabolism. One mechanism for these oscillations is in glycolysis, the first stage of glucose metabolism. However, it is possible that oscillations inherent in one of the other two stages of metabolism, the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, could be the slow process that drives slow bursting activity and that clusters faster bursts together into periodic episodes. This possibility will be investigated using mathematical modeling and analysis, as will what measurements of periodicity in citric acid cycle intermediates indicate about the mechanism of the oscillations. Returning to the glycolytic component of metabolism, modeling studies will be conducted in parallel with experimental studies in a collaborating laboratory to determine how the enzyme phosphosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2) may modulate glycolytic oscillations.<br/><br/>Insulin secretion in mammals, including rats, humans, dogs, and humans, is pulsatile, with a period of about five minutes. These insulin oscillations, which can be measured in the blood, are important for normal glucose homeostasis, since disruption of the oscillations is linked to type II diabetes. Insulin is secreted from micro-organs in the pancreas called Islets of Langerhans, composed largely of insulin-secreting beta-cells. For more than a decade now, the principal investigator has been investigating the biophysical mechanism for the oscillations in insulin secretion. This research involves mathematical modeling and analysis, and parallel experimental studies in a collaborating laboratory. It is thus a truly multidisciplinary project. The current project uses a current mathematical model of pancreatic beta-cells to understand how oscillations in the metabolism of glucose by the beta-cells can lead to oscillations in the electrical activity and insulin secretion from the beta-cells. In addition, bifurcation analysis and recent mathematical methods in the area of Mixed Mode Oscillations will be used to understand the oscillatory electrical activity of beta-cells that have been isolated from an islet. The intention is to determine, using this mathematical analysis, how single-cell behavior is converted to the very different behavior of beta-cells in an intact islet. The long-term goal of this research is to better understand the normal functioning of islets, which will ultimately provide insights into the dysfunction of islets that occurs in type II diabetes."

Even in cancer cells, dramatic DNA rearrangements are frequently observed in somatic cell lineages. This project uses certain species of ciliates as a model system to study gene rearrangements. These organisms undergo massive recombination during differentiation of an archival germline micronucleus into a somatic macronucleus capable of gene expression.  The objective of this project is to increase the understanding of this process of assembly, starting from the basic principles of molecular DNA - RNA - enzyme interactions, through general knowledge of the possible pathways and intermediate steps that lead to the final product.  Through mutual reinforcement, the project interlaces biological experiments with mathematical findings. The theoretical model utilizes spatial graphs with 4-valent vertices as a physical representation of the DNA at the time of recombination, and smoothing of the vertices models the actual recombination.  Specific aims include: (a) examine the interactions of the template RNA and the involvement of possible cutting and splicing enzymes at the moment of recombination, (b) identify steps in the process by pinpointing putative intermediate molecules during unscrambling a variety of genes, and theoretically analyze sets of pointers leading to these intermediates (c) characterize theoretically and confirm experimentally all possible gene unscrambling pathways for a subset of genes, and (d) develop mathematical techniques based on methods from knot theory and formal languages to study the theoretical model.<br/><br/>Our understanding of genome-wide DNA rearrangements is still very limited. These processes appear on an evolutionary scale, where they can lead to species-specific differences and even the creation of species boundaries. On a developmental scale, genome rearrangements appear in a wide range of differentiating eukaryotic cells. The findings of this project will offer insight into the process of gene descrambling in ciliates and may also extend more generally to other model systems.  This project seeks to learn from both theory and experiments how a mechanism for RNA-templated DNA recombination sculpts the assembly of genetic information in ciliates. This mechanism of template-mediated DNA rearrangement can be visualized as a scaffold for controlling and programming certain types of genetic information within a cell. Such control of information processing could facilitate biomolecular computing in vivo, as well as methods for epigenetic control of development.<br/>"

The interaction of large populations of neurons leads to a complex repertoire of high-dimensional activity patterns that is difficult to analyze.  The dimension of the space of connectivity patterns among neurons is likewise astronomical.  To understand the behavior of neuronal networks, one would like to analyze the relationship between these connectivity patterns and neuronal activity.  This project will develop an analytical approach to distill both network connectivity and activity down to first and second order statistics.  This simplified framework will facilitate studying the relationships between key features of connectivity and activity.  The project centers around a kinetic theory framework to represent populations of neurons by capturing the first and second order statistics among the states of neurons.  The evolution of the kinetic theory equations will be determined by the first and second order statistics of the connectivity.  An approach to estimating these first and second order connectivity statistics from experimental data will link the analysis with biological networks.<br/><br/>The central objective of this project is the development of mathematical tools to analyze the interrelationships between simplified descriptions of neuronal network connectivity and simplified descriptions of neuronal activity.  When linked with experimental data, the analysis may provide insight into the behavior of the neuronal networks underlying the brain's computations.  As this research may provide tools that help scientists better understand the effects of the degradation of neural connections, such as in neurodegenerative disease, it may eventually lead to strategies to mitigate or reverse these effects. Integrated into the project is interdisciplinary training in conjunction with the research as well as a plan to help young people discover exciting ways of applying mathematics to biology, with the goal of inspiring them to pursue further applications of mathematics to biology and other sciences."

Detailed three-dimensional stochastic reaction-diffusion models that incorporate the exclusion of nuclear volume by chromatin and the sliding of transcription factors along DNA will be constructed. Systems of spatially-continuous Smoluchowski diffusion-limited reaction equations (SDLR) and lattice-based reaction-diffusion master equations (RDME) are the two primary stochastic reaction-diffusion models that have been used to study systems in which both the stochasticity in the chemical reaction process and the spatial diffusion of molecules is important. We will develop extensions to the RDME and SDLR systems of equations to account for the influence of chromatin on the motion of proteins and messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) within the nucleus of cells. A multiscale approach will be developed in which an initial model that explicitly represents chromatin fibers over length scales significantly smaller than the size of the nucleus will be constructed. This model will then be coarse grained, and combined with existing experimental imaging data to estimate parameters in effective whole-nucleus scale RDME and SDLR models. These new coarse grained models will be used to study the influence of global nuclear substructure on the time needed for gene regulatory proteins, upon entering the nucleus, to find specific DNA binding sites. Methods will also be developed for improving the accuracy of the RDME in approximating the SDLR model, and for exactly simulating the stochastic processes described by the SDLR model in the complex geometries that are present in cells. A rigorous analytical and numerical study of the predictions that the two models make for general multi-particle systems and for specific biological systems with realistic geometries will be undertaken.<br/><br/>To better comprehend how organisms function, respond to environmental stimuli, and to aid in treating disease, it is necessary to understand, predict, and control the behavior of individual cells. Each cell contains numerous complex dynamical processes involving proteins undergoing biochemical reactions that play a major role in cell to cell communication, cell growth and division, heart and nervous system development and function, and the development and progression of cancer. Understanding the ways that these processes activate and inactivate genes inside individual cells is fundamental to determining how these processes influence cell function. In this work we will develop explicit mathematical models of how proteins within a cell find the specific genes that they activate or inactivate. These models will allow the quantitative study of how the interior physical structure of cells influences this process.  New mathematical equations will be developed to model the movement of proteins within cells containing realistic cellular substructures. New computational methods will be developed to efficiently solve these mathematical equations in order to better predict and control the dynamical processes that influence cell behavior."

The steady states of a network of reactions are therefore solutions to a set of polynomial equations and form an algebraic variety. Despite the powerful mathematical tools that have been developed to analyze algebraic varieties, this feature has never previously been exploited in studying biological systems.  The research team recently showed that for a particular class of biological networks, arising in multisite protein phosphorylation, the steady-state variety has remarkable geometric properties, which lead to new biological predictions as well as a method for drastically reducing the complexity of calculating steady states. In this project, these geometric ideas will be used to analyze a much broader class of cellular networks, especially the key modules that are repeatedly used in biological processes, including cascades, scaffolds and feedbacks. While the analysis will initially be at steady state, the team will also examine whether the unexpected benefits of polynomial dynamics can be extended to more complex dynamical behaviors, such as limit cycles. If successful, these studies will provide new methods for overcoming molecular complexity as well as a new geometrical language in which to formulate the principles of cellular regulation.<br/><br/>The molecular networks found within biological cells exhibit extraordinary complexity. Not only are there many components--there are around 23,000 genes in the human genome--but the proteins encoded by the genes may themselves become modified in multiple different ways by other proteins in a dynamic fashion. Although the researchers have developed excellent mathematical tools for dealing with genes, which are static entities, there are few such tools for dealing with the dynamics of proteins and their modifications. It is these dynamical processes that do the work of cellular physiology and which become destabilized in disease. For instance, a characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease is uncontrolled modification of a protein called tau, while similar imbalances in protein modification have been found in many cancers.  Unfortunately, the number of different protein states that can arise in such processes is enormous, making it hard to even understand what the processes are capable of doing, let alone to devise the right experiments to unravel them. At present, much of this complexity has to be glossed over. In this project, the investigators develop new mathematical tools for representing and analyzing such cellular processes that enable them to overcome some of the complexity rather than ignore it. In this way, the team hopes to characterize how cellular networks exploit molecular complexity to implement the physiological processes of life.  Studies of this kind will help lay the foundation for a better molecular understanding of health and disease."

The theory and application of mathematical models have proved useful for the purpose of providing a logical structure within which to synthesize knowledge, test assumptions, and make predictions about the dynamics of biological populations with regard to epidemiological problems. Models have provided the impetus and means for researchers to study increasingly complex and important questions in these disciplines. The main theme of this conference will be epidemiology and related topics, specifically, the dynamics of diseases to which biological species are susceptible, the establishment and spread of diseases within populations and their control and elimination. Mathematical models are built on trade-offs between biological accuracy and mathematical tractability. Of particular importance are the effects of modeling assumptions concerning spatial or temporal heterogeneities or concerning heterogeneities among the characteristics of individuals within the population. The conference theme will focus on the derivation and analysis of dynamic models appropriate for the study of epidemics and will address a wide variety of theoretical and applied problems and case studies that illustrate the connection of models with data, and the impact of the modeling results on the public health.<br/><br/>The conference will bring together expert researchers for the purpose of establishing a solid basis for contacts and interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers in mathematical biology at large and mathematical epidemiology in particular. Five distinguished researchers will each give a 50-minute plenary talk that will survey current directions and present frontiers of epidemic modeling. There will be three parallel sessions consisting of 30-minute talks given by invited speakers. The formal and informal discussions during the conference will result in the increase of collaboration among various groups and researchers. A panel discussion, moderated by the principal investigators, will discuss new directions and open problems in the field of Mathematical Biology, in particular, of Mathematical Epidemiology.  The panel will further discuss strategies to promote the integration of mathematics and biology curricula as promoted by NSF-UBM programs across the country. For the graduate and undergraduate students, this will be a great opportunity to meet leading authorities in the field and discuss with them, formally and informally, topics and questions in which they are interested.<br/>"

On the theoretical side, it will contribute to the mathematical theory of persistence, an important tool for the analysis of biological models as it provides a mathematically rigorous method to establish the long term persistence or viability of a population.  Presently, the theory is difficult to apply to discrete-time dynamical systems arising in epidemiology and population dynamics because of the complexity of (boundary) attractors for discrete-time systems (e.g., the standard quadratic map). Recently, the theory of Lyapunov exponents has been applied to detect when a boundary invariant set, representing a ""resident regime"" is normally repelling, meaning it is invadable by a non-resident.  One aspect of the project is to further develop this approach and to develop methods of computing/estimating the key normal Lyapunov exponents and their dependence on system parameters.  The newly developed tools will be applied to mathematical models of a fungal disease model in amphibian populations. The project aims to improve current state-of-the-art mathematical models of in-vivo bacterial infections by including more realistic immune system responses, antibiotic treatment and the development of resistance to antibiotic, and examining appropriate antibiotic dosing strategies.  A parallel effort will aim to improve mathematical models of virus disease by exploring the effects of multiple viral infections of host target cells. <br/><br/>Many important questions in the life sciences center on whether or not a biological species or set of species can survive indefinitely in given environment or whether they will become extinct.  Issues of biological diversity revolve around the question of which species can or cannot survive in an (possibly human-altered) environment.  If a disease or parasite is introduced into a population, can it survive and become endemic in the host or will it die out or become rare?  Will it drive the host population to extinction as fungal diseases appear to be doing to amphibian populations?  Similar questions arise when an inoculum of bacteria or virus gains entry into a host animal or plant: can it exploit its host and initiate a chronic disease or will it be removed by a host immune response?  Currently, there are few guiding principles to decide these questions but mathematical modeling and analysis can and has played a role.  Motivated by these important biological questions, a mathematical theory (called persistence theory) has been developing in recent decades to provide answers.  The project will contribute to this theory by sharpening the available mathematical tools and applying them to important biological problems.  On the practical side, the new tools should help to predict long term persistence or extinction in particular models. A focus of the project is to apply newly developed tools to study mathematical models of disease within human and animal populations. Models of the fungal disease Chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease of amphibians caused by the chytrid fungus, implicated in the mass die-offs and species extinction of frogs in many areas of the world, will be studied.  Another arena of important applications are disease processes within a given animal or plant. Mathematical modeling of in vivo disease processes is a relatively new field holding great promise due to the difficulty of real-time monitoring of these processes.  Prior work aimed at creating more realistic mathematical models of generic bacterial infections of mammalian tissues including host immune response and antibiotic therapy will be extended to include known pathogen heterogeneity in virulence and susceptibility to antibiotic treatment, and alternative antimicrobial dosing strategies. The proposed extensions should lead to better understanding of the infection and treatment processes, allowing computer simulation of processes which are difficult to monitor in vivo. Mathematical modeling of virus infections have also proved to be useful, most notably for understanding HIV replication within the human host.  Mathematical modeling can predict and confirm features of virus-host cell dynamics that are difficult to monitor in animal models.  The investigator will examine effects of multiply infected host cells on disease dynamics."

Research in the area known as ecological stoichiometry (ES) has highlighted the ecological importance of the relative abundance of chemical constituents, known to vary considerably among species and across trophic levels. ES deals with how the balance of energy and elements affect and are affected by organisms and their interactions in ecosystems. It has proven to be an important new lens through which to view and understand ecological interactions and has gained momentum by explicitly linking the elemental physiology of organisms to their food web interactions and ecosystem function. Thus, ES theory covers multiple biological scales and allows, via rigid physical and chemical constraints, the construction of robust mechanistic and predictive mathematical models. While biology has a research tradition that is empirical in nature and often only weakly connected to formal quantitative analyses, mathematical and theoretical biology on the other hand has had a research agenda that has often been somewhat distanced from mainstream empirical biology. There is not enough effort and attention on marrying empirical results with theoretical findings. The investigators will extend and generalize existing well-received stoichiometry-based mathematical models to encompass a broader range of ecological situations, including cell quota dynamics, consumer age- or size-structures, variable consumer stoichiometry, and delayed nutrient cycling. Once such a generalized theoretical framework is established, the investigators will construct and evaluate models inspired by recent empirical discoveries in ES, including one considering the effects on consumer dynamics of not only insufficient food nutrient content but also of excess food nutrient content, and another considering the effects of stoichiometric dietary mixing. Finally, the investigators will challenge these parameterized stoichiometric models against observed population growth dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively. In doing so, the investigators hope to achieve a far-reaching synthesis between model and experiment in the form of new theoretical applications that may allow for direct and quantitative predictions of the effects of stoichiometric constraints on ecosystem processes. The models the investigators will investigate may motivate challenging but tractable problems in areas of qualitative and computational studies of nonlinear differential equations and delay differential equations. <br/><br/>This project will have a broad impact in both local and global environs. The biological findings of this project may have a number of practical applications to issues such as eutrophication, biofuel production, global change, and biodiversity. Its theoretical outcomes will provide a solid and user-friendly framework to build mathematical models that allow quantitative prediction of ecological interactions. Moreover, it will find many ready applications in cancer and other within host diseases dynamics and treatment modeling since one can view cancer cells and pathogens as invading species in a host ecosystem. The investigators' collaborative efforts will provide undergraduate and graduate students of diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds with first-hand educational experience in cross-disciplinary communication and exploration. Finally, the investigators are partnering with Arizona State University's School of Life Sciences award-winning Ask-A-Biologist program to develop articles and virtual experiments related to this project to enhance middle- and high school student learning of biological and mathematical concepts.<br/>"

This reproductive strategy is found throughout the plant and animal kingdoms.  The trade-offs between reproduction and survival and the distinctions between semelparous and iteroparous life cycles have long been recognized as key issues involved in the study of life history strategies.  Major topics of interest are the population dynamic consequences and the evolutionary advantages (or disadvantages) of semelparity versus iteroparity.  Recent developments in the mathematical modeling of semelparity, using methods of nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory, have established a fundamental dynamic dichotomy that is of both biological and mathematical interest.  From a mathematical point of view, models for the dynamics of semelparous species lie outside the standard theory of general structured population dynamics.  Specifically, the fundamental bifurcation theorem that deals with the passage from population extinction to persistence (as the expected lifetime number of newborns produced by a newborn increases through the critical value of one) fails to hold.  The challenge of determining the dynamic consequences of this fact have been met only in low dimensional cases (i.e., short maturation periods) and even then not thoroughly.  These studies have established that, in lower dimensional cases, semelparous models exhibit a dynamic dichotomy that consists, roughly speaking, of an alternative between equilibration with overlapping generations and oscillations with non-overlapping generations.  The oscillations in the later case can be strictly periodic, but also might be aperiodic. (They result from an invariant loop whose structure is a heteroclinic cycle.)  Which of the two dynamics results (i.e., which is mathematically stable) depends on the magnitude of inter-stage competition present (relative to intra-stage competition).  The first part of this project addresses the conjecture that this dynamic dichotomy is also present in semelparous models of higher dimension, to quantify the amount of inter-stage competition that results in an oscillatory dynamic, and to clarify the nature of these oscillations.  The methods involve stability analysis, bifurcation methods, perturbation expansions, monotone semi-flow theory, the use average Lyapunov functions, persistence theory, and numerical simulations.  The second part of the project addresses questions about the evolution of semelparity and the possibility of its being an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS).  The method to be used is based on evolutionary game theory (and is called Darwinian dynamics), a methodology that extends a population dynamic model to include the dynamics of an evolving (mean phenotypic) trait, which in turn affects the population dynamics (through its influence on vital birth, growth, and death rates).  The approach is primarily by means of bifurcation theory and will depend on the dynamic studies in the first part of the project. Indeed, part 2 will obtain (among other things) generalizations of the results in part 1 to an evolutionary setting.  The theoretical results and methodology developed in part 2 will then be used in applications that address specific evolutionary questions.  Using biologically reasonable trade-offs to build sub-models for fecundity and survivorships as functions of an evolving trait, we will study the circumstances under which semelparity is evolutionarily favored and when it is not.  The Darwinian dynamics approach allows the methods of nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory to be applied to these evolutionary questions.<br/><br/>Investigations of many problems in biological sciences are based fundamentally on an understanding of population dynamics.  This includes problems concerning the effects of climate change on ecosystems, the spread and control of diseases and pests, the protection of endangered species, the invasion of non-native species, the management of agricultural systems, the operation of fisheries, the design of wildlife refuges, and many others.  Mathematical models derived to study problems such as these must, if one hopes to obtain accurate descriptions and predictions, be based on accurate dynamic models of the populations involved.  For example, there is currently a great deal of research being carried out to ""downscale"" global climate data, i.e., to resolve the data to smaller scales, so that it can be used in population (ecosystem) dynamic models, the ultimate goal being an ability to predict the effects of future climate change on specific species of plants and animals.  Accurate models of population dynamics must take into account, to some level of resolution, details concerning the life history strategy of species, i.e., the growth and reproduction schedule by means of they optimize fitness.  Species with one type of life history will likely be quite differently affected by climate change (or by an invasive species or diseases or management decisions, etc.) than will be a species with a different life history.  Biologists recognize two broad types of life histories: one in which individuals reproduce and then, or shortly thereafter, die (referred to as semelparity) and individuals who have repeated reproductive events throughout their life (referred to as iteroparity).  There are numerous species throughout the plant and annual kingdoms that are semelparous (annual plants, a great many insects, some species of salmon, etc.).  Models of semelparous population dynamics have not received the attention, with regard to many of their important aspects, as have those for iteroparous populations.  Recent preliminary studies have shown that semelparous populations exhibit dynamic features that are, in several fundamental ways, very different from those typical iteroparous populations.  These features, among others, have to do with the propensity of semelparous populations to exhibit periodic crashes and booms (as, for example, seen in the notorious cicada cycles or disastrous outbreaks of forest insect pests).  The main goals of this research project are: (1) to develop a broad based theory of semelparous population dynamics and understand the properties of population oscillations (periodic outbreaks) and ascertain the conditions under which they do and do not occur; (2) extend the population dynamic theory to an evolutionary context so as to provide an understanding of how semelparous populations adapt and evolve; (3) to apply the findings to carefully selected and derived models of specific, important types of life histories studied in both theoretical and applied ecology.  The mathematical models to be used in this research are of a type that is particularly accessible to those with limited backgrounds in the mathematics of dynamical systems.  Because of the quick learning curve associated with these kinds of models, the project provides abundant research opportunities for students (both undergraduate and graduate) that, on the one hand, introduces them in an accessible context to sophisticated concepts and methods in the mathematical theory of dynamical systems and, on the other hand, permits them to carry out interesting applications that make solid contributions to biological problems."

The project divides into<br/>specific but interconnected lines: the mathematical development<br/>of a theory of elastic growth in soft materials; the long-time<br/>dynamics of growth; the linear and nonlinear stability analysis<br/>of growing elastic systems with application to morphogenesis and<br/>pattern formation; the problem of cavitation and void-opening in<br/>growth; and the study of reduced theories.  The Principal<br/>Investigators study elastic growth within the framework of exact<br/>elasticity theory, where growth is modeled through the<br/>multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient.  The<br/>mechanical consequences of growth, its long-time dynamics, and<br/>its potential to either generate instabilities through changes in<br/>geometry and stresses, or to act as a regulatory mechanism, are<br/>examined.  Furthermore, a study of growing tissues is carried out<br/>through the development and application of the techniques of<br/>weakly nonlinear analysis.  The development of reduced theories<br/>for rods, membranes, plates, and shells for growing structures is<br/>also undertaken.  Various applications in biology and physiology<br/>are studied; in particular the ideas of growth are applied to<br/>bacterial and fungal systems, stems, leaves, arteries, and blood<br/>vessels.  The various theoretical analyses and specific models of<br/>growth are carried out through the use and extension of nonlinear<br/>analysis techniques developed by the Principal Investigators. <br/><br/>     Growth is a fundamental scientific problem of great<br/>complexity coupling biological, chemical, and physical phenomena. <br/>The goal of the project is to develop mathematical tools to<br/>understand and model a variety of problems related to growth,<br/>including plant and microbial morphogenesis, the stability of<br/>arteries, the development of aneurysms, and the regular and<br/>abnormal functions of organs such as the heart, the esophagus,<br/>and the trachea.

In prior work, generalizations of the matrix computations that underlie theoretical physics were developed, and their use was pioneered in creating models from DNA microarray data. These models have been used to predict mechanisms that govern the activity of DNA and RNA, including a previously unknown mechanism of regulation that correlates DNA replication initiation with RNA expression during the cell cycle, the first mechanism to be predicted from mathematical modeling of microarray data. Preliminary experimental results verify this computational prediction, demonstrating for the first time that mathematical modeling of microarray data can be used to correctly predict previously unknown cellular mechanisms. This work will now be extended by creating the first tensor algebra models, integrating and comparing different types of cell cycle data from different studies and organisms and under different conditions. This project will result in innovative mathematical frameworks for large-scale data analysis, as well as new insights into the cellular program of cell division. For example, one preliminary tensor model is the only mathematical framework to date that enables comparison of data from multiple organisms without being limited to similar genes among these organisms. This model promises to reveal universality and specialization of evolutionary, biochemical and genetic pathways that are truly on genomic scales. Another preliminary model enables integration of data from time courses under different perturbations into a coherent picture of the effects of these perturbations on cell cycle progression. This model promises to uncover previously unrecognized causal coordination of cellular activities.<br/><br/>Recently developed high-throughput technologies, such as the DNA microarray, make it possible for the first time to record the complete molecular biological signals that guide the progression of cellular processes, i.e., tell cells what to do and when and where to do it. Biology and medicine today may be at a point similar to where physics was after the advent of the telescope. The rapidly growing number of large-scale data sets holds the key to the discovery of cellular mechanisms, just as the astronomical tables compiled by Galileo and Tycho enabled accurate predictions of planetary motions and, later, the discovery of universal gravitation. Just as Kepler and Newton made these predictions and discoveries by using mathematical frameworks to describe trends in astronomical data, so future discovery and control in biology and medicine will come from the mathematical modeling of large-scale molecular biological data. In this project, mathematical frameworks for large-scale data analysis are developed and used to create models from microarray data, and predict cellular mechanisms. For example, earlier work predicted a previously unknown mechanism of regulation that correlates the beginning of DNA replication with RNA transcription, the process by which the information in DNA is transferred to RNA, during the cell division cycle. This is the first mechanism to be predicted from mathematical modeling of microarray data. Preliminary experimental results verify this computational prediction, demonstrating for the first time that mathematical modeling of microarray data can be used to correctly predict previously unknown cellular mechanisms. This project will now extend this work by creating models that integrate and compare different types of cell cycle data from different studies and organisms and under different conditions. Models such as these may become the foundation of a future where physicians model and control biological systems as readily as engineers model and control physical systems today. In this future, cancer and disease can be stopped or reversed, damaged tissues can be engineered to regenerate, and aging can be slowed or even halted altogether."

From this data set, the goal is to understand at some more macroscopic level the structure of the paths taken during the simulation. The challenge here is that while there are many degrees of freedom, many of these are not important and in fact obscure the potentially relevant dynamics in progress. For example, the collection of attracting fixed points is a primary important invariant when studying any dynamical system. Unstable critical points, as well as invariant manifolds, including attracting submanifolds, are also of a great deal of interest in studying dynamics. Even when the ambient space on which the dynamics is taking place is trivial topologically (Euclidean space, for example), it is well-understood that fixed sets and invariant sets frequently carry interesting topological structure. Moreover, there exists a powerful set of tools (Conley index theory) which often allow one to derive useful information about invariant subsets, and the interrelationship between them. This methodology has been used to develop computational methods which permit one to describe dynamics in an algorithmic and provable way for dynamics on low-dimensional systems. Moreover, these tools permit the tracking of qualitative behavior as parameters in a parametrized system are changed, so as to produce ""databases"" of dynamical system behavior of a given physical form. This family of ideas is being rapidly developed, and is expected to provide very useful information about many chemical dynamical systems. The investigators will emphasize challenges involved from the point of view of the inherent biology and chemistry.<br/><br/>The simulation of biology at the molecular scale has come a long way since its origins decades ago.

The specific objectives of this project are threefold. The first objective is to extend mathematical development of a modeling approach for assessing the impact of toxin-mediated interactions between multiple plant species and herbivores. The second objective is to integrate toxin-mediated browsing dynamics into the existent theory of boreal forest community dynamics. The final objective is to explore the roles that landscape disturbance, patterns of patchiness, and adaptive browsing play in shaping the plant community. These models are developed to reflect the biological complexity of plant-herbivore systems and will provide unique insight into how herbivore factors, plant factors, and environmental factors impact the establishment and spread of toxic plants in natural systems.<br/><br/>The modeling studies in this project have critical societal importance because of the key role that moose and other herbivores play in indigenous societies in the boreal forest. Moose, the largest herbivore in Alaska, are a major source of protein for residents in interior Alaska. For generations, Athabascan Indians have harvested moose, which provide a valuable nutritional and cultural resource, so changes in moose abundance and distribution can have large impacts on subsistence users.  This is especially true in rural areas where availability of alternative resources can be limited, and lack of job opportunities and high poverty levels make subsistence harvest an essential component of rural economies. Toxins in plants are known to affect intake and plant selection in herbivores which in turn can influence ecosystem processes such as succession.  Succession in turn influences the quality of moose habitat, distribution, and ultimately harvest.  This research project will improve understanding of how toxins influence plant selectivity by moose during succession in the boreal forest. Models developed will explore future scenarios of vegetation, herbivores, and their consequences for subsistence.  Additionally, process-based understanding of the impacts of recent climate warming and increases in wildfire on moose abundance and distribution will be improved, and therefore subsistence opportunities for indigenous residents of Alaska.  Lastly, such information can help better inform wildlife managers and allow for more proactive management policies."

For low frequency range (< 100 kHz), the proposed methods are based on homogenization theory. A typical scale for trabecular bone spacing is between 0.5 to 2mm with trabecular thicknesses of 5 to 150 mm. In this range, the wavelength is longer than 15 mm; hence, homogenization theory can be applied. Modified Biot equations (i.e. no ad hoc effective parameters), effective equations for cancellous bone with pore space filled with blood-marrow modeled by the Careau law, and those derived from first principles without the restrictive assumption of periodic microstructure are considered. Two different mathematical approaches are applied in order to go beyond the periodic microstructure assumption: one by a variant of Tartar's method of oscillating test functions, the other by stochastic-two-scale homogenization. These effective equations are to be incorporated into our existing numerical solver for comparison with experimental data.  A novel mathematical method is proposed for the inverse problem of retrieving mechanical properties relevant to the strength of bone from ultrasound measurement.  This is an ill-posed, nonlinear inverse problem.  This novel method is based on an iteration scheme utilizing dehomogenization, which is a linear inverse problem.  This is made possible by quantifying the microstructure through relating it to moments of the spectral measure of the associated operator, rather than using directly the characteristic function of the microstructure.  A method for estimating porosity distribution from phase velocity by utilizing its frequency dependence is also developed.<br/><br/>This project is motivated by the challenges in detecting osteoporosis, a major public health threat affecting more than 44 million Americans. Both treatment and prevention of the disease rely on the best assessment possible of the condition of the patient's bones. Currently, the diagnosis is done using X-ray images and/or bone mineral density test by X-ray type of device. However, as is well known in the field of biomechanics, this approach does not always correctly predict the likelihood of bone fracture. Using a detailed CT image of microstructure, various effective parameters can be computed using numerical method but this is very expensive. The method developed will quantify the mathematical link between strength and microstructural information (statistics of the microstructure), rather than the detailed image. This in turn will lead to the discovery of a way of calculating the strength of bones without detailed image of microstructure.  This microstructural information will be obtained by utilizing the frequency dependence of the effective mechanical properties of bone, which can be measured by an ultrasound device. The gains are manifold. First, this approach reduces the patients' exposure to radiation. Secondly, ultrasound is much cheaper and portable than an X-ray type device. Thirdly, this microstructural information can be used for quantifying the area of high concentration of strain, which is another indicator for mechanical failure such as bone fracture.<br/><br/>"

Even in cancer cells, dramatic DNA rearrangements are frequently observed in somatic cell lineages. This project uses certain species of ciliates as a model system to study gene rearrangements. These organisms undergo massive recombination during differentiation of an archival germline micronucleus into a somatic macronucleus capable of gene expression.  The objective of this project is to increase the understanding of this process of assembly, starting from the basic principles of molecular DNA - RNA - enzyme interactions, through general knowledge of the possible pathways and intermediate steps that lead to the final product.  Through mutual reinforcement, the project interlaces biological experiments with mathematical findings. The theoretical model utilizes spatial graphs with 4-valent vertices as a physical representation of the DNA at the time of recombination, and smoothing of the vertices models the actual recombination.  Specific aims include: (a) examine the interactions of the template RNA and the involvement of possible cutting and splicing enzymes at the moment of recombination, (b) identify steps in the process by pinpointing putative intermediate molecules during unscrambling a variety of genes, and theoretically analyze sets of pointers leading to these intermediates (c) characterize theoretically and confirm experimentally all possible gene unscrambling pathways for a subset of genes, and (d) develop mathematical techniques based on methods from knot theory and formal languages to study the theoretical model.<br/><br/>Our understanding of genome-wide DNA rearrangements is still very limited. These processes appear on an evolutionary scale, where they can lead to species-specific differences and even the creation of species boundaries. On a developmental scale, genome rearrangements appear in a wide range of differentiating eukaryotic cells. The findings of this project will offer insight into the process of gene descrambling in ciliates and may also extend more generally to other model systems.  This project seeks to learn from both theory and experiments how a mechanism for RNA-templated DNA recombination sculpts the assembly of genetic information in ciliates. This mechanism of template-mediated DNA rearrangement can be visualized as a scaffold for controlling and programming certain types of genetic information within a cell. Such control of information processing could facilitate biomolecular computing in vivo, as well as methods for epigenetic control of development.<br/>"

A novel mathematical method is proposed for the inverse problem of retrieving mechanical properties relevant to the strength of bone from ultrasound measurement.  This is an ill-posed, nonlinear inverse problem.  This novel method is based on an iteration scheme utilizing dehomogenization, which is a linear inverse problem.  This is made possible by quantifying the microstructure through relating it to moments of the spectral measure of the associated operator, rather than using directly the characteristic function of the microstructure.  A method for estimating porosity distribution from phase velocity by utilizing its frequency dependence is also developed.<br/><br/>This project is motivated by the challenges in detecting osteoporosis, a major public health threat affecting more than 44 million Americans. Both treatment and prevention of the disease rely on the best assessment possible of the condition of the patient's bones. Currently, the diagnosis is done using X-ray images and/or bone mineral density test by X-ray type of device. However, as is well known in the field of biomechanics, this approach does not always correctly predict the likelihood of bone fracture. Using a detailed CT image of microstructure, various effective parameters can be computed using numerical method but this is very expensive. The method developed will quantify the mathematical link between strength and microstructural information (statistics of the microstructure), rather than the detailed image. This in turn will lead to the discovery of a way of calculating the strength of bones without detailed image of microstructure.  This microstructural information will be obtained by utilizing the frequency dependence of the effective mechanical properties of bone, which can be measured by an ultrasound device. The gains are manifold. First, this approach reduces the patients' exposure to radiation. Secondly, ultrasound is much cheaper and portable than an X-ray type device. Thirdly, this microstructural information can be used for quantifying the area of high concentration of strain, which is another indicator for mechanical failure such as bone fracture.<br/><br/>"

The development of this type of dynamical analysis and control theory-inspired experiment design has been hindered by the lack of adequately accurate mathematical models and incomplete knowledge of the intracellular signaling pathways.  Recent developments and preliminary experiments using nonlinear model predictive controller design with sparse grid-based optimization have set the stage for the development of effective control strategies despite these uncertainties.  The refinement of computationally efficient sparse grid-based techniques to rapidly screen model structures and parameters for compatibility with the available experimental data will elucidate data-consistent signaling dynamics, facilitate experiment design to discern between data-compatible mechanisms, and support robust controller design.  The extension of current robust controller design techniques to select controller parameters that minimize the effects from uncertainties in the model parameters and structure and small perturbations in the controller parameter values will maximize the likelihood that the resulting controller actions, when realized in the laboratory, will achieve their desired objectives.  The robust controller design techniques developed to minimize the effects of large degrees of uncertainty in the model parameters and structure will be immediately applicable to control a number of highly uncertain systems.<br/> <br/>Intracellular signaling pathways transmit and coordinate signals within the cell to direct fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis.  The ability to predict signaling network dynamics will ultimately provide us with ways to alter cellular responses in a controlled manner.  This ability will find application in medicine and pharmacy, agriculture, and biotechnology.  The intracellular signaling pathways involve numerous chemical species that participate in a complex sequence of events orchestrated by interactions, crosstalk and feedback.  The complexity of these networks hinders the ability of unaided intuition to efficiently design experiments to manipulate the signaling events in a desired manner.  This interdisciplinary research combines and extends expertise and techniques from control theory, computational mathematics, and cell biology to derive approaches to quantitatively design experiments.  Undergraduates and graduate students will participate in the research and primary dissemination of the research results will be through peer-reviewed journal publications, conference presentations, a technical workshop, course material, and the Web.<br/>"

The specific objectives of this project are threefold. The first objective is to extend mathematical development of a modeling approach for assessing the impact of toxin-mediated interactions between multiple plant species and herbivores. The second objective is to integrate toxin-mediated browsing dynamics into the existent theory of boreal forest community dynamics. The final objective is to explore the roles that landscape disturbance, patterns of patchiness, and adaptive browsing play in shaping the plant community. These models are developed to reflect the biological complexity of plant-herbivore systems and will provide unique insight into how herbivore factors, plant factors, and environmental factors impact the establishment and spread of toxic plants in natural systems.<br/><br/>The modeling studies in this project have critical societal importance because of the key role that moose and other herbivores play in indigenous societies in the boreal forest. Moose, the largest herbivore in Alaska, are a major source of protein for residents in interior Alaska. For generations, Athabascan Indians have harvested moose, which provide a valuable nutritional and cultural resource, so changes in moose abundance and distribution can have large impacts on subsistence users.  This is especially true in rural areas where availability of alternative resources can be limited, and lack of job opportunities and high poverty levels make subsistence harvest an essential component of rural economies. Toxins in plants are known to affect intake and plant selection in herbivores which in turn can influence ecosystem processes such as succession.  Succession in turn influences the quality of moose habitat, distribution, and ultimately harvest.  This research project will improve understanding of how toxins influence plant selectivity by moose during succession in the boreal forest. Models developed will explore future scenarios of vegetation, herbivores, and their consequences for subsistence.  Additionally, process-based understanding of the impacts of recent climate warming and increases in wildfire on moose abundance and distribution will be improved, and therefore subsistence opportunities for indigenous residents of Alaska.  Lastly, such information can help better inform wildlife managers and allow for more proactive management policies."

For example, some 6-9% of adult women have the disorder known as polycystic ovarian syndrome PCOS) making it the most common of all endocrinopathies. PCOS has a profound adverse impact on the health of many women since it commonly causes infertility, is associated with unhealthy body composition, and increases key risk factors for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The menopause transition is another example of changes in hormones secretion with resulting symptoms that might be mild, moderate or severe and lead to significant medical intervention. To study cycle abnormalities in a mathematical setting, this project will develop a model for a woman's reproductive life span. Using data sets from three consecutive age groups, three submodels will be integrated into one whole-life model represented by a system of delay differential equations with some slowly varying time-dependent coefficients. The resulting model will be the first endocrine system model which encompasses three time scales (days, months and years), with possible ensuing mathematical difficulties. For such systems, techniques for parameter identification and parameter sensitivity will be developed. The tools of dynamical systems such as stability, bifurcation and perturbation theories will be used to study model behavior.<br/><br/>Mathematical simulations will be used to investigate cycle abnormalities due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and to the menopause transition. These studies may help to identify subtle hormonal changes in the aging process and to predict optimal types, doses and durations of hormonal therapies for young and aging women. <br/>In turn, given the broad consensus that hormone therapies be used at lowest doses for the shortest intervals necessary to achieve specifc therapeutic aims, the impact of these studies on women's health could be beneficial. A key ingredient for understanding PCOS is the relationship between the endocrine (hormone) system and the glucoregulatory (blood sugar) system.<br/>A working model incorporating the hormonal imbalances of PCOS may illuminate the connections between excess androgens, insulin resistance and PCOS. Thus, in addition to applications to the treatment of infertility and menopause, this work may also advance our understanding of diabetes and metabolic disorders, the incidence of which has increased dramatically in recent years.<br/>"

The aim of this project is to make progress towards a better understanding of such DNA packing and folding under a condensed condition in general. The long-term goal of this project is to provide a detailed quantitative description of the DNA packing and folding processes in dsDNA viruses. There are two specific objectives in the proposal.

There is increasing evidence that synchronous oscillations play fundamental roles in cognition and neural information processing, but their exact functional roles remain unclear. To understand how the oscillations contribute to cognitive function, it is critical to understand how the intrinsic properties of neurons and the network connectivity shape rhythmic synchronous activity in neuronal networks. Inhibitory interneurons, which form sub-networks via weak but extensive electrical coupling, appear to play essential roles in producing synchronous oscillations in the brain. We will use a combination of numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, as well as data from in vitro experiments, to determine conditions that promote robust synchrony and those that can disrupt synchrony in electrically coupled networks of interneurons. Specifically, we will use phase response properties of neurons and the theory of weakly coupled oscillators to dissect out the influences of specific membrane conductances on synchronization. We will also use large-scale network simulations, analytical techniques in the weak coupling limit, and an approach involving master stability functions to determine how network structure influences the spatial properties of synchronization.<br/><br/>The brain is composed of large inter-connected networks of neurons. Synchronous oscillatory activity in these networks of neurons is a hallmark of electrical activity in the brain. Synchronous activity is thought to play fundamental roles in many cognitive processes, and its disruption has been linked to complex neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. In order to understand how the synchronous oscillations contribute to cognitive function, it is critical to identify the cellular mechanisms underlying them. Subnetworks of inhibitory neurons that are extensively connected via ?electrical coupling? appear to play essential roles in producing the synchronous oscillations in the brain. Synchrony in these inhibitory networks is determined by connectivity in the network and intrinsic electrical properties of the cells. However, it is still unclear how these features combine to set the level of synchrony in the network and its spatial extent. Using a combination of mathematical modeling, computer simulations and theoretical analysis, as well as experimental data, we will study the mechanisms of synchrony in electrically coupled networks of inhibitory neurons and determine conditions that promote synchrony and those that can disrupt synchrony. We will determine the influences of specific membrane channels that could be targets of drug therapies. We will also examine how the structure of the network influences synchronization. This work will be part of a large body of research that will lead to improved treatments for complex neurological disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism.<br/>"
