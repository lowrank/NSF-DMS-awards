ICMA-IX builds upon the success of eight previous conferences, each of which had over 100 participants. The aim of this conference is to have participants from a wide variety of backgrounds, various career levels, and from underrepresented groups. The conference will highlight significant recent developments in mathematical biology and provide a forum for the participants to meet, to communicate their scientific discoveries, and to initiate new collaborations.  By bringing together a new generation of researchers along with the established experts, the aim is to cultivate new collaborations and networks that can help junior researchers as they advance their careers. <br/> <br/>Mathematical modeling in biology and medicine is becoming ever more important and impactful. This became more visible than ever to the general public during the years of the recent Covid-19 pandemic when crucial policy recommendations were made by epidemiologists and modelers based on mathematical models of the dynamics of the disease. Further applications include a better understanding of cancer spread and its treatment, the working of the nervous system and interactions of species in ecosystems at various scales. ICMA-IX will continue the tradition of  including a plenary talk based on the paper that won the Lord May Prize awarded by the Journal of Biological Dynamics. The conference will feature mathematical modeling in biology diverse in both its applications and its techniques. By its very nature, this research is interdisciplinary and collaborative. Thus, conferences are crucial events to bring together researchers and students from different areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(?NASEM DT REPORT?). The purpose of this report was to bring structure to the burgeoning field of digital twins by providing a working definition and a series of research challenges that need to be addressed to allow this technology to fulfill its full potential. The concept of digital twins is compelling and has the potential to impact a broad range of domains. For instance, digital twins have either been proposed or are currently being developed for manufactured devices, buildings, cities, ecologies and the Earth as a whole. It is natural that the concept be applied to biology and medicine, as the most recognizable concept of a ?twin? is that of identical human twins. The application of digital twins to biomedicine also follows existing trends of Personalized and Precision medicine, in short: ?the right treatment for the right person at the right time.? Fulfilling the promise of biomedical digital twins will require multidisciplinary Team Science that brings together various experts from fields as diverse as medicine, computer science, engineering, biological research, advanced mathematics and ethics. The purpose of this conference, the ?2024 Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group (IMAG)/Multiscale Modeling (MSM) Consortium Meeting: Setting up Teams for Biomedical Digital Twins,? is to do exactly this: bringing together such needed expertise in a series of teaming exercises to operationalize the findings of the NASEM DT REPORT in the context of biomedical digital twins. As part of outreach and training efforts to broaden the participation within this growing field, this workshop will provide support for both traditionally under-represented categories of senior researchers as well as junior researchers such as graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. <br/><br/>Facilitating the development and deployment of biomedical digital twins requires operationalizing the findings and recommendations of the NASEM DT REPORT, which raises a series of specific and unique challenges in the biomedical domain. More specifically, there are numerous steps that need to be taken to convert the highly complex simulation models of biological processes developed by members of the MSM Consortium into biomedical digital twins that are compliant with the definition of digital twins presented in the NASEM DT REPORT. There are also identified challenges associated with these various steps. Some of these challenges can benefit from lessons learned in other domains that have developed digital twins while others will require the development of new techniques in the fields of statistics, computational mathematics and mathematical biology. This task will require multidisciplinary collaborations between mathematicians, computational researchers, experimental biologists and clinicians. This IMAG/MSM meeting will promote the concepts of Team Science to bring together experienced multiscale modeling researchers and experts from the mathematical, statistical, computational, experimental and clinical communities to form the multidisciplinary teams needed to operationalize the findings of the NASEM DT REPORT. The website for this meeting is at https://www.imagwiki.nibib.nih.gov/news-events/announcements/2024-imagmsm-meeting-september-30-october-2-2024, with the landing page for the Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group at https://www.imagwiki.nibib.nih.gov/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the single species context, theoretical models have simplified the study of adaptation to genotype/phenotype fitness, however complex eco-evolutionary dynamics in multi-species communities have challenged researchers.  For example, in microbial and virus-immune response ecosystems, a dynamic fitness landscape determines whether pathogen strains can gain several resistance mutations.  This project aims to bridge ecosystem dynamics with evolutionary genetics by analyzing ecological models evolving on fitness landscapes and developing a computational platform for incorporating phylogenetics. The advances can inform vaccines and therapies which prevent pathogen resistance against multiple immune responses or drugs.  This research will engage undergraduate and graduate students, providing interdisciplinary training in computational and mathematical biology.<br/><br/>Recent work has sought to understand assembly of interacting species in ecosystem models. However, the overwhelming number of species combinations and connecting the models to evolution have challenged researchers, especially in higher dimensional systems. This project aims to address this gap by looking through an evolutionary genetics lens, representing species variants as binary sequences which encode ecological interactions and fitness landscapes.  First, persistence and stability of equilibria in models of ecological networks will be analyzed and linked to epistasis (non-additivity) in underlying fitness landscapes, facilitating simplifying rules for ecosystem evolution. Predator-prey and consumer-resource networks pertaining to viral evolution, microbiomes and antibiotic resistance, along with applications to immunotherapy and treatments, will be considered. Next, the PI will construct a flexible computational method for jointly simulating eco-evolutionary trajectories and phylogenetic trees, which can validate the theoretical results, and confront both genetic and population dynamic data. The work will involve interdisciplinary collaboration into how fitness landscapes shape ecological network evolution for HIV-immune dynamics, and microbial resistance to antibiotics and phage infection.  Through dynamical systems, stochastic simulation, combinatoric and computational analysis, techniques will be developed for connecting population dynamics and evolutionary genetics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theory of dynamical systems lies at the crossroads of several areas of mathematics, and has natural applications to engineering and to other scientific disciplines. In this project, the principal investigator will extend relevant dynamical results from the finite dimensional case to the infinite dimensional case. These include results about dynamical semi-flows generated by evolutionary partial differential equations. Such equations model a variety of physical phenomena. A second component of the project consists in leveraging the principal investigator?s expertise in interdisciplinary research to identify recurrent themes and emergent phenomena arising naturally in the biological sciences, thereby incorporating new phenomenology into a modern theory of dynamical systems. In addition to these scientific advances, the proposed projects offer ample training opportunities for students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The project centers on four lines of research. The first two lines seek to extend finite-dimensional phenomena to infinite dimensions. In the first project, the principal investigator aims to show that in the presence of random forces, a unifying description of large-time orbit distribution holds much more generally than is currently known. The second project seeks to extract low dimensional structures and dynamical phenomena embedded in high dimensions. Specifically, the PI will aim to show that shear-induced chaos is a source of instability in physical models including the Navier-Stokes system. The remaining two projects investigate a class of reaction networks of relevance to biology. Mean-field approaches to the large-time behavior of scalable networks will be investigated. The project also aims to study the novel concept of `depletion?, a bifurcation phenomenon amenable to mathematical analysis. From the viewpoint of applications, depletion occurs naturally in several contexts and potentially has dire biological consequences. The final project seeks to use scalable reaction networks as a model to answer a question of fundamental importance for dissipative dynamical systems, namely, which invariant measures are visible from an observational viewpoint?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Epidermal cells in plant leaves, especially pavement cells (PCs), exhibit interdigitated puzzle shapes. Shape formation of PCs serves as an ideal model to understand principles governing cell morphogenesis and tissue growth in developmental biology. During the development, PCs change from small rounded polygonal shapes into large interdigitated puzzle shapes, under the regulation of the extracellular plant hormone and multiple key molecules accumulated at the plasma membrane (PM). This developmental process also involves reorganization of cytoskeletal components and dynamic cell-to-cell communication. The multiscale mathematical model proposed in this research will have a broad range of applications from tissue engineering to biomanufacturing and biotechnology. The PI will develop a satellite undergraduate research program based on University of California, Riverside (UCR), a Hispanic-serving institution with many first generation college students. The program will also recruit students from California State Universities and high schools in local public school district. Research symposia and summer research programs will be organized through the coordination with department of mathematics, Association of Women in Mathematics at UCR Chapter, Interdisciplinary Center for Quantitative Modeling in Biology at UCR, and nearby colleges to promote public awareness on research and career paths in mathematical biology.<br/><br/>The morphogenesis of PCs is a complex process. During the early stage, extracellular hormone induces nanoclustering on the PM of individual cells to initiate cell polarization. It is followed by nonhomogeneous mechanical forces exerted along cell wall and a subcellular signaling gradient to regulate cell-cell interaction. Stable cell polarization, further the interdigitated jigsaw cell shapes, will be established under the regulations between the nanoclustering signals and structural components in the same cell and regulations of Rho GTPase signals between neighboring cells. Different hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism underlying the PC morphogenesis, while most of them focus on either chemical signals or mechanical properties in PCs. The proposed study will test new hypotheses that include both the chemical signaling network and mechanical properties, as well as interactions between them, and therefore provide novel insights into the fundamental principles of cell shape formation and tissue development. This project will develop a multiscale model using the local level set method to incorporate both chemical signals and mechanical properties in a multicellular environment to test different hypotheses on the shape formation of PCs. Machine learning techniques and experimental data will be used in the modeling selection, parameter estimation and model calibration.<br/><br/>This CAREER project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology Program at the Division of Mathematical Science and the Developmental Systems Cluster at the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Discoveries range from pinpointing what makes different cell types unique (e.g., a skin vs. brain cell) to how diseases emerge from genetic mutations. This gene expression data is now a ubiquitously used tool in every cell biologist?s toolbox. However, the mathematical theories for reliably extracting insight from this data have lagged behind the amazing progress of the techniques for harvesting it. This CAREER project will develop key theoretical foundations for analyzing imaging data of gene expression. The advances span theory to practice, including developing mathematical models and machine-learning approaches that will be used with data from experimental collaborators. Altogether, the project aims to create a new gold standard of techniques in studying spatial imaging data of gene expression and enable revelation of new biological and biomedical insights. In addition, this proposed research will incorporate interdisciplinary graduate students and local community college undergraduates to train the next generation of scientists in the ever-evolving intersection of data science, biology, and mathematics.  Alongside research activities, the project will create mentorship networks for supporting first-generation student scientists in pursuit of diversifying the STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The supported research is a comprehensive program for studying single-molecule gene expression spatial patterns through the lens of stochastic reaction-diffusion models. The key aim is to generalize mathematical connections between these models and their observation as spatial point processes. The new theory will incorporate factors necessary to describe spatial gene expression at subcellular and multicellular scales including various reactions, spatial movements, and geometric effects. This project will also establish the statistical theory of inference on the resulting inverse problem of inferring stochastic rates from only snapshots of individual particle positions. Investigations into parameter identifiability, optimal experimental design, and model selection will ensure robust and reliable inference. In complement to the developed theory, this project will implement and benchmark cutting-edge approaches for efficiently performing large-scale statistical inference, including variational Bayesian Monte Carlo and physics-informed neural networks.

It is important to study the interplay between environmental fluctuations, both deterministic and random, and the persistence of interacting species. Developing a rigorous mathematical theory for coexistence, in conjunction with data-driven applications, will help theoretical ecologists pinpoint how harvesting and periodic or random environmental fluctuations affect the long term dynamics of ecological communities. Global climate change models predict increasing temporal variability in temperature, precipitation and storms in the next century. The research project will provide much-needed theoretical underpinning for this fast-moving area. The application related to the harvesting of marine animals will be key for conservation and management of vulnerable or endangered species. Questions around optimal control of stochastic models are vital in today's world where there are multiple global crises in a changing environment as well as species loss. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists invoke stochasticity as a key determinant of everything from population genetics to extinction risk. But the exposure that scientists from such disciplines actually get to the mathematical concepts underpinning stochastic processes is incomplete. An integral component of the educational objectives will be the organization of a summer school at the interface of biology and stochastics targeted to advanced undergraduate and graduate students from mathematics and biology. <br/><br/>In order to have realistic models for the coexistence of species it is important to incorporate both periodic and random environmental fluctuations. Connecting ideas from dynamical systems and stochastic processes, it will be possible to show that the long-term dynamics is determined by the invasion rates (Lyapunov exponents) of the periodic measures living on the boundary of the state space. The developed ideas will then be used to look at non-stationary community theory where the long term behavior of the system can not be described by an equilibrium, an attractor, or a stationary distribution. An important question from conservation biology is how to harvest a given population in order to maximize the yield while not driving the population extinct. While there are a few results for single-species systems, little is known in the significantly more realistic setting of interacting species. By using a combination of novel approaches from stochastic control and Markov chain approximation methods one can analyze multi-species harvesting problems and then apply the results in order to gain insight for important real-life applications from fishery management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerous infectious disease outbreaks over the past two decades have demonstrated the need for epidemiological modeling. They also revealed shortcomings of existing scientific techniques to accurately predict epidemic dynamics and to devise effective control strategies. This project will establish a new efficient simulation method that makes it possible to assess rare but highly consequential events. It will be used to identify decisive risk factors concerning the fabric of virus-spreading interactions that can facilitate large epidemic outbreaks. A well-documented example are superspreading events that played an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigations will be focused on models for diseases similar to COVID-19 and HIV as archetypal cases. The improved understanding and models of epidemiological processes will be used to devise and analyze efficient preventive strategies with the goal of providing more reliable guidance for the general public and health-policy decision makers, saving lives and resources.<br/><br/>Traditionally, the dynamics of infectious diseases are studied on the basis of deterministic compartmental models, where the population is divided into large groups, and deterministic differential equations for the group sizes are employed to investigate disease dynamics. Classical examples are the deterministic SIR and SIS models. This is a strong simplification of reality that ignores to a large extent the heterogeneity in contact patterns and biomedically relevant attributes across the population as well as the stochastic nature of infection processes. Both have a decisive impact on the dynamics at the early stages of epidemic outbreaks and need to be incorporated to enable reliable predictions. Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods can sample more realistic stochastic agent-based dynamics, but cannot efficiently assess the preconditions leading to rare consequential events. The project will address this challenge with a new numerical technique that allows one to efficiently sample important but rare epidemic trajectories of realistic models under suitable constraints. The research will renew attention on the crucial role of rare events in the genesis of large outbreaks, including combinations of bottlenecks in contact networks and the stochastic nature of the disease dynamics. Risk-factor analysis based on the new method will provide answers to cutting-edge questions in disease diffusion concerning outbreak preconditions, information flow, and control strategies. This approach will open new avenues for research on the prevention and control of epidemics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Human Networks and Data Science program (HNDS) of the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Closely related viruses, however, can have very dissimilar genomes, complicating integration of knowledge acquired from the study of independent viruses, and limiting prediction of the characteristics and potential threats of emerging viruses. Viruses, however, conserve a few structural properties that could help circumvent this problem. Most viruses store their infective genetic material in a protein shell called a capsid. The capsid self-assembles from multiple copies of the same (or similar) proteins, and most capsids display icosahedral symmetry. This architecture optimizes the interaction of proteins and the volume available to store the viral genetic information. This research project hypothesizes that viruses have evolved a limited set of replication strategies to specialize and exploit the reduced number of geometrical templates capable of forming icosahedral capsids. This, in turn, may have constrained the number of three-dimensional configurations adopted by capsid proteins, providing a mechanistic rationale for the existence of viral structural lineages. This hypothesis will be tested by analyzing and comparing hundreds of viruses from multiple different viral families using novel mathematical methods. Confirming this hypothesis will offer a quantitative framework to study viral evolution and open the door to design of generic antiviral strategies targeting viruses in the same structural lineage.<br/><br/>Only ten protein folds have been identified among major capsid proteins of viruses that form icosahedral capsids. These folds define viral lineages that group viruses that can be genetically unrelated and infect hosts from different domains of life. This limited number of folds contrasts with the vast genetic diversity of viruses. The existence of these folds across the virosphere, however, remains unknown. Here, it is hypothesized that there is a direct relationship between the viral replication strategy of each viral lineage, the icosahedral lattice of the capsid, and the fold of capsid proteins. The hypothesis will be tested by developing a database that will include the viral replication, protein fold, and capsid lattice of five hundred viruses that have been reconstructed at high or medium molecular resolution. Voronoi tessellations and protein-protein interaction lattices will be obtained to identify computationally the icosahedral lattice associated to each virus. Additionally, molecular measurements of the reconstructed capsids will be obtained to establish allometric relationships for at least one viral lineage, facilitating the prediction of icosahedral capsid properties from genomic information. The new icosahedral framework will be also extended to obtain new sets of elongated capsids, which represent the second most abundant type of capsid. The methods will be disseminated online for use by viral structure researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research shows that the frequency of large disease outbreaks is increasing over time globally, and yet differences in outcomes remain poorly understood.  This research will explore the factors that drove variation in COVID-19 outcomes across the counties and metropolitan areas of Oklahoma, particularly which areas had more or fewer cases than would be expected based on their overall population size.  The investigators will look at both environmental factors, such as weather patterns and air quality, and socioeconomic factors such as numbers of doctors and differences in the proportion of individuals that were willing to be vaccinated.  The investigators will also conduct surveys of individual across the state to try and better understand why people made the healthcare choices that they did and how behavior drove differences in outcomes. Understanding all of these factors requires a team with diverse expertise. Traditionally, most mathematical and quantitative models for disease dynamics have been developed and studied by mathematicians, ecologists, and computer scientists. However, understanding differences in attitudes towards health care measures and how they originate is more the purview of social scientists and historians. By building a team of collaborators spanning all of these disciplines, the research team will be able to build a more complete picture of COVID-19 outcomes in Oklahoma. This will in turn suggest what actions may be most effective to try and best mitigate the effects of both COVID and other large-scale disease events in the future. The final product of this work will include a new data repository and a public-facing intelligent epidemiological modeling platform powered by Jupyter Notebooks. The project will also provide outreach and training, including to students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Increases in outbreak frequency seem to be related to globalization and other human activities. Yet the effects of most human behavioral, social and economic factors on outbreak risk are rarely quantified.  Relevant social factors can be hard to measure, often needing specialists to generate and interpret data.  However social scientists with expertise to do so are rarely trained in mathematical modelling of disease dynamics.  To address these challenges, the investigators will focus on developing data sources and mathematical models that can be used to explore COVID-19 outcomes in Oklahoma.  The project will be a true collaboration between social scientists and experts in modelling infectious diseases.  Oklahoma is understudied, and is spatially heterogeneous such that models of disease dynamics in Oklahoma are likely to be generalizable to many other regions of the US. The Investigators will generate protocols for standardizing existing data on behavioral and socioeconomic factors as well as develop new data sources. The team will develop statistical models of past outbreaks, and mathematical models reflecting factors shown to have driven COVID-19 dynamics empirically.  The latter work will demonstrate how baseline SIR-like models can be modified to reflect human behavioral factors. The Investigators will also contrast the performance of models based on existing data on socioeconomic factors with models incorporating new survey data on variation in behaviors and attitudes related to primary and secondary prevention.  The code and datasets to be generated will be made freely available and searchable in an intelligent epidemiological modeling framework, which will enable other researchers to easily iterate on them.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The distribution of such variable traits within a species can shift over time. For example, behavioral traits can change quickly in response to environmental change or species interactions. The dynamic shift of trait distribution within a species can modify the interaction patterns among species and ultimately affect the stability of ecosystems. However, the prevalence and significance of such effects have not been evaluated systematically. This research project aims to fill in the gap by integrating theoretical and empirical approaches. A mathematical framework will be developed to classify different types of interaction modification and identify conditions that would destabilize ecosystems. Additionally, a comprehensive survey of empirical studies will be conducted to assess the level of evidence for the various types of interaction modification identified above and provide criteria for evaluating past and future case studies. This project will train young researchers in the interdisciplinary area between mathematics and ecology to address important environmental and ecological problems facing the next generation. In addition, educational kits and programs will be designed to promote teaching of important ecological concepts and engage underrepresented groups in K-12 schools.<br/> <br/>Intraspecific trait variation has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in determining ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Although some work has examined how the variation of heritable traits affects eco-evolutionary dynamics, non-heritable variation caused by phenotypic plasticity, developmental differences, or species interactions has received less consideration. Ecosystems have traditionally been studied as dynamical systems with fixed interaction strengths, but these interaction strengths will no longer be constant if the trait distributions can shift within short timescales. Such ?trait-shift induced interaction modification? (TSIIM) can lead to higher-order interactions among species, causing species extinction or coexistence that are otherwise unexpected. This project will develop a theoretical framework for studying TSIIM by generalizing traditional dynamical systems to incorporate intraspecific trait variation and categorizing these systems into different network motifs. The effect on large ecosystems will be studied using a disordered systems approach augmented by the new motifs. Meta-analysis of these motifs using empirical studies will provide insight on the mechanisms by which higher-order interactions arise from TSIIM, prompting experimental searches for such phenomena and their consequences.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology Program at the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Population and Community Ecology Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology at the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
