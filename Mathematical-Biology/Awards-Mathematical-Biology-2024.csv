The project tackles this challenge by combining two key sources of information: community wastewater and human behaviors. While current methods often rely on delayed and inaccurate medical reports, our innovative approach analyzes traces of viruses in sewage and incorporates various types of data about human activity. This includes information on people's movements, social interactions, online searches, social media posts, and immune factors. By combining these diverse data sources, the Investigators aim to detect diseases earlier and gain a more comprehensive understanding of how they spread through communities. The investigators will also examine how public attitudes and behaviors evolve during prolonged health crises. Although the initial focus is on COVID-19, the methods to be developed could be applied to other infectious diseases, helping communities worldwide prepare for future health emergencies.

By synthesizing advancements across mathematical modeling, wastewater epidemiology, and geographic information science (GIScience), the research approach innovatively connects human behavior insights with wastewater data to enhance viral transmission understanding and forecasts at the community level. To achieve this, the Investigators will pursue three main objectives: (1) Develop an early-warning system using wastewater and digital and social behavior data; (2) Create a socio-immuno-epidemiological framework to examine the effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions and the emergence of dominant variants using wastewater surveillance data; and (3) Model the impact of pandemic fatigue social behaviors on viral transmission at the community level. These objectives will be addressed by a interdisciplinary research team, which brings together expertise in applied mathematics, epidemiology, public health, and geography. This approach represents a significant step forward in understanding the complex interactions between human behavior, immune responses, and pathogen spread. Ultimately, the research outcomes will equip health officials with valuable tools for designing proactive, targeted, and adaptable interventions, enabling quicker and more informed decision-making.

A graph consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges, each of which links a pair of nodes.  PI will extend this framework to the study of neuronal activity.  In the neuronal case, each node is a neuron, and edges between them represent the one-way or directed synaptic connections through which neurons interact.  Moreover, to capture the different levels of activity that neurons exhibit, each node will be in one of three states, with state changes determined by interactions along edges.  PI will develop novel mathematical methods to analyze the patterns of activity that emerge in such multi-state, directed graphs.  These methods will allow the project team to study how activity spreads in networks of neurons, how this spread depends on the connection patterns in the network, and what properties characterize sets of nodes that are especially effective at spreading activity.  The research results will generate novel predictions about the properties and function of networks of neurons in the brain, with a focus on the key networks that drive breathing and other essential, rhythmic behaviors. The project will train students, will generate openly available computer code, and will include public outreach through online videos and a summer math program for girls. <br/><br/>Functional outputs from brain circuits driving certain critical, rhythmic behaviors require the widespread emergence of an elevated, bursting state of neuronal activity.  The main goal of this project is to advance knowledge about how the localized initiation of activity can rapidly evolve into widespread bursting in synaptically coupled neuronal networks, exemplified by the respiratory brainstem circuit.  The project team will achieve this goal by representing such networks as digraphs in which each node can assume one of three possible activity states ? inactive, weakly active, and fully active or bursting -- with updates based on in-neighbors? states.  Little theory exists to characterize this multi-state bootstrap percolation framework, and we will develop new analytical approaches involving mean field and master equations, asymptotic and probabilistic estimates, and graph design based on combinatorial principles.  The analysis will address differences between dynamics in this framework and that in bootstrap percolation with only two possible states per node, the impact of global graph properties on activity spread, and the characteristics of local initiation sites that result in especially effective activity propagation.  Overall, the project will support a new interdisciplinary collaboration and the completed work, involving trainee mentorship and open sharing of code, will provide important insights and predictions about neuronal dynamics and interactions as well as a range of mathematical advances.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Research Resources Cluster in the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While much research has focused on individual reactions to risks and policies, this project examines how groups of people, such as households, communities, or organizations, demonstrate coordinated risk-mitigating behavior and make collective decisions during an epidemic. These group-level behaviors can significantly impact the trajectory of an epidemic, beyond what can be captured by aggregating individual behaviors. By studying group behaviors, such as the formation of social bubbles and changes in risk-mitigating norms and conventions, this research aims to create better mathematical models that reflect real-world social interactions. These models will help scientists and policymakers develop more effective strategies for managing epidemics, ultimately saving lives and reducing social and economic impacts. Additionally, insights from this research could inform policies on a range of issues including gun violence, opioid abuse, disaster response, and community resilience, where group behaviors play a critical role.<br/><br/>The research concentrates on two main questions: 1) How can mathematical models and scalable computational algorithms be created to incorporate group-level behavioral responses in epidemic models? 2) How much do group-level responses significantly influence pandemic trajectories, and what are the resulting policy implications? The team plans to jointly work on several interconnected research thrusts. They will build mathematical foundations using a three-level network model and cooperative game theory to incorporate group-level behavioral responses, such as the formation and transformation of pandemic social bubbles and localized risk-mitigating norms within pandemic models. Next, they will create computational models that enable scalable and interpretable execution of these network-based approaches, developing dynamic networks using geospatial data and designing network downscaling algorithms to improve simulation efficiency. The team will use causal identification based on various natural experiments to estimate the input parameters of the models, focusing on empirically measuring perceived risk, peer effects on interaction networks, and the formation of social bubbles. Finally, they will implement and validate the model comprehensively at the county level in the US and at a more granular level in Boston neighborhoods, examining the policy implications of group-level behavioral responses.

Using the hazard function, this in vivo model can predict the epidemiological incidence of mutants. Fitting predicted to observed mutant age-incidence data for humans will yield a parameterized and predictive model of human TET2 and DNMT3A mutant evolution.

Environmental disturbances that cause mortality, such as fire, drought, and flood, are an important feature of any biological community. Through these changes, disturbances can alter the composition of a community and change how the community functions. Biological communities are increasingly facing novel disturbances, and humans routinely employ disturbances, such as pesticides and logging, to manage and harvest ecosystems. Uncovering the myriad effects of disturbances on communities is therefore important for our understanding and management of any ecosystem. However, a systematic understanding of disturbances has been challenging because they come in many forms and affect every type of community. Our project will employ two novel approaches to overcome this challenge. First, it will directly compare the effects of two broad types of disturbances: pulses, which are short and discrete events, and presses, which are long and sustained events. Second, the project will uncover the effects of disturbances on communities where organisms compete over limited resources as well as in communities where one organism consumes another. The project will use a community of bacteria and their predators which allows for highly controlled experiments, which will then inform field systems. It will also recruit a new generation of scientists into disturbance ecology through a course on student-led research projects, which has been shown to increase STEM retention rates in students across diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>A critical difference between pulse and press disturbances lies in how communities respond to them over time. To precisely compare the effects of pulse vs. press disturbances, one major challenge is to analyze how variations in dynamics arising from different frequencies and intensities of pulses result in different community outcomes, while controlling for the overall mortality rate over the duration of the disturbance.  Consequently, ecologists have historically studied press and pulse disturbances separately. Our recent work, however, has developed novel methods to overcome this challenge. We further hypothesize that pulse and press disturbances can have qualitatively different effects on community dynamics. The project will test these methods and hypotheses by integrating mathematical models of disturbances with microcosm experiments. Using microbial systems, we will: (1) Determine the differential effects of pulse and press disturbances on competitive community dynamics in a single trophic layer using an experimental community of Pseudomonas fluorescens strains; (2) Develop mathematical models to elucidate the effects of pulse and press disturbances on communities with predator-prey interactions; (3) Experimentally analyze the differential effects of pulse and press disturbances on predator-prey dynamics using a protist predator Tetrahymena thermophila of P. fluorescens. Our work generalizes disturbance theory to consumer-resource interactions (e.g., predator-prey, host-pathogen, plant-herbivore), which are ubiquitous and fundamental processes across ecological systems yet often overlooked in the disturbance literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chikungunya (CHIK) is a viral disease transmitted to humans through the bites of mosquitoes infected with the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). CHIKV is endemic in Central and South American countries, posing significant public health burdens. As the ?gateway to Latin America?, Miami-Dade County, Florida, has seen annual importations of CHIKV cases over the last decade. Miami-Dade County has an abundant population of Aedes mosquitoes, a suitable climate that promotes the growth of these mosquito vector species, and the potential for local CHIKV circulation. Integrating Aedes mosquito data collected in Miami-Dade County and local CHIK outbreak data from Brazil into a hybrid machine learning and mathematical modeling framework, the investigative team will reconstruct CHIKV dynamics in Brazil and evaluate control efforts in Florida. The project will further assess the risk for importation and local transmission of CHIKV in Florida considering global environmental changes. This study will provide valuable insights into the transmission dynamics of CHIKV and assist in developing more effective preventive and control measures.

Derived from skin or blood cells, hiPSCs are reprogrammed to an embryonic-like state, enabling them to differentiate into any cell type, such as blood, immune, heart, and neuron cells. This Nobel Prize-winning technology circumvents the ethical issues associated with human embryonic stem cells and provides valuable models for studying human development, disease, drug testing, and potential cell-based therapies. However, to leverage hiPSCs in clinical settings and large-scale manufacturing, there are significant challenges to overcome. One major challenge is accurately identifying cell types at different stages of differentiation, which is crucial for ensuring the cells perform their intended functions. Traditional experimental methods for cell identification can be costly, time-consuming, and limited in robustness. This research aims to address these challenges by developing explainable and physics-informed machine learning models. These models will enhance the accuracy and reliability of cell type identification, ensuring that hiPSC technology can be widely adopted in clinical and industrial applications, ultimately benefiting society through improved healthcare solutions and advancing our understanding of human biology.  The project will involve both graduate and undergraduate students, with graduate students focusing on core theory and method development while undergraduates investigate applications. The PIs will work with Purdue?s Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), and Summer Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) program to mentor additional underrepresented minority students each summer to work on interdisciplinary research in stem cell engineering and machine learning. Outreach activities will include developing hands-on K-12 activities, partnering with local organizations, organizing lab tours, and presenting research at the ""Mending Broken Hearts"" gallery exhibit, aiming to increase STEM participation among underrepresented groups.<br/> <br/>This research project addresses critical challenges in the adoption and scalability of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by developing novel machine learning methodologies. The specific problems targeted include the need for high-accuracy, cost-effective cell type identification during differentiation and the incorporation of prior biological knowledge into explaining machine learning models. The PIs intend  to create explainable machine learning algorithms that leverage single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and imaging data to provide counterfactual explanations, highlighting key genes or image features critical for cell typing. These models will utilize mixed-integer programming to solve counterfactual explanations to generate interpretable predictions, addressing the limitations of current black-box approaches. Additionally, the aim is to overcome data scarcity by integrating biological knowledge into the machine learning frameworks, employing novel physics-informed machine learning algorithms.

Non-destructive measurements of single-cell protein expression in yeast cells have revealed that signaling in quiescence-related biochemical pathways can be highly heterogeneous across genetically identical cell populations as they transition into dormancy, even though they are treated with the exact same stress type and timing. Mathematical modeling has produced remarkable insights into the protein interaction networks that govern the yeast cell cycle and quiescence, however, predicting the transition from proliferation into quiescence at the single-cell level remains unclear under most physiological scenarios. The goal of this project is to develop a mathematical model that recapitulates the heterogeneity in proliferation/quiescence transitions of yeast cells in response to multiple quiescence-promoting stimuli. To accomplish this goal, this project will couple the development of novel scientific machine learning methods, chemical and environmental perturbation experiments, and single-cell protein expression measurements in live yeast cells. This research will address the mathematical challenges of learning and validating mathematical models from heterogeneous high-dimensional time series data to answer significant questions about how signaling pathways govern cell fate and differentiation. The project?s findings will be applicable to quiescence-related phenomena such as chemotherapy-resistant quiescent cancer cells, stem cells that exit quiescence for wound healing, and developmental processes that rely on the ubiquitous stress signaling pathways that will be studied. Research findings will be communicated to the scientific community through conference workshops and minisymposia, and to the general public through the creation of new K-12 outreach exhibits.<br/><br/>The proposed work will develop a data-driven mathematical framework to mechanistically explain inter-cellular variability during proliferation-quiescence transitions. Specifically, new deep learning tools will be developed to directly learn differential equation models from multivariate protein expression data collected from individual yeast cells undergoing quiescence in response to a diverse range of biologically relevant stressors. These research efforts will involve the integration of recurrent neural networks, multi-task learning, and novel regularization methods that enable deep learning models to simultaneously learn differential equations from thousands of single-cell replicates of protein expression time series data. Sensitivity analysis methods will be developed in conjunction with these new deep learning tools to enable optimization within a vast space of stress combinations and timing, thereby generating quantitative predictions about which experimental perturbations have the greatest effect on inter-cellular phenotype variability. The application of the new framework to non-destructive single-cell data arising from state-of-the-art experimental setups will shed new light on how coordinated cell division, stress, and metabolic signaling pathways produce intercellular variability in protein expression and quiescence phenotypes observed across species. In addition, this project will provide interdisciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students, and develop open-source code for application to biological data sets involving perturbation experiments with multivariate time series data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The models used to predict pathogen spread do not include the complexity of interactions between disease and human behavior but instead focus on biological processes and policy interventions. However, disease transmission depends on people?s behaviors, which are shaped by their perceptions of risk from the disease and from health interventions, as well as by the opinions and behaviors of the other people around them. This project will contribute to the development of mathematical epidemiological models that better represent the complexities of the human response to disease and that can be used to evaluate the relative impacts of public health policies on disease dynamics. The project will be focused on understanding respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, seasonal flu, and bird flu, but can be readily modified to be broadly applicable to other infectious diseases such as HIV or Ebola. The project will contribute to existing national COVID-19 and Flu Scenario Modeling Hubs that are working to better predict and understand the dynamics of infectious disease and to contribute to policy interventions. The Investigators will disseminate the results and foster connections with the disease modeling community through a workshop for public health professionals and will engage the public through production of educational music videos targeted at the broader community<br/><br/>The complexity of human behavior is not well represented in epidemiological models, contributing to reduced skill and utility of model forecasts. While some epidemiological models represent human behavioral responses using a few static parameters, the Investigators will construct models of human behavior and policy processes that update dynamically to represent the dependence of human responses to the evolving state of the epidemic. Human cognition, social and policy responses will be represented using a system of differential equations linked with a traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model using infectious respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 as model systems. Adoption of protective behaviors (vaccination, physical distancing) will be a function of risk perceptions (from disease and health interventions), health policies (lockdowns, vaccine mandates), and the behavior of other people (social norms). Policy interventions and adoption of protective behaviors mediate disease spread and impacts (infections and deaths) that influence human behavioral and policy responses. Mathematical novelty arises because cognition depends upon the history of infection, so the differential equations have past-dependence, generating differential integral equations. Model outputs will be used to analyze the sensitivity of and uncertainty in epidemic forecasts that arise from human risk perceptions, social influence, protective behaviors, and policy interventions. This project will advance the disease modeling community?s capability to analyze the interlinked dynamics of human social systems and infectious disease, increase the impact of social science on the disease modeling community, and will develop analysis methods for the complex and time-dependent interactions that arise from linkages of disease dynamics with social systems. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) and the CDC Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division (CORVD).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(?NASEM DT REPORT?). The purpose of this report was to bring structure to the burgeoning field of digital twins by providing a working definition and a series of research challenges that need to be addressed to allow this technology to fulfill its full potential. The concept of digital twins is compelling and has the potential to impact a broad range of domains. For instance, digital twins have either been proposed or are currently being developed for manufactured devices, buildings, cities, ecologies and the Earth as a whole. It is natural that the concept be applied to biology and medicine, as the most recognizable concept of a ?twin? is that of identical human twins. The application of digital twins to biomedicine also follows existing trends of Personalized and Precision medicine, in short: ?the right treatment for the right person at the right time.? Fulfilling the promise of biomedical digital twins will require multidisciplinary Team Science that brings together various experts from fields as diverse as medicine, computer science, engineering, biological research, advanced mathematics and ethics. The purpose of this conference, the ?2024 Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group (IMAG)/Multiscale Modeling (MSM) Consortium Meeting: Setting up Teams for Biomedical Digital Twins,? is to do exactly this: bringing together such needed expertise in a series of teaming exercises to operationalize the findings of the NASEM DT REPORT in the context of biomedical digital twins. As part of outreach and training efforts to broaden the participation within this growing field, this workshop will provide support for both traditionally under-represented categories of senior researchers as well as junior researchers such as graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. <br/><br/>Facilitating the development and deployment of biomedical digital twins requires operationalizing the findings and recommendations of the NASEM DT REPORT, which raises a series of specific and unique challenges in the biomedical domain. More specifically, there are numerous steps that need to be taken to convert the highly complex simulation models of biological processes developed by members of the MSM Consortium into biomedical digital twins that are compliant with the definition of digital twins presented in the NASEM DT REPORT. There are also identified challenges associated with these various steps. Some of these challenges can benefit from lessons learned in other domains that have developed digital twins while others will require the development of new techniques in the fields of statistics, computational mathematics and mathematical biology. This task will require multidisciplinary collaborations between mathematicians, computational researchers, experimental biologists and clinicians. This IMAG/MSM meeting will promote the concepts of Team Science to bring together experienced multiscale modeling researchers and experts from the mathematical, statistical, computational, experimental and clinical communities to form the multidisciplinary teams needed to operationalize the findings of the NASEM DT REPORT.

In this project, the principal investigator will extend relevant dynamical results from the finite dimensional case to the infinite dimensional case. These include results about dynamical semi-flows generated by evolutionary partial differential equations. Such equations model a variety of physical phenomena. A second component of the project consists in leveraging the principal investigator?s expertise in interdisciplinary research to identify recurrent themes and emergent phenomena arising naturally in the biological sciences, thereby incorporating new phenomenology into a modern theory of dynamical systems. In addition to these scientific advances, the proposed projects offer ample training opportunities for students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The project centers on four lines of research. The first two lines seek to extend finite-dimensional phenomena to infinite dimensions.

The second project seeks to extract low dimensional structures and dynamical phenomena embedded in high dimensions. Specifically, the PI will aim to show that shear-induced chaos is a source of instability in physical models including the Navier-Stokes system. The remaining two projects investigate a class of reaction networks of relevance to biology. Mean-field approaches to the large-time behavior of scalable networks will be investigated. The project also aims to study the novel concept of `depletion?, a bifurcation phenomenon amenable to mathematical analysis. From the viewpoint of applications, depletion occurs naturally in several contexts and potentially has dire biological consequences.

In the single species context, theoretical models have simplified the study of adaptation to genotype/phenotype fitness, however complex eco-evolutionary dynamics in multi-species communities have challenged researchers.  For example, in microbial and virus-immune response ecosystems, a dynamic fitness landscape determines whether pathogen strains can gain several resistance mutations.  This project aims to bridge ecosystem dynamics with evolutionary genetics by analyzing ecological models evolving on fitness landscapes and developing a computational platform for incorporating phylogenetics. The advances can inform vaccines and therapies which prevent pathogen resistance against multiple immune responses or drugs.  This research will engage undergraduate and graduate students, providing interdisciplinary training in computational and mathematical biology.<br/><br/>Recent work has sought to understand assembly of interacting species in ecosystem models. However, the overwhelming number of species combinations and connecting the models to evolution have challenged researchers, especially in higher dimensional systems. This project aims to address this gap by looking through an evolutionary genetics lens, representing species variants as binary sequences which encode ecological interactions and fitness landscapes.  First, persistence and stability of equilibria in models of ecological networks will be analyzed and linked to epistasis (non-additivity) in underlying fitness landscapes, facilitating simplifying rules for ecosystem evolution. Predator-prey and consumer-resource networks pertaining to viral evolution, microbiomes and antibiotic resistance, along with applications to immunotherapy and treatments, will be considered. Next, the PI will construct a flexible computational method for jointly simulating eco-evolutionary trajectories and phylogenetic trees, which can validate the theoretical results, and confront both genetic and population dynamic data. The work will involve interdisciplinary collaboration into how fitness landscapes shape ecological network evolution for HIV-immune dynamics, and microbial resistance to antibiotics and phage infection.

Epidermal cells in plant leaves, especially pavement cells (PCs), exhibit interdigitated puzzle shapes. Shape formation of PCs serves as an ideal model to understand principles governing cell morphogenesis and tissue growth in developmental biology. During the development, PCs change from small rounded polygonal shapes into large interdigitated puzzle shapes, under the regulation of the extracellular plant hormone and multiple key molecules accumulated at the plasma membrane (PM). This developmental process also involves reorganization of cytoskeletal components and dynamic cell-to-cell communication. The multiscale mathematical model proposed in this research will have a broad range of applications from tissue engineering to biomanufacturing and biotechnology. The PI will develop a satellite undergraduate research program based on University of California, Riverside (UCR), a Hispanic-serving institution with many first generation college students. The program will also recruit students from California State Universities and high schools in local public school district. Research symposia and summer research programs will be organized through the coordination with department of mathematics, Association of Women in Mathematics at UCR Chapter, Interdisciplinary Center for Quantitative Modeling in Biology at UCR, and nearby colleges to promote public awareness on research and career paths in mathematical biology.<br/><br/>The morphogenesis of PCs is a complex process. During the early stage, extracellular hormone induces nanoclustering on the PM of individual cells to initiate cell polarization. It is followed by nonhomogeneous mechanical forces exerted along cell wall and a subcellular signaling gradient to regulate cell-cell interaction. Stable cell polarization, further the interdigitated jigsaw cell shapes, will be established under the regulations between the nanoclustering signals and structural components in the same cell and regulations of Rho GTPase signals between neighboring cells. Different hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism underlying the PC morphogenesis, while most of them focus on either chemical signals or mechanical properties in PCs. The proposed study will test new hypotheses that include both the chemical signaling network and mechanical properties, as well as interactions between them, and therefore provide novel insights into the fundamental principles of cell shape formation and tissue development. This project will develop a multiscale model using the local level set method to incorporate both chemical signals and mechanical properties in a multicellular environment to test different hypotheses on the shape formation of PCs.

In addition, this proposed research will incorporate interdisciplinary graduate students and local community college undergraduates to train the next generation of scientists in the ever-evolving intersection of data science, biology, and mathematics.  Alongside research activities, the project will create mentorship networks for supporting first-generation student scientists in pursuit of diversifying the STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The supported research is a comprehensive program for studying single-molecule gene expression spatial patterns through the lens of stochastic reaction-diffusion models. The key aim is to generalize mathematical connections between these models and their observation as spatial point processes. The new theory will incorporate factors necessary to describe spatial gene expression at subcellular and multicellular scales including various reactions, spatial movements, and geometric effects. This project will also establish the statistical theory of inference on the resulting inverse problem of inferring stochastic rates from only snapshots of individual particle positions. Investigations into parameter identifiability, optimal experimental design, and model selection will ensure robust and reliable inference. In complement to the developed theory, this project will implement and benchmark cutting-edge approaches for efficiently performing large-scale statistical inference, including variational Bayesian Monte Carlo and physics-informed neural networks.  The culmination of this work will be packaged into open-source software that infers interpretable biophysical parameters from multi-gene tissue-scale datasets.<br/><br/>This CAREER Award is co-funded by the Mathematical Biology and Statistics Programs at the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Cellular Dynamics & Function Cluster in the Division of Molecular & Cellular Biosciences, BIO Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is important to study the interplay between environmental fluctuations, both deterministic and random, and the persistence of interacting species. Developing a rigorous mathematical theory for coexistence, in conjunction with data-driven applications, will help theoretical ecologists pinpoint how harvesting and periodic or random environmental fluctuations affect the long term dynamics of ecological communities. Global climate change models predict increasing temporal variability in temperature, precipitation and storms in the next century. The research project will provide much-needed theoretical underpinning for this fast-moving area. The application related to the harvesting of marine animals will be key for conservation and management of vulnerable or endangered species. Questions around optimal control of stochastic models are vital in today's world where there are multiple global crises in a changing environment as well as species loss. Ecologists and evolutionary biologists invoke stochasticity as a key determinant of everything from population genetics to extinction risk. But the exposure that scientists from such disciplines actually get to the mathematical concepts underpinning stochastic processes is incomplete. An integral component of the educational objectives will be the organization of a summer school at the interface of biology and stochastics targeted to advanced undergraduate and graduate students from mathematics and biology. <br/><br/>In order to have realistic models for the coexistence of species it is important to incorporate both periodic and random environmental fluctuations. Connecting ideas from dynamical systems and stochastic processes, it will be possible to show that the long-term dynamics is determined by the invasion rates (Lyapunov exponents) of the periodic measures living on the boundary of the state space. The developed ideas will then be used to look at non-stationary community theory where the long term behavior of the system can not be described by an equilibrium, an attractor, or a stationary distribution. An important question from conservation biology is how to harvest a given population in order to maximize the yield while not driving the population extinct. While there are a few results for single-species systems, little is known in the significantly more realistic setting of interacting species. By using a combination of novel approaches from stochastic control and Markov chain approximation methods one can analyze multi-species harvesting problems and then apply the results in order to gain insight for important real-life applications from fishery management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerous infectious disease outbreaks over the past two decades have demonstrated the need for epidemiological modeling. They also revealed shortcomings of existing scientific techniques to accurately predict epidemic dynamics and to devise effective control strategies. This project will establish a new efficient simulation method that makes it possible to assess rare but highly consequential events. It will be used to identify decisive risk factors concerning the fabric of virus-spreading interactions that can facilitate large epidemic outbreaks. A well-documented example are superspreading events that played an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigations will be focused on models for diseases similar to COVID-19 and HIV as archetypal cases. The improved understanding and models of epidemiological processes will be used to devise and analyze efficient preventive strategies with the goal of providing more reliable guidance for the general public and health-policy decision makers, saving lives and resources.<br/><br/>Traditionally, the dynamics of infectious diseases are studied on the basis of deterministic compartmental models, where the population is divided into large groups, and deterministic differential equations for the group sizes are employed to investigate disease dynamics. Classical examples are the deterministic SIR and SIS models. This is a strong simplification of reality that ignores to a large extent the heterogeneity in contact patterns and biomedically relevant attributes across the population as well as the stochastic nature of infection processes. Both have a decisive impact on the dynamics at the early stages of epidemic outbreaks and need to be incorporated to enable reliable predictions. Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods can sample more realistic stochastic agent-based dynamics, but cannot efficiently assess the preconditions leading to rare consequential events. The project will address this challenge with a new numerical technique that allows one to efficiently sample important but rare epidemic trajectories of realistic models under suitable constraints. The research will renew attention on the crucial role of rare events in the genesis of large outbreaks, including combinations of bottlenecks in contact networks and the stochastic nature of the disease dynamics. Risk-factor analysis based on the new method will provide answers to cutting-edge questions in disease diffusion concerning outbreak preconditions, information flow, and control strategies. This approach will open new avenues for research on the prevention and control of epidemics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Human Networks and Data Science program (HNDS) of the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research shows that the frequency of large disease outbreaks is increasing over time globally, and yet differences in outcomes remain poorly understood.  This research will explore the factors that drove variation in COVID-19 outcomes across the counties and metropolitan areas of Oklahoma, particularly which areas had more or fewer cases than would be expected based on their overall population size.  The investigators will look at both environmental factors, such as weather patterns and air quality, and socioeconomic factors such as numbers of doctors and differences in the proportion of individuals that were willing to be vaccinated.  The investigators will also conduct surveys of individual across the state to try and better understand why people made the healthcare choices that they did and how behavior drove differences in outcomes. Understanding all of these factors requires a team with diverse expertise. Traditionally, most mathematical and quantitative models for disease dynamics have been developed and studied by mathematicians, ecologists, and computer scientists. However, understanding differences in attitudes towards health care measures and how they originate is more the purview of social scientists and historians. By building a team of collaborators spanning all of these disciplines, the research team will be able to build a more complete picture of COVID-19 outcomes in Oklahoma. This will in turn suggest what actions may be most effective to try and best mitigate the effects of both COVID and other large-scale disease events in the future. The final product of this work will include a new data repository and a public-facing intelligent epidemiological modeling platform powered by Jupyter Notebooks. The project will also provide outreach and training, including to students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Increases in outbreak frequency seem to be related to globalization and other human activities. Yet the effects of most human behavioral, social and economic factors on outbreak risk are rarely quantified.  Relevant social factors can be hard to measure, often needing specialists to generate and interpret data.  However social scientists with expertise to do so are rarely trained in mathematical modelling of disease dynamics.  To address these challenges, the investigators will focus on developing data sources and mathematical models that can be used to explore COVID-19 outcomes in Oklahoma.  The project will be a true collaboration between social scientists and experts in modelling infectious diseases.  Oklahoma is understudied, and is spatially heterogeneous such that models of disease dynamics in Oklahoma are likely to be generalizable to many other regions of the US. The Investigators will generate protocols for standardizing existing data on behavioral and socioeconomic factors as well as develop new data sources. The team will develop statistical models of past outbreaks, and mathematical models reflecting factors shown to have driven COVID-19 dynamics empirically.  The latter work will demonstrate how baseline SIR-like models can be modified to reflect human behavioral factors. The Investigators will also contrast the performance of models based on existing data on socioeconomic factors with models incorporating new survey data on variation in behaviors and attitudes related to primary and secondary prevention.  The code and datasets to be generated will be made freely available and searchable in an intelligent epidemiological modeling framework, which will enable other researchers to easily iterate on them.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Closely related viruses, however, can have very dissimilar genomes, complicating integration of knowledge acquired from the study of independent viruses, and limiting prediction of the characteristics and potential threats of emerging viruses. Viruses, however, conserve a few structural properties that could help circumvent this problem. Most viruses store their infective genetic material in a protein shell called a capsid. The capsid self-assembles from multiple copies of the same (or similar) proteins, and most capsids display icosahedral symmetry. This architecture optimizes the interaction of proteins and the volume available to store the viral genetic information. This research project hypothesizes that viruses have evolved a limited set of replication strategies to specialize and exploit the reduced number of geometrical templates capable of forming icosahedral capsids. This, in turn, may have constrained the number of three-dimensional configurations adopted by capsid proteins, providing a mechanistic rationale for the existence of viral structural lineages. This hypothesis will be tested by analyzing and comparing hundreds of viruses from multiple different viral families using novel mathematical methods. Confirming this hypothesis will offer a quantitative framework to study viral evolution and open the door to design of generic antiviral strategies targeting viruses in the same structural lineage.<br/><br/>Only ten protein folds have been identified among major capsid proteins of viruses that form icosahedral capsids. These folds define viral lineages that group viruses that can be genetically unrelated and infect hosts from different domains of life. This limited number of folds contrasts with the vast genetic diversity of viruses. The existence of these folds across the virosphere, however, remains unknown. Here, it is hypothesized that there is a direct relationship between the viral replication strategy of each viral lineage, the icosahedral lattice of the capsid, and the fold of capsid proteins. The hypothesis will be tested by developing a database that will include the viral replication, protein fold, and capsid lattice of five hundred viruses that have been reconstructed at high or medium molecular resolution. Voronoi tessellations and protein-protein interaction lattices will be obtained to identify computationally the icosahedral lattice associated to each virus. Additionally, molecular measurements of the reconstructed capsids will be obtained to establish allometric relationships for at least one viral lineage, facilitating the prediction of icosahedral capsid properties from genomic information. The new icosahedral framework will be also extended to obtain new sets of elongated capsids, which represent the second most abundant type of capsid. The methods will be disseminated online for use by viral structure researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The distribution of such variable traits within a species can shift over time. For example, behavioral traits can change quickly in response to environmental change or species interactions. The dynamic shift of trait distribution within a species can modify the interaction patterns among species and ultimately affect the stability of ecosystems. However, the prevalence and significance of such effects have not been evaluated systematically. This research project aims to fill in the gap by integrating theoretical and empirical approaches. A mathematical framework will be developed to classify different types of interaction modification and identify conditions that would destabilize ecosystems. Additionally, a comprehensive survey of empirical studies will be conducted to assess the level of evidence for the various types of interaction modification identified above and provide criteria for evaluating past and future case studies. This project will train young researchers in the interdisciplinary area between mathematics and ecology to address important environmental and ecological problems facing the next generation. In addition, educational kits and programs will be designed to promote teaching of important ecological concepts and engage underrepresented groups in K-12 schools.<br/> <br/>Intraspecific trait variation has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in determining ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Although some work has examined how the variation of heritable traits affects eco-evolutionary dynamics, non-heritable variation caused by phenotypic plasticity, developmental differences, or species interactions has received less consideration. Ecosystems have traditionally been studied as dynamical systems with fixed interaction strengths, but these interaction strengths will no longer be constant if the trait distributions can shift within short timescales. Such ?trait-shift induced interaction modification? (TSIIM) can lead to higher-order interactions among species, causing species extinction or coexistence that are otherwise unexpected. This project will develop a theoretical framework for studying TSIIM by generalizing traditional dynamical systems to incorporate intraspecific trait variation and categorizing these systems into different network motifs. The effect on large ecosystems will be studied using a disordered systems approach augmented by the new motifs. Meta-analysis of these motifs using empirical studies will provide insight on the mechanisms by which higher-order interactions arise from TSIIM, prompting experimental searches for such phenomena and their consequences.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology Program at the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Population and Community Ecology Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology at the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
