Mathematical models are used broadly across biology to understand mechanisms, make predictions, and guide intervention strategies. To do so, the model parameters often must be calibrated using data; the estimated parameters can have significant implications for reliability of insights generated from the model and data. This raises the important question of whether the calibration process is well posed, i.e. is it possible to uniquely estimate model parameters from a given type or set of data? Identifiability analysis is the study of these issues, and this project will improve and expand the currently available set of algebraic identifiability methods to set them on a firmer theoretical basis and address new types of models used broadly in many biological settings. Beyond academia, the algorithms to be developed will allow researchers to successfully link models and experiments to generate model-based insights that improve real-world treatment strategies. Training will be provided to two Ph.D. students working on research for this project. The training component will also include interdisciplinary course development as well as a conference with tutorial lectures and problem sessions to educate industrial and academic participants in the theory, algorithms, and software developed in this project.  This project is supported jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Mathematical Biology and Division of Computing and Communication Foundations Algorithmic Foundations programs.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigators will develop, analyze, and implement symbolic and symbolic-numeric algorithms that perform identifiability analysis of dynamic models (including ordinary differential (ODE), delay, and difference equation models) that appear in biology and other sciences. Using these algorithms, they will also carry out identifiability analysis for a range of models drawn from cellular signaling and physiology applications. The proposed algorithms will be based on differential-difference algebra, which connects to identifiability in the common case of rational ODEs/delay/difference equations by applying differential-difference elimination algorithms to the model equations. Such symbolic methods for ODE models have proven to be productive in the area of parameter identifiability. The proposed methods would allow a large class of models to be analyzed for structural identifiability, allowing one to assess which parameters can be estimated and tailor experiment design to answer the questions of interest for treatment strategies and mechanistic insights. For the first time, rigorously justified and analyzed efficient algorithms will be available for identifiability problems in delay and difference equation models. Certified and more efficient algorithms will appear for global identifiability problems in ODE models. To carry out the proposed research, new advances in the algebraic theory of differential/difference equations will be made.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to demarcating cellular boundaries, these membranes perform critical functions such as the uptake of nutrients and drugs into the cell and ejection of material out of the cell. Membranes perform these functions by interacting with many different proteins. Therefore, understanding how membrane-protein interactions take place is critical for gaining insight not just into how cells function but also for understanding how viruses can hijack cells or how better drug delivery systems can be designed. The work proposed here will result in new computational algorithms and experimental tools to understand how cellular membranes interact with proteins to regulate these fundamental functions. The insights generated from our effort will fill major gaps in current understanding about how the cell membrane can change its shape to affect its function. These insights have the potential to benefit society in multiple ways including (i) improving understanding of the mechanisms that pathogens use to invade cells, suggesting new therapeutic strategies; (ii) inspiring the design of better systems for drug and gene delivery, and; (iii) revealing fundamental mechanisms that structure and organize soft matter, potentially leading to improvements in technologies that rely on such materials including surfactants, cosmetics, fuels, and foods. <br/><br/>Membrane curvature plays a role in nearly every cellular function, in both health and disease. The curvature of the membrane is mediated by many proteins that interact with lipids. In this proposal, we will develop new theoretical and computational models of membrane-protein interactions with a focus on understanding how protein crowding can lead to membrane curvature generation. This effort combines multiscale modeling of membrane bending with quantitative detailed experimental measurements of membrane surface coverage, steric pressure, and curvature. The multiscale modeling efforts include coarse-grained models of lipid bilayer-protein interactions that will inform the continuum models of membrane curvature generation. The team of investigators includes an experimental biophysicist, a theoretical biophysicist, and mathematicians. The insights generated from our efforts will fill major gaps in current understanding of how membrane curvature is generated and stabilized. We also anticipate these applications driving additional development of the theory and numerical treatment of nonlinear geometric partial differential equations posed on surfaces with constraints.  Additionally, the team of investigators will participate in outreach and educational activities, including programs for high school students, undergraduate research opportunities, and new course development.

Numerous cells in the body are electrically active. They produce electrical impulses, and these impulses through which nerve cells code and transmit information, endocrine cells secrete hormones, and muscle cells initiate contraction. Understanding the electrical activity of these cells is fundamental to understanding their behavior. This is, no easy task, since the electrical activity is mediated by ion flow through several types of ion channels in the cell membrane interacting in nonlinear ways through the membrane potential. Adding to this complexity, there are numerous intracellular signaling molecules acting on some of these channels and modifying their behavior. This project focuses on oscillations in the membrane potential of insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas, stress-hormone-secreting pituitary cells, and cells of the cardiac ventricles. These oscillations can be beneficial or pathological, depending on the cell type. One objective of this project is to understand why the oscillations happen and, in the case that they are pathological, to determine how they can be terminated. Another objective is to train undergraduate and graduate students in the theory and application of sophisticated mathematical techniques that are directly applicable to biological systems. This training is facilitated through the interaction with several experimental labs.<br/><br/>The variables that describe an electrically excitable cell often vary on significantly different times scales. Some variables adapt quickly to changes in the cell's membrane potential, while others adapt more slowly. In such cases, oscillations in the membrane potential can occur at the level of the subsystem of fast variables, or at the level of the slow subsystem, or at some intermediate level that involves variables from both subsystems. To understand the basis of the oscillations, system variables should be partitioned in an appropriate way, facilitating the use of geometric singular perturbation analysis, or fast/slow analysis. This project employs fast/slow analysis in the examination of bursting oscillations in pituitary corticotrophs and pancreatic beta-cells, and pathological early after depolarizations (EADs) in ventricular myocytes.  The former drive the secretion of hormones, while the latter can lead to, at the tissue level, ventricular tachycardia. The fast/slow analysis of the different models will uncover the mechanisms through which modulators of cell behavior, such as corticosteroids or glucose or hypokalemia, act to move the cell among distinct behaviors, some rhythmic and some not. It will also be used to understand the effects of different stimulus frequencies on EAD production in ventricular myocytes, which normally receive periodic stimulation from the sinoatrial node in situ.

Understanding and predicting the course of such outbreaks is challenging due to the variability of individuals, particularly with respect to their levels of protection against various infections. This work will address three infectious diseases of worldwide interest: dengue, malaria and whooping cough. Simple mathematical models have been successful at describing the epidemics of and suggesting intervention strategies for simple infectious disease. More complicated diseases, however, require the development and analysis of more complicated models, particularly linking multiple scales - organismal, temporal, and spatial. The novel models and quantitative tools will provide insight into the reason for observed patterns of outbreaks as well as guide strategies for combating these complicated diseases.

This work furthers the mathematical theory of multi-scale systems of differential equations motivated through the incorporation of within-host heterogeneity in population models.

Circadian (~24 hour) rhythms in behavior and physiology, including sleep-wake rhythms, are entrained by the sun's daily light cycle and affect physical and mental health. These rhythms are driven by the brain's master circadian clock, which receives light information from the eyes and coordinates biological rhythms throughout the body. In modern life, exposure to artificial light can erode the crucial tie between internal physiological rhythms and environmental light timing. The proposed mathematical modeling and data analysis projects focus on understanding how information and uncertainty in light signals are processed and stored in the master circadian clock and propagated downstream to sleep-wake networks through neural signaling.  In collaboration with a clinical researcher, the mathematical models will be applied to data describing light exposure and sleep in elementary school-aged children during the school year and summer to understand summer vacation-induced disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms. An additional collaborator at a primarily undergraduate and Hispanic-serving institution will contribute to modeling the clock and developing a mathematical modeling mini-course for undergraduate students. Undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees will be involved in the research. This project is funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Mathematical Biology Program and the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems Neural Systems Cluster.<br/><br/>Behavioral states of waking, sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are governed by networks of brainstem and hypothalamic neuronal populations, and mathematical modeling of these networks provides insights into the dynamics of their interactions. The master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls the timing of behavior across the 24 hour day and involves a hierarchy of physiological processes from the intracellular molecular ""circadian clock,"" to clock-driven variations in the electrophysiological responses of SCN neurons, to the collective signaling of the SCN neural network and its dynamic role modulating sleep-wake behavior. Using an innovative combination of mathematical modeling and analysis, key aspects of light-dependent circadian modulation of sleep-wake behavior will be explored at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Return maps will be used to reduce dimensionality and formally classify the relationship between circadian signaling and bifurcations in sleep-wake patterning. Effects of coherence of SCN activity on sleep-wake behavior will be established theoretically, and these results will be applied to understand experimentally observed changes in phase relationships between dorsal and ventral SCN regions in rodents under seasonal light variation. SCN and sleep-wake network models will be combined to investigate the role of dorsal-ventral interactions in gating light effects on SCN activity; to quantify sensitivity of the human clock to erratic light schedules; and to examine mechanisms underlying summer vacation-induced changes in sleep-wake behavior in data collected in elementary school-aged children.

The investigators will carry out mathematical, statistical and computational analyses of these models to better understand factors affecting the geographical spread of Zika. Several vector-borne diseases (VBDs), such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika, have been imported into Florida, caused local outbreaks (dengue in 2009-2010 and 2013, chikungunya in 2014, Zika in 2016), and posed major public health problems. Dengue, chikungunya and Zika share the same primary mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, both abundant in Florida and capable of transmitting several other diseases. The transmission cycle of these VBDs is heavily influenced by seasonal changes, climate conditions, and human movement. Based on data from 2016 Zika outbreaks in Miami Beach, Wynwood, and Little River in Florida, they will build and calibrate models including the age structure of both hosts and vectors as well as the effects of seasonality to study the spatial and temporal dynamics and spread of Zika in Florida. The objectives are to be better prepared to anticipate and respond to similar reemerging arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. The project involves graduate students and postdoctoral trainees and results will be disseminated through seminars, conference presentations and journal publications.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are: (i) Since dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses have significant agreement in their spatiotemporal distributions, the PIs will develop a multi-scale (multi-region) multi-patch model to study the geographical spread of VBD. A large scale is used to describe the long distance human movement from regions to regions and a small scale is used to model the short distance movement of both mosquitoes and humans from patches to patches within a region. The model will be applied to simulate the geographical and local spread of Zika among Miami Beach, Wynwood, and Little River in 2016 and will be studied employing multiple scale analysis and slow-fast dynamical system theory. (ii) Since age distributions of both vectors and hosts are very important in the spread of VBD, the PIs will construct age-structured models to study the effect of age distributions of both mosquitoes and humans on the transmission of VBD and use the model to design optimal vector control policies and to access disease risk for different age groups. (iii) Since age-structured models can be written as abstract equations in Banach spaces and seasonality imposes a natural temporal period, the PIs will study the nonlinear dynamics of semilinear periodic equations and apply the results to age-structured VBD models with seasonal change. Studying the nonlinear dynamics of periodic solutions in the semilinear periodic Cauchy problem will be transformative since the results will be useful in studying periodic delay equation models, time-periodic reaction-diffusion equations, and age-structured periodic models arising from biology and epidemiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Epidermal morphogenesis, which occurs during the second half of embryogenesis, is the developmental process that generates a skin permeability barrier essential for terrestrial survival. Defects with this barrier are associated with common skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis. Study of mechanisms that control epidermal development and differentiation is therefore highly relevant to human health. Comprehensive knowledge about adult epidermal homeostasis and regeneration, as well as adult epidermal stem cell biology, has been accumulated for decades. However, embryonic development of the epidermis, especially in the early period, still needs exploration. The overall goal of this project is to help address this knowledge gap by developing mathematical results and tools to unravel critical mechanisms underlying epidermal development that are generally applicable to multiple organisms and differentiation/developmental processes. The project will involve close multi-disciplinary interactions among students and researchers in the fields of biology, mathematics, statistics, and engineering cross colleges and universities in Nebraska with a commitment to enhancing the recruitment and support of female and underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>The project will investigate mechanical, chemical, and gene regulatory processes in a comprehensive modeling platform to understand how these processes influence epidermal development and its defects that may lead to an improved understanding of skin and other epithelial systems such as the tongue, esophagus, stomach, and the olfactory epithelium. Interactions among three major biological scales will be investigated: transcription factors within a cell, individual cells of different fates (or different intracellular states), and the epidermis consisting of many cells and diffusive regulatory molecules secreted from the cells. In order to do this, the project will first develop a 3D spatial multiscale model based on a novel anisotropic subcellular element method to account for structural aspects of the epidermis for self-organization. The project will then use a hybrid model consisting of a non-spatial cell lineage model with several cell stages and the spatial model to investigate the coupling of the biochemical and dynamical mechanisms of the organization with stochasticity that accounts for stochastic gene regulation and the interplay between gene regulation and extracellular signaling profile of the epidermis. Existing data where available will be used to inform model development, and the results will identify experiments capable of probing the mechanism responsible for robust epidermal organization. The project will also develop a new unified computational toolkit for modeling and simulating the interplay between discrete cells, biochemical signaling, gene regulation, and continuum mechanics that will have broad applications.

The genomes of any two humans are 99.9% identical, with differences in the remaining 0.1% determining the diversity of human traits. For example, DNA sequence differences account for 80% of the variability in human height. Current technology allows the identification of these sequence polymorphisms between individuals, which can then be correlated to differences in a given trait. When done on a genome wide level with a large population of individuals, such genome wide association studies (GWASes) can be a useful tool for the identification of key genes controlling specific traits. However, a requirement for this approach is the availability of powerful and accurate statistical and computational methods to search through a massive amount of sequencing data to correctly identify DNA differences associated with the phenotypic trait of interest. The outcome of the project will (1) provide statistical methods to understand relationships between DNA sequence differences and the full range of diversity observed in a population, and (2) provide corresponding computational tools suitable for use by biologists and biomedical specialists for their specific population studies. This research project will produce intermediate methodological and theoretical results that lay the foundation for the final output. This project will also apply the developed methods to real, experimental data to demonstrate their utility. In addition to these research outcomes, the project will support the training of students in the field, including women and underrepresented minorities.<br/> <br/>GWAS estimates the correlation between phenotypic traits and sequence polymorphisms to identify genetic variants highly associated with specific traits. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of genetic variant, and sequencing technologies allow for large-scale collection of SNP information. The project team will develop new GWAS models and methods to find trait-affecting variants with more power and accuracy. Specifically, the new methods developed in this research project will improve existing approaches by allowing modeling of observed traits from any probabilistic distribution in the exponential family. This extension ensures statistical models are biologically meaningful and interpretable. Second, the new methods will exploit different Bayesian priors, especially contemporary Bayesian priors for ultra-high dimensional model selection, that will share information across the entire genome for stable statistical inferences. Theoretical results of Bayesian priors in these new methods will also be developed. Third, a stochastic search algorithm will be developed to efficiently search through the massively large model space for model selection. This ensures that new methods are practical and useful since analysis can be done within a reasonably short time frame. Meanwhile, this also eliminates the use of subjective thresholds of significance that are now commonly used but an embarrassing practice in GWAS, having no theoretical support.

For example, the principal investigators will determine how the shape and structure of tulip poplar leaves enhance cooling on nearly-stagnant hot summer days while also reducing drag in tropical storm or even hurricane force winds. The models and tools developed in this project will also be applied to determine under what conditions the waving motion of seagrass augments waste removal and enhances photosynthesis. The scientific results of this project will inform the selection of plants that can survive extreme environmental conditions, including low levels of CO2, high temperatures, or strong wind and wave forces. The significance of the proposed also work extends beyond gaining insight into mechanical adaptation of plants in the natural world. The physical principals discovered could drive innovations in the engineering design of flexible structures such as sails, flags, and cables. Furthermore, the computational tools developed in this project will find immediate application in other systems where exchange occurs across flexible structures in air and water, including gas exchange in the lungs, odor capture and pheromone release in a variety of animals, nutrient uptake in the gut, and heat loss in appendages.<br/><br/>Flexible plants, fungi, and sessile animals are thought to reconfigure in strong wind and floodwaters to reduce the drag acting upon them. In fast flows, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce flutter and drag when compared to paper cutouts of similar shape and flexibility. In light breezes and currents, leaf flutter can be beneficial to heat dissipation and gas exchange. It is not clear how the shape and mechanical structure of broad leaves results in different passive movements across this range of flows. The specific goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms by which 1) single leaves flutter in low winds and flows and roll up into drag reducing shapes in strong flows, 2) leaf flutter enhances heat dissipation and photosynthesis in light winds and flows, and 3) some leaves, such as the touch-me-not, actively reconfigure by changes in turgor pressure initiated by electrical signaling. A combination of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments with real and artificial leaves will be used to quantify both passive and active movements as well as the concentrations of gases and heat. The fluid-structure interaction problem will be solved using the immersed boundary and inviscid vortex sheet methods. A new immersed boundary-style method for modeling the leaf as a source or sink of gases or heat will be developed. Hyperelastic material models will be developed and implemented in the immersed boundary framework to determine how strain-softening or strain-hardening elasticity affects leaf performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response to vessel injuries, blood will clot to prevent bleeding. The clotting response is complex and involves numerous biochemical and biophysical components working together under the influence of flow. Certain diseases or drugs may cause clots to form improperly, resulting in life-threatening bleeding or pathological clot growth with vessel occlusion. Due to the intricate biochemical and biophysical aspects of the clotting system, predicting its responses and identifying the regulatory mechanisms underlying these responses is difficult. Mathematical models of blood clotting provide powerful tools for designing new drugs, experiments, and patient-specific therapies, but there are still great challenges in formulating such models. This research focuses on developing new mathematical models of essential biochemical players and their involvement in complex biophysical processes. These models will be used to test hypotheses related to regulation of blood clotting and optimal drug design. Additionally, graduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary research and help to organize summer workshops in mathematical biology. The workshops will be offered to local community college students, with the goal being their recruitment and retention into four-year programs by offering active learning, faculty and graduate student mentoring, peer networking, and timely advising. <br/><br/>This research will build a comprehensive modeling framework coupling the biochemistry, biophysics, and biomechanics of blood clotting. It will address mechanistic questions about regulating the generation and sequestration of thrombin, the most important enzyme in the clotting process. Specifically, the research will focus on (1) development of a mathematical model that accurately describes thrombin's binding to fibrin (the polymer that stabilizes growing blood clots) and explains the extended periods of time that thrombin has been observed to stay bound to fibrin under flow, (2) development of a mathematical model that incorporates a new, platelet-dependent mechanism to inhibit thrombin generation and explains observed inhibition under flow, and (3) development of a new numerical method to model platelets as discrete objects immersed in a fluid, interacting elastically, responding to molecules in the surrounding fluid, and carrying information via molecules bound to their surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biological systems are very complex, involving a multitude of interactions among many components at different scales.  How ecological communities may be grouped to explain how they coexist and evolve has been a subject of intense interest among biologists and ecologists.  Even after a century of research, the mathematical tools and models needed to fully understand observed species invasions and extinctions do not exist. Moreover, very few ecological studies have considered mathematical models with random effects.  Real world systems are inherently noisy, and only by including random effects can one properly understand an ecological community. The work involves collaboration with ecologists based at British Antarctic Survey in the United Kingdom to create an interdisciplinary approach grounded in specific data. The outcome of the research will be disseminated through seminars, presentations at meetings, and publications in peer-reviewed journals.  The project will train undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary mathematical research. Many students at Montclair State University are members of underrepresented groups in STEM (including women and minorities), and the research program will leverage existing programs which support these students. <br/><br/>The project involves the use of theoretical, statistical, and computational approaches to improve our understanding of how models of large ecological systems respond to stochastic interactions and perturbations. Of particular interest is the study of primary and secondary extinction cascades in food webs as well as the susceptibility of food webs to invasive species. By considering a variety of empirical and synthetic food webs and incorporating full dynamics with stochasticity, the work will shed light on which ecosystem mechanisms (e.g., self-regulation, interaction strengths, feedback loops) serve to stabilize food webs against perturbations. The three major components of the work are to: (i) perform comprehensive numerical studies of the stochastic systems to improve our understanding of stochastic invasion, primary extinction, and the resulting secondary extinction cascade; (ii) develop new approaches using continuous Markov chain models to find the optimal path to extinction when considering pairwise, three-way, and higher-order interactions between species; and (iii) determine the vulnerability of an existing food web to invasion by exotic species using innovative asymptotic analysis  The results will be useful in improving our understanding of biodiversity and the organization of living communities as well as factors that can stabilize or destabilize ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, recent advances in mathematical modeling and analysis have greatly increased scientists' theoretical insight about what movement strategies would optimize the fitness of ideal animals in variable landscapes.

These efforts will provide insight into how landscape dynamics such as the spatial and temporal distributions of resources drive individual movement behavior, and how movement then produces the population level distribution patterns characteristic of different species. By focusing on the question of how animals use perceptual information to inform movement behaviors, these studies will provide insights into how population patterns such as home range residency, migration, or nomadism might evolve. The project will feature the development of new kinds of models and of the new mathematics required for their analysis, such as movement models that incorporate cognition (e.g., switching between dispersal modes based on information that might be nonlocal in origin).

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. The advent of the big data era pushed machine learning to the forefront and has spurred broad interests in machine learning in recent years. The field of life sciences has advanced through a synergistic interplay between deep understanding of biology and mathematical techniques, especially from computational mathematics, probability, and statistics. Still, biologists are overwhelmed by the amount of data being generated and the new methods required for data-management. Quantitative theories are needed to help interpret and to contextualize observations. A variety of new challenges in scientific computing for machine learning have emerged in recent years that are related to the life sciences, such as developing predictive models for disorder detection, drug repurposing, toxicity prediction, electronic health record analysis, language translation, etc. These issues and many other open problems will be discussed among the diverse group of scientists participating in the workshop.

Such decisions are governed by activity across multiple brain areas. State of the art models of the human visual system tend to treat it as a feedforward machine, but feedback connections are also very important to the efficiency of biological vision. This project will develop mathematical models of the visual system that demonstrate how visual processing, decision making, and attention are intimately linked. These models will tested on three tasks: visually tracing a curve, visual searching a tree, and detecting motion. Results will show the degree to which the human visual system does not simply filter images, but can perform complex decision making tasks. Treatment of blindness with visual prostheses requires continued research on camera-to-brain interfaces that require deep computational knowledge of the brain's visual processing abilities. This project will develop novel and important mathematical insights into the efficiency of the visual system and the underlying neural principles. Results from this work will also be leveraged to develop course material for newly developed major and professional masters in Statistics and Data Science at CU Boulder, training the next generation of data scientists. In addition, this work will augment typical machine learning approaches to modeling human vision, and potentially inspire new technologies for computer-aided vision and categorization. <br/><br/>Mathematical theories of vision must be extended to address cognitive tasks that reflect the complexity of the natural world. This project advances this effort for three main reasons. First, it focuses on understanding how the visual cortex participates in decision-making, a ubiquitous cognitive process. Most studies of the visual system consider object filtering and image classification. This project will develop spatially-extended neuronal network models that both process spatiotemporal inputs and interpret them to make complex decisions. These models will reflect the geometry of the visual world that humans observe and interpret, and the resulting theories will help to predict strategies people use to make everyday visual decisions. Second, the project is grounded in mathematical models of the visual cortex we will validate with the data sets of experimental collaborators. These models are amenable to mathematical analysis, so the architecture of neuronal networks can be linked to the cognitive computations they perform, providing testable predictions. This skill set will be crucial for analyzing models of spatiotemporal activity in visual cortex. Trainees will become conversant in techniques for the analysis of nonlinear and stochastic systems as well as probabilistic models of decision-making applicable to many problems in science and industry. The PI will share educational graphics, software, and outreach materials on a webpage to communicate findings widely.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, the mathematical model organism will execute a three-dimensional unbiased random walk following Poisson process. This project will use an improved version of the regularized Stokes formulation combined with the nonstandard Kirchhoff rod theory and the neutrally buoyant rigid cell body dynamics in order to describe the fluid-mechanical interaction of the cell model.  This model will also be used to investigate positive rheotaxis near a surface, which can affect bacterial transport in biomedical settings such as the urinary tract and catheters. The methods and tools developed in this project will find many applications in biological fluids, where thin elastic structures together with rigid bodies interact with fluids, including sperm motility and bacterial pathogens such as H. pylori in the stomach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algae are microscopic organisms that drift in the water columns of lakes and oceans. They form the foundation of the aquatic food web and produce approximately 50% to 85% of the world's oxygen via photosynthesis. Their population persistence is critical to ecosystem health. However, harmful algal blooms are a serious problem in some bodies of water, including Lake Erie. Blooms can be caused by the reversal of the competition between toxin-producing algae and the non-toxic diatoms. In well-mixed environments, cyanobacteria are competitively excluded by diatoms, but in poorly mixed or stratified water the toxic cyanobacteria float upwards to form surface scum and exclude diatoms. Hydrologic measures, such as altering the turbulent mixing in lakes, can solve the problem under appropriate conditions. This project will use mathematical models to understand the competition among phytoplankton and help design more effective hydrologic control strategies. Innovative mathematical analysis will be performed to quantify the effect of various environmental processes in shaping the population dynamics of phytoplankton. This project will provide research topics for PhD students and undergraduate summer projects. The undergraduate mentorship will be leveraged with the Summer Undergraduate Capstone Conference of the Mathematical Biosciences Institute at Ohio State University. <br/><br/>This project aims to understand the effect of environmental drivers, including spatial heterogeneity, non-uniform mixing, and light and nutrient availability, in shaping the community structure of a diverse phytoplankton population. We will develop phytoplankton population models of a single species, multiple species, and a continuous spectrum of species to address four key biological questions: (1) In eutrophic conditions nutrients are abundant, but light is limited. How does water column stratification affect the persistence of a single species? (2) Human activities have accelerated the eutrophication of many freshwater lakes and coastal ecosystems, causing harmful algal blooms to emerge. Can artificial mixing create a competitive reversal, allowing non-toxic diatoms to competitively exclude the toxic algae? (3) Phytoplankton communities are diverse and can be structured along various functional trade-offs. How do trade-offs in light acquisition affect  coexistence among phytoplankton species? (4) How do nutrient dynamics influence phytoplankton competition in spatially heterogeneous environments? For two-species competing in stratified water columns, long-term dynamics will be classified by monotone dynamical systems results. A significant methodological advance of this project is the game-theoretical approach of using mutation-selection models. This approach captures the surprising diversity of the phytoplankton by grouping various phytoplankton species according to their functional traits.  Finally, the effect of nutrient dynamics will be addressed in a thin-layer limit, with emphasis on the evolutionary stability of deep chlorophyll maxima. This project will further understanding of population persistence, vertical distribution, and community diversity of phytoplankton through mathematical modeling and analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global climate change models predict increasing temporal variability in temperature, precipitation and storms in the next century. Random environmental fluctuations have been shown to drive populations extinct, promote persistence, change genetic diversity, and modify the spread of infectious diseases. It is therefore urgent to develop tools for understanding the effects of random temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions on species. The PIs will develop mathematical theory, in conjunction with analytical and numerical approximation methods, to help theoretical ecologists pinpoint how environmental fluctuations affect the long-term dynamics of ecological communities. In collaboration with the Gore lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology the PIs will test theoretical results by comparison with microbial ecology experiments. The investigators plan to involve high school and undergraduate students in projects allowing them to develop programming skills and diversify their mathematical and ecological knowledge. For outreach, the investigatprs will organize seminars and conferences and promote the participation of women and members of traditionally underrepresented minorities within the sciences.<br/><br/><br/>The PIs will investigate continuous and discrete time models of interacting populations that experience random temporal environmental variations. In the continuous time setting the research will focus on Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes - processes that switch between different systems of ordinary differential equations at random times. In the discrete time setting stochastic difference equations will be analyzed. New methods for checking when species persist and converge to their invariant probability measures (which describe the 'random equilibria' of subcommunities of species) will be developed, and conditions under which species go extinct exponentially fast determined.  Since all theoretical models are merely approximations of natural systems, the PIs will study how the persistence/extinction results change under small, density-dependent, perturbations of the model parameters. The extinction/persistence criteria will involve Lyapunov exponents, which usually cannot be computed explicitly. In order to resolve this issue analytical and numerical approximation methods for estimating the Lyapunov exponents will be developed.

Astrocytes have multiple arms, called processes, and are linked with important brain functions but their involvement is not well-understood. Often astrocytes wrap processes around synapses, the contacts between neurons. The number of wrapped synapses and wrapping tightness changes in diseases such as epilepsy. The role of such differences is not yet understood and will be investigated in this project. The problem is challenging and multi-scale: astrocyte wrapping acts at the scale of individual, but it affects neuronal networks involving thousands of neurons. The effects of wrapping will first be studied at the individual synapse level by developing mathematical theory and detailed biological models. Next, the essential features of connections altered by wrapping will be extracted and included in neuronal network models. The effective network-level representation of astrocyte ensheathment will be as simple as possible to aid implementation in a variety of networks and minimize computing costs, but will preserve the essential biological features derived from detailed models. The resulting hybrid networks will reveal the effects of ensheathment conditions corresponding to different brain areas and disease states. The project will involve graduate and undergraduate trainees and will be disseminated through research presentations, training courses, K-12 and public presentations.<br/><br/>Synaptic ensheathment is ubiquitous in the brain but not ordinarily included in models as a property of network structure. Thus, this study explores a novel aspect of a more general problem of network structure-function relationship, central in modern neuroscience. Expected findings will contribute to understanding the complex interactions between the two major brain cell types. To this end, computational and mathematical analysis will be used to study the role of synaptic ensheathment at different spatial and temporal scales. First, the influence of degree of synaptic ensheathment on synaptic function will be investigated at the spatiotemporal scale of molecules and receptors to determine how ensheathment affects the (random) number of molecules reaching the post-synaptic and astrocytic receptors as a function of time, the resulting astrocyte calcium response, and excitability of the postsynaptic cell. This will involve extending mathematical theories of diffusion with switching boundaries to spatially-extended initial conditions and developing a method to quantify roles of individual parameters in controlling the system behavior. These detailed, biologically-realistic studies will inform how synaptic and post-synaptic properties are determined by the level of ensheathment. Next, in an excitatory-inhibitory network, each synapse will be endowed with its own ensheathment parameters and the resulting firing rate and synchronization properties will be determined based on the distribution of ensheathment properties. This will be done both in simulations and by extending network activity coherence measures to include synaptic ensheathment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These benefits occur through interactions of each individual with the flows produced by others and may take the form of energy savings or speed enhancement. Also to be explored are more subtle aspects of flow interactions such as maintaining or holding together a group, preventing collisions, establishing natural formations or patterns of individuals, and communication through motions that spread across the group. The research work will combine mathematical descriptions of the motions of individuals and the surrounding fluid (water or air), laboratory experiments on ""robotic flocks"" of motorized swimmers or flyers, and the analysis of video footage of birds flying in formations. The different approaches will allow for a complete understanding of the fluid-dynamical interactions in a group as well as insights into how animals exploit or modify such mechanisms. The work thus stands to clarify the role of flows in animal groups and in so doing also suggest how such effects can be exploited in applications such as flow energy harvesting and efficient propulsion. Additionally, education and outreach programs will train high school students, university undergraduate and graduate students in STEM research and especially the important role of mathematics in the natural and engineering sciences.<br/><br/>Specifically, physical experiments on mechanical swimmers, flow-locomotor interaction models and simulations, and crowd-sourced biological data will be combined interactively and applied towards understanding formation swimming and flying. Research will start with the detailed interrogation of few-body systems in order to cross-validate all approaches and to understand fundamental mechanisms. Experiments and simulations will inform models based on vortex-body interactions, and comparison against biological measurements will inform behavioral models in the context of formation flight of birds. Many-body systems of in-line arrays will then be studied, with all methods used to understand principles, for example through analogies to conventional states of matter, in which aspects such as group cohesion, crystallization or other patterning, dynamical instabilities, and information transfer will be explored. Biologically-relevant issues including self-organization and collective advantages will also be studied, and structural and dynamical metrics will be established and tested.

Specifically, this project will study the pressure of the fluids filling the eye globe, also called intraocular pressure, whose control is crucial to maintain a proper visual function. Chronically high intraocular pressure is associated with high risk of developing glaucoma, a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by a loss of retinal ganglion cells and permanent vision loss. Glaucoma constitutes one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Despite the importance of maintaining healthy levels of intraocular pressure, to date, the question of what is its optimal range for a given individual remains unanswered. The variability in outcomes, side effects and hemodynamic impacts following medications that lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients poses an additional, and currently unresolved, challenge in preventing vision loss for millions of individuals. The PIs will address this critical need by utilizing the laws of physics to develop a virtual laboratory where the relationship between intraocular pressure, medications, hemodynamics and ocular function can be studied quantitatively, and the optimal target level for intraocular pressure and the therapeutic strategy to achieve it can be theoretically estimated by accounting for patient's specific conditions. <br/> <br/>The development of a virtual laboratory to study ocular physiology and function requires to account for multiple length scales simultaneously. Since the action of medications occurs at the cellular level (approx. length scale: 100 microns), even down to the ion exchangers across the membrane of the non-pigmented epithelial cells within the ciliary processes (approx. length scale: 10 nm), while the clinical assessments of ocular hemodynamics and function occur at the whole organ level (approx. length scale: 3cm), it is necessary to adopt a multiscale modeling approach. The main challenges of this project are: (i) capturing the essential biophysical features of ocular physiology across length scales that differ by 6 orders of magnitude, while maintaining the solution of the overall model affordable; (ii) preserving the essential biophysical features of ocular physiology when discretizing the multiscale problem in order to obtain its approximate numerical solution; (iii) validating the model predictions with a large and comprehensive clinical and experimental dataset. To best address these challenges and successfully complete this project, the model development is articulated into two specific aims: (Aim 1) Multiscale modeling of the relationship between aqueous humor flow and medications for intraocular pressure to theoretically investigate the hypotensive efficacy on patients presenting different clinical conditions; (Aim2) Multiscale modeling of the relationship between aqueous humor flow and ocular perfusion to theoretically investigate the changes on ocular hemodynamics and function in patients presenting different clinical conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical models are used broadly across biology to understand mechanisms, make predictions, and guide intervention strategies. To do so, the model parameters often must be calibrated using data; the estimated parameters can have significant implications for reliability of insights generated from the model and data. This raises the important question of whether the calibration process is well posed, i.e. is it possible to uniquely estimate model parameters from a given type or set of data? Identifiability analysis is the study of these issues, and this project will improve and expand the currently available set of algebraic identifiability methods to set them on a firmer theoretical basis and address new types of models used broadly in many biological settings. Beyond academia, the algorithms to be developed will allow researchers to successfully link models and experiments to generate model-based insights that improve real-world treatment strategies. Training will be provided to two Ph.D. students working on research for this project. The training component will also include interdisciplinary course development as well as a conference with tutorial lectures and problem sessions to educate industrial and academic participants in the theory, algorithms, and software developed in this project.  This project is supported jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Mathematical Biology and Division of Computing and Communication Foundations Algorithmic Foundations programs.<br/><br/>More specifically, the investigators will develop, analyze, and implement symbolic and symbolic-numeric algorithms that perform identifiability analysis of dynamic models (including ordinary differential (ODE), delay, and difference equation models) that appear in biology and other sciences. Using these algorithms, they will also carry out identifiability analysis for a range of models drawn from cellular signaling and physiology applications. The proposed algorithms will be based on differential-difference algebra, which connects to identifiability in the common case of rational ODEs/delay/difference equations by applying differential-difference elimination algorithms to the model equations. Such symbolic methods for ODE models have proven to be productive in the area of parameter identifiability. The proposed methods would allow a large class of models to be analyzed for structural identifiability, allowing one to assess which parameters can be estimated and tailor experiment design to answer the questions of interest for treatment strategies and mechanistic insights. For the first time, rigorously justified and analyzed efficient algorithms will be available for identifiability problems in delay and difference equation models.

Circadian (~24 hour) rhythms in behavior and physiology, including sleep-wake rhythms, are entrained by the sun's daily light cycle and affect physical and mental health. These rhythms are driven by the brain's master circadian clock, which receives light information from the eyes and coordinates biological rhythms throughout the body. In modern life, exposure to artificial light can erode the crucial tie between internal physiological rhythms and environmental light timing. The proposed mathematical modeling and data analysis projects focus on understanding how information and uncertainty in light signals are processed and stored in the master circadian clock and propagated downstream to sleep-wake networks through neural signaling.  In collaboration with a clinical researcher, the mathematical models will be applied to data describing light exposure and sleep in elementary school-aged children during the school year and summer to understand summer vacation-induced disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms. An additional collaborator at a primarily undergraduate and Hispanic-serving institution will contribute to modeling the clock and developing a mathematical modeling mini-course for undergraduate students.

While it is increasingly feasible to study biological systems as a whole by collecting information across many scales (e.g., cellular and molecular levels), a major challenge in such studies is to properly integrate information from individual components in order to obtain a complete picture of the system. What makes this task even more daunting is the fact that biological systems are typically heterogeneous and dynamic, meaning that the system properties tend to change across individuals, time, and space. For investigating such complex biological systems, this project brings together an interdisciplinary team of data and biological scientists in order to develop and validate a new mathematical framework that combines statistical and mechanistic models together to enable scientists to discover emergent biological phenomena and to understand the rules that govern them. This framework will then specifically be used to investigate hematopoiesis, which is a remarkable biological process responsible for creation and maintenance of blood cells, and involves complex interactions among biochemical and physical events across temporal and spatial scales that are still not well-understood.  Additionally, this project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with a true interdisciplinary experience with equal mentorship from data and biological scientists.  <br/><br/>The overarching objective of this project is to develop a new data-driven framework for investigating complex biological systems that are characterized by heterogeneity, dynamics, and interactions across multiple time and space scales. The investigators will achieve this goal by embedding mechanistic models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Hierarchical Bayesian models provide a natural framework for integrating information (as well as prior knowledge) available at different scales. Mechanistic models, on the other hand, provide a flexible framework for modeling heterogeneous and dynamic systems in ways that enable prediction and control. This mathematical framework will be used to develop optimal experimental design strategies in order to elucidate hematopoiesis dynamics, perform new in vivo experiments to produce serially sampled barcoded single-cell gene expression profiles, and analyze the resulting data. Hematopoiesis is an ideal biological process for this modeling framework because 1) cell populations (stem, progenitor, and mature cells) are well-defined, 2) experimental model systems allow for easy manipulation, and 3) it is possible to apply stressors to minimally perturb the system and observe the process of returning to homeostasis/equilibrium. Successful implementation of this project will allow scientists to gain insights into physiologic hematopoiesis.

The investigators will carry out mathematical, statistical and computational analyses of these models to better understand factors affecting the geographical spread of Zika. Several vector-borne diseases (VBDs), such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika, have been imported into Florida, caused local outbreaks (dengue in 2009-2010 and 2013, chikungunya in 2014, Zika in 2016), and posed major public health problems. Dengue, chikungunya and Zika share the same primary mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, both abundant in Florida and capable of transmitting several other diseases. The transmission cycle of these VBDs is heavily influenced by seasonal changes, climate conditions, and human movement. Based on data from 2016 Zika outbreaks in Miami Beach, Wynwood, and Little River in Florida, they will build and calibrate models including the age structure of both hosts and vectors as well as the effects of seasonality to study the spatial and temporal dynamics and spread of Zika in Florida. The objectives are to be better prepared to anticipate and respond to similar reemerging arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. The project involves graduate students and postdoctoral trainees and results will be disseminated through seminars, conference presentations and journal publications.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are: (i) Since dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses have significant agreement in their spatiotemporal distributions, the PIs will develop a multi-scale (multi-region) multi-patch model to study the geographical spread of VBD. A large scale is used to describe the long distance human movement from regions to regions and a small scale is used to model the short distance movement of both mosquitoes and humans from patches to patches within a region. The model will be applied to simulate the geographical and local spread of Zika among Miami Beach, Wynwood, and Little River in 2016 and will be studied employing multiple scale analysis and slow-fast dynamical system theory. (ii) Since age distributions of both vectors and hosts are very important in the spread of VBD, the PIs will construct age-structured models to study the effect of age distributions of both mosquitoes and humans on the transmission of VBD and use the model to design optimal vector control policies and to access disease risk for different age groups. (iii) Since age-structured models can be written as abstract equations in Banach spaces and seasonality imposes a natural temporal period, the PIs will study the nonlinear dynamics of semilinear periodic equations and apply the results to age-structured VBD models with seasonal change. Studying the nonlinear dynamics of periodic solutions in the semilinear periodic Cauchy problem will be transformative since the results will be useful in studying periodic delay equation models, time-periodic reaction-diffusion equations, and age-structured periodic models arising from biology and epidemiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the currently prevailing models explaining intratumoral heterogeneity is the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis. Oncogene HER2 is a well-studied oncogene known for its role in promoting cancer cell survival and proliferation, and recently implicated in generation and maintenance of CSCs. Thus understanding the HER2 signaling is critical for development of novel strategies for cancer treatment, while tumor growth is a very complicated phenomenon involving many inter-related processes across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, which makes the mathematical modeling and computation very challenging. This research seeks to employ modeling techniques and computational studies to address complex issues arising from tumor growth at the interface of mathematics, chemical engineering and biology. Successful completion of this project will also have a significant impact on public health, as the research findings can be used to develop diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics to more specifically target cancer stem cells. The proposed research of mathematical modeling and experimental studies for cancer cells creates a unique multidisciplinary research environment that attracts both undergraduate and graduate students (especially women and minority students) from all disciplines to join our research team.<br/><br/>With a close integration with experiments, the PI will perform multi-scale modeling and computational investigation of HER2 signaling in modulating CSC population in cancer tumor growth with spatial-temporal dynamics. To better explore HER2 signaling for better understanding the heterogeneity in breast cancer, PI shall develop a multi-scale model coupled cell signaling with cell population to study the dynamics control of CSCs. This control mechanism capitalizes on emerging evidences in literature, and correlates with recent findings from new observed experimental data. It is widely believed that a key mechanism for proper maintenance of a cell lineage to occur is the formation and substance of the stem cell niche, a microenvironment where stem cells reside in a tissue. To explore the CSCs' spatial patterns for tumor growth, PI will also develop a continuum PDE model coupled HER2 signaling with multistage cell lineage models and spatial effects of nutrients. Specific tasks are: (1) to investigate the roles of HER2 signaling in controlling and maintenance of CSCs, and develop and evaluate multi-scale models to explore underlying mechanisms and biological factors to control the balance of tumor growth; (2) to further develop continuous mathematical models to better understand the spatial structures of CSC populations during tumor growth with different effects of various biological factors; (3) to design fast and efficient numerical methods for solving the mathematical models with moving and complex domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the principal investigators will determine how the shape and structure of tulip poplar leaves enhance cooling on nearly-stagnant hot summer days while also reducing drag in tropical storm or even hurricane force winds. The models and tools developed in this project will also be applied to determine under what conditions the waving motion of seagrass augments waste removal and enhances photosynthesis. The scientific results of this project will inform the selection of plants that can survive extreme environmental conditions, including low levels of CO2, high temperatures, or strong wind and wave forces. The significance of the proposed also work extends beyond gaining insight into mechanical adaptation of plants in the natural world. The physical principals discovered could drive innovations in the engineering design of flexible structures such as sails, flags, and cables. Furthermore, the computational tools developed in this project will find immediate application in other systems where exchange occurs across flexible structures in air and water, including gas exchange in the lungs, odor capture and pheromone release in a variety of animals, nutrient uptake in the gut, and heat loss in appendages.<br/><br/>Flexible plants, fungi, and sessile animals are thought to reconfigure in strong wind and floodwaters to reduce the drag acting upon them. In fast flows, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce flutter and drag when compared to paper cutouts of similar shape and flexibility. In light breezes and currents, leaf flutter can be beneficial to heat dissipation and gas exchange. It is not clear how the shape and mechanical structure of broad leaves results in different passive movements across this range of flows. The specific goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms by which 1) single leaves flutter in low winds and flows and roll up into drag reducing shapes in strong flows, 2) leaf flutter enhances heat dissipation and photosynthesis in light winds and flows, and 3) some leaves, such as the touch-me-not, actively reconfigure by changes in turgor pressure initiated by electrical signaling. A combination of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments with real and artificial leaves will be used to quantify both passive and active movements as well as the concentrations of gases and heat. The fluid-structure interaction problem will be solved using the immersed boundary and inviscid vortex sheet methods. A new immersed boundary-style method for modeling the leaf as a source or sink of gases or heat will be developed. Hyperelastic material models will be developed and implemented in the immersed boundary framework to determine how strain-softening or strain-hardening elasticity affects leaf performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The survival and evolution of cell populations under stress often depends on a small fraction of outlier cells. For example, drug exposure leads to cell death for most cancer cells in a tumor, but a small fraction survive and lead to development of drug resistance. Recent research shows that such cellular differences are driven by rare events during gene expression, and there is a need to develop quantitative models of rare events in stochastic descriptions of gene expression. This project, supported jointly by the Divisions of Mathematical Sciences and Molecular and Cellular Biology, will develop and apply approaches from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and large deviation theory to create a framework for rare events in gene expression and its regulation in diverse cell processes. The theory will address current research questions: (1) How do cell regulatory mechanisms control probability of rare events in gene expression? (2) How can one characterize gene expression conditional on rare event occurrences? (3) Can control mechanisms be determined to realize desirable rare events? The answers will have applications ranging from synthetic biology to understanding latency in HIV-1 infections. Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored in interdisciplinary research on biological systems, and research activities will be effectively integrated with teaching at graduate and undergraduate levels. The integrated research, teaching and outreach activities will prepare future scientists to apply stochastic mathematics to molecular biology.<br/><br/>Rare events which lead to phenotypic transitions are a recurring theme in current biological research. In several cases phenotypic switching is driven by the intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression. Correspondingly, there is a need to develop a theoretical framework for analyzing rare events in stochastic models of gene expression. Recent developments in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, using large deviation theory, have led to a framework for analyzing Markovian processes conditioned on rare events and for representing such processes by conditioning-free driven processes. The goal of this project is to apply and further develop this theoretical framework to quantitatively characterize large deviations in stochastic models of gene expression and its regulation. The specific aims will focus on developing analytical and computational approaches for characterizing large deviations in general models of gene expression with a) promoter-based regulation, b) post-transcriptional regulation and c) feedback regulation. This research will lead to quantitative insights into how cellular regulatory mechanisms impact rare event probabilities which can be used to design optimal control mechanisms for realization of desired rare events. A particular focus will be modeling latency in HIV-1 viral infections.

Movement is a complex process that involves the spatial and temporal control and integration of a number of sub-processes, including the transduction of chemical or mechanical signals from the environment, intra-cellular biochemical responses, and translation of the intra- and extracellular signals into a mechanical response. While many single-celled organisms use flagella or cilia to swim, there are two basic modes of movement used by eukaryotic cells that lack such structures -- mesenchymal and amoeboid. The former, which can be characterized as `crawling' or `gliding', involves the extension of finger-like protrusions and/or broad, flat protrusions, whose protrusion is driven by actin polymerization at the leading edge. The amoeboid mode is less reliant on strong adhesion, and cells are more rounded and employ shape changes to move -- in effect 'jostling through the crowd' or `swimming'. Cells of the immune system use this mode for movement through tissues when adhesion molecules have been knocked out. However, recent experiments have shown that numerous cell types display enormous plasticity in locomotion, in that they sense the mechanical properties of their environment and adjust their mode of movement accordingly. Thus pure crawling and pure swimming are the extremes on a continuum of locomotion strategies, but many cells can sense their environment to determine the most efficient strategy in a given environment.<br/><br/>The long-term objective in this research is to understand how cells sense the mechanical properties of their environment and transduce the information into intracellular biochemical and mechanical changes that determine their pattern of movement. Recent experimental work has discovered that numerous cell types use strong intracellular material flows near the cell wall, which, when disrupted, disrupts<br/>cell movement. However, there is as yet little understanding of how this flow translates into cell movement, and our first objective is to continue development and analysis of a mathematical model that facilitates in silico experiments to understand how the processes involved interact to produce motion. Another objective is to understand the cytoskeletal changes needed to produce motion using blebs, which are 'blister-like' protrusions of the membrane, and how the choice between blebs and other modes is arbitrated in complex environments. In particular, the role of membrane tension and the nature of cell confinement in determining how and where on the membrane blebs are initiated, and whether blebs or protrusions are used, are not understood. A third objective concerns movement of cells under various forms of confinement. It is known that imposed mechanical stress can induce movement in otherwise quiescent cells, but how mechanical stimuli induce motion is not understood. A detailed model such as the PI shall develop will provide experimentally-testable predictions that can be used to guide new experiments that advance our understanding of cell movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important feature of the dynamics of diseases transmitted on contact is that the contact patterns change in response to infection and progression of symptoms: infected individuals curtail contacts with their regular community due to illness (e.g. being too sick to go to school or work) but increase their contacts with other segments of the population, such as healthcare workers or caretakers in the home. The recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa provides a stark example, but there have been many others, for instance in the waves of HIV-AIDS epidemics in various parts of the world as well as new, smaller outbreaks of Ebola in remote parts of the Congo.  Although the question of how evolving contact network structure and infection status affect disease outbreaks seems basic, theoretical treatments have been very limited. The main objective of this project is to help address this knowledge gap by developing mathematical results and tools for simple approximation of these complicated dynamics.  The research will be of interest to many individuals and organizations inside and outside of academia including the Centers for Disease Control, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Public Health. Training will be provided for a PhD student from the Kinshasa School of Public Health via annual monthly visits to Ohio State University and ongoing international collaboration; a US graduate student will also be trained in interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/><br/>This project will develop a general Approximate Markovian Computation (AMC) framework for approximating complex stochastic SIR-type disease models on evolving, large, multi-layer networks in which each layer corresponds to an interaction type (also referred to as multiplex or multi-relational network). The idea of AMC is that for a large random configuration network one may often construct Markov jump process closely tracking the outbreak dynamics on the original network despite averaging out some network features (e.g. number of contacts or drop/activation rates). If both processes share the same mean field limiting equations, they also share the same set of limiting parameters; hence the Markov process may also be used for consistent parameter estimation. On the one hand, AMC bears some conceptual resemblance to the popular ABC method in Bayesian inference, although, unlike ABC, it explicitly approximates the likelihood of the SIR process of interest. On the other hand, AMC may also be viewed as a generalization of quasi-equilibrium approximations for stochastic complex systems. In addition to developing relevant theoretical results, the investigators plan to develop software to apply AMC to real field data from contact epidemics in Africa and elsewhere. It is hoped that methods developed in this project will improve predictive modeling for infectious diseases and provide essential insight into key contact epidemic features such as invasion probability, persistence, and outbreak size.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the beneficial effects of stenting, persistent high rates of complications such as in-stent restenosis and late stent thrombosis call for novel approaches to stent design. Recent ideas based on nano-engineered stents seem to be particularly promising. They include: (1) nano-engineered stents, which are stents covered with nano-engineered surface that promotes accelerated restoration of functional endothelium and provides a drug-free approach to keeping stents patent long-term; and (2) ferromagnetic stents with magnet-enhanced nano-particle drug delivery of anti-thrombogenic drugs for improved arterial wall healing. This project will addresses the development of new mathematical methods to guide and aid the bioengineering design of next generation stents. The methods are based on partial differential equations, particle-base kinetic methods, and artificial intelligence-based optimization methods. The mathematical and computational results will be experimentally tested in the Therapeutic Microtechnology and Nanotechnology Lab at UCSF. Two students and a postdoc will be involved in the project, and topics from this research will be presented in a new, interdisciplinary class at UC Berkeley, cross-listed in three different departments (Mathematics, Bioengineering, and Mechanical Engineering).

The mathematical methods include a fluid-structure interaction model involving multi-layered poroelastic media to model arterial walls, a dimension reduction-based 1D hyperbolic net model describing stents' geometric and mechanical properties, and a ferromagnetic nano-particle fluid-structure interaction model. The computational methods will be based on a combination of Finite Element Method approximations of the macro-scale continuum models, and on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics approximations of  the micro/nano-scale particle models. Uncertainty Quantification and Artificial Intelligence (Deep Neural Networks) will be used to study solution dependence on the parameters in the problem, and to study optimal stent design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Growth regulation remains an unsolved mystery and a grand challenge for both developmental biology and regenerative medicine. Uncontrolled tissue growth can result in abnormal development and fatal diseases including cancer. Mathematical models offer an important new tool both to simulate biological systems and to test hypotheses in growth control mechanisms, currently difficult or impossible for experiments alone. This project will investigate mechanisms in growth regulation, including those that are difficult to test by using existing models, by developing a novel mathematical model incorporating biochemical signals and cell mechanical properties, as well as the interaction between them. By applying this model to a classical biological system, it will provide novel insights into the fundamental principles of growth control. UC Riverside is a Hispanic-serving institution with diverse student background. This research will engage undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary projects and incorporate emerging results into coursework. Outreach activities, including seminars, workshops, and summer research programs, will be coordinated with department of mathematics, Interdisciplinary Center for Quantitative Modeling in Biology at UC Riverside, and community colleges in the area of southern California. <br/> <br/>Cells response to both chemical and mechanical signals to coordinate the growth and proliferation during the tissue development, such that the overall shape and tissue size can be obtained precisely with robustness. The Drosophila wing disc, an epithelial primordial organ that later forms the adult fruit fly wing, features a relatively simple geometry, limited number of cells, rapid growth, and a well understood molecular signaling network based on molecules conserved in other developmental systems. Studying this classical biological system can reveal underlying general mechanisms of growth regulation, applicable in other developmental systems. The main goal of this interdisciplinary research is to develop a coupled mechanochemical model at sub-cellular level in a mechanistic way for the wing disc tissue. Different morphogens acting in orthogonal directions as well as an intracellular gene regulatory network will be considered. Sub-cellular mechanical properties will be taken into account by using an advanced subcellular element model involving different cell types. The interaction between cell stiffness, cell-cell adhesion and biochemical signals will be included in this multiscale framework. This model will be applied to test the hypothesis that the rate of cell growth is determined by the temporal change in biochemical signals and the hypothesis that uniform growth is achieved by molecular cues and mechanical feedback, suggested by experimental data. This coupled model will allow exploration of the new mechanisms for spatially homogeneous growth and the asymmetric shape of the wing disc pouch, as well as investigation of the effects of stochasticity in biochemical or/and biomechanical signals on growth control mechanisms.

Drugs that target microbes (antimicrobials) have saved millions of lives. But, because microbes evolve, over time antimicrobials reduce the population of pathogens that succumb to drugs and leave behind those that do not - a process called selection. Consequently, unbridled use of antimicrobials threatens their long-term efficacy - a concern since the discovery of penicillin in 1928. Today, drug resistance is recognized as a serious problem requiring urgent attention. Differential equations can describe mechanisms that drive changes in living systems; control theory can generate the best strategies to use these mechanisms to achieve a desired goal. These tools will help guide drug development and dosing protocols that balance the immediate benefits of administering antimicrobials with the long-term selection pressure imposed by these drugs. A mathematical framework that is adaptable to different disease systems could inform strategies to reduce the threat of resistant pathogens to global health and the attendant cost to society. Furthermore, this project will provide graduate students at Howard, Texas Tech, Lehigh, and the University of Kentucky, with the opportunity to intern at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, fostering connections outside of academia.  University of Kentucky students will also assist the lead investigator in mentoring high school students through a pilot Saturday Morning Math program that will provide hands-on experience with coding, modeling, and visualization of scientific results.<br/><br/>The investigators aim to construct a general mathematical framework, with vector-borne disease serving as a benchmark example, and build the tools needed to bridge the gap between within-host PK/PD (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) and population-level epidemiology, so that others may readily adapt the framework to their own studies of competing pathogens. The investigators will approach the problem of linking the fast dynamics of PK/PD to the comparatively slow population-level dynamics by introducing serial compartments in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations representing the progression of individuals through stages of treatment characterized by different drug concentrations and different durations. A stochastic sub-model is proposed to parameterize one of the functions that links within-host PK/PD to the population-level dynamics.  The proposed research is important because, to date, no general methods exist to analyze a staged-progression model where the stages have different durations. Such a model could provide results and insights that significantly improve the protocols for drug interventions in a way that mitigates the selection pressure leading to drug resistance. For example, it is unknown how the likely existence of backward bifurcation and the staged-progression approach with heterogeneous stages will interact and influence optimal treatment policy. Furthermore, the proposed parameter estimation, uncertainty, and identifiability analyses will likely lead to challenging mathematical and statistical problems requiring advances of existing methodologies.  <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Mathematical Biology Program and Division of Human Resource Development HBCU-UP.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will integrate mathematical modeling and experimental analysis of an insect commonly found in stored grains to describe the effects of habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal (e.g. an organism?s decision to leave a fragment depends upon competitor presence) and interspecific competition on population dynamics from the patch level to the landscape level. Results from this project will answer key ecological questions including: What effects do competitors have on the emigration behavior of species at patch boundaries? How do relationships between density and emigration affect regional population dynamics and competitor coexistence? How does conditional dispersal affect competition-dispersal tradeoffs that are thought to be a key to competitor coexistence? The project will advance the analysis of mathematical models created to answer these questions and better understand model dynamics. Finally, results from this study will apply to conservation programs and habitat reserve design. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained through PI-hosted workshops and mentorship of independent research projects. Project results will be disseminated to both ecological and mathematical communities through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference talks, and a user-friendly website. Additionally, an app that estimates key dispersal parameters from field data will be created and made publicly available. This project is funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences Mathematical Biology program and the Division of Environmental Biology Population and Community Ecology program.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will integrate reaction-diffusion models, mathematical analysis, and experimental analysis to explore the effects of habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal and interspecific competition on the population dynamics and species coexistence from the patch to the landscape level. The PIs will use diffusive Lotka-Volterra competition systems with nonlinear boundary conditions modeling density dependent emigration (DDE) both at the patch and landscape levels and stage structure. Ongoing research suggests that life-history traits, such as whether a species is solitary or gregarious, can provide cues as to the form of DDE for particular species. Knowledge of species' life histories, coupled with our predictions regarding how different forms of DDE can affect species coexistence and connectivity among habitat patches, can help determine whether existing reserves are adequate for species coexistence.  Dispersal experiments will be performed using two Tribolium flour beetle species to parameterize the models and compare model predictions about coexistence and stability with results from long-term experiments. Innovative contributions will be made by providing (1) experimental evidence that interspecific competitors affect within-patch redistribution, boundary behavior and the strength and form of the DDE relationship; (2) the first theoretical framework and empirical evidence for the effects of conditional dispersal on the population dynamics and coexistence of competing species in fragmented landscapes; and (3) novel analysis of elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The genomes of any two humans are 99.9% identical, with differences in the remaining 0.1% determining the diversity of human traits. For example, DNA sequence differences account for 80% of the variability in human height. Current technology allows the identification of these sequence polymorphisms between individuals, which can then be correlated to differences in a given trait. When done on a genome wide level with a large population of individuals, such genome wide association studies (GWASes) can be a useful tool for the identification of key genes controlling specific traits. However, a requirement for this approach is the availability of powerful and accurate statistical and computational methods to search through a massive amount of sequencing data to correctly identify DNA differences associated with the phenotypic trait of interest. The outcome of the project will (1) provide statistical methods to understand relationships between DNA sequence differences and the full range of diversity observed in a population, and (2) provide corresponding computational tools suitable for use by biologists and biomedical specialists for their specific population studies. This research project will produce intermediate methodological and theoretical results that lay the foundation for the final output. This project will also apply the developed methods to real, experimental data to demonstrate their utility. In addition to these research outcomes, the project will support the training of students in the field, including women and underrepresented minorities.<br/> <br/>GWAS estimates the correlation between phenotypic traits and sequence polymorphisms to identify genetic variants highly associated with specific traits. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of genetic variant, and sequencing technologies allow for large-scale collection of SNP information. The project team will develop new GWAS models and methods to find trait-affecting variants with more power and accuracy. Specifically, the new methods developed in this research project will improve existing approaches by allowing modeling of observed traits from any probabilistic distribution in the exponential family. This extension ensures statistical models are biologically meaningful and interpretable. Second, the new methods will exploit different Bayesian priors, especially contemporary Bayesian priors for ultra-high dimensional model selection, that will share information across the entire genome for stable statistical inferences. Theoretical results of Bayesian priors in these new methods will also be developed. Third, a stochastic search algorithm will be developed to efficiently search through the massively large model space for model selection. This ensures that new methods are practical and useful since analysis can be done within a reasonably short time frame. Meanwhile, this also eliminates the use of subjective thresholds of significance that are now commonly used but an embarrassing practice in GWAS, having no theoretical support. Methods will be implemented into software tools and will be freely available for statisticians, biologists, and biomedical researchers.

Global climate change models predict increasing temporal variability in temperature, precipitation and storms in the next century. Random environmental fluctuations have been shown to drive populations extinct, promote persistence, change genetic diversity, and modify the spread of infectious diseases. It is therefore urgent to develop tools for understanding the effects of random temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions on species. The PIs will develop mathematical theory, in conjunction with analytical and numerical approximation methods, to help theoretical ecologists pinpoint how environmental fluctuations affect the long-term dynamics of ecological communities. In collaboration with the Gore lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology the PIs will test theoretical results by comparison with microbial ecology experiments. The investigators plan to involve high school and undergraduate students in projects allowing them to develop programming skills and diversify their mathematical and ecological knowledge. For outreach, the investigators will organize seminars and conferences and promote the participation of women and members of traditionally underrepresented minorities within the sciences.<br/><br/><br/>The PIs will investigate continuous and discrete time models of interacting populations that experience random temporal environmental variations. In the continuous time setting the research will focus on Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes - processes that switch between different systems of ordinary differential equations at random times. In the discrete time setting stochastic difference equations will be analyzed. New methods for checking when species persist and converge to their invariant probability measures (which describe the 'random equilibria' of subcommunities of species) will be developed, and conditions under which species go extinct exponentially fast determined.  Since all theoretical models are merely approximations of natural systems, the PIs will study how the persistence/extinction results change under small, density-dependent, perturbations of the model parameters. The extinction/persistence criteria will involve Lyapunov exponents, which usually cannot be computed explicitly. In order to resolve this issue analytical and numerical approximation methods for estimating the Lyapunov exponents will be developed. Finally, together with the Gore lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the PIs will run experiments in order to see how analytical results qualitatively compare with multi-species microbial systems under environmental fluctuations.

Diversity of participants is strongly promoted.<br/><br/>The summer school activities include two tracks: Cancer Dynamics and Evolution and Stochastic Cell Regulation. The topics shall cover stochasticity and cell-to-cell variability in the measurement and modeling of biochemical systems. Emphasis will be given to the effects that small numbers of important molecules (i.e. genes, RNA, and protein) have on the dynamics of living cells. The lectures will review experimental manifestations of stochastic effects in molecular biology, as can be measured using single-cell and single-molecule techniques. The lectures will discuss the most recent analytical and numerical methods that are used to model these systems and show how these methods can improve interpretation of experimental data. The lecture will discuss how different cellular mechanisms control and/or exploit randomness in order to survive in uncertain environments. Lectures will cover topics spanning many time- and length-scales, from the fundamental issues of cell proliferation and mutation dynamics, to molecular events affecting specific pathways in cells, to population genetics effects. This section of the summer school will include a number of instructor-suggested group projects, in which students will apply various numerical techniques to formulate, identify and solve stochastic models of cancer evolution.
