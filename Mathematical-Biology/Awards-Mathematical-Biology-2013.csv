These same changes may also affect how species evolve, especially on very short time scales (months to decades).  The goal of this project is to understand how to measure and predict the stability of natural communities, particularly when species evolve in response to environmental changes. While ecological and evolutionary processes were traditionally not studied together, there is mounting evidence that these processes interact and affect present-day communities (i.e. eco-evo feedbacks).  A fundamental challenge facing evolutionary ecologists is to determine the extent to which these eco-evo feedbacks affect species abundances and the stability of communities.  This project tackles this challenge by developing a mathematical framework for analyzing eco-evo feedbacks, and applying this framework to species in a natural community.  Specifically, the investigators will use pitcher plant communities to evaluate the applicability of the mathematical framework and to provide an empirical basis for extrapolating theoretical results to other natural communities.  These combined theoretical and empirical efforts will provide insights into when eco-evo feedbacks stabilize or destabilize ecological communities. <br/><br/>Understanding eco-evo feedbacks is particularly important in ecosystems where human activities are a dominant ecological and evolutionary force.  Society depends on many ecosystem services, in the form of food, medicine, and energy, which in turn depend on the stability of natural communities.  In analyzing the role of eco-evo feedbacks on community stability, the project will provide a framework to better understand how ecosystems respond to anthropogenic disturbances and how to potentially minimize their impact on ecosystem services. <br/>This project will also support multiple outreach activities to K-12 education.  Particularly, the investigators on this project will continue their extensive work with the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) at Davis, the GK-12 program to develop Data Nuggets for use in K-12 classrooms, and continued outreach to a number of organizations aimed at promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education for young women at Davis.  Undergraduate students will be supported by this project and recruiting efforts will target traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences by interfacing with Biology Undergraduate Scholars Program (BUSP), the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), the McNair Scholars, and the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) at Davis."

The ECO-IMPACS program will provide students from mathematical and biological sciences the opportunity to collaborate on a cutting edge research program to study how recent environmental fluctuations have impacted coastal marsh ecosystems at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).  Specifically, students will examine how hydrologic, nutrient and physical drivers affect key food resources of the endangered whooping crane (Grus americana). ECO-IMPACS students will learn about the biology of ANWR, travel to ANWR to collect field data, and analyze their data in a TRIES laboratory.  ECO-IMPACS students will be instructed on the fundamentals of dynamical model building in the environmental sciences and basic theories of applied mathematics.  Informed by their classroom, field, and laboratory work, ECO-IMPACS students will create and analyze mathematical models of hydrologic fluxes, algae population dynamics, and aquatic vegetation growth.  Students will investigate agent based and nonlinear differential and difference equation models and analyze model behavior utilizing techniques such as non-dimensionalization, computation of the local and global stability of steady-states, exploration of the existence of periodic solutions, perturbation methods, bifurcation analysis, simulation and numerical computation of solutions, and parameter sensitivity analysis.  Graduate students will not only facilitate each stage of the learning process, but also incorporate more advanced mathematics such as stochastic modeling.  Community partners will communicate their research objectives and student efforts will be focused on these objectives throughout the modeling process.  ECO-IMPACS students will be asked to clearly and practically present their results to community partners and demonstrate that their mathematical models can be used as effective tools to guide community partner research and better understand the ANWR ecosystem.   <br/><br/>The importance of integrative modeling and computational solutions within the biological sciences has motivated many universities to create and support programs in environmental mathematics.  The ECO-IMPACS program is a collaborative and educational program that is rooted in ongoing research on ecosystem dynamics of coastal marshes in the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge.  The heterogeneous nature of the ANWR ecosystem and wide range of both natural and anthropogenic influences in the system provide multiple opportunities for collaboration between students in mathematical and biological sciences.  In the ECO-IMPACS program, students will construct mathematical models based on data collected in the field and in the laboratory, perform theoretical and numerical analyses of these models, and report their results in terms that are immediately applicable to the objectives of our community partners (e.g., Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the International Crane Foundation).  The involvement of mathematics and biology students in all phases of the scientific method will produce a more unified perspective about the use of modeling, simulation, laboratory procedures, and field methods in an integrative setting.   The primary goals for ECO-IMPACS are to provide undergraduate and graduate students with a summer internship that develops their ability to successfully integrate mathematics and biology to complete entry level assignments in the field of environmental mathematics.  Students will develop critical skills that U.S. employers desire of their employees (e.g., environmental sampling techniques, mathematical modeling, oral and written communications, teamwork, critical thinking, and problem solving) as they receive feedback and guidance from faculty members and community partners. Thus, ECO-IMPACS participants will be better prepared for both mathematical and environmentally oriented careers in a green economy.

Integrodifference equations reduce the problem of determining the persistence of a population in a changing environment to a simple eigenvalue problem.  Researchers will analyze the effects of climate-driven range shifts on age- and stage-structured populations with complex life histories, perform analyses of two-dimensional range-shift models on realistic geometries, build and analyze models with explicit habitat quality functions, and build and analyze range-shift models that contain interspecific interactions.

In response to this warming, many species have shifted their ranges poleward in latitude or upward in elevation.  The purpose of this project is to develop mathematical models and tools that will help us determine which species can continue to keep pace with climate-driven habitat shifts and which species are at risk.  Researchers will start with models that include growth and demography, dispersal, and climate-driven spatial shifts and extend these models to include age and stage structure, complicated life histories, population interactions, habitat quality, and realistic geometries.

Intestinal edema refers to the excess accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces of the intestinal wall tissue.   The project focuses on two separate scales. At the continuum scale, the intestinal layer is modeled as an inhomogeneous poroelastic medium that undergoes finite deformation.  Intestinal transit is modeled as  Navier-Stokes flow within the intestinal cavity and is coupled to the intestinal wall model in a fluid-structure interaction algorithm.  Coupling conditions include the continuity of normal fluid flux, the balance of forces and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman condition, across the interface between the lumen and intestinal layer.  At the microscale, a detailed biochemical-mechanical mathematical model of a smooth muscle cell is developed.  The model focuses on the regulation of myosin light chain and its phosphorylation, which have been linked to intestinal muscle contractility. Experimental data from both animal and cell models are to be incorporated into the development of the mathematical models at both scales.<br/><br/>Intestinal edema can arise in patients with gastroschisis, inflammatory bowel disease and cirrhosis, as well as in patients receiving resuscitative fluid treatments after traumatic injuries. The main problem for a patient with intestinal edema is that the condition causes ileus, a decrease in intestinal transit due to decreased intestinal smooth muscle contractility.  Decreased intestinal transit often leads to longer hospital stays and recovery times for patients and in extreme cases can be fatal.  The link between edema and ileus is unknown, and is thus the motivation for developing mathematical models to explore this phenomenon. Results from this project will improve understanding of edema formation and its effect on intestinal muscle contractility and intestinal transit.  The models will be utilized to simulate treatment scenarios to assist experimentalists with their goal of preventing ileus when edema forms.  There are only a few drugs available to treat ileus; they have limited effectiveness and all target the enteric or central nervous system.  This research will be integrated into a Summer math program for high school students. In addition, an important aspect of this collaborative project is the interdisciplinary research experience the postdoctoral fellows and students will obtain as a result of their interactions with the mathematicians and experimentalists."

The investigators have introduced a dynamic Boolean network model of plant-pollinator mutualistic ecosystems that describes their formation and stability.  They will expand the model to examine perturbations to ecosystem structure, specifically the permanent or temporary removal (extinction) or introduction (invasion) of one or more species.  This will allow for assessment of which species and ecosystem properties contribute to the susceptibility of an ecosystem to catastrophic failure, and which contribute most to stability.  The project will make use of high-performance computing to model the formation and dynamics of diverse ecological communities.  The results of the dynamic simulations will be distilled into novel graph theoretical analyses and measures.  This project will also inform a number of related theoretical studies on the importance of transient species (those absent from stable communities, but temporarily present during dynamical re-equilibration), the role of other mutualistic and natural enemy interactions, composite interactions, and context-dependent interactions.  This project is based upon an application of dynamic network theory to mutualistic ecological networks, the unique challenges of which will also expand the body of knowledge concerning network theory's general applications and uses.<br/> <br/>The need to address the impacts of environmental perturbations is increasingly urgent; the addition or loss of species to existing ecological communities can have far-reaching consequences for both the community and the greater ecosystem in which the community is embedded.  For example, the recent, rapid decline in pollinator levels poses a serious risk to global agriculture and food security.  This project will advance our knowledge of how these complex systems function; only if we can anticipate the effects of environmental perturbations can we act to prevent or ameliorate undesired outcomes.  This project will not only address species and community structures that are critical to community stability, but will also facilitate assessment of community manipulations, such as floral resource provisioning for native bees to benefit fruit growers, that bring about desired management outcomes in the face of perturbations."

These problems typically involve the movement of a flexible appendage in a fluid where both inertia and viscosity are important. The fundamental computational challenge associated with these problems is the accurate and efficient simulation of the moving, flexible structure in the surrounding fluid. One aim is to extend numerical methods for Stokes flow to Reynolds numbers on the order of 1 to 10. These methods will then be applied to aerodynamics problems involving flow through bristled wings. Another aim is to incorporate viscous effects into vortex sheet methods, in order to more accurately simulate flows over a wider range of scales. These tools will then be used to understand the importance of active control of fish fin rays and other instances of fluid interactions with organisms. Finally, this work will allow for comparisons of propulsion mechanisms and numerical methods across a wide range of Reynolds numbers.<br/><br/>The numerical methods and models developed in this research project can be applied to numerous and diverse biological fluid-structure interactions problems. Some examples beyond those specific to the proposal include the pumping of blood by the heart, the flow of air in the lungs, drag reduction in flexible materials such as leaves and sessile organisms, and the dispersal of seeds in air and larvae in water. The broader impacts of this work include the improved understanding of propulsion mechanics that can be used for the design of micro air and water vehicles; the development of computational tools which are useful to study optimization questions in biology; rich examples of nonlinear dynamics for physics; research mentoring to undergraduates in experimental and modeling work and graduate students in computational and modeling research. The outreach component will help more students achieve autonomy in research and critical thinking through independent research projects. This project also addresses one of the seven questions posed by the National Academy of Sciences on the role of theory in advancing 21st century biology: ``what are the engineering principles of life?''"

The major problems to be addressed in this project are (i) movement by shape changes, (ii) modeling of the intracellular mechanics, and (iii) integration of signaling, actin dynamics and mechanics in an integrated computational model of cell movement.  Heretofore mathematical modeling has primarily focused on the mesenchymal mode, but the investigators first address the other end of the continuum.  The overall objective is to produce a unified description for locomotion in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix that integrates signaling and mechanics.  Movement by shape changes has not been studied in the context proposed, but it has recently been shown to be important in the movement of a number of cell types, and understanding the factors that affect the speed and efficiency of such movement is a challenging problem.  This project develops mathematical models that can be used to study and quantify the importance of various factors, such as properties of the surrounding medium, that affect the efficiency of movement.  The third component continues previous work by the principal investigator on signaling and will integrate a model of the control networks with the mechanical components that comprise the first topics.  This will lead to the first model that incorporates both signaling and mechanics, and will result in a computational tool that should be very useful to the broader community.<br/><br/>Cell movement is a very complex process that involves the spatial and temporal control and integration of a number of subprocesses, including the transduction of chemical or mechanical signals from the environment, intracellular biochemical responses, and translation of the intra- and extracellular signals into a mechanical response.  While many single-celled organisms use flagella or cilia to swim, there are two basic modes of movement used by eukaryotic cells that lack such structures--mesenchymal and amoeboid.  The former, which can be characterized as ?crawling? in fibroblasts or ?gliding? in keratocytes, involves the extension of finger-like pseudopodia and/or broad flat lamellipodia, whose protrusion is driven by actin polymerization at the leading edge. In the amoeboid mode, which does not rely on strong adhesion, cells are more rounded and employ shape changes to move--in effect 'jostling through the crowd' or 'swimming'.  However, recent experiments have shown that numerous cell types display enormous plasticity in locomotion, in that they sense the mechanical properties of their environment and adjust the balance between the modes. Thus pure crawling and pure swimming are the extremes on a continuum of locomotion strategies, but many cells can sense their environment and use the most efficient strategy in a given context.  This project uses innovative mathematical approaches to better understand the dynamics of cell locomotion, combining novel models with experimental data.  Additionally, the research team includes postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, with the project providing an opportunity to work in an inherently interdisciplinary field."

Unlike other analytical platforms, the comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry system provides a much increased separation capacity, chemical selectivity and sensitivity for the analysis of metabolites. The aim of this project is to infer metabolic networks from the measurements of metabolites using this high-throughput comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry system. To achieve a high accuracy metabolic network construction, an innovative peak detection algorithm will be first developed for simultaneous baseline removal, smoothing and peak picking steps, as well as the statistical assessment of peak confidence level. The investigators will then develop an innovative peak alignment algorithm based on global comparison using point matching algorithm as well as considering measurement error and outlier detection. Once an accurate alignment peak table is created, metabolic networks will be created using Bayesian ensemble method, which is Bayesian model averaging, to find meaningful pairwise interactions and associations among sets of metabolite peaks as well as to account for uncertainty of network complexity. In particular, the pathway information will be incorporated into network constructions for weighting each network constructed by several different approaches.<br/><br/>The comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry platform can not only leverage the peak capacity issue in current metabolomics, but also brings much improved chemical selectivity and sensitivity for metabolomics analyses.

The metabolic network construction system developed from this project will enable identification of consistent metabolite mechanisms and pathways for numerous organisms and diseases in real time.

Cognitive tasks often require coordinated spatiotemporal activity, which experimentalists can measure using multiple electrodes, voltage sensitive dye, and optical techniques. The main goal of this research project is to develop mathematical tools to study how spatially structured networks in the brain produce reliable activity in the face of noise. Specifically, we will be interested in how the spatial architecture of synaptic connections interacts with noise on multiple scales to influence network activity. Thus, linking our theory with experimental data will require the development of new techniques in stochastic and nonlinear analysis, multiscale methods, and symmetric bifurcation theory. Neuronal network models that incorporate space often assume synaptic connectivity depends only on the distance between neurons. Such dynamical systems tend to be marginally stable, so solutions diffuse in the presence of noise. More realistic models of neuronal connectivity do not produce such degeneracies. We propose to examine how spatial heterogeneity can improve or limit the robustness of neuronal networks. We will analyze models that encode neural activity linked to working memory, decision making, and place localization. Our work will contribute mathematical methods to other current research areas in math biology concerned with analyzing the effect of noise on spatially extended systems. <br/><br/>Everyday, humans make decisions, use memory, and navigate their environment. Spatially structured activity in the brain underlies all these processes. Spatially localized ""bumps"" of activity are thought to encode short term memories of spatial position. Propagating waves of activity represent visual inputs and the movement of limbs. These activity patterns must be generated in networks of the brain that are fraught with noise. Despite the noisiness of the brain, we execute cognitive tasks faithfully. How does this happen? We will develop mathematical techniques to address this major question. Mainly, we will explore how neuronal networks can be structured to support robust spatiotemporal dynamics. Insight into the robustness of cognitive processes can be used to develop therapeutic solutions for various mental disorders. Alzheimer's, dementia, and Parkinson's present more commonly as human lifespans grow. Treatments are not possible without well-developed theory. Our analysis of spatiotemporal neural coding will also help understanding of how spatial arrays of multielectrodes should best be designed for applications like neural prosthetics."

The multiscale study of the emergence of these patterns presents both challenges and opportunities for research and education.  The goal of this interdisciplinary research is to develop a general integrated multi-scale dynamical network modeling framework of division of labor in social insects.

How to characterize the crucial feedback mechanisms linking both structure and dynamics of the division of labor in a dynamical environment and 3. How the decentralized social insect system based on many independent and simple individual interactions leads to highly complex dynamics with great network properties such as scalability, robustness/flexibility and simplicity.

These equations model the stochastic reactions and diffusion of tens of thousands of molecules within a cell containing detailed sub-cellular structures derived from high resolution soft X-ray tomography imaging data.<br/><br/>To better comprehend how organisms function, respond to environmental stimuli, and to aid in treating disease, it is necessary to understand, predict, and control the behavior of individual cells. Each cell contains numerous complex dynamical processes involving proteins undergoing biochemical reactions that play a major role in cell to cell communication, in cell growth and division, in immune system function, and in the development and progression of cancer. Understanding how proteins move about and interact within cells is critical to being able to predict and control these dynamical processes. This project will develop new mathematical equations and computational methods that can be used to study how proteins move about and interact within cells. These methods are designed to facilitate the computer simulation of cellular processes within realistic models of the interior of cells derived from high resolution experimental imaging data.  This project integrates the theoretical work with an educational program designed to improve the training of computational mathematical biologists. This interdisciplinary field requires a synthesis of skills that the project will provide to students in an integrated manner. These skills include the ability to develop mathematical models of biological systems; the ability to understand, and choose, appropriate numerical methods with which to solve these models; and the ability to implement these methods in a manner that takes advantage of existing numerical libraries on large scale computing platforms. Thus the planned research studies are complemented by an educational program designed to address the need to train scientists and engineers in the computational sciences, with an emphasis on computational mathematical biology."

The models will be used to develop and test general principles for how animals manage to move stably and effectively through complex and changing environments. The PIs have developed the first mathematical model of a swimming organism to fully couple a surrounding fluid with a simulated animal.  In this project, the PIs will add simulated nervous and sensory systems, in order to test broad hypotheses for how animals must respond to perturbations for stable and effective swimming. The approach of the project is to consider how the dynamics of swimming emerges from the inherent coupling of all of these elements. The PIs hypothesize that sensory feedback is necessary to support the locomotor pattern as oscillation frequency increases, but, at a particular oscillation frequency, mechanical interactions alone can be sufficient to stabilize the swimmer against both neural noise and fluid perturbations. To test these hypotheses, the PIs combine two different classes of mathematical models: (1) a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model based upon the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to estimate the forces and the motion of the body; (2) coupled oscillator models to describe the neural circuit that generates the locomotor pattern, called a central pattern generator (CPG) and its sensory inputs. The CFD model simulates aspects of the system where the governing equations and parameters are known, while the CPG models allow us to examine general principles about sensorimotor feedback for aspects where fewer details are known.<br/><br/>All animals interact with their environment using flexible structures such as hairs, antennae, fins, limbs, and even their entire bodies, and all of these structures deform in response to both internal body forces and external environmental forces. And all animals that move have nervous systems that use electrical signals to activate muscles to produce force and to respond to sensory inputs that result from those environmental interactions. To understand how animals move effectively in the physical world, one must understand the interactions of many different forces, including forces from passive tissue properties, active muscular forces, and forces from the external environment. Such an understanding is critical to the development of next generation prosthetic limbs that enable adaptive and effective motion in complex environments, and to the progress of therapies for spinal cord injury that rely on the coupling between the damaged spinal circuits, the mechanics of legs, and the interaction with the external world. In this project, the PIs will investigate how the coupling among these different systems and forces contributes to the dynamics and stability of motion in a model swimming organism."

They emerge from the cooperative activity of the participating neurons and network synaptic connectivity. Understanding how the intrinsic biophysical properties of neurons interact with oscillatory input currents and synaptic conductances is essential to understand the mechanisms by which preferred frequencies are selected in oscillatory neuronal networks. Resonance refers to the ability of a neuron to exhibit a preferred frequency response to oscillatory inputs. Existing mathematical studies on resonance have focused primarily on linear models or linearized conductance-based models. Nonlinear effects have been examined using numerical simulations. A general theory of resonance in neuronal models is lacking, as are appropriate mathematical tools to answer key biophysical and dynamic questions. The aim of this project is to develop general theoretical principles for the generation of preferred frequency responses in neuronal systems that incorporate the effects of nonlinearities and the diversity of time scales, and to expand existing dynamical systems tools in ways that allow for the investigation of the underlying mechanisms. This project has three specific aims: (i) to identify the neuronal subthreshold mechanisms of generation of preferred frequency responses in both amplitude and phase to oscillatory inputs, (ii) to identify the mechanisms by which subthreshold resonances are communicated from the subthreshold to the spiking regimes, and (iii) to evaluate how resonance and synaptic currents interact to generate preferred frequency responses to oscillatory inputs in networks of neurons. The models in this project have two levels of description. Biophysical models are used to understand the effect of the participating currents on the network dynamics and to make experimentally verifiable predictions. Minimal models are used for mathematical analysis using dynamical systems tools. The mathematical tools to be developed will provide a theoretical framework for the investigation of preferred frequency responses in models with higher levels of descriptions. <br/><br/>Rhythmic oscillations at characteristic frequency bands have been observed in various areas of the brain and have been implicated in cognition and motor behavior in both health and disease. Network oscillations result from the cooperative activity of the participating neurons, but how these neurons interact to produce coherent activity in the brain is only beginning to be understood. This project deals with the responses of neurons to oscillatory inputs, and how these responses can be used to understand the dynamics of neuronal networks. As test cases, we focus primarily on neurons of the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. Rhythmic oscillations in these areas of the brain have been implicated in various cognitive processes including learning, memory and navigation. Neuronal networks in these areas are also the focus of diseases of the nervous systems such as epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this project is to understand the biophysical and dynamic mechanisms that underlie the generation of preferred frequency responses to oscillatory inputs in neurons and neuronal networks, and to develop the appropriate mathematical tools to answer key mechanistic questions. This work will be carried out in the context of ongoing collaborations with experimental neuroscientists, and is designed to achieve a close integration between our modeling and theoretical efforts and the experimental efforts of various collaborators so that findings from one side will inform the other. Students participating in this project will be trained at the interface between Mathematics and Neuroscience in the well-established interdisciplinary environment at the NJIT/Rutgers campus, and will be prepared to join the scientific task force in the mathematical and biomedical sciences."

Neural variability is malleable depending upon task specifics, cognitive state, and sensory input; however little is known about the mechanisms that mediate this variability.  Using techniques from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and nonlinear systems theory this project will build a coherent theory of the mechanics of neural variability. Recent experiments across cortex show that the stochastic dynamics of spontaneous neural activity is very rich, beyond that observed during evoked or task driven responses.  This research will show how clustered neural architectures can replicate this finding.  This research will develop key insights from simplified Markov chain models of cortical assembly dynamics, which will allow a more formal approach to our previous simulation based studies.  Uncovering the core mechanics of neural variability is a critical step in giving a foundation for a theory of neural computation.    <br/><br/>Modern computers minimize noisy fluctuations in transistors and semiconductors in order to improve performance reliability.

Specifically, our theory will expose how the underlying circuitry of the brain is involved in producing and controlling neural variability.  This research will guide future experiments that aim to better characterize neural circuits, placing any data in the context of a core functional feature of the nervous system.  Furthermore, our research will give critical insights concerning many neurodegenerative diseases where a common neural signature is an excess of variability."

This project will focus on the generation and control of rhythms in neuronal networks associated with two classes of repetitive movements, namely respiration and limb motion.  In the neuronal rhythms, multiple populations of neurons activate sequentially within each cycle, and the activity within each population is synchronized when it arises.  This work will explore the mechanisms underlying the synchronized bursting of respiratory neurons in the pre-Btzinger complex (preBtc), which occurs during the inspiratory phase of breathing.  Doing so will involve novel mathematical analysis of three time scale dynamics and of the interaction of multiple burst-generation mechanisms in single neurons.  New results will be attained about how synchronized bursting in neuronal networks depends on features of network coupling and on intrinsic properties of the neurons involved.  Additional modeling and analysis will consider how the preBtc interacts with neurons in other respiratory areas and participates in a closed loop feedback control system to achieve robust respiratory rhythms that respond flexibly to changing demands.  In the area of limb motion, coordination of muscle groups controlling multiple limb segments and limbs is critical for effective behaviors. This project will analyze how correctly timed rhythmic activity of a particular joint emerges from the interaction of top-down neural commands for muscle activation with feedback signals from movements of other joints. We will also study how different stimuli can reconfigure a particular rhythm generation circuit to yield diverse movements of a single limb, as needed for behavioral flexibility.  The analysis performed will provide new results on how to handle forcing in multiple time scale dynamical systems and will suggest general mechanisms that underlie coordinated rhythm generation in neuronal networks.<br/> <br/>Respiration and locomotion are among the many rhythmic neuro-mechanical processes that can be maintained without direct conscious control.  This automation is made possible by particular sets of neurons in the brain and spinal cord, which are specialized to produce the signals that drive these behaviors.  There are many unanswered questions about how these neurons generate activity with the appropriate features in a way that adapts fluidly to altered conditions, such as changes in terrain encountered while walking. This project will use the development of mathematical models constrained by experimental data as well as computer simulations and mathematical analysis of these models to address several such questions.  In the context of respiration, the results of this project will help explain how output from different groups of respiratory neurons is produced with the correct intensity and timing to drive normal breathing.  They will also provide new understanding of how signals related to the levels of gases in the blood and the amount of stretch in the lungs and chest wall feed back to tune the neuronal outputs and maintain successful breathing under changing respiratory demands, as well as how this system may fail in certain breathing disorders. These results will be attained in collaboration with experimentalists, who will provide direct access to data and testing of model predictions. The project will also study two classes of problems related to repetitive limb movements.  First, behaviors such as walking require activation of multiple muscle groups, controlling multiple limb segments and joints, in an appropriate sequence.  We will use modeling and mathematics to explore how this coordination is achieved.  Second, animals achieve a diverse range of behaviors using a small set of limbs by activating their limb control muscles in a variety of different patterns. We will use mathematical analysis to test the hypothesis that a single neuronal rhythm generation network can generate multiple such patterns, selected by input signals that trigger different behaviors. Our analysis will supply predictions that can be tested by our experimental collaborators to gain a better understanding of how limb motions are generated, which can provide useful information for robotics and for efforts to restore limb movements compromised by disease or injury."

Anti-inflammatory treatment of human spinal core injury and its<br/>timing must be based on knowledge of the types of cells participating in the inflammatory response, the time after injury when they appear and the nature of their actions. However, inflammatory cascades and relationship with neurogenesis are complicated and consequence of central nervous system injury including spinal cord injury is poorly understood. Invading macrophages and resident microglia cells, the two major cell types that are from monocytic lineage play major role in the inflammatory process. Due to the lack of specific markers, the functional roles of invading macrophages from activated microglia within injured<br/>spinal cord are not largely unknown. We propose to use microarray techniques to investigate expression profiles on microglia and macrophages in different time points and the expression network between inflammation and neurogenesis. New methods are proposed to label defined cell populations in microglia/macrophage deleted mice. New statistical techniques will be developed to address directly the<br/>challenges from our biological studies. These include removing intensity effect of the Affymetrix data, identifying significant genes and determining gene expressions patterns over time, identifying a small group of genes that differentiate invading macrophages from activated microglia in the spinal cord, among others.  They involve the statistical estimation, testing, variable selection, classification and network modeling in high-dimensional feature spaces.  These emerging problems will be confronted via developing new statistical methods to address the challenges associated with high-dimensionality. At the same time, the investigators  also intend to provide fundamental understanding, via asymptotic analysis and simulation studies, to these problems and their associated methodologies.

Our aims include identifying genes that reveal the distinct functional profiles of resident microglia and invading macrophages in spinal cord injury, and selecting the genes that are uniquely altered during specific facets of the neuronal response to inflammation. These approaches can not only help us understand the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory responses in spinal cord injury, but also potentially identify genes to be targeted for therapeutic intervention following spinal core injury. In addition, our developed cutting-edging statistical techniques and bioinformatic tools can be applied to other biological and statistical researches. The project will also integrate research and education by working closely with students and funding them in the form of research assistantships, creating datasets, and developing publicly available computer code (both made available through the web) for each of the main research endeavors funded by this proposal.

Intestinal edema refers to the excess accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces of the intestinal wall tissue.   The project focuses on two separate scales. At the continuum scale, the intestinal layer is modeled as an inhomogeneous poroelastic medium that undergoes finite deformation.  Intestinal transit is modeled as  Navier-Stokes flow within the intestinal cavity and is coupled to the intestinal wall model in a fluid-structure interaction algorithm.  Coupling conditions include the continuity of normal fluid flux, the balance of forces and the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman condition, across the interface between the lumen and intestinal layer.  At the microscale, a detailed biochemical-mechanical mathematical model of a smooth muscle cell is developed.  The model focuses on the regulation of myosin light chain and its phosphorylation, which have been linked to intestinal muscle contractility. Experimental data from both animal and cell models are to be incorporated into the development of the mathematical models at both scales.<br/><br/>Intestinal edema can arise in patients with gastroschisis, inflammatory bowel disease and cirrhosis, as well as in patients receiving resuscitative fluid treatments after traumatic injuries. The main problem for a patient with intestinal edema is that the condition causes ileus, a decrease in intestinal transit due to decreased intestinal smooth muscle contractility.  Decreased intestinal transit often leads to longer hospital stays and recovery times for patients and in extreme cases can be fatal.  The link between edema and ileus is unknown, and is thus the motivation for developing mathematical models to explore this phenomenon. Results from this project will improve understanding of edema formation and its effect on intestinal muscle contractility and intestinal transit.  The models will be utilized to simulate treatment scenarios to assist experimentalists with their goal of preventing ileus when edema forms.  There are only a few drugs available to treat ileus; they have limited effectiveness and all target the enteric or central nervous system.  This research will be integrated into a Summer math program for high school students. In addition, an important aspect of this collaborative project is the interdisciplinary research experience the postdoctoral fellows and students will obtain as a result of their interactions with the mathematicians and experimentalists."

Moreover, many diseased states have been attributed to elevated noise levels in specific proteins. Stochastic analysis of biochemical processes relies heavily on Monte Carlo simulation techniques that come at a significant computational cost. In addition, these techniques do not provide closed-form solutions that enable a systematic understanding of how stochastic variability is regulated in these systems. This project will overcome these challenges by developing computationally tractable methodologies based on moment closure schemes for studying stochastic dynamics of gene regulatory networks. Various analytical approximations that relate statistical properties of the system to biologically relevant parameters will be investigated. Far from being a hindrance, signatures of protein noise levels can be informative of the underlying gene network topology. This project will build mathematical techniques that harness quantitative measurements of stochasticity in protein levels for inferring regulatory interactions between genes and proteins.<br/><br/>Biological data is being collected at a rapid rate and innovative methods for analyzing data are critically needed. Advances in experimental techniques allow measurements of fluctuations in protein levels in individual cells, which carry useful information to probe interactions between genes and proteins. In this project, tools exploiting statistical properties of these fluctuations to characterize cellular processes will be developed and will be made available for the broad scientific community to use. Stochastic variability in protein levels has been implicated in bacterial antibiotic resistance, mutation-independent selection of tumors and driving pathogenic human viruses, e.g., HIV, into a drug-resistant dormant state. This research will improve the characterizations of gene networks underlying these disease systems and thus this research will have a broader impact on medicine. Many of the results of this project will be incorporated into various courses offered across different departments providing interdisciplinary training and research experience to students at the interface of mathematical and biological sciences."

This project considers the example of polymerase switching in translesion DNA synthesis, which is essential for cells to cope with DNA damage.  The polymerase switch process involves multiple components.  A ""tool-belt"" model has been proposed for the switch, but attempting to verify the model with conventional fluoroscopy modifies the normal activity of the proteins.  Thus, a label-free technique such as SPR is desirable, but requires more sophisticated mathematical modeling.  A mathematical model will be produced that relates the sensogram signal to the underlying kinetics.  Asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations of this model will be used to design a set of experiments that can determine the kinetic pathway for a general system.  These results will be used to test the ""tool-belt"" model.  In particular, by adjusting the relative concentrations of the various species, one can move into regimes where a few reactions dominate.  Then the rate constants can be easily ascertained, since the nonlinear governing equations will be simplified.<br/><br/>When studying the processes underpinning disease and other biological systems, biochemists often need accurate estimates of reaction rates.  Optical biosensors are a popular way to measure such reactions, as they do not disturb the underlying system.  Correctly interpreting biosensor data requires having an accurate mathematical model for the system.  Current models do not work well when multiple reactions are occurring simultaneously.  A new model will be developed that will provide scientists a general roadmap on how to design experiments to analyze multiple reactions that occur at the same time.  In particular, the mathematics will be used to validate a model to explain translesion DNA synthesis, which is essential for cells to cope with DNA damage."

Each project will involve at least four RTG participants, including faculty, students and/or postdoctoral researchers. Some projects will focus more on development of new methodologies, while others aim more at utilizing these methodologies in a particular biological setting. Important cross-cutting themes will include parameter estimation and parameter identifiability, model selection, model robustness, uncertainty quantification and model-based experimental design. Students will receive preparation for research activities in this area through a number of supporting courses, the majority of which will be offered at the graduate level, but will be accessible to advanced undergraduates. Interdisciplinarity and team-working skills will be emphasized and developed through careful mentoring and using a number of activities, such as regular research presentations, both within and between the project groups, and journal clubs. Professional development sessions will help prepare participants for current and future careers in interdisciplinary environments both inside and outside of academia. These will be offered at various levels, designed to cater for the needs of the different participants, in some cases focusing on issues unique to scientists working in the biological realm. An annual RTG workshop, including external speakers, will showcase participants' accomplishments and give opportunity to reflect on the successful (and less successful) aspects of the year's research and training activities. In alternate years, the workshop will be expanded to include a week-long lecture, tutorial and laboratory course, providing a condensed presentation of chosen aspects of the RTG curriculum to external participants, primarily advanced undergraduates and early-stage graduate students.<br/><br/>Ever increasing amounts of biological data are being collected, at a range of scales from the molecular and cellular through to the population and ecosystem.

The models will be used to develop and test general principles for how animals manage to move stably and effectively through complex and changing environments. The PIs have developed the first mathematical model of a swimming organism to fully couple a surrounding fluid with a simulated animal.  In this project, the PIs will add simulated nervous and sensory systems, in order to test broad hypotheses for how animals must respond to perturbations for stable and effective swimming. The approach of the project is to consider how the dynamics of swimming emerges from the inherent coupling of all of these elements. The PIs hypothesize that sensory feedback is necessary to support the locomotor pattern as oscillation frequency increases, but, at a particular oscillation frequency, mechanical interactions alone can be sufficient to stabilize the swimmer against both neural noise and fluid perturbations. To test these hypotheses, the PIs combine two different classes of mathematical models: (1) a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model based upon the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to estimate the forces and the motion of the body; (2) coupled oscillator models to describe the neural circuit that generates the locomotor pattern, called a central pattern generator (CPG) and its sensory inputs. The CFD model simulates aspects of the system where the governing equations and parameters are known, while the CPG models allow us to examine general principles about sensorimotor feedback for aspects where fewer details are known.<br/><br/>All animals interact with their environment using flexible structures such as hairs, antennae, fins, limbs, and even their entire bodies, and all of these structures deform in response to both internal body forces and external environmental forces. And all animals that move have nervous systems that use electrical signals to activate muscles to produce force and to respond to sensory inputs that result from those environmental interactions. To understand how animals move effectively in the physical world, one must understand the interactions of many different forces, including forces from passive tissue properties, active muscular forces, and forces from the external environment. Such an understanding is critical to the development of next generation prosthetic limbs that enable adaptive and effective motion in complex environments, and to the progress of therapies for spinal cord injury that rely on the coupling between the damaged spinal circuits, the mechanics of legs, and the interaction with the external world. In this project, the PIs will investigate how the coupling among these different systems and forces contributes to the dynamics and stability of motion in a model swimming organism."

These same changes may also affect how species evolve, especially on very short time scales (months to decades).  The goal of this project is to understand how to measure and predict the stability of natural communities, particularly when species evolve in response to environmental changes. While ecological and evolutionary processes were traditionally not studied together, there is mounting evidence that these processes interact and affect present-day communities (i.e. eco-evo feedbacks).  A fundamental challenge facing evolutionary ecologists is to determine the extent to which these eco-evo feedbacks affect species abundances and the stability of communities.  This project tackles this challenge by developing a mathematical framework for analyzing eco-evo feedbacks, and applying this framework to species in a natural community.  Specifically, the investigators will use pitcher plant communities to evaluate the applicability of the mathematical framework and to provide an empirical basis for extrapolating theoretical results to other natural communities.  These combined theoretical and empirical efforts will provide insights into when eco-evo feedbacks stabilize or destabilize ecological communities. <br/><br/>Understanding eco-evo feedbacks is particularly important in ecosystems where human activities are a dominant ecological and evolutionary force.  Society depends on many ecosystem services, in the form of food, medicine, and energy, which in turn depend on the stability of natural communities.  In analyzing the role of eco-evo feedbacks on community stability, the project will provide a framework to better understand how ecosystems respond to anthropogenic disturbances and how to potentially minimize their impact on ecosystem services. <br/>This project will also support multiple outreach activities to K-12 education.  Particularly, the investigators on this project will continue their extensive work with the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) at Davis, the GK-12 program to develop Data Nuggets for use in K-12 classrooms, and continued outreach to a number of organizations aimed at promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education for young women at Davis.

The Bayesian models integrate two well-established modeling paradigms: (1) deterministic mathematical models of cellular metabolism and (2) causal graphical models of phenotypes and genotypes.  These modeling paradigms are widely used, but suffer major limitations: deterministic models do not reflect the individual variation in fluxes that result from allelic variation of enzymes, and graphical modeling techniques currently ignore all prior information about the biochemical pathway.  This project overcomes these limitations by incorporating diverse forms of data and variables, which span the genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and clinical phenotypes.  Applications focus on genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of breast and skin cancer cell metabolism to search out novel molecular targeted therapies, side-effects, and unravel the complex mechanisms underlying the disease.  The methodology will be implemented in a publicly available software package, which is designed for users with a minimal background in mathematics and statistics.  <br/> <br/>Understanding how genetics influences metabolic and regulatory function is important for the prevention and treatment of disease.

Mathematical models are widely used to elucidate networks of molecular traits from high-throughput data, and have become important tools for systems biology.  Despite this progress, integrating diverse types of data remains a major challenge that has limited our ability to take full advantage of the wealth of post-genomics data for knowledge and discovery.

This research investigates this issue in the context of bacterial chemotaxis, and derive continuum models from cell-based models based on the detailed biochemistry of cell signaling. This task involves development of new multiscale methods that deal with nonlinearities of single-cell dynamics and overlapping time scales.

A fundamental question in axonal physiology is to understand how the structure of the axonal cytoskeleton is developed and maintained in health and how it gets perturbed in diseases. This research investigates the mechanisms that lead to the segregation of axonal cytoskeletal molecules observed in diseases using multiscale models, and will be conducted in close collaboration with experimentalists.<br/><br/>Complex biological systems involve multiple space and time scales. To completely understand these systems, multiscale models and methods are essential tools.

This research will lead to quantitative, mechanistic models for directed movement of bacterial populations. These models will enhance our ability to predict and control health problems such as bacteria-associated infections and environmental problems such as bioremediation. The resulting multiscale analysis framework is broadly applicable to study collective movement of other types of cells, ants, birds and animals, and thus this research has far-reaching impacts in medicine and ecology. The second topic concerns the physiology of axons, which are long thin projections of nerve cells. Maintaining the regular shape and organization of the axonal cytoskeleton is critical for the normal functioning of neurons. How is the normal organization of the axonal cytoskeleton maintained and established in health? How is it perturbed in neurodegenerative diseases? This research investigates these questions using multiscale models that integrate the detailed biology of the axonal cytoskeletal molecules.

In particular, second order finite difference methods will be developed, which are efficient in computing solutions of these models with high accuracy. Convergence results for these schemes will be established. Previous work has demonstrated that models falling under this general class are successful in describing the dynamics of a green tree frog population. The investigators will demonstrate that the application of this class of models can be extended to the spread of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) among amphibians. It has been recently discovered that the symbiont Janthinobacterium lividum (Jl) provides immunity to this disease for some species of amphibians through the production of anti-fungal metabolites. The numerical methods developed during this project will be used to understand the effects the disease Bd and the symbiont Jl have on the persistence of amphibians. Further, an important aim of this project is to train Ph.D. students in the multidisciplinary field of mathematical biology to help carry out the proposed research.<br/><br/>The decline and extinction of amphibian populations are of immense concern to the scientific community. Because amphibians travel between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and across different trophic levels, they are often the first indicators of large-scale environmental degradation caused by climate change, habitat loss, pollution, and non-native species.  For example, introduced diseases diminish and weaken amphibian populations, which in turn transform the ecological landscape. The study of amphibians and associated diseases in this project will result in structured models to understand population and disease dynamics. The computation of solutions of these models will require novel numerical methods, which will be developed. The extensive numerical simulations of the models conducted during this project will provide insight as to how a program to combat Bd with the judicious introduction of the symbiont Jl might be carried out most effectively. Furthermore, because of the generalities of the models developed and the abstractness of the mathematical techniques established in this project, these tools will undoubtedly be useful to other important biological problems. Specific examples of models that fall under the proposed class that have already been developed include: (i) cell dynamics involved in erythropoiesis, (ii) intra-host dynamics of malaria, (iii) the transmission dynamics of Mycobacterium marinum (a TB-like bacterium) among fish."

The CSHL conference advances knowledge in cell biology by providing a forum where scientists who study all aspects of dynamic cellular processes, from data generation and analysis to the development and validation of quantitative models, can interact with each other and exchange ideas, information, and approaches. The conference includes sessions on signal processing, noise, cell mechanics, development, synthetic biology, imaging, evolution, and organizing principles of biological systems. The 2013 meeting builds on the successes of prior CSHL meetings to assemble an international gathering of scientists, discuss new developments in the field, and catalyze innovative research collaborations.<br/><br/>The discipline of computational cell biology seeks to develop mathematical models of living systems, such as molecular interactions during cell division in both healthy cells and cancer. The goals for such models are twofold: 1) predict outcomes from dynamical systems in the cell, thereby allowing scientists to 2) explain how cellular processes go awry in disease. To build successful models, mathematicians and computer scientists must work closely with experimental cell biologists. In this partnership, experimentalists collect quantitative information about cellular processes and how they change over time, while mathematicians use the information to build and improve upon computer models that accurately reflect the biology. The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory conference on Computational Cell Biology: The Interplay between Models and Data advances knowledge in the field by bringing together scientists with expertise in both experimental and computational techniques, thus catalyzing scientific interactions that will ultimately accelerate the pace of discovery."

In particular, they have shown that some cells use pressure-driven protrusions called blebs to squeeze their way through the gaps in the matrix, and it has been hypothesized that this method of locomotion can be achieved without adhesive interactions with the surrounding environment.  The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive mathematical model of a blebbing cell and use this modeling framework to explore how cells use cytoplasmic streaming for locomotion. This model will be the first to provide an integrative picture of how local mechanical and chemical factors work together to drive directed cell locomotion. These models will involve the mechanochemical chemical interactions between the cytoskeleton, cytosol, cell membrane, extracellular fluid, and the surrounding solid structures. A necessary component to this project is accounting for the changing geometry of the cells. Given the complexity of the problem, efficient numerical simulations are needed to explore the models.  The investigators develop a new mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to unify the mathematical description of these complex interacting materials. Using this framework, new and efficient methods for solving the coupled equations that arise in the model are developed.<br/><br/>Many problems in biology involve interactions between mechanics complex multiphase fluids, chemical reactions, and deforming structures. For example, the dynamics of growing bacterial biofilms and the transport of mucus in the respiratory system are two such processes. Our models and numerical methods can be adapted to explore these important complex systems. A graduate student will be trained as part of this research project. This project is ideally suited for training graduate students with the broad background necessary for research in mathematical biology and scientific computation. The student will interface directly with the experimental collaborators involved in the project to learn the essential skill of communicating ideas across disciplines."

Proper communication between cells relies upon precise control and coordination of extracellular and intracellular signaling, as well as the induced cellular responses such as cell morphogenesis. This project is to study cell-to-cell communication through yeast mating system using mathematical modeling and will be conducted in close collaboration with experimentalists. The project will develop the models and the computational framework for a multi-cell environment that includes complex extracellular and intracellular signaling networks and the cell morphological changes. Numerical methods will be developed to meet the computational modeling challenges. <br/><br/>Cells interact with their environment or with other cells through sensing and making responses such as cell movement and cell shape change. These processes require precise coordination of intricate cellular networks and the resulting responses. This project will use mathematical modeling and computation to examine the interaction between cells and the underlying networks. The models and computational framework developed in this research can be applied to other systems, such as neural and immune systems, in which cell-to-cell communication is central to their function.

U.S. researchers and students will participate in ten workshops and three summer schools.  The first workshop will be held at the Centre de recherches mathmatiques in Montral in February 2013 and is entitled ""Models and Methods in Ecology and Epidemiology.""  Mathematical models have a long tradition in exploring dynamical aspects of ecology and epidemiology on a number of different temporal and spatial scales. While ecological and epidemiological applications are often studied separately for historical reasons, both fields are faced with similar challenges of model complexity, model-data fitting and accurate predictions. Recently, advances in data collection (e.g. GIS), availability of large-scale simulation tools (e.g. agent-based modeling), development of statistical tools to fit mechanistic models, and new mathematical techniques (e.g. multiscale methods) have highlighted the many commonalities between ecological and epidemiological models. Successful applications of these models to pressing issues in population and ecosystem health combine techniques and insights from all fields. <br/><br/>The main goal of the pan-Canadian thematic year on Models and Methods in Ecology, Epidemiology and Public Health is to tackle pressing and emerging challenges in population and ecosystem health, to stimulate cross-disciplinary research between all the disciplines involved and to foster tighter links between the research community, government agencies and policy makers, and to train a new generation of researchers in this priority research area. The wide range of topics includes questions of how global change will impact vector-borne diseases and biodiversity, how aquatic ecosystems can be managed sustainably, or how modeling and surveillance can be integrated for public health decision-making. All of these questions are very active areas of research around the world; and the Canadian mathematics community plays a leadership role. The purpose of this pan-Canadian program is to bring together the international community of researchers who work on these topics in a series of workshops and to foster exchange between the different disciplines involved, to discuss perspectives and directions for future advances in the field, including new models and methods. In addition, several summer schools are aimed to train the next generation of researchers in the most recent tools and techniques and enable them to build novel tools in the future in these research areas. The funds from this grant will allow promising junior researchers from a diverse set of backgrounds, including early career professors, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, from the United States to participate in the workshops and summer schools of this program.  Understanding the mechanisms and effects of ecosystem function, ecosystem service, disease transmission and disease spread rests on mathematical models on different spatio-temporal scales. Effective and efficient management and policy decisions are based on these insights. Advancing research into the required tools, techniques and applications will provide us with better understanding and guidance for policy makers and management."
