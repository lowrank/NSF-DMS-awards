Further, microbes are important in many medical contexts, where they are found in richly interacting communities. Microbial communities have, as well, always been important in industry,  generally as nuisances, but more recently also for exploitation. Yet, despite their ubiquity, ecology and function of microbial communities and their interaction with their surroundings is poorly understood in most circumstances. The ""big"" question that motivates this project is the following: To what extent can the function of a microbial community of a given environment be characterized from knowing the physical and chemical profile of that environment?  Recent increase in power and coincident decrease in cost of molecular methods has revolutionized the potential to experimentally identify and characterize community inhabitants and activity. At the same time, development of  sophisticated microprobe and imaging technology has enabled resolution, down to the microscale, of the chemical environment in which microbial communities function. What lags is the capability to extract community function from that data. Whatever the form this capability ultimately takes, it will by necessity require and incorporate knowledge of the local physical and chemical environment -- microbial communities are specialists in exploiting their local physics and chemistry -- and this project develops the mathematical tools needed to do so. The assembled research team is committed to emphasizing the importance of chemical and physical concepts in the training of math biologists, and has already successfully cross-trained graduate students from different disciplines. This project continues this emphasis and aims to extend this training to undergraduate students, particularly from underrepresented groups. The team aims  (i) to bridge the training gap between mathematical biology and microbial ecology, and (ii) to focus attention of mathematical biologists on in situ physio-chemical and biological realities. Through this project the impact of microbial communities on biodeterioration of stone  cultural heritage materials is being addressed in an integrated way, from model to lab to the field to professional practice. This work has an important impact on conservation  efforts and will establish a beginning basis for the scientific management of stone biodeterioration that can be disseminated internationally and facilitate collaboration among heritage managers. <br/><br/>The investigators study an important microbial community type, namely  biofilms driven by photosynthesis, particularly as subaerial biofilms (subaerial biofilms are generally non-submerged microbial communities, living together in close proximity in self-secreted polymeric matrices and exposed to air) on carbonate stones. The context of the project is cultural environments, specifically microorganisms that attach to stone and grow as biofilms. These communities can discolor and degrade cultural monuments, but, at the same time, can offer useful insights into many microbial communities by providing platforms for developing and testing hypotheses of microbial ecology. Biofilms inhabiting outdoor stonework have advantages in this respect. They contain the essential biocomplexity for survival in open, uncontrolled environments, but, because of the relatively stringent conditions typical of exposed stone, still have amenable ecologies, and also are known to demonstrate mutually beneficial associations with cooperating photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic organisms. Particularly important, their simplicity and accessibility make them well suited for use as subjects for development of prototype mathematical methodology needed for connecting omics-based cell-level metabolic models to physics-based community-level function models. The linkage of community data to community model is an essential piece, and one for which mathematics is central, in the broad program of transforming omics into useable theory of microbial communities which, in turn, is central to the program of modern microbiology. This project aims to construct multiscale population models capable of accepting omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics) and physical (e.g., temperature, light intensity) data  at the microscale, and to develop mathematical methods for bridging the gap between community level omics and community level population models. The core target are the modes of regulation among microbial community members and how they are effected by the physical environment."

The primary goal of the conference is to provide a venue for researchers to share recent advances in applications of computational algebra and combinatorics to biology.  The conference will consist of talks by invited speakers, contributed talk,s and a poster session.  This grant helps to defray the expenses of the invited speakers and also to provide transportation and lodging for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other junior researchers attending the conference.<br/><br/>The previous two decades have witnessed the emergence and acceleration of a new paradigm in mathematical biology, which employs advanced methods in computational algebra and discrete mathematics toward modeling biological systems. In molecular biology in particular, rich libraries of gene regulation, protein-protein interactions and high-throughput gene expression profiling enable the construction of increasingly granular discrete models, which require the development and analysis of new algebraic and combinatorial techniques.  Whereas traditional methods in mathematical biology benefit from a robust infrastructure of journals, organizations, and conferences, such infrastructure for algebraic and combinatorial biology is still taking shape.  A core objective of this conference is to consolidate the ACSB as a national forum for the presentation, discussion, and integration of current work in the field.  ACSB 2015 will focus on diverse aspects of modeling of molecular networks, in particular gene regulatory networks, with an emphasis on discrete modeling approaches, including stochastic aspects of networks.  In addition to models of specific molecular networks, it will explore questions such as the relationship between network structure and their dynamics and design principles of molecular networks.  Both mathematical and biological aspects of molecular network modeling will be discussed, and the conference will open with talks on both.<br/><br/>Conference web site:  http://acsb2015.cqm.uchc.edu/"

There is considerable data available on the effects of pathogens within a single host individual and the resulting responses of the host immune system, and also for the distribution of the infectious diseases within host populations (for example, the total number of infections and the rates of new infections).  Pathogen abundance within a host can rise after infection, and then wane to the point of extinction because of host immune responses.  This project will create mathematical models that link such within-host pathogen dynamics to the spread of pathogens between hosts.  These models will make use of both sources of data, leading to a better understanding of these infectious diseases and therefore possible strategies for their control.  For example, these types of models have shown that HIV medications decrease HIV levels within patients, increasing patient lifespan, which can perversely result in more HIV cases in the population as a whole.  Sufficiently wide-spread application of these medications, however, may decrease the number of cases.  Using multi-scale data validates these models and allows their application to make predictions in cases where population data is scant.  The models that will be developed can be used to assess how the pathogen load within a host affects the number of disease cases and the effect of control measures such as medications and vaccination on the number of cases.  Most infectious diseases that still to this day create significant death, particularly among humans, are caused by pathogens that can evolve very quickly; hosts can also evolve in response to these pathogens.  Models that link within-host and between-host data are particularly adept for studying host and pathogen evolution, adding a new dimension to our understanding of how to control diseases with pathogens that can change rapidly, such as malaria, hepatitis C, and influenza.<br/><br/>The central research objectives of this project are: (1) Develop, analyze and simulate multi-scale mathematical models that link immunology, epidemiology and ecology in vector-borne diseases or diseases involving ecologically interacting species, and that are well grounded in disease epidemiology, ecology and immunology. (2) Develop mathematical techniques to analyze multi-scale models and study disease evolution using these models. Develop numerical techniques to fit such models to data, thus integrating immunological and epidemiological data. (3) Use immuno-epidemiological models to address important questions related to control and evolution of vector-borne diseases and diseases involving ecologically interacting species. In particular, two types of questions will be addressed: (a) How do within-host dynamics affect the population level reproduction number and disease prevalence and what consequences does that have for the control of infectious diseases? (b) How do pathogens and hosts evolve in their within-host interactions to enhance their population level performance?"

Specifically, we address the problem of integration and analysis of multiple sources of high dimensional biological data with network structure. It is a well documented fact that correlation between different molecular compartments is relatively low, while the information derived from a single compartment is often highly noisy or even incomplete. Hence, there is a need to develop advanced models and techniques for integrating multiple data sets from diverse Omics platforms, while taking explicitly into consideration the available information of interactions within and between compartments. Particular emphasis is placed on pathway analysis and enrichment due to their role in complex diseases onset and progression. The following directions will be pursued: (1) Development of network based methods that integrate data from multiple Omics platforms for pathway analysis and enrichment. (2) Development of fast computational algorithms for estimating large scale network based integrative models. Investigation of associated inference problems and study of properties of proposed estimators together with their robustness to the noise levels of the network information employed. (3) Introduction of novel hypergraph models for assessing differential activity of pathways that utilize different degrees of information about the structure and accuracy of the underlying network. (4) Development of a novel scheme based on perturbed P-values for detecting active members of pathways that would aid in biomarker discovery. (5) Implementation of the propose methodology into an easy to use software tool.<br/><br/>The proposed research program will have a three-pronged impact: methodological, scientific and educational. On the methodology front, the research based on this project will lead (a) to a developing a comprehensive framework for assessing differential activity of pathways based on different models that integrate data from multiple Omics platforms and utilize different degrees of information about the structure and accuracy of the underlying network, (b) a systematicunderstanding of the computational issues involved in large scale (generalized) mixed linear models;and (c) a novel scheme based on perturbed P-values for identifying active members of pathways that become potential targets for therapeutic drugs. The enhanced scientific understanding will provide tangible impact at the level of applications. A number of the proposed methods have already been used in the analysis of high dimensional genomic, proteomic and metabolomic data with emphasis on identifying active pathways (subnetworks) in different disease (primarily cancer) states. Further, a number of new experiments are in the design stage that would utilize some of the advanced models and techniques proposed in this project. Another key aspect of this proposal is the development of an easy to use by practitioners open source software, built within a domain independent workflow management system. This allows users to enhance the software by adding their own functionality and computational tools in an easy and transparent manner. The novel methodological procedures ensuing from this research agenda will be disseminated to the relevant scientific communities, both via inter-disciplinary interaction and collaboration and through presentations at conferences and specialized workshops. Finally, on the educational front, the material from the project will provide research topics for doctoral students working under the supervision of the PIs; it will therefore play an important role in the training of future quantitative scientists."

The ecological effects of dispersal in turn influence the fitness of individuals, and hence influence natural selection, which drives evolution.  Thus, the effects of dispersal can feed back to influence the attributes and behaviors of organisms, including those that affect dispersal and its consequences.  Such attributes and behaviors are known as traits. They include tendencies to seek resources, avoid predators, or migrate seasonally, which can be viewed as dispersal strategies, but they also include the ways that organisms use information about their environment to decide how to move or how they communicate such information with other members of their species.  This project will use mathematical models to gain insight into the connections between the structure and variability of the environment and the dispersal traits that can be expected to evolve and persist. Mathematical models are necessary to gain such insight because the effects of dispersal and the feedbacks involved in its evolution are too subtle and complex to capture with verbal descriptions.  In past research, the investigators have gained a good understanding of which fixed dispersal traits are most favorable in the context of a single population in an environment that varies in space but not in time.  One aspect of this project is to address similar issues in the context of environments that are also changing in time. Another is to study more deeply how dispersal influences species interactions, especially when it interacts with variations in timing of life history events.  Both of those research directions are motivated in part by ecological problems related to global change.  Other aspects of the project focus on understanding behavioral traits related to dispersal; some of those may be relevant to conservation/restoration efforts and to understanding the movement of disease vectors.  Some parts of the project will be conducted in collaboration with postdoctoral fellows and thus should contribute to enhancing the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>The dispersal of organisms affects their fitness by determining their spatial distribution and interactions with other populations, which then creates selective pressure on traits related to dispersal.  This leads to complex feedbacks between the effects and evolution of dispersal traits that can only be understood by using mathematical or computational models.  Traditional models of dispersal typically assume it is a fixed behavior, independent of environmental conditions, such as simple diffusion.  However, organisms seek resources, avoid enemies, and engage in behaviors such as migration that require the use and transmission of information.  These conditional dispersal behaviors are traits, which can be shaped by evolution and can be viewed as strategies from the viewpoint of adaptive dynamics.  In previous work, the investigators used pairwise invasibility analysis of various models, including reaction-advection-diffusion equations, discrete diffusion systems, and their nonlocal integro-differential analogues, to show that for a single unstructured population in a spatially varying but temporally constant environment the evolutionarily stable strategies are those that produce an ideal free distribution.  The research team will use similar methods to gain understanding of the evolution of dispersal traits in the more realistic contexts of populations in environments that vary in both space and time, populations that are structured by stage or internal state, and systems of interacting populations.  To do that, the investigators will use additional types of models including integro-difference models as well as those used before.  It is expected that the detailed conclusions in those cases will often be different from those for an unstructured population in a temporally constant environment.  Some numerical experiments may be needed to suggest what the conclusions should be.  Hybrid models that include both dispersal and phenology will also be studied, as well as models for organisms with multiple dispersal modes.  The first of those is relevant to understanding how phenology shifts caused by global change could interact with spatial effects.  For example, how are the effects of isolation in time similar to those of isolation in space, and how do they differ?  The second is relevant to understanding the movement patterns of various organisms, including female mosquitoes that switch between seeking blood meals and seeking oviposition sites.  More broadly, understanding dispersal traits is relevant to conservation and pest management and to predicting the effects of global change on natural and agricultural ecosystems."

While this question has been of central importance to neuroscience for decades, at this moment researchers are well positioned to make significant progress -- new recording devices and imaging techniques are revealing the activity and changes within the networks of the brain at unprecedented scale and resolution. Sound mathematical models are essential to keep up with the mounting avalanche of data. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical tools to assist with improving understanding how networks of neurons are shaped by experiences. Developing this theory is crucial for understanding learning, as well as associated disorders. The project will focus on how learning improves the brain's ability to make decisions and store memories. Graduate students and postdocs joining this project will be part of an established, interdisciplinary mathematics research community.

Understanding neural computation demands a description of how network dynamics co-evolves with network architecture. The research team will address this challenge by answering specific questions about the interplay between spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity, the attendant changes in network architectures, and the resulting neural computations. This project focuses on two main questions. First, what mathematical techniques can describe the co-evolution of network dynamics and network connectivity toward stable assemblies of neurons? To address this question this project will build a theory describing how global network structure evolves under the dynamics of biophysically realistic plasticity rules that operate on the scale of individual spikes and synapses. Analysis of these models requires novel multiscale and averaging methods. The resulting equations allow analysis of the stability of network architectures and their dependence on stimulus drive. With these results, the second question can be addressed: How does network plasticity create spatiotemporal dynamics that support the basic building blocks of neural computation? Models to understand how plasticity forms networks whose dynamics underlie specific operations on incoming stimuli will be developed to address this question. The mechanism by which long-term plasticity can reshape the connectivity of a network to encode a precise temporal sequence of events will also be investigated."

Although the symptoms of epilepsy have been observed for millennia, the brain processes that support human seizures remain poorly understood. This lack of understanding has a profound clinical impact; in one-third of patients with epilepsy, seizures are not adequately controlled. Animal studies provide powerful methods to uncover the potential mechanisms for epilepsy, yet how the results from these studies relate to human epilepsy remains unclear. Although some mechanisms of epilepsy may be consistent in animal models and humans, differences occur, and these differences are critical to understanding and treating human epilepsy. The PI's goal is to improve understanding of the mechanisms that drive human seizures and thereby advance therapeutic management of this disease. To do so, brain voltage recordings made directly from human patients will be analyzed. Motivated by these patient data, mathematical models will be developed that describe the activity of individual neurons and small populations of interacting neurons.  The mathematical models will then be used to study the biological mechanisms that support the different brain voltage rhythms that appear during seizure, and how these rhythms move across the surface of the brain.  Ultimately, these mathematical models will provide new insights into human epilepsy, and help identify novel approaches to improve patient care. The PI will also include integration of research data and methods into an undergraduate course in computational neuroscience, publish a textbook and online course in neuronal data analysis, and provide undergraduate and graduate research training in computational neuroscience, with a specific emphasis on clinical data and computational modeling.<br/><br/>The PI aims to improve understanding of the ionic and neuronal mechanisms that govern the brain's stereotyped spatiotemporal dynamics during human seizure. To do so, a computational modeling framework will be developed that incorporates individual neuron dynamics in cortical and subcortical structures and ion concentration dynamics in the extracellular space. Model behavior will be explored through simulation and dynamical systems techniques, and model features will be constrained to match microelectrode array recordings of seizures in human patients. The modeling framework will be used to test the hypothesized scenario that a class of cortical interneurons serve as the first line of defense against the outbreak of seizure, but eventually fails upon entering depolarization block. Concomitant with this failure, another circuit activates to the support large amplitude, spike-and-wave dynamics, which appear as traveling waves that sweep across the cortical surface.  Two main research goals are the focus of the project. First the modeling of human seizure data will provide new insights into the mechanisms of medically refractory epilepsy, and help identify biological targets for novel pharmacological approaches to improve patient care. Second, to understand brain function and dysfunction, a deeper knowledge of cortical and subcortical neuronal dynamics combined with ion concentration dynamics is required. In this project, the stereotyped dynamical state of seizure motivates models that implement these dynamics to examine principles that support spatiotemporal patterns in the human brain. Educationally the PI will develop new interdisciplinary training in computational neuroscience. This will be done through integration of research data, analysis methods and computational technology in the undergraduate classroom, publication of a textbook and development of an online course describing cases studies in neural data analysis, and directed graduate and undergraduate research in computational neuroscience."

Examples in humans include wound healing, tissue development, tumor growth, and some bioengineered diagnostic tools. Experiments have shown that molecules in cell-cell interfaces experience forces (squeezing, pulling) and that these forces influence cell behavior and cellular decision-making. One important example is offered by immune cells, which must attach to the surface of other cells in order to decipher information about disease. Their nanometer size and inaccessible geometry make cell-cell interfaces challenging to explore experimentally. The investigator will develop mathematical equations that predict forces on molecules at cell-cell interfaces, using immune cells as a prototype. Results will have direct implications for understanding immune function, impacting research on autoimmune disease and immunotherapy. Additionally, these mathematical models can be readily generalized to abstract, generic cell-cell interfaces, thereby highlighting the biophysical similarities between  biologically disparate systems to help understand the general principles of the cellular tactile sense. In coordination with his research goals, the investigator has an educational goal of using cell mechanics (i.e., forces in cells) as a venue to teach mathematics, biology and physics with tangible, accessible examples to audiences in K-12, undergraduate, graduate and general public education. Unlike cell biology based on biochemistry or genetics, many cell-mechanical phenomena have direct analogies with everyday life that are useful in establishing a three-way correspondence between cell phenomena, everyday intuition of mechanical forces, and their mathematical representation.<br/><br/>Of many ways in which cells interact, an increasingly recognized interaction is through the establishment of transient, dynamic cell-cell interfaces. The investigator will develop mathematical models of cell-cell interfaces to describe and predict mechanical forces and their influence on cell signaling. The dynamics at cell-cell interfaces involve an interplay between transport, mechanics and chemical kinetics, and play out over a range of length- and time-scales, necessitating a combination of mathematical techniques: Coupled systems of elliptic, parabolic and stochastic differential equations; computational fluid dynamics of fluid-structure interactions including thermal fluctuations in 3D; Brownian dynamics; and Bayesian statistics to leverage quantitative experimental data from the investigator's collaborators. Specific aims of the investigator through this research are to: (1) Understand how cells overcome and exploit the physical constraints to cell-cell contact, by developing a model that integrates motion of the intracellular and extracellular fluid, Brownian motion of molecules embedded in the cells' membranes, and active forces. (2) Explore the mechanism and evolutionary advantages of molecular clustering at interfaces to address the large class of molecules that aggregate into clusters containing tens to hundreds of molecules.  (3) develop, validate and use mesoscale models of large flexible biomolecules to decipher their mechanical properties and biological role. In mesoscale models, individual molecules are represented as combinations of rigid bodies such as rods, spheres and semi-flexible joints undergoing Langevin dynamics. The biological novelty lies in new hypotheses that will emerge from the models, including the hypothesis that within-cluster load sharing can allow for nontrivial kinetics, such as co-operativity, multi-stability and ultra-sensitivity - regulatory modules that have classically been assumed to arise from biochemical reaction networks. The mesoscale models will allow us to access timescales that all-atom molecular dynamics cannot, while capturing details that particle-based simulations miss. Students at all educational levels will gain exposure to contemporary work at the interface of mathematics, biology and physics."

Particularly when generating data is expensive or time consuming, as it is often the case with clinical trials and biomolecular experiments, the problem of identifying information-rich data becomes crucial for creating models that can reliably predict the outcome of future experiments. Few results have been published on the amount of necessary data, and currently there are no methods for generating specific data sets which would unambiguously identify a predictive model. This research project addresses fundamental mathematical and computational questions in data selection.  The theoretical results will advance the fields of design of experiments and network inference through the determination of criteria for selecting data sets to uniquely identify models. The algorithms under development will serve as a guide for experimentalists in determining the data that are needed to identify the structure of a network of interest. Such knowledge has the potential to drastically reduce wasted resources that arise from too much data with too little information. Graduate students will participate at the appropriate level in each component of the project. Such an experience will provide possible topics for M.S. or Ph.D. dissertations and will very likely inspire career-long involvement of the participants in the STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>As a first step towards developing a complete theory, the PIs will focus on models described by finite-valued nonlinear polynomial functions. Finite-state multivariate polynomial functions have successfully been used to model complex networks from discretized data; however, few results have been published on the amount of data necessary for such models, with the majority applying to Boolean models only. The PIs will address the issue of the minimality and specificity of data to uniquely identify discrete polynomial models by developing the appropriate theory, implementing the theoretical results as algorithms, and applying the algorithms to important physical systems. The proposed work will also increase the utility of polynomial dynamical systems as models of complex networks by establishing the minimal amount of the data for unique model identification."

There is considerable data available on the effects of pathogens within a single host individual and the resulting responses of the host immune system, and also for the distribution of the infectious diseases within host populations (for example, the total number of infections and the rates of new infections).  Pathogen abundance within a host can rise after infection, and then wane to the point of extinction because of host immune responses.  This project will create mathematical models that link such within-host pathogen dynamics to the spread of pathogens between hosts.  These models will make use of both sources of data, leading to a better understanding of these infectious diseases and therefore possible strategies for their control.  For example, these types of models have shown that HIV medications decrease HIV levels within patients, increasing patient lifespan, which can perversely result in more HIV cases in the population as a whole.  Sufficiently wide-spread application of these medications, however, may decrease the number of cases.  Using multi-scale data validates these models and allows their application to make predictions in cases where population data is scant.  The models that will be developed can be used to assess how the pathogen load within a host affects the number of disease cases and the effect of control measures such as medications and vaccination on the number of cases.  Most infectious diseases that still to this day create significant death, particularly among humans, are caused by pathogens that can evolve very quickly; hosts can also evolve in response to these pathogens.  Models that link within-host and between-host data are particularly adept for studying host and pathogen evolution, adding a new dimension to our understanding of how to control diseases with pathogens that can change rapidly, such as malaria, hepatitis C, and influenza.<br/><br/>The central research objectives of this project are: (1) Develop, analyze and simulate multi-scale mathematical models that link immunology, epidemiology and ecology in vector-borne diseases or diseases involving ecologically interacting species, and that are well grounded in disease epidemiology, ecology and immunology. (2) Develop mathematical techniques to analyze multi-scale models and study disease evolution using these models. Develop numerical techniques to fit such models to data, thus integrating immunological and epidemiological data. (3) Use immuno-epidemiological models to address important questions related to control and evolution of vector-borne diseases and diseases involving ecologically interacting species. In particular, two types of questions will be addressed: (a) How do within-host dynamics affect the population level reproduction number and disease prevalence and what consequences does that have for the control of infectious diseases? (b) How do pathogens and hosts evolve in their within-host interactions to enhance their population level performance?"

How do firing patterns of neurons represent our sensory experiences?  The advent of technologies that facilitate simultaneous recordings of large populations of neurons present new opportunities to answer these classical questions of neuroscience.  There are mathematical models that are frequently used in network simulations and data analyses that can be employed, but whose mathematical properties are still poorly understood.  To guide these efforts, a better understanding of theoretical models of recurrent networks and population codes is essential.  This research will focus on two such examples: threshold-linear networks and combinatorial neural codes.  The goal is to produce major advances in the mathematical theory of these models, with an eye towards neuroscience applications.  Part of the research will involve the analyses of neural activity in the cortex and hippocampus, in collaboration with experimentalists.  Despite the focus on neuroscience, the mathematical results have the potential to be sufficiently general so as to be useful in a variety of broader contexts in the biological and social sciences.<br/><br/>A threshold-linear network is a common firing rate model for a recurrent network, with a threshold nonlinearity. These networks generically exhibit multiple stable fixed points, and multistability makes them attractive as models for memory storage and retrieval.  Preliminary results have shown that the equilibria possess a rich combinatorial structure, and can be analyzed using ideas from classical distance geometry.  The first project will build on this understanding in order to develop a more complete picture of the structure of fixed points and higher-dimensional attractors of these networks.  A combinatorial neural code is a collection of binary patterns for a population of neurons.  The second project will develop an algebraic classification of combinatorial codes, using the recently developed framework of the neural ring.  The neural ring encodes information about a neural code in a manner that makes properties such as receptive field organization most transparent.  The resulting methods will be tested and refined using electrophysiological recordings of place cells in the hippocampus.  This research will also generate new and interesting problems at the interface of neuroscience with applied algebra, combinatorics, and geometry."

This is a disorder of the brain that is the basis of migraine aura and many other diseases of the brain including stroke and epilepsy. In this disorder the ionic environment of the brain is completely disrupted and the nerve cells turn silent, with a  disturbance that spreads at speeds of two to five millimeters per minute across the brain. When this happens in the visual cortex, the brain area that processes visual information, the patient will perceive an aura, a temporary visual defect that slowly travels over the field of view. Migraine sufferers often perceive an aura (migraine aura) prior to a migraine attack. Better understanding the mechanisms of cortical spreading depression  will thus help in management of migraine headache and many other pathological brain conditions. This research collaboration will train graduate students who will work on various aspects of the project. Summer schools will be held at Florida International University, which is a minority serving institution. Thus this project, accompanied with existing institutional efforts, has the potential to  further the goal of increasing minority representation in the sciences. Further, this collaborative effort brings together experimentalists and theorists of diverse interests and strength, and  therefore provides students with an ideal opportunity for professional growth.<br/><br/>Cortical spreading depression is a massive redistribution of ionic concentrations in the brain that results in a localized temporary loss of neuronal function. This disturbance spreads through the brain at speeds of two to five millimeters per minute and is the physiological substrate of migraine aura. Although cortical spreading depression was first described over seventy years ago, the physiological mechanisms leading to the disturbance remains elusive, most likely due to the fact that it involves many biophysical processes. In this project, a comprehensive mathematical model and computational apparatus to simulate the phenomena will be constructed and validated with experimental data obtained at high spatial resolution. An important aspect of the mathematical model is that it takes into account ionic electro-diffusion, an effect that has not been properly considered in previous studies, and may also be relevant for illucidating mechanisms in many other neurophysiological settings. In particular, the effects of electro-diffusion on extracellular recordings, electroencephalography and magneto-encephalography signals will be studied, thereby improving analysis of these measurement modalities. Overall this research may have an impact in many other brain pathologies which are linked to these underlying biophysical processes."

This study will help answer important biological questions such as 1) what patch level effects can be expected from density dependent dispersal, specifically of positive, negative or U-shaped density dependent dispersal, 2) does density dependent dispersal moderate or even exacerbate the effects of habitat fragmentation, Allee effects, interspecific competition, or predation on local or regional stability/persistence of a population, and 3) how should empirical studies be constructed to evaluate the presence and consequences of density dependent dispersal in light of the predictions of these theoretical models. A more comprehensive understanding of the patch and landscape level consequences of density dependent dispersal in the presence of such complicating factors as predation, interspecific competition, and habitat fragmentation is important by itself, but may also lead to the development of better population management strategies, especially in an environment where populations face diverse ecological challenges due to predation, habitat fragmentation, and global climate change. This project is expected to be significant by providing much-needed information in population ecology on the consequences of conditional dispersal (i.e., as a function of the density of conspecifics, interspecific competitors, and predators) to population dynamics of species in fragmented landscapes. The research is novel because, to date, theoretical and empirical studies in fragmented systems have ignored other forms of density dependent dispersal (negative or U-shaped) that are commonly found in nature. Results from this project will answer several key ecological questions as to whether the presence of negative or U-shaped density dependent dispersal helps to moderate potentially detrimental factors as habitat fragmentation or worse, exacerbate their effects. The project will also provide a significant contribution towards the analysis of elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions, as new mathematical tools will be developed to better understand the dynamics of these population models. Further, development of a true landscape level modeling framework built on reaction diffusion equations will serve as a foundation for enhanced study of landscape dynamics in theoretical models. The investigators plan to disseminate the results of this project to both the ecological and mathematical communities through various media including: the ArXiv, peer-reviewed mathematics, mathematical biology, and ecology journals, and in talks at mathematical biology and ecological conferences."

Further, microbes are important in many medical contexts, where they are found in richly interacting communities. Microbial communities have, as well, always been important in industry,  generally as nuisances, but more recently also for exploitation. Yet, despite their ubiquity, ecology and function of microbial communities and their interaction with their surroundings is poorly understood in most circumstances. The ""big"" question that motivates this project is the following: To what extent can the function of a microbial community of a given environment be characterized from knowing the physical and chemical profile of that environment?  Recent increase in power and coincident decrease in cost of molecular methods has revolutionized the potential to experimentally identify and characterize community inhabitants and activity. At the same time, development of  sophisticated microprobe and imaging technology has enabled resolution, down to the microscale, of the chemical environment in which microbial communities function. What lags is the capability to extract community function from that data. Whatever the form this capability ultimately takes, it will by necessity require and incorporate knowledge of the local physical and chemical environment -- microbial communities are specialists in exploiting their local physics and chemistry -- and this project develops the mathematical tools needed to do so. The assembled research team is committed to emphasizing the importance of chemical and physical concepts in the training of math biologists, and has already successfully cross-trained graduate students from different disciplines. This project continues this emphasis and aims to extend this training to undergraduate students, particularly from underrepresented groups. The team aims  (i) to bridge the training gap between mathematical biology and microbial ecology, and (ii) to focus attention of mathematical biologists on in situ physio-chemical and biological realities. Through this project the impact of microbial communities on biodeterioration of stone  cultural heritage materials is being addressed in an integrated way, from model to lab to the field to professional practice. This work has an important impact on conservation  efforts and will establish a beginning basis for the scientific management of stone biodeterioration that can be disseminated internationally and facilitate collaboration among heritage managers. <br/><br/>The investigators study an important microbial community type, namely  biofilms driven by photosynthesis, particularly as subaerial biofilms (subaerial biofilms are generally non-submerged microbial communities, living together in close proximity in self-secreted polymeric matrices and exposed to air) on carbonate stones. The context of the project is cultural environments, specifically microorganisms that attach to stone and grow as biofilms. These communities can discolor and degrade cultural monuments, but, at the same time, can offer useful insights into many microbial communities by providing platforms for developing and testing hypotheses of microbial ecology. Biofilms inhabiting outdoor stonework have advantages in this respect. They contain the essential biocomplexity for survival in open, uncontrolled environments, but, because of the relatively stringent conditions typical of exposed stone, still have amenable ecologies, and also are known to demonstrate mutually beneficial associations with cooperating photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic organisms. Particularly important, their simplicity and accessibility make them well suited for use as subjects for development of prototype mathematical methodology needed for connecting omics-based cell-level metabolic models to physics-based community-level function models. The linkage of community data to community model is an essential piece, and one for which mathematics is central, in the broad program of transforming omics into useable theory of microbial communities which, in turn, is central to the program of modern microbiology. This project aims to construct multiscale population models capable of accepting omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics) and physical (e.g., temperature, light intensity) data  at the microscale, and to develop mathematical methods for bridging the gap between community level omics and community level population models. The core target are the modes of regulation among microbial community members and how they are effected by the physical environment."

Although classical biofluids problems such as low Reynolds number locomotion have been studied theoretically for decades, the studies were limited to problems that were analytically tractable.  These problems can now be probed with greater depth and biological relevance using computational methods.  The power of personal computing combined with development of new algorithms has led to a revival of research in biofluids. Problems in physiology relating to the function of heart valves, the mechanics of blood clotting, and the mechanics of motile cells are also now being investigated using novel applied mathematical techniques and computational models. Integrative research on these biological and physiological processes has the potential to lead to medical advances such as the prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer metastasis.<br/><br/>The applied mathematics community has played a central role in the resurgence of biofluids by developing theories, algorithms, and models aimed at answering fundamental biological and physical questions.

Included among these are hantaviruses, which pose a significant threat to public health worldwide and are classified as emerging infectious diseases. Hantaviruses are transmitted to humans through contact with infected rodent excrement. Although hantaviruses cause little morbidity or mortality in their rodent reservoir, they establish a persistent infection that spills over into sympatric or human hosts. Spillover infection in nonreservoir rodents results in an asymptomatic acute infection without any apparent proinflammatory response or disease, whereas spillover in humans results in severe pathology (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) with mortality reaching 40-50%. Very little is known regarding the differences in the innate/adaptive immune response to hantavirus infection that characterize these three distinct responses: persistence, viral clearance, or severe pathology. The primary goals of this research are  to formulate and to test new mathematical models based on carefully designed in vitro experiments for hantavirus infection and to identify key immune components at crucial time points that differentiate between natural versus nonnatural reservoirs (rodents and humans). This knowledge is essential for designing interventions and therapeutics for treatment of hantaviruses and other similar zoonotic viruses for which treatment is not currently available.<br/><br/>The in vitro experiments are designed to clearly distinguish the pathways during hantavirus infection in natural reservoir (rodents) versus spillover into nonreservoir hosts (rodents and humans). Three different hantaviruses, endemic in North America, will be used to infect endothelial and immune cells: Sin Nombre virus,  Black Creek Canal virus, and  Prospect Hill virus in two different types of host cells, deer mice and human. Dependent on the combination of host and hantaviral species, three different outcomes can be observed in either reservoir or nonreservoir hosts: (i) persistence of infection with no disease, (ii) acute infection with viral clearance, and  (iii) severe pathology and disease. In the lungs, endothelial cells and macrophages are the primary target cells of hantavirus. Based on the experimental outcomes, deterministic and stochastic mathematical models will be formulated and statistically validated for the dynamics of these and other cells important in the early phase of the immune response. Methods from ordinary and stochastic differential equations, Markov chains and branching processes will be used to model the virus-cell-immune dynamics that includes  activation of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Mathematical and statistical methods will be developed to identify thresholds that determine specific  immunological pathways. In the broader context, this research will have educational and scientific impacts through cross-disciplinary training of students and a postdoc in mathematics and biology, through outreach and professional activities, and through development of new mathematical models and statistical methods. The mathematical models, methods, and data will be shared with other scientific groups to investigate questions and hypotheses regarding other zoonotic viruses important to public health such as avian influenza, Hendra, Ebola, and SARS Coronavirus."

In order to aid in the treatment of reduced sperm motility, it is important to understand interactions of the sperm flagellum with different regions of the reproductive tract. In particular, fluid flow helps bring the egg to the uterus (in the opposite direction of sperm progression). Recent experiments have shown that a large percentage of sperm exhibit positive rheotaxis, the ability to reorient and swim against a background flow. Additionally, sperm will bind and unbind to the oviductal wall and the role of a background flow on sperm detachment is not known. The main scientific goals of this project include further analyzing existing experimental data (through image processing techniques) and developing new computational models to understand the clinical importance of migration through the female reproductive tract and sperm binding and detachment from walls in a background flow. Several new computational modeling frameworks will be developed to allow simulations of sperm in the presence of a background flow and a wall. The PI will provide interdisciplinary training for several students (undergraduate and graduate) as well as one postdoc in the areas of computational biofluids, image processing of experimental movies, and model development. In addition, the PI will work to develop image processing and modeling modules to be used in area High Schools and at summer programs for High School students at WPI. <br/><br/>The sperm flagellum is an elastic structure that propagates waves of bending along its length to propel itself through the female reproductive tract. Understanding the behavior of the interaction between sperm, dynamic elastic structures, and their surrounding fluid will shed light onto the biophysics of their 3-dimensional motion and will help determine the clinical importance of migration through the female reproductive tract in a background flow.  Models will be able to delineate the importance of factors such as sperm rolling, types of flagellar waveforms, biochemistry, and fluid viscosity for forward progression of the sperm.  In this project, the PI will model the sperm flagellum as a Kirchhoff rod that is able to bend and twist.  The rod is able to achieve both planar and nonplanar waveforms and the rotation of the rod can be captured via an orthonormal triad associated with each material point along the centerline of the flagellum. Through this work the PI will focus on the following objectives: (1) Understand the types of emergent waveforms and trajectories of sperm in a background flow at different viscosities; (2) Determine if rolling is due to calcium mediated changes in flagellar waveforms, background flow, wall interactions, or hydrodynamic interactions with other sperm; (3) Investigate the role of background fluid flow on attachment/detachment of sperm to walls; (4) Extend current numerical methods. The PI's research will lead to the development of two new numerical methods to study interactions near a wall and increase accuracy of force calculations through parametric representations of the structure.  These newly developed methods can also be used for other slender elastic structures such as cilia and bacterial flagella."

A more comprehensive understanding of the patch and landscape level consequences of density dependent dispersal in the presence of such complicating factors as predation, interspecific competition, and habitat fragmentation is important by itself, but may also lead to the development of better population management strategies, especially in an environment where populations face diverse ecological challenges due to predation, habitat fragmentation, and global climate change. This project is expected to be significant by providing much-needed information in population ecology on the consequences of conditional dispersal (i.e., as a function of the density of conspecifics, interspecific competitors, and predators) to population dynamics of species in fragmented landscapes. The research is novel because, to date, theoretical and empirical studies in fragmented systems have ignored other forms of density dependent dispersal (negative or U-shaped) that are commonly found in nature. Results from this project will answer several key ecological questions as to whether the presence of negative or U-shaped density dependent dispersal helps to moderate potentially detrimental factors as habitat fragmentation or worse, exacerbate their effects. The project will also provide a significant contribution towards the analysis of elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions, as new mathematical tools will be developed to better understand the dynamics of these population models. Further, development of a true landscape level modeling framework built on reaction diffusion equations will serve as a foundation for enhanced study of landscape dynamics in theoretical models.

Multistationarity refers to the capacity of a system to operate at alternative steady-states, and is observed experimentally as irreversible switch-like behavior; oscillatons are periodic variations in the  concentration of interacting elements (genes, metabolites, enzymes, etc).  The interplay of multistationary and oscillatory behavior underlies crucial physiological processes: cellular division, differentiation and apoptosis, cellular signaling, enzyme regulation, circadian rhythms, and membrane potential activity in neurons and heart cells are only a few examples.  Many diseases involve disturbances of these processes as a result of deregulation of multistationary and oscillatory behaviors in specific gene networks or biological pathways.  A better understanding of the two behaviors may lead to developments in the study of such diseases.  In this project, the investigator will create mathematical tools and software that will allow biochemical and biomedical scientists to analyze dynamical features of relevant biological systems. <br/><br/>The emergence of multistationarity and oscillation is intimately linked to the existence of feedbacks and to other subtle features of the structure (i.e. wiring diagram) in the underlying reaction network of interacting elements.  Design principles associated to multistationarity and oscillations have long been proposed and refined over the years, but there is not yet a complete picture of the relationship between structure on one hand and multistationary or oscillatory behavior on the other.  In this project, the investigator develops new mathematical theory and expand existing results to strengthen our understanding of this connection.  In particular, algorithms will be developed to identify key structural properties of biochemical reaction networks that give rise to multistationarity and oscillation.  These developments will be implemented in user friendly, open source software, to assist and complement theoretical and experimental work in biochemical and biomedical fields.  For example, in a joint effort with experimental collaborators, the investigator will analyze the ERBB network of receptor tyrosine kinases whose multistable behavior is involved in early events in cancer onset.  This work also opens up exciting possibilities in bioengineering for the design of reaction networks with prescribed properties, relevant to research in cellular differentiation and with applications to tissue engineering and drug development."

In recent years, systems biology has emerged as a discipline to examine biological complexity from the point-of-view of integrated systems rather than separate components (the reductionists? point-of-view). A systems approach may help to resolve many fundamental issues in the life sciences that relate to systems-level interactions rather than individual biomolecular species. To achieve a full systems-level description, many new analytical techniques and theories need to be developed, in addition to new experimental advances. One major challenge concerns computational modeling of biological dynamics by differential equations. Due to the complexity of any particular biochemical control system, a large number of variables and parameters are needed to describe its dynamics. To have the desired predictive power, the values of these parameters need to be determined with sufficient precision, but for most systems the requisite experimental data are not available. This is a general problem in many areas of science, including physics and chemistry, where the powerful Mori-Zwanzig projection method is widely used for studying Hamiltonian dynamics. In this method, the complex dynamical system is first separated into primary and secondary subsystems.  Through systematic information contraction, one can focus on the primary system, which contains the variables of primary interest (in particular, experimentally resolvable variables). The secondary subsystem is not treated explicitly, but its effect on the primary system is properly accounted for mathematically. In this proposal, the researchers will develop a general formalism and numerical algorithms for non-Hamiltonian systems without detailed balance, with a focus on cellular regulatory networks. The method will be especially useful in three cases: 1) where a coarse-grained model is desirable, or available data prevents a more detailed model; 2) where the network under study is embedded in a larger network; and 3) where one wants to perform multi-scale modeling. <br/><br/>The proposed methods will provide a powerful tool for systems biologists to approach the ultimate goals of understanding complex biological processes and of  improving human health. One encounters similar situations, of dealing with a complex system with incomplete information, in many other research areas, for example: financial transactions, the power supply network, and the spread and evolution of viruses during an epidemic or a bioterrorist attack."

Experiences and memories leave their imprints on connections between neurons. Understanding this process is fundamental to understanding how the brain works. While this question has been of central importance to neuroscience for decades, at this moment researchers are well positioned to make significant progress -- new recording devices and imaging techniques are revealing the activity and changes within the networks of the brain at unprecedented scale and resolution. Sound mathematical models are essential to keep up with the mounting avalanche of data. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical tools to assist with improving understanding how networks of neurons are shaped by experiences. Developing this theory is crucial for understanding learning, as well as associated disorders. The project will focus on how learning improves the brain's ability to make decisions and store memories. Graduate students and postdocs joining this project will be part of an established, interdisciplinary mathematics research community. Trainees will gain a wide perspective of mathematical neuroscience through integrated research at three institutions, including extensive visits among them. <br/><br/>This research project builds on earlier results of this team to address a central challenge in the mathematical analysis of biophysically realistic neuronal networks: How brain activity changes brain structure over time. Understanding neural computation demands a description of how network dynamics co-evolves with network architecture. The research team will address this challenge by answering specific questions about the interplay between spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity, the attendant changes in network architectures, and the resulting neural computations. This project focuses on two main questions. First, what mathematical techniques can describe the co-evolution of network dynamics and network connectivity toward stable assemblies of neurons? To address this question this project will build a theory describing how global network structure evolves under the dynamics of biophysically realistic plasticity rules that operate on the scale of individual spikes and synapses. Analysis of these models requires novel multiscale and averaging methods. The resulting equations allow analysis of the stability of network architectures and their dependence on stimulus drive. With these results, the second question can be addressed: How does network plasticity create spatiotemporal dynamics that support the basic building blocks of neural computation? Models to understand how plasticity forms networks whose dynamics underlie specific operations on incoming stimuli will be developed to address this question. The mechanism by which long-term plasticity can reshape the connectivity of a network to encode a precise temporal sequence of events will also be investigated."

Surprisingly, there exists no standardized way to measure and compare infectivities across viral strains and under different experimental conditions.  This research will develop the quantitative framework needed and quantify existing experimental measurements of infectivity.  Most importantly, the models and analysis tool will allow quantitative comparison of existing infectivity data.  Such comparisons will facilitate the development of antivirals that block viral entry, or complex antibodies that neutralize virus particles.  The research is independent of the particular virus under consideration and may be feasibly extended to bacterial pathogens.<br/><br/>The first component of the research will be to model, under typical experimental conditions, the physical process of viral entry into cells.  Specifically, the investigators aim to understand the effects of (i) protocols such as centrifugation that bring virus particles close to their target cells, (ii) the reporter system used to count the number of cells infected, and (iii) the different parameters, such as temperature, duration of exposure, and antiviral concentrations under which the assays were performed.  A model for how these variables affect the measured infectivities will allow different experiments, performed in different laboratories under different conditions, to be compared with each other.  The second component of the proposed research involves implementing the models for viral entry into a web-based data analysis tool that will be constructed.  It is anticipated that this tool will aid virologists in their interpretation of large scale infectivity data in terms of biological and mechanistic attributes of the viruses."

This rhythmicity becomes enhanced in disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), where pathological activity patterns include pronounced oscillations within certain frequency bands, increased synchrony, and phasic bursting.  These patterns of amplified rhythmicity are thought to compromise functionality of basal ganglia networks and to contribute to motor impairments.  The overarching goal of this work is to understand how cellular and synaptic changes that occur in PD render neural circuits in the basal ganglia more susceptible to rhythmic activity in disease.  Specifically, this research will focus on an understudied neural circuit that is well positioned to influence rhythmicity throughout the basal ganglia and will help to identify potential cellular targets to disrupt pathological network activity in disease.  A combination of in vivo and in vitro physiological approaches together with computational model development, simulation, and analysis will be used to identify biological features of this circuit that can generate and maintain rhythmicity and to explain how this network contributes to runaway rhythmicity in PD. <br/><br/>The external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) is a central nucleus within the basal ganglia that has been strongly implicated in the onset and maintenance of rhythmic activity.  Under normal conditions, neurons in the GPe fire tonically and independently, at rates of 10-80 Hz; after dopamine depletion, GPe neurons become highly synchronized and fire in rhythmic bursts.  The GPe interacts with other basal ganglia nuclei through multiple circuits, one of which, a pallidostriatal circuit linking GPe with the striatum, has only recently been identified as a natural contributor to basal ganglia rhythmicity.  A major goal of this work is the identification of features within the pallidostriatal circuit that generate and maintain rhythmicity and may underlie runaway rhythmicity in pathological conditions.  Achievement of this aim will help in the location of targets that can be modulated to disrupt the pathological amplification or propagation of basal ganglia rhythmicity.  These results will be achieved through an approach that integrates in vivo and in vitro physiological experiments with computational model development, simulation, and analysis."

Recently, this question has been brought to the forefront by climate change and landscape conversion.  Due to the processes of climate change, habitat regions suitable for population growth of many species have been shifting geographically.  Climatically induced shifts may interface with population demographic processes in complex ways, setting the stage for impacts on species population growth and spread, long-term dynamics and interactions between species.  This project aims to produce new frameworks for the analysis of persistence and spreading speeds of species in a shifting habitat.  It addresses the question of how ecosystems are being affected by climate change and how ecosystems might respond in the future.  It contributes to the growing body of information identifying species at a high risk for extinction and predicting the spread of invasive species under ongoing climate change.  The outcomes of the project help improve strategies for coping with challenges of natural resource management.  This project further stimulates interdisciplinary collaboration between mathematicians and biologists to address issues beyond the reach of single disciplines.  In addition, it contributes to human resources development, focusing on training and skill development of graduate students, and providing them with experience in interdisciplinary interaction and exploration. <br/> <br/>In this project, the investigator formulates and analyzes spatial population models that describe species growth, interactions, and dispersal in shifting habitats.  The goal is to understand and accurately describe how climate change affects biological invasion processes.  Multi-species reaction-diffusion competition models and predator-prey models, as well as semi-discrete stage-structured spatial models with a shifting habitat edge, are studied to emphasize the role of changing habitat suitability in persistence and spread of an invasive species interacting with an existing species.  In these models, shifts in habitat ranges are incorporated in species growth functions that propagate as traveling waves.  Species spatial dynamics are investigated for the following cases: (i) one species spreads into a shifting habitat preoccupied by a resident species; and  (ii) two species consecutively invade an open shifting habitat and the earlier species is still in the process of expanding its spatial range.  New techniques are developed to determine the behaviors of solutions of the models on appropriate bounded and unbounded spatial intervals that expand and shift in time.  Methods from differential equations, integral equations, and dynamical systems are employed to detect conditions under which species go extinct and to determine spreading speeds of persisting species in space.  The results of this research also have impacts in other disciplines where wave propagation is studied."

Mathematical and computational models are useful tools in developing this understanding since they allow scientists to test theories about which neural connectivity patterns give rise to which neural activity patterns. However, the cortex is too complex to represent every detail in a model. For example, the human cortex contains billions of neurons arranged in hundreds of interconnected subregions. Instead, mathematical studies rely on identifying fundamental organizing principles of the cortex and using them to build and study simplified models. One such principle is the widely reported balance between the activity of excitatory neurons (which promote activity in other neurons) and inhibitory neurons (which suppress activity). Most previous studies of excitatory-inhibitory balance do not account for the spatial connectivity structure of cortical neuronal networks. This project studies the implications of excitatory-inhibitory balance when the spatial structure cortical neuronal connectivity is taken into account. Prior work has shown that this combination of balance and spatial structure produces similar neural activity patterns as those observed in experimental recordings. The project will use this foundation to construct mathematical models that link anatomical features of the cortex to functional properties such as the neural coding of visual information and the neural basis of motor learning. As such, the project will contribute to the understanding of the cortex and its function. A deeper understanding of cortex can improve disease treatment, brain machine interfaces and the capabilities of intelligent machines.<br/><br/>The project comprises three sub-projects that use spatially extended balanced network models to provide new insights into the following three features of cortical networks: (1) Correlations between the activity of neurons. Correlated neural activity plays a role in neural coding and disease. Previous balanced network models produce small correlations in contrast to larger correlations observed in many cortical recordings. This project explores how spatial network structure introduces new network states with larger correlations. (2) Intrinsic dynamics. Previous balanced network models produce simple macroscopic dynamics, but the computations required to learn new motor sequences rely on more complicated network dynamics. This project explores the rich dynamics exhibited by spatially extended balanced networks and their ability to support motor learning. (3) Sensory coding. This project explores the impact of balance on sensory coding in a model of the primary visual cortex that accounts for the intricate spatial structure of orientation tuning maps. The mathematical techniques developed in this project represent novel approaches to studying spatially extended neuronal networks, which typically involve nonlinear integral equations. In the proposed work, excitation-inhibition balance is exploited to show that these equations become linear at large system size, facilitating the analysis of networks with realistic neuron models and connectivity structure. The novel mathematical approaches contribute to the general study of complex systems and dynamics on large networks."

The modeling approach that divides the population into three groups (susceptibles, infected, and removed--the so-called SIR model) and its various generalizations has been used historically as an important tool in deciding whether epidemics grow or dissipate.  The investigators expand the traditional model of an SIR stochastic epidemic on a graph with a given degree distribution,  in order to account for the Ebola-specific features.  These include, among others, incorporating a class of individuals at high risk of infection (e.g., health workers), and incorporating a dynamic network structure that reflects how contacts with different segments of the population change over the course of infection within host.<br/><br/>The new mathematical model describing the way in which Ebola spreads through a network of human contacts, both in rural and urban areas as well as across countries and continents, will be informed by the actual  field data from   various parts of the world including Africa and the United States. It is expected that the model will allow  public health and government officials to quickly analyze a host of different  intervention scenarios  in order to  speed up the current epidemic's  dissipation and to select the most effective way of preventing, or at least minimizing, the future outbreaks."

In particular, the modeling results will provide a deeper understanding of fundamental processes underlying population response of Daphnia magna to changes in the environment. The findings will have important implications for environmental sustainability, since D. magna is a toxicologically sensitive species that plays a vital role in freshwater ecosystems as feeders on phytoplankton and as a source of food for other invertebrates and fish. The investigators will hold interdisciplinary workshops to ensure broad application/adaptation of the computational tools developed in this research to other species, stressors, and biological scenarios. These workshops, designed to share the innovative efforts with graduate students, postdoctoral associates, faculty, and researchers in the ecology, toxicology, and mathematics communities, will be held at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis. The investigators will train graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented minority groups, in multi-disciplinary research involving population biology, toxicology, computer science, statistics, and mathematics.<br/><br/>Structured population models (SPMs) are well characterized for describing aggregate ecological data across a wide variety of species and have utility in estimating population-level responses to natural changes in the environment (e.g., climate change) as well as anthropomorphic influences on the environment (e.g., ecotoxicological risk assessments). Yet, the uncertainty involved in parameterizing SPMs using only population-level data (e.g., longitudinal size or age distributions) can be unreasonably high, thereby limiting the practical utility of such models to understand and predict future population change. A fundamental problem associated with this high uncertainty is that inter-individual variability can influence population-level dynamics and may be difficult to estimate from population level alone. The overall objectives in this research include three aims: (Aim 1) To test the ability of a novel parameter estimation framework (involving random differential equations and the Prohorov metric) to estimate inter-individual variability in demographic rates for SPMs from population-level data. (Aim 2) To develop a parameter estimation framework for estimating inter-individual variability in demographic rates for SPMs that utilizes both organismal-level and population-level data. The investigators will quantify the effect of using organismal-level data within this framework on estimating demographic rate distributions and reducing parameter uncertainty. (Aim 3) To extend optimal experimental design theory for application to SPMs within a statistical framework that estimates inter-individual variability. Using this extended theory, the investigators will test the effect of experimental design complexity on the reduction of parameter uncertainty for SPMs using organismal-level and population-level data. To validate these methods, the investigators will collect experimental data using a species of water flea, Daphnia magna, an ecologically important organism in the context of evolution, toxicology, ecology, and genomics. The investigators aim to develop a novel methodology that quantitatively connects and propagates the assessment of D. magna organismal responses (i.e., to environmental change, to the population level), thereby enabling the causal association of organismal responses to ecosystems adversity."

This is a disorder of the brain that is the basis of migraine aura and many other diseases of the brain including stroke and epilepsy. In this disorder the ionic environment of the brain is completely disrupted and the nerve cells turn silent, with a  disturbance that spreads at speeds of two to five millimeters per minute across the brain. When this happens in the visual cortex, the brain area that processes visual information, the patient will perceive an aura, a temporary visual defect that slowly travels over the field of view. Migraine sufferers often perceive an aura (migraine aura) prior to a migraine attack. Better understanding the mechanisms of cortical spreading depression  will thus help in management of migraine headache and many other pathological brain conditions. This research collaboration will train graduate students who will work on various aspects of the project. Summer schools will be held at Florida International University, which is a minority serving institution. Thus this project, accompanied with existing institutional efforts, has the potential to  further the goal of increasing minority representation in the sciences. Further, this collaborative effort brings together experimentalists and theorists of diverse interests and strength, and  therefore provides students with an ideal opportunity for professional growth.<br/><br/>Cortical spreading depression is a massive redistribution of ionic concentrations in the brain that results in a localized temporary loss of neuronal function. This disturbance spreads through the brain at speeds of two to five millimeters per minute and is the physiological substrate of migraine aura. Although cortical spreading depression was first described over seventy years ago, the physiological mechanisms leading to the disturbance remains elusive, most likely due to the fact that it involves many biophysical processes. In this project, a comprehensive mathematical model and computational apparatus to simulate the phenomena will be constructed and validated with experimental data obtained at high spatial resolution. An important aspect of the mathematical model is that it takes into account ionic electro-diffusion, an effect that has not been properly considered in previous studies, and may also be relevant for illucidating mechanisms in many other neurophysiological settings. In particular, the effects of electro-diffusion on extracellular recordings, electroencephalography and magneto-encephalography signals will be studied, thereby improving analysis of these measurement modalities. Overall this research may have an impact in many other brain pathologies which are linked to these underlying biophysical processes."

These developments play essential roles in understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases, the effects of environment on public health, the impacts of environmental changes such as global warming and pollution on the environments, and the detection of pathogens including viruses. Development of analytical methods to make full use of NGS data is essential in advancing public health, improving the environment, and strengthening national security. Although significant progress has been made in the analysis of NGS data, there are still wide gaps between the current available analytical tools and the full potential that can be achieved through the analysis of NGS data. This research project aims to further advance recently-developed statistical and computational methods for the comparison of genomes and metagenomes using NGS reads, without the need for assembly into genomes, avoiding many pitfalls that make assembly problematic. The research will make the computational tools more efficient and powerful and will employ them to analyze metagenomic data to study the effects of environmental factors on marine microbial communities. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for both genomics and metagenomics studies under a variety of environments.<br/><br/>In more detail, statistical and computational methods for the inference of Markovian properties of molecular sequences based on NGS short reads will be developed and the methods will then be used to study the relationships among individual genomes and metagenomic samples. Firstly, methods to estimate the order and the transition probability matrix and their asymptotic distributions will be developed. Methods to infer variable length Markov chains (VLMC) will also be developed. Secondly, new alignment-free statistics taking into account the Markov chain (MC) properties of the sequences will be developed to study the relationships among genome sequences. Iterative approaches for choosing the word length will be developed. Thirdly, Markov chain models derived from NGS reads will be used to identify species or strains in metagenomic communities and to compare metagenomic samples based on the MC models. Finally, a suite of computer algorithms related to the inference of MCs based on NGS reads and applications to genome and metagenomic data analysis will be developed. The broad impacts of the project include computational tools for genome and metagenome comparison based on NGS data together with software packages for public usage, graduate and undergraduate training across multiple disciplines of statistics and biology, and outreach lectures for K-12 teachers and students."

Particularly when generating data is expensive or time consuming, as it is often the case with clinical trials and biomolecular experiments, the problem of identifying information-rich data becomes crucial for creating models that can reliably predict the outcome of future experiments. Few results have been published on the amount of necessary data, and currently there are no methods for generating specific data sets which would unambiguously identify a predictive model. This research project addresses fundamental mathematical and computational questions in data selection.  The theoretical results will advance the fields of design of experiments and network inference through the determination of criteria for selecting data sets to uniquely identify models. The algorithms under development will serve as a guide for experimentalists in determining the data that are needed to identify the structure of a network of interest. Such knowledge has the potential to drastically reduce wasted resources that arise from too much data with too little information. Graduate students will participate at the appropriate level in each component of the project. Such an experience will provide possible topics for M.S. or Ph.D. dissertations and will very likely inspire career-long involvement of the participants in the STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>As a first step towards developing a complete theory, the PIs will focus on models described by finite-valued nonlinear polynomial functions. Finite-state multivariate polynomial functions have successfully been used to model complex networks from discretized data; however, few results have been published on the amount of data necessary for such models, with the majority applying to Boolean models only. The PIs will address the issue of the minimality and specificity of data to uniquely identify discrete polynomial models by developing the appropriate theory, implementing the theoretical results as algorithms, and applying the algorithms to important physical systems. The proposed work will also increase the utility of polynomial dynamical systems as models of complex networks by establishing the minimal amount of the data for unique model identification."

Even cells that are genetically identical and exposed to the same environments can have different chemical composition. The fundamental reason is that molecules bounce around in an unpredictable way, much like dice do when thrown on a table, and react when they randomly collide. This project will describe the randomness mathematically. Specifically, it will explore the general connection between fluctuations and control, that is, how controlling some parts of a system creates heterogeneity in others, much as small variations in the weather must be translated into large variations in the temperature of radiators to keep the room temperature constant. Rather than model specific systems, it will take a more general approach to capture broad principles of complex systems. That makes the results widely applicable in other disciplines - whether in health and medicine, ecology, or infrastructure problems where conceptually similar challenges arise. The project will train students at the interface between scientific disciplines, as well as generate examples and principles that will be useful in undergraduate education.  <br/><br/>Stochastic descriptions of cells have historically relied on detailed computer simulations that must guess many of the system details, or simplified toy models that only include a few reactions. This project will instead focus on the derivation of theorems of sufficient generality to hold for large families of processes, to rigorously understand broader design principles of biological systems. Specifically, the project will focus on deriving bounds on variances as a function of other system properties, to show, for example, how selection for maximal anabolic or enzymatic efficiency inevitably leads to large fluctuations. Similarly, the project will derive fluctuation trade-offs showing how suppressing noise in some components inevitably increases fluctuations in others. Mathematically this relies on both Markov and non-Markov processes, information theory, and fluctuation-dissipation relations, to derive statistical moments for open ended families of models."

Indeed, there is an active direction of study, known as  connectomics, that seeks to find such connections on multiple spatial scales. It is not sufficient, however, to find what regions are connected. Rather it is important to determine how and in what directions regions are connected. How are signals conveyed and acted upon as part of a neural computational process? To understand such neural computations, it is necessary to understand how input patterns of signals in space and time are processed at the target network.  This is a huge scientific program in which mathematics and modeling can play a central role in guiding experiments. The aim of this research is to produce a body of work that is representative of the general issues that are encountered in adding input that has timing structure to networks exhibiting rhythmic structure.  From such a body of examples, a goal of this project is to search for general principles about networks of neurons with external input. Such forced networks are far more complex than the well-studied phenomena of simple forced oscillators. This project will support two graduate students and will be carried out within the context of the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, a NSF-supported group of more than two dozen labs (mostly) in the Boston area working on brain dynamics and cognition.  The CRC is designed to facilitate collaborations among its many groups, with special attention to the graduate students and postdocs of these groups.  <br/><br/>This project is concerned with the effects of input signals with multiple time scales on target networks of neurons that also have multiple time scales.  From the huge number of examples of these phenomena manifest in the nervous system, this research is focused on two of particular biological importance.  The first is the interaction of gamma and theta rhythms, mainly in hippocampal networks, with inputs from other parts of the hippocampus and neocortex also carrying such temporal patterns.  The second concerns a rhythm that has been experimentally and computationally investigated in a region of parietal cortex in vitro; parietal cortices are known to be hubs of connections, with inputs from many other areas.  The particular rhythm in question arises as an after-effect of stimulation, and has been shown computationally to change the network response to later tonic excitation.  This research will improve understanding of the effect on a network displaying this rhythm of input with more complex spectral properties, such as inputs from other brain regions. The networks involved have both excitatory and inhibitory cells, sometimes with more than one kind of inhibitory cell producing multiple time scales in the target network."

It is triggered by the entry of calcium ions into the cell, followed by their diffusion and binding to calcium-sensing proteins. This fundamental physiological cell process is called secretory vesicle exocytosis, and is also responsible for neuro-muscular communication and the release of hormone from endocrine cells. Accurate modeling and deeper understanding of cell calcium signals that trigger neurotransmitter release and endocrine hormone release is at the core of the current project, and may provide deeper insight into the function of neural and endocrine systems both in the normal state and in pathological conditions, for instance type-II diabetes. This project will employ advanced mathematical and computational techniques in order to gain deeper knowledge of physiologically relevant cell calcium dynamics with high resolution in time and space. This will include further development of an open-source computational tool called CalC (""Calcium Calculator"") for the simulation of three-dimensional cell calcium ion diffusion and calcium binding (http://www.calciumcalculator.org), contributing to the infrastructure for computational modeling in the biological sciences, facilitating rapid and effective dissemination of the obtained results through the publicly accessible on-line simulation file database. Students will be trained in the highly interdisciplinary field spanning applied mathematics, cell biophysics and computational neuroscience, contributing to the development of future researchers capable of using advanced computational methods to tackle problems of broad societal impact in the life sciences.<br/><br/>This project addresses several challenges in the modeling of cell calcium dynamics leading to neurotransmitter and hormone release. One of these challenges is taking into account the strong influence of various intracellular calcium-binding molecules, collectively termed calcium buffers and sensors, on cell calcium diffusion. This project extends recent studies of calcium diffusion in the presence of buffers with several calcium binding sites that bind calcium cooperatively through a mechanism similar to the process of cooperative binding of oxygen by hemoglobin. Cooperative binding distinguishes an important class of calcium buffer-sensors evolutionarily linked to calmodulin, and deeper understanding of their influence on calcium signals is important for the understanding of cell physiology.This project also explores the relationship between the two most widely used approaches in modeling calcium dynamics: the deterministic approach that models calcium as a continuous concentration distribution, and the stochastic approach that simulates trajectories of individual calcium ions and is assumed to be more realistic, but more expensive computationally. A novel analytical method will be applied to more accurately estimate stationary distribution of calcium near a single membrane calcium channel, allowing efficient modeling and analysis of calcium ""nanodomains"" that form around open calcium channels. Finally, through collaborative work with experimental physiologists, obtained methods and results will be applied to understand the interplay between calcium diffusion, buffering and sensing that underlies the observed dynamics of vesicle release in specific types of mammalian synapses and endocrine cells."

Included among these are hantaviruses, which pose a significant threat to public health worldwide and are classified as emerging infectious diseases. Hantaviruses are transmitted to humans through contact with infected rodent excrement. Although hantaviruses cause little morbidity or mortality in their rodent reservoir, they establish a persistent infection that spills over into sympatric or human hosts. Spillover infection in nonreservoir rodents results in an asymptomatic acute infection without any apparent proinflammatory response or disease, whereas spillover in humans results in severe pathology (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) with mortality reaching 40-50%. Very little is known regarding the differences in the innate/adaptive immune response to hantavirus infection that characterize these three distinct responses: persistence, viral clearance, or severe pathology. The primary goals of this research are  to formulate and to test new mathematical models based on carefully designed in vitro experiments for hantavirus infection and to identify key immune components at crucial time points that differentiate between natural versus nonnatural reservoirs (rodents and humans). This knowledge is essential for designing interventions and therapeutics for treatment of hantaviruses and other similar zoonotic viruses for which treatment is not currently available.<br/><br/>The in vitro experiments are designed to clearly distinguish the pathways during hantavirus infection in natural reservoir (rodents) versus spillover into nonreservoir hosts (rodents and humans). Three different hantaviruses, endemic in North America, will be used to infect endothelial and immune cells: Sin Nombre virus,  Black Creek Canal virus, and  Prospect Hill virus in two different types of host cells, deer mice and human. Dependent on the combination of host and hantaviral species, three different outcomes can be observed in either reservoir or nonreservoir hosts: (i) persistence of infection with no disease, (ii) acute infection with viral clearance, and  (iii) severe pathology and disease. In the lungs, endothelial cells and macrophages are the primary target cells of hantavirus. Based on the experimental outcomes, deterministic and stochastic mathematical models will be formulated and statistically validated for the dynamics of these and other cells important in the early phase of the immune response. Methods from ordinary and stochastic differential equations, Markov chains and branching processes will be used to model the virus-cell-immune dynamics that includes  activation of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Mathematical and statistical methods will be developed to identify thresholds that determine specific  immunological pathways. In the broader context, this research will have educational and scientific impacts through cross-disciplinary training of students and a postdoc in mathematics and biology, through outreach and professional activities, and through development of new mathematical models and statistical methods. The mathematical models, methods, and data will be shared with other scientific groups to investigate questions and hypotheses regarding other zoonotic viruses important to public health such as avian influenza, Hendra, Ebola, and SARS Coronavirus."
