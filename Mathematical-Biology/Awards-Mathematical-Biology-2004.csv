The genetically<br/>altered mosquitos are resistant to infection by mosquito-borne<br/>diseases, so their introduction into wild populations could be an<br/>effective measure in controlling mosquito-borne diseases such as<br/>malaria, dengue fever, and West Nile virus.  He aims to<br/>understand the complexity of the dynamics of interacting<br/>genetically-altered and wild mosquitoes and to predict gene<br/>distributions in future generations of the population.  The<br/>population models are structured, that is, they account for both<br/>gender and genetic structure.  Within this structure, homogeneous<br/>models, where all transgenic (genetically-altered) mosquitoes are<br/>considered as a single group without distinction, heterogeneous<br/>models, where homozygous and heterozygous transgenic mosquitoes<br/>are distinguished, and multiple-transgenic models, where<br/>genetically-altered mosquitoes have different transgenes, are<br/>examined.  Within each model category, formulas for the birth<br/>functions and contact rates are established.  To account for data<br/>deviations and environmental noise, the investigator formulates<br/>versions of these models that include demographic and<br/>environmental stochasticities.  Transmission dynamics of the<br/>diseases are incorporated with various epidemiological models for<br/>both human and mosquito populations.  The investigator combines<br/>analysis and numerical simulation to study qualitative and<br/>quantitative features of the models, including existence and<br/>stability of equilibria, existence of periodic and aperiodic<br/>oscillations through bifurcations, and chaotic behavior and<br/>transient dynamics.

The introduction of transgenic<br/>(genetically altered) mosquitoes into wild mosquito populations<br/>could be an effective measure in controlling mosquito-borne<br/>diseases.  To explore this possibility, the investigator in<br/>collaboration with biologists develops and analyzes mathematical<br/>models that represent the population dynamics of wild and<br/>transgenic mosquitoes.  The models account for the spread of<br/>transgenes through the mosquito population over multiple<br/>generations.  They help answer such questions as how effectively<br/>transgenic mosquitoes would be able to compete for partners with<br/>their wild counterparts, how long it would take for a new<br/>resistance gene to penetrate the mosquito population, and how<br/>effective it would be in mosquitoes that carry it.  In this way,<br/>the results of the project can provide useful guidance for public<br/>health measures. <br/>"

Models of<br/>biofilms, previously developed by this investigator and<br/>collaborators, are used to study important phenomena such as gene<br/>transfer among micro-organisms and quorum sensing.  These models<br/>are based on the classical chemical engineering bio-reactors,<br/>namely, the continuously stirred tank reactor and the tubular<br/>plug flow reactor with dispersion, and take the form of ordinary<br/>differential equations for the former and coupled parabolic<br/>equations with nonlinear boundary conditions for the latter.  The<br/>aim is to understand the factors that facilitate biofilm<br/>formation, the factors involved in the successful introduction of<br/>new genes via plasmid transfer in biofilm communities, and the<br/>role of bacterial quorum sensing in these processes.  The study<br/>also addresses a fundamental issue in population biology -- the<br/>so-called ""paradox of the plankton"": why can so many plankton<br/>species be supported by so few limiting resources in lakes and<br/>seas?  The same paradox arises with the microbial denizens of<br/>arid soils that receive infrequent rains and deposition of<br/>nutrients -- another focus of the project.  The investigator's<br/>aim is to introduce mathematical models based on the classical<br/>model of a multi-species community in which members compete<br/>exploitatively for several essential (nonoverlapping) resources<br/>(light, nitrogen, carbon, etc.) in a well-mixed environment and<br/>to provide mathematically rigorous results of an explanatory<br/>nature rather than numerical simulations.  On the mathematical<br/>side, the theory of monotone dynamical systems and persistence<br/>theory have greatly contributed to the understanding of<br/>biological models and the study aims to enhance and build on<br/>these theories.<br/><br/>     A substantial effort is devoted to study mathematical models<br/>of microbial processes in environmental settings where biofilms<br/>may form on surfaces.  Biofilms are of great importance in the<br/>health sciences and industry, where their formation typically<br/>results in negative outcomes.  They are responsible for food and<br/>water contamination, dental caries and periodontal disease, and<br/>the contamination of medical implants.  The focus is on<br/>understanding conditions favorable for biofilm formation, factors<br/>involved in gene transfer (e.g., antibiotic resistance) among<br/>microorganisms in biofilms, and the ability of organisms to<br/>chemically communicate their existence and current state to<br/>others organisms on these processes.  Broadly, the study is<br/>characterized by a desire to obtain mathematically rigorous<br/>results along with computer simulations.  Modelling and computer<br/>simulations are widely acknowledged to be important tools in the<br/>study of biological systems.  The modelling process forces a<br/>careful description of what are the known and important features<br/>of a system.  Computer simulations are important in order to<br/>explore the implications of assumptions and sensitivity of model<br/>behavior to parameter changes.  However, computer simulations<br/>alone seldom lead to a comprehensive understanding of a model,<br/>let alone the underlying biological process, due to the inherent<br/>limitations of the computer itself -- one can only test a<br/>relatively small sample of the full range of model parameters,<br/>follow the time course of the model over a relatively small time<br/>window, for a relatively small number of possible initial data. <br/>Rigorous mathematical analysis can lead to real understanding of<br/>a model and the underlying biological processes by identifying<br/>mechanisms responsible for model behavior.  Unfortunately, the<br/>mathematical tools necessary to provide a careful mathematical<br/>analysis are often not currently available.

The over-arching theme is that of ""High-Dimensional Model Search,"" <br/>i.e. the development of tools and methods for generating, evaluating and <br/>interpreting sets of relevant candidate models of a biological problem <br/>involving many variables.  Research includes the investigation of models and <br/>computational methods for very large-scale graphical models, especially <br/>Gaussian graphical models and very sparse model structures, as <br/>representatives of the structure and patterns of association between <br/>biological variables from observed and experimental data. Contexts of gene <br/>and protein expression studies generate multiple motivating problems and <br/>data for case studies. In problems of realistic dimension (thousands) any <br/>one such graphical model is high-dimensional in both the variable domain <br/>(number of nodes) and numbers of parameters; but, the fundamental challenge <br/>is that the number of candidate models for a given problem is astronomical. <br/>In fitting and evaluating candidate models, it is typical that many <br/>candidates have plausible support based on fit to the available <br/>observational or experimental data and in the context of relevant biological <br/>information. Hence the need for methods to identify, explore and evaluate <br/>many plausible models, and to interpret and characterize their similarities <br/>and differences in both statistical and substantive biological terms. <br/>Additional classes of regression models, including nonlinear statistical <br/>classification and prediction tree models, represent flexible frameworks for <br/>the exploration, combination and utilization of multiple forms of biological <br/>data in predictive phenotyping for prognosis, diagnosis and discovery. In <br/>genomic contexts, high-throughput molecular information such as gene <br/>expression data leads to very, very many potential predictor variables to be <br/>assessed, so that, again, the challenges to statistics include dealing with <br/>and exploring spaces of very high-dimensional models. These central research <br/>challenges -- variable selection and model uncertainty that, with large <br/>numbers of variables, are simply unanswerable based on current mathematical <br/>and statistical methods -- form the core focus of this project. Motivated by <br/>and integrated with a number of genomic studies that provide data, <br/>collaborators and application contexts in functional genomics in several <br/>areas of application, this project involves model development and innovation <br/>in methods of stochastic search over complex and very high-dimensional <br/>statistical model spaces. This includes associated model theory, methods, <br/>and computational algorithm development that involve distributed cluster-<br/>based implementations, as well as feedback application in a number of <br/>biomedical studies. <br/><br/>Modern biomedicine now has access to data of rapidly escalating scales and <br/>complexities based on innovations and advances in, in particular, genome <br/>technologies. This includes high-throughput genomic data from DNA microarray <br/>gene expression studies in both laboratory and human observational disease <br/>and exposure studies, related large-scale molecular information from <br/>proteomic and metabolic profiling technologies, genetic and sequence <br/>information that is quickly expanding towards genome-scale sequence data, <br/>and, of course, traditional forms of clinical, environmental and demographic <br/>data. Advances in both basic biology and the use of such information to <br/>inform and aid in human health studies requires very substantial <br/>advances in the capacity to analyse and interpret these data sets of ever-<br/>increasing scale and complexity. Bringing multiple forms of such data to bear <br/>in defining predictive phenotypes is at the core of the emergent arena of <br/>clinico-genomics, for example. The challenges to modern mathematical and <br/>computational modellers are those of very high-dimensional mathematical <br/>model specification and analysis, coupled with the need for computational <br/>tools to search across astronomical numbers of candidate models, an endeavor <br/>that is well beyond the current capacity to implement, evaluate and <br/>understand. This challenge defines the core agenda of this research project: <br/>the development of statistical and computational tools for very high-<br/>dimensional statistical models. The research is coupled with an integrated <br/>collection of genomic studies that provide data, biological collaborators <br/>and applications in functional genomics in several areas of cancer and <br/>cardiovascular biology, pathway studies in cell cycle regulation and <br/>oncogenesis, cancer proteomics, transcription regulation and other areas. At <br/>the core of the research lies innovation in methods of stochastic search -- <br/>i.e., simulation techniques -- over complex and very high-dimensional <br/>statistical model spaces, and the associated model theory and methods. The <br/>inherent intellectual merit of the research lies in the advances and <br/>innovative new methods in computation and statistical modelling, as well as <br/>specific biological applications. The broader impact of the research lies in <br/>the applicability of the resulting methods and tools to applications in these <br/>specific areas, in other related biomedical/genomic applications, and in <br/>other fields of science.<br/>"

For well over half a century, the conventional<br/>theoretical approach to cooperation and dominance has been to<br/>study them separately.  But this approach ultimately yields<br/>diminishing returns, because each phenomenon incorporates crucial<br/>aspects of the other.  On the one hand, a dominance hierarchy is a<br/>cooperative structure: well organized groups, in which each<br/>individual knows and is fairly resigned to its particular social<br/>status, are more productive than similar groups in a constant<br/>state of organizational turmoil.

The investigator studies these<br/>connections between cooperation and dominance by developing a<br/>suite of analytical and computational models to predict the<br/>effects of coalition formation on the emergence and stability of<br/>dominance hierarchies versus more egalitarian social structures,<br/>and to identify conditions that favor each possible outcome.

Smith<br/><br/>This multi-campus team is studying processes within a single<br/>biological host that can be described by models inspired by ecological<br/>stoichiometry, the study of the balance of energy and multiple<br/>chemical resources (usually elements) in ecological<br/>interactions. These concepts have been broadened by their extension to<br/>biological stoichiometry, which has proven to be an important new lens<br/>through which we can view and understand complex biological<br/>interactions. Within this general theory, the cycling and utilization<br/>of energy and multiple nutrients by organisms and their constituent<br/>cells occupies a central position. With its emphasis on the flow of<br/>elemental matter, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus,<br/>stoichiometric theory covers multiple biological scales. It also<br/>allows, via rigid physical and chemical constraints, the construction<br/>of robust mechanistic and predictive models. Originally formulated and<br/>verified in the fields of limnology and plant ecology, biological<br/>stoichiometry has recently been applied at physiological scales to<br/>such diverse areas as organism development and tumor growth. In this<br/>proposal we aim to synthesize and apply theoretical and empirical<br/>approaches to biological stoichiometry within the grand framework of<br/>internal disease.  Recent headline-grabbing findings that connect<br/>nutritional factors to disease dynamics indicate there is an<br/>increasing need for stoichiometry-based mathematical models of<br/>internal disease that track the effects of potentially limiting<br/>resources.  The proposed work weaves together threads of theoretical<br/>and experimental research. Our primary aim is the construction of<br/>predictive and verifiable theoretical models which can begin to<br/>explicitly deal with the effects of stoichiometric interactions in<br/>within-host disease dynamics. Such models will be built in a modular<br/>fashion, starting with simple deterministic models, and then<br/>progressively adding stochasticity, spatial heterogeneity, and<br/>genetics. At each step the models will be challenged, calibrated, and<br/>tested by in vitro laboratory experiments.<br/><br/>The proposed work will have a broad impact in both science research<br/>and education, and eventually in internal disease management and<br/>treatment. Regarding the former, our research team is truly<br/>interdisciplinary, with group members in mathematics, theoretical<br/>physics, ecology, and biomedicine. Our collaborative efforts will<br/>provide undergraduate and graduate students and junior scientists of<br/>diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds with first-hand educational<br/>experience in cross-disciplinary communication and exploration.  The<br/>current proposal is a step towards new ways to understand disease,<br/>aiming to develop robust and experimentally calibrated mathematical<br/>theories of disease-host interactions that can be applied to a wide<br/>variety of diseases. We firmly believe that such theories have a<br/>central role to play in present and future research.

Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is associated<br/>with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's<br/>chorea.  Structures within the basal ganglia have in fact been the target<br/>of recent therapeutic surgical procedures including pallidotomy and deep<br/>brain stimulation.  Numerous experiments have demonstrated that neurons<br/>within the basal ganglia display a variety of dynamic behaviors; moreover,<br/>patterns of neuronal activity differ between normal and pathological<br/>states.  Neither the origins of these neural firing patterns nor the<br/>mechanisms that underlie the patterns are understood.  The primary goals of<br/>the project are to develop detailed computational models, based on<br/>experimental data, for basal ganglia activity and to develop mathematical<br/>tools for analyzing these models.  The investigator systematically studies<br/>mechanisms underlying complex activity patterns found in a broad class of<br/>excitatory-inhibitory neuronal networks.

The particular phenomenon<br/>explored by the investigator is the short-term facilitation of<br/>synaptic response, that is, the transient increase in synaptic<br/>strength elicited with just a few action potentials, and decaying<br/>on time scales of tens to hundreds of milliseconds.  Facilitation<br/>is observed in a wide variety of systems, and must play an<br/>important role in neural dynamics and information processing. <br/>Although facilitation is known to depend on the presynaptic<br/>accumulation of residual calcium, its precise mechanisms are still<br/>under debate.  The investigator focuses on the role of endogenous<br/>calcium buffers in several different mechanisms previously<br/>proposed to explain facilitation.  Among such mechanisms is buffer<br/>saturation, recently shown experimentally to underlie facilitation<br/>at certain central synapses, and a facilitation model relying on<br/>both free and bound residual calcium.  The study concentrates on<br/>two model systems that have been widely used to explore the<br/>mechanisms of synaptic transmission: the crayfish neuromuscular<br/>junction and the auditory calyx of Held synapse.  The abundance of<br/>experimental data obtained at these synapses allows detailed<br/>modeling of the calcium-secretion coupling.  One of the main goals<br/>of this study is to explore how variations in endogenous buffering<br/>characteristics affect the spatiotemporal calcium concentration<br/>profile during trains of action potentials.  This in turn helps in<br/>elucidating the mechanisms of facilitation and in ascertaining the<br/>role of calcium buffers in these and other synapses.  Another<br/>objective of this work is to estimate the properties of endogenous<br/>buffers at the crayfish NMJ and at the calyx of Held.  A modeling<br/>approach is indispensable in this respect: apart from the over-all<br/>buffering capacity, the specific buffering properties are<br/>inaccessible to direct measurement at most synapses. <br/><br/>     The investigator applies computational tools to the study of<br/>a fundamental biological process, that of the movement of calcium<br/>ions inside a cell.  It is known that calcium regulates a vast<br/>number of crucial biological events, such as gene transcription,<br/>muscle contraction, immune system response, and many others.  In<br/>order to understand how a single element can regulate such a<br/>diverse set of biological reactions, it is necessary to know in<br/>detail how calcium concentration is controlled inside a cell. <br/>This is particularly important for a better understanding of<br/>synaptic transmission, which is at the center of the<br/>investigator's work.  In synaptic transmission, the entry of<br/>calcium into the synapse causes the release of a neurotransmitter<br/>chemical, binding of which to the receptors of the neighboring<br/>neuron allows the electric activity to be transmitted from one<br/>cell to the next.  This is the fundamental process of<br/>communication between neurons in the nervous system.  It is<br/>interesting that the strength of the synaptic connection between<br/>two neurons does not remain the same, but is constantly changing. <br/>The investigator explores how the accumulation of calcium causes<br/>some synapses to temporarily increase (facilitate) their strength. <br/>Along with other forms of synaptic change (termed synaptic<br/>plasticity), such facilitation must play an important role in the<br/>functioning of the nervous system.  Apart from the immediate goal<br/>of further elucidating the synaptic transmission mechanisms, this<br/>study of intracellular calcium dynamics helps to shed light on<br/>other important biological processes that are also controlled by<br/>calcium.  Finally, this work contributes to the widening of the<br/>use of computational methods in biosciences, which is necessary in<br/>order to maintain the current rapid progress in biology. <br/>"
