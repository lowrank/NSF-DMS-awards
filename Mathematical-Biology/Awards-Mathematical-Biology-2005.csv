This interdisciplinary education and research training project for undergraduates in biological and mathematical sciences will recruit junior undergraduate students, with half majoring in biology, and the others in mathematics (including statistics).  The research will be directed towards qualitative and quantitative approaches to understanding molecular structures and mechanisms. This includes dynamics and regulation of the pathways and networks involved in gene expression and signal transduction in cells.  It will involve using technical strategies from biochemistry, genetics and cellular biology, and mathematical tools such as DNA and protein microarray analysis, data mining, dynamical systems, numerical simulation, and partial differential equations. The students will assimilate and employ these mathematical techniques under the direction of faculty from the Department of Mathematics, and the Department of Statistics and Probability. Beyond providing intense education and research training to the participating undergraduates, this project will influence the future direction of curriculum changes.<br/><br/>The importance of the mathematical sciences in the development of 21st Century biology has been noted, just as they have been important in the past development of physical sciences and engineering.  Yet the traditional training of biologists and that of mathematical scientists did not expose one population to the tools, problems, opportunities for progress, and challenges of the other.  This project will train budding mathematical scientists in cutting-edge biology and will train undergraduate biology majors in quantitative analysis relevant to the fields of genetics and cell biology.  The particular research projects being addressed by these students under the guidance of faculty in the biological and mathematical sciences include mathematical analysis of processes within cells, such as communication between parts of the cell and the assembly of the molecules necessary for proper life functions.  The mathematical description of molecular processes allows for the simulation of these highly complex mechanisms, which brings understanding that could otherwise be unavailable. The mathematical description on the other hand, relies upon careful laboratory experimental work and data analysis, and so it is essential that future scientists be trained in both the laboratory approach and the mathematical approach to research into cellular and genetic processes.  This integrative analysis and understanding should help in devising novel therapies to treat human diseases such as cancer, Huntington's, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease."

One of the main innovations of the project is that pathophysiologically relevant shear exposure times and magnitudes will be studied, in contrast to the vast majority of prior platelet function studies that employed time exposures on the order of seconds to minutes.  A microfabricated experimental platform is to be developed to investigate blood damage in dynamic fluidflowing environments with mechanical stresses of magnitude and duration typical of cardiovascular devices and occlusive arterial disease. Another innovation of this project is the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in conjunction with experiments to jointly provide complete fluid dynamic information for blood damage analysis. This reliance upon CFD to provide such vital information is unique among platelet function studies performed to date. <br/><br/>Biomedical devices are frequently employed to repair or replace various elements of the cardiovascular system. Prosthetic heart valves, vascular grafts, circulatory assist devices, and hemodialysis systems are in wide clinical use, often saving or extending the lives of patients with otherwise hopeless medical conditions. This project will provide a deeper understanding of the interactions of blood flow with the dynamics of blood damage may yield new insights into the mechanisms of blood damage and, thus, enable further progress in the design, evaluation, and improvement of cardiovascular devices as well as provide direction for new preventative clinical therapies.  The outcomes of this project will impact FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) submission packages by providing guidelines and validated models of blood damage to better evaluate the efficacy and performance of future devices. In addition, the project has a substantive educational impact through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students with this research. The biomechanics of blood damage will be taught in bioengineering classroom settings, and graduate students will experience cross-disciplinary training via laboratory visits between the computational and experimental facilities involved in this project.<br/>"

To do that the investigators will develop and analyze mathematical models for the population dynamics of dispersing organisms.  The models will be generalizations of reaction-diffusion systems that will incorporate features not usually present in ecological models based on those systems.  Standard reaction-diffusion models in ecology describe populations inhabiting a single uniform environment and assume that dispersal is purely random and is not conditional on properties of the environment or the presence of other organisms.  The models that the investigators will study will describe dispersal that depends on environmental conditions, occurs in patchy landscapes, and/or is variable in time.  To capture those features the models will incorporate mechanisms and structures such as density-dependent diffusion and boundary conditions, advection along environmental gradients, boundary conditions that change over time, spatially varying coefficients, and multiple patches linked by long distance dispersal.  The motivation for incorporating such features is to obtain more realistic descriptions of the ways in which populations can be affected by modifications of the environment such as habitat fragmentation and the effects of global change.  To analyze the models the investigators will use methods from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, and nonlinear functional analysis.  Some of the modeling assumptions will lead to models with novel features that will require the development of new mathematical ideas and methods. <br/><br/>The objective of the project is to create and apply mathematical models that describe how the movement patterns of organisms affect how their populations grow or decline and how they interact with other organisms.  The models will be based on equations which incorporate factors such as movement rates that involve responses to features of the landscape such as edges between habitat types or are influenced by the presence of other organisms.  Those features are not generally present in existing spatial models in ecology.  The models will describe populations inhabiting patchy environments consisting of mixtures of different habitat types.  Such environments often result from human activities such as urbanization, agriculture, and the creation of nature reserves.  Investigating how spatial effects can threaten or help maintain biodiversity or affect interactions between important types of organisms such as crops, pests, and biological control agents may provide insights that will lead to improved decision making in areas such as conservation, land management, pest and disease control, and urban planning. <br/>"

The BioMaPS program promotes the integration of research and teaching in mathematics and biology by engaging students as both researchers and teachers. The students and faculty work together as research teams on integrative projects, asking innovative questions from both biological and mathematical viewpoints. The projects include modeling of ecological and evolutionary processes relating to fecundity, parameter identification, developmental stability, biodiversity, anthropogenic disturbances, and population fluctuations. Through a mentored research experience, undergraduates will gain insight into the connections that exist between biology and mathematics.    <br/><br/>A defining aspect of the project is the collaboration of four female and three male investigators across two disciplines. These mentors have the ability to attract a diverse group of students based on their different but complementary backgrounds. The BioMaPS program will enhance existing partnerships with Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. In conjunction with the Biomathematics in the Commonwealth program, the BioMaPS program will promote the development of new partnerships with universities across Kentucky as well as nationally. The findings of the BioMaPS teams will be disseminated through presentations at local, regional, and national conferences as well as through peer reviewed publications. The BioMaPS program has the potential to increase enrollments in mathematics and biology by making a challenging and exciting area of study available to students.

In molecular biology these ""dominoes"" are called base pairs, because each is formed by joining together with hydrogen bonds two nearly planar complementary nucleotide bases. Both the intrinsic geometry (e.g., curvature in the stress-free state) and the elastic properties (e.g., moduli governing bending, twisting, shearing, and coupling between such modes of deformation) are sensitive to the nucleotide sequence in the DNA molecule. Each base pair is covalently attached to the sugar-phosphate backbone chain of one of the two DNA strands that have come together to form the Watson-Crick structure, and as each phosphate group in the backbone chain bears one electronic charge, two such charges are associated with each base pair. The electrical force exerted on each base pair depends on the concentration of salt in the medium and the position in space of even remotely placed base pairs in the same DNA molecule. Calculations based on this model performed under a previous NSF grant indicate that the equilibrium configurations of an intrinsically curved DNA molecule in solution are very sensitive to the concentration c of salt in the medium. Bifurcation diagrams with c as the parameter can have great complexity and, under appropriate circumstances, contain regions in which several locally stable equilibrium configurations (each giving the molecule a distinct shape) occur at a single value of c.  The goal of this project is to develop the mathematical theory of the model to the point where its conclusions are easily capable of experimental testing (e.g., by predicting that for particular DNA sequences experimentally detectable changes in configuration should occur at values of c near to calculated critical values).<br/><br/>The attainment of a well developed theory of the influence of long-range electrostatic forces, and hence of changes in salt concentration, on the configurations of intrinsically curved (and in general non-homogeneous) DNA molecules is a matter of general interest in biophysics that has implications in bioengineering. The research in this project is expected to have applications to microdevices for imaging and sorting genomic-length DNA molecules. In one such device the DNA is elongated by confinement to a channel with a width of 0.1 microns, and the computational methods to be developed will aid in the attainment of an understanding of the way the amount of extension experienced by DNA confined in such a channel is related to the channel diameter, the concentration of salt, and the intrinsic curvature of the DNA.  Another application of the theory is the investigation of the possibility that circularized molecules of DNA formed from appropriate sequences of several hundred base-pairs can serve as mesoscale mechano-chemical switches that undergo large changes in configuration upon small changes in salt concentration."

We shall do this by developing microscopic filament-based models for force generation at the leading edge, and then integrating these into a continuum description. We will develop modules for the subprocesses that can be tested separately on different systems and then integrated into the complete model. This approach is necessary, given the complexity of the problem, but is also the best long-term strategy because it will allow for the use of different modules for different systems, and facilitate incorporation of new information as it becomes available. A summary of the major steps is as follows.  We will formulate an integrated microscopic model of force generation in a simple geometry and obtain the force velocity relation, then apply this to a number of different experimental configurations.  We will then develop the continuum description for actin dynamics and force generation and test it on data for retrograde flow in coelomocytes and apply it, suitably modified, to the actin comet tail in the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes.  All phases will require the development of appropriate computational tools. <br/><br/>Cell movement is an essential process at various stages in the life cycle of most organisms: early development of multicellular organisms involves individual and collective cell movement, leukocytes must migrate toward sites of infection as part of the immune response, and in cancer directed movement is involved in invasion and metastasis. Movement entails force generation within cells and mechanical interactions with their surroundings, and understanding how they are controlled in space and time to produce cell-level movement is a major challenge. The complexity of the molecular network that controls these processes is such that not all interactions can be followed at the molecular level in a computational model; a multiscale hybrid of microscopic and continuum descriptions is needed.  At present there is no multiscale three-dimensional model that integrates the microscopic-level processes (the nanobiology) into a cell- or tissue-level description.  Significant progress on the development of computational algorithms for a whole-cell model has been made, and the proposed work is aimed at the development of a new microscopic model of force generation in a cell, and the integration of the microscopic model into a multicomponent 3D continuum description based on spatially- and temporally-varying material properties.  A significant product of the research will be a computational tool built around modular descriptions for signal transduction, force generation, and movement that can be used to test new hypotheses and to do experiments computationally that are difficult to do in the laboratory."

Nonlinear effects in population dynamics interact with <br/>environmental variability in ways that are, thus far, poorly <br/>understood.

It also seeks to <br/>understand the relationship between the domination of many field <br/>population time series by low frequencies and the domination of <br/>many environmental fluctuations by low frequencies. The project <br/>aims to: 1) Develop new computational mathematical methods for <br/>fitting nonlinear stochastic models to ecological time series data <br/>in the frequency-domain; 2) Develop methods of inferring the <br/>spectral <br/>properties of environmental perturbations that affect empirical <br/>population time series; 3) Apply the new frequency-domain fitting <br/>techniques to existing data from population dynamics experiments <br/>on the flour beetle Tribolium that did not impose environmental <br/>variability, and to models of these data that are already well <br/>tested in the time-domain; 4) Design, conduct and analyze experiments<br/> to test the impact of red-shifted, white, and blue-shifted environment<br/>al variability on systems exhibiting known population dynamics (by<br/> analogy to light, variability dominated by low-frequency fluctuations<br/> is called red-shifted, variability dominated by high-frequency <br/>fluctuations is called blue-shifted, and variability with all <br/>frequencies equally represented is called white); and 5) Apply gained <br/>insights to important ecological systems in the field (by contrast to <br/>those in the laboratory). <br/>The inherent biological processes that determine the dynamics of some animal populations can lead them to fluctuate chaotically. Variations in the external environment (for example, weather or anthropogenic perturbations) can also lead to unpredictable fluctuations of animal populations. The interactions between the environmental fluctuations and the inherent biological processes can produce large, complex and varied effects that presently defy simple explanations. Small changes in the nature of the environmental noise affecting a system can sometimes be magnified and transfigured by the internal system dynamics to produce substantial and diverse qualitative changes in how a population fluctuates. This project seeks to develop mathematical and statistical tools to understand and model the interactions between internally driven fluctuations and externally driven fluctuations of animal populations. The research focuses on the effects of changing the frequencies of the dominant environmental fluctuations. Preliminary modeling predicts, for instance, that the average population size in a laboratory population of Tribolium flour beetles, widely used as an experimental model for animal population dynamics, can be increased or decreased as the dominant environmental-variation frequency changes across a fixed range, depending on the internal dynamics of the system.  Understanding the complex interaction between environmental noise and internal dynamics is essential for predicting which effect will occur, and therefore could have implications when larger populations are desirable (endangered species), or undesirable (pests, including insect vectors of disease). New experiments on the flour beetle system will investigate the interactions between environmental variability and internal dynamics. The knowledge gained from these experiments and the novel analytical techniques developed in this project may have practical importance in pest control, conservation, and the control of human disease. <br/><br/>"

Since these dominant Lyapunov exponents determine the asymptotic growth rate of populations at low densities, they are critical for understanding persistence.<br/><br/>The interaction between environmental fluctuations, for example those due to anthropogenic disturbances or weather, and biological processes can dramatically affect the outcomes of species interactions. Consequently, the applications of the mathematical techniques developed in this project may be of practical value to the conservation or the restoration of ecological communities, the prevention of biological invasions, the management of natural resources, and biological control of agricultural pests."

Specifically, averaging is used to analyze the termination of waves in spatially connected networks by reducing the complicated conductance-based models to scalar spatial models. Phase-plane methods are applied to the reduced systems. Averaging is also used at the single spike level to understand the transition between synchrony and asynchrony in coupled networks that have different types of connections. Population density methods and linearized stability analysis will distinguish between the onset of synchrony, clusters, and propagating waves in spatially distributed networks of neural oscillators. Indirect coupling between excitable and oscillatory cells will be analyzed using a combination of phase-resetting curves and the dispersive properties of excitable cables.<br/><br/>When neurons are connected together, they can often produce persistent activity.  Such persistent activity has been implicated in short-term memory -- how an animal or human ""holds a thought.""  What kinds of interactions disrupt this and which are necessary to maintain the activity are some of the questions that are asked in this proposal. When activity is too persistent then certain pathologies arise such as epilepsy. Thus, one goal of this proposal is to understand how to strike a balance between the ability to produce stable persistent activity while preventing its pathological propagation into quiet regions. When neurons fire they communicate with other neurons and depending on the interactions, the result can be that the neurons want to fire together or they want to fire asynchronously. The latter is useful for persistent activity. Synchrony on the other hand is crucial for several normal physiological processes. For example, it is known that certain cells in the base of the brain organize the output of hormones. The electrical activity of these cells is synchronized yet the mechanisms for this synchrony remain unknown since there are no direct connections between the individual oscillating neurons.  We will study mechanism through which indirect coupling can produce synchronous behavior. Tools and methods developed in this proposal will have applications well beyond neuroscience, as the questions of synchrony and propagation of ""information"" are ubiquitous in biology from the single cell level on up to the ecological interactions between populations.<br/>"

This has led to considerable interest in analyzing reduced biological models of neuronal networks. Most analytical studies of these network models assume that the system is spatially homogeneous. Recently, however, the principal investigator has shown that the combined effect of a spatially localized inhomogeneous input and recurrent synaptic interactions between neurons can result in nontrivial forms of coherent oscillations and waves. This motivates the current research project, which will carry out a more detailed study of the cellular and network mechanisms underlying the generation of these oscillations and waves. The research program will be divided into three parts corresponding to three distinct neurobiological application areas: (I) epileptiform activity in a model of disinhibited neural tissue, (II) stimulus-induced coherent oscillations in a model of primary visual cortex, and (III) localized activity states in a two-layer thalamic network model of the head direction system. In each of these cases the existence and stability of coherent activity states will be analyzed, and their dependence on various biologically relevant parameters will be determined. The mathematical aspects of the work will also be applicable to other population-based biological systems, in which the basic elements at the molecular, cellular or organismal level interact nonlocally in space.<br/><br/>Analysis of the dynamical mechanisms underlying spatially structured activity states in neural tissue is crucially important for understanding a wide range of neurobiological phenomena, both naturally occurring and pathological. For example, neurological disorders such as epilepsy and migraine are characterized by waves propagating across the surface of the brain. Determining the various cellular and network properties underlying the onset of such disorders could ultimately help in developing clinical techniques for eliminating them. Spatially coherent activity states are also prevalent during the normal healthy functioning of the brain, encoding local properties of visual and auditory stimuli, encoding head direction and spatial location, and maintaining persistent activity states in short-term working memory."

The project combines interdisciplinary research experiences for advanced undergraduate students in biology and mathematics with the development of curriculums of interdisciplinary concentration areas leading to formal QSB certificate for Biology majors and MB certificate for Math majors. We define Systems Biology as an approach to studying biological systems that treats them as a whole rather than merely components.  This idea has become a paradigm of the contemporary biological research from molecular and cell biology to ecology.  With computers and computational tools facilitating exchange of information and system modeling become ubiquitous in biological research, it is anticipated that all aspects of biology in the next decade will embrace the system biology approach.  Mathematics has played a large historical role in biology, from the Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potentials to the Lotka-Volterra models in ecology.  Its role can only become larger as computational and data-gathering technologies improve. Genome sequencing is revolutionizing biology by providing large volumes of genetic data.  The goal of bioinformatics is to provide computer-based methods for getting insights into biological mechanisms underlying the ever-increasing amount of high-throughput genomic data.  The field presents one of the grand challenges of our times, with both a large basic research aspect as well as important practical applications.  With the pre-genomic era characterized by the effort to sequence the human and other most important genomes just completed, we are now entering the more difficult post-genomic era that concentrates on understanding the genomic texts.  Educating the next generation of researchers will play a critical role in the success of this endeavor.  Biologists will need to be able to use existing tools, understand their foundations, and build the new tools. Therefore, we seek to prepare our undergraduate students for this ""biocomplex future"" in all sub-disciplines of biology. We advocate neither a naive reductionism (""the whole doesn't matter"") nor a naive holism (""the parts don't matter""). Instead, we suggest a balanced approach that uses mathematical and computational models to integrate small-scale biological data to predict whole-system behavior and computational and statistical approaches to extract biological insights from large-scale biological data. There is a continuous spectrum of researchers linking mathematics and biology.  We seek to help students find their place along this spectrum and give them rigorous training in their chosen discipline and enough exposure to ""neighboring"" disciplines to allow meaningful collaboration, followed by real interdisciplinary research experiences.<br/><br/>The new educational and research training initiative at Georgia Tech:  Development and implementation of the interdisciplinary undergraduate programs in Quantitative Systems Biology (QSB) and Mathematical Biology (MB) will use interdisciplinary research-driven strategies to increase access to quality biological science and applied mathematics for talented undergraduate students. The specific goals of the QSB and MB programs are (i) enhancing undergraduate research in quantitative and mathematical biology as well as teaching and learning of these disciplines; (ii) expanding participation in these new interdisciplinary programs through attracting qualified and capable undergraduates.  To meet these goals, we will establish and add to the current biology and math curriculums new concentration areas focused on Quantitative Systems Biology and Mathematical Biology, and bring together math and biology students and faculty in yearlong research projects. The core of our project are academic-year and summer interdisciplinary research projects conducted by teams of two to four advanced undergraduates from both biology and mathematics, supervised by either a pair of biology and mathematics mentors or a single mentor already working at the bio-math interface.  Through these projects, students will get a good taste of one particular sub-discipline of biology, gain real hands-on experience in research, and learn effective ways to collaborate with others with complementary backgrounds.  Students will be able to begin research projects in their third year, and therefore could participate in more than one project to try different things or they could stay on one project to become an expert in that area. Implementation of this plan will contribute to reaching an educational goal of the nation wide scale, providing advanced training for future researchers in human health and medicine."

Deformable fragments in the protein, ranging in length from 5 to 20 amino-acids, often lead to disorder in the crystal, which makes interpretation of the electron density map difficult. At the same time, such mobile fragments can be critical to a protein's ability to bind to other molecules and thus achieve its function. This project will develop a new mathematical model for a redundant, closed, protein-like kinematic chain, and use techniques from algebraic geometry and differential topology, in particular Morse Theory, and probabilistic roadmap techniques from robotics to determine the structure of its configuration space (the self-motion manifold). Precise knowledge of the structure can be exploited to develop efficient algorithms capable of defining a probability distribution over all configurations, derived from the electron density map and an energetic model of the molecule. The objective of the program is to enable crystallographers to retrieve and study important, dynamic properties of the molecule, and furthermore to develop new algorithms for protein model building in areas of weak or ambiguous electron density. In a multimodal disordered case, the goal will be to identify all substates, along with their probabilities, and to reconstruct energetically plausible conformational pathways.<br/><br/>Proteins are the worker molecules that carry out life's essential processes. A protein's function is largely dictated by its folded, three-dimensional structure. X-ray crystallography is the most widely used experimental technique to obtain a protein's 3-D structure. Flexible fragments in the protein, vital for performing its function, are often poorly resolved in the data, and lead to structural models with gaps. This project will investigate the mathematical structure of the set of configurations of gap-closing fragments, and use these insights together with experimental data and energy models to associate a likelihood with each configuration. Algorithms will be developed to study important, dynamic properties of proteins, and to aid protein structure determination from experimental data. The research and developments described in this proposal will have a direct impact on medical research. Improved 3-D models will lead to a better understanding of a protein's function. An ability to infer the most likely configurations of a fragment, that is known to be of functional significance, may enhance structure-based drug design capabilities. It will furthermore contribute substantially to the Protein Structure Initiative's (PSI) broader mission of developing methods for automating crystallographic analysis. The program is a joint effort of the Department of Mathematics and the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, and the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (an NIGMS funded PSI center) at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The project will support the training of PhD level students at Stanford University. Computer software based on the research will be made available to the structural biology community.<br/><br/>"

These subcellular phenomena are typically modeled using Monte Carlo simulation methods.  The proposed work begins with the observation that realistic models of cardiac myocytes are required to strategically investigate the generation of cardiac arrhythmias and to develop medical device or drug interventions that can prevent this pathophysiology.  Unfortunately, widely used deterministic cardiac myocyte models do not reproduce certain cellular phenomenon in which discrete molecular events and local signaling within subcellular compartments play an essential role.  An important example is pathological excitation-contraction (EC) coupling during heart failure that is due in part to aberrant local signaling between small numbers of voltage-gated calcium channels and ryanodine receptors co-localized at the same dyadic cleft, so-called ""stochastic functional units"" (SFUs).  Another example is the phenomenon of ""graded release"" where the amount of calcium released by internal stores is a gradually increasing function of calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels.  In these cases deterministic models provide only limited mechanistic insight and stochastic cellular models only include a compact representation of subcellular events that are required to assist experimental design and interpretation.  Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations of SFUs are computationally expensive and difficult to apply at the cellular scale.  To address those issues, the development of an ""ensemble density"" approach is proposed where coupled Fokker-Planck-like equations are used to accurately represent SFU activity and the resulting independent probability density of subsarcolemmal calcium concentrations in mathematical models of normal and pathophysiological EC coupling in cardiac myocytes.  The ensemble density method will be validated using traditional Monte Carlo techniques and the computational advantage of the method explored.  A hierarchy of models will be developed and tested in the context of a joint experimental/theoretical investigation of the stochastic aspects of normal and pathological EC coupling in cardiac myocytes.<br/><br/>To summarize, many cellular processes are involved in single events that occur with a certain probability.  These seemingly random events combined determine cellular function.  The proposed research will develop methods and representations for the cardiac muscle cell incorporating discrete random events in efficient cellular models.

Quantitative models will provide a platform for for the discovery of mathematical theorems, that relate the structure of genetic circuits to their dynamics and function.

There are networks of genes that control and regulate the behavior of other genes and ultimately all biological processes. These networks of genes are analogous to electrical circuits and switches. There has been an expanding willingness and desire to use mathematical and  computational techniques to leverage all existing information regarding the structure of biological control circuitry to understand the basic rules on which they are predicated and to acquire the ability to predict their output. Understanding the  dynamics of such networks promises revolutionary changes in the treatment of human diseases as well as providing insight for the development of a new generations of robust electronic and digital devices.

In particular, the temporal structure and the amplitude of population synchrony in the network of FS neurons strongly influence the response of the full cortical microcircuit. However, while pairs of FS neurons in vivo have been shown to frequently fire in synchrony, the extent of synchrony in the population of FS neurons is not known. To understand cortical information processing, we must know how the FS network is behaving and how the cellular properties and connectivity interact to produce this behavior. We will use mathematical modeling to examine the mechanisms that shape the response of networks of inhibitory neurons in the cortex to sensory input, and thus we will provide insight into the role of inhibition in sensory information processing. Both biophysical-detailed and idealized models of the FS neuron network will be constructed, and the dynamics of the network models will be thoroughly examined using data analysis methods, numerical simulations and analytical mathematical techniques. The responses of the model network to biologically-realistic stochastic input will be studied. In particular, the influence of the correlation structure of the input, the intrinsic properties of FS cells and the connectivity within the FS network will be considered. We hypothesize that certain input to the FS network could trigger waves of activity that propagate through the network via the electrical coupling. These waves would be a novel mechanism for significant amplification of the inhibitory response. Conditions for waves in the FS model networks will be investigated and the likelihood of waves occurring in vivo will be assessed. The behavior in the models will be compared to data from in vivo experimental data, and predictions made from the modeling work will be tested in vitro experiments.<br/><br/>A major goal of neuroscience is to understand the mechanisms involved in processing sensory information in the cerebral cortex. This involves understanding how the intrinsic properties of neurons and the connectivity between neurons affect the input-output characteristics of cortical neuronal networks. It is known that inhibitory neurons, such as fast-spiking (FS) neurons, play fundamental roles in determining the response of cortical networks, however the details concerning exactly what they do and how they do it remain unclear. This modeling project will examine the response characteristics of networks of FS neurons and identify the cellular mechanisms underlying these characteristics. Thus, the work will take a step towards understanding the cellular basis of how the brain processes sensory information. The work will be part of a large body of research being done by many neuroscientists that will lead to improved treatments for complex neurological disorders such as epilepsy and attentional disorders."

Although these aggregation processes arise from diverse physical and biological contexts, their analysis reveals an underlying connection:  They all proceed by distinct succession of eras.  Large molecular aggregates start with the initial formation of tiny clusters of monomers, their subsequent growth to macroscopic size, and finally the assimilation of smaller aggregates by the larger.  The eras are 'matched' in the sense that the end of the previous era sets the conditions for the beginning of the next one.  The successive eras of electroporation, `initial charging,' `pore creation,' and `coarsening' closely resemble their counterparts in molecular aggregation.  Finally, pattern formation in myxobacteria starts with time-oscillatory waves of bacterial concentration, proceeds to the formations of more permanent concentrations called 'fruiting bodies,' and then there is a growth of the larger fruiting bodies at the expense of smaller.  This research will focus on the asymptotic and numerical analysis of the selected eras in each problem and on establishing their connection to the subsequent eras by matched asymptotic expansions, and will involve collaborators from Biomedical Engineering and Molecular and Cell Biology.<br/><br/>The three aggregation processes investigated here have important theoretical and practical applications.  The work on the creation of large molecular aggregates will address the main gap in the existing literature that prevents a global understanding of the whole process, from non-aggregated monomer units to late-stage coarsening. In addition, it informs new and fundamental problems in semiconductor fabrication.  Electroporation has great promise as a means to transfer genes and/or drugs to specific organs or cancer tumors, without poisoning the rest of the body.  However, a computationally efficient model of pore nucleation is needed for modeling of transport of drugs and genes through the electropores and for using the modeling results in the design of pulsing protocols used in experiments and in therapies.  The benefits of the myxobacteria problem lie in its long-range contribution to understanding how the multicellular life organizes itself.  This problem features the very original mechanism of pattern formation based on direct contact chemical signaling, which is radically different from the traditional mechanisms based on the long-range diffusion of morphogens but more relevant to morphogenesis in higher organisms, including humans."

Although the literature is abundant with mathematical theories of competition in mixed environments, many mathematical models fall short of directly addressing the dynamics of physiological adaptations exhibited by microbial species in response to environmental fluctuations. In our previous work, we have laid foundations for developing a comprehensive mathematical theory that fulfills this modeling niche. We have shown that predictions of these models are in close agreement with experimental data. In this project, we will provide a solid mathematical background behind the physiological theory of microbial adaptation and further extend the modeling framework to include the key physiological variables and intracellular processes that we did not consider previously. This work will provide the molecular basis for understanding extinction, coexistence, and physiological heterogeneity in complex microbial communities. This project will also address the impact of environmental perturbations on adaptive microbial ecosystems.<br/><br/>Many of the modern biotechnologies including food processing and waste water treatment are based on the controlled growth of microbial cultures, an adaptive process that is sensitive to environmental perturbations.  This project will contribute towards our understanding of the key factors that drive the physiological adaptation of microorganisms and greatly enhance our ability to control and optimize the performance of industrial bioreactors. In addition, this work will have an educational impact on graduate (and possibly undergraduate) students both through direct involvement, and through the set of research-based educational materials in microbial growth kinetics and adaptive population dynamics developed at the University of Florida."

Specifically, the model includes comprehensive fluid dynamics for a fluid flowing over a generic biofilm domain. The major advance in this model is to allow for the motion of the biofilm due to the fluid motion and growth processes. The biofilm is composed of multiple species of bacteria that consume multiple types of nutrients and produce both bacteria and exo-polymeric substance (EPS). The EPS is responsible for the redistribution of the biomass by virtue of the osmotic pressure that typifies hydrogels.  By producing EPS in regions of higher nutrient concentration, gradients of EPS concentration are set up. These gradients induce a force on the biofilm tending to equilibrate the concentration of EPS.  This physical description of biomass redistribution coupled with realistic motion of the biofilm due to growth is a substantial improvement over existing models. Much of the focus of the early investigations will concern numerical methods to incorporate the free boundary that marks the permanent separation between the bulk fluid and the biofilm regions.  The methods that we are using are based on boundary integral methods that have been used successfully to model two fluid systems with various types of boundaries (e.g. elastic, passive).  To use these methods, a generalized reciprocal theorem will be derived which includes the growth of the biofilm in the constitutive relationship. Once the reciprocal theorem is established, an integral equation can be derived that determines the velocity of the fluid/biofilm system.<br/><br/>Microbial biofilms have a significant impact on virtually all areas of our lives. While these impacts can be beneficial, such as the use of biofilms in bioremediation and wastewater treatment, the majority of current research focuses on the detrimental processes associated with biofilm contamination.  Negative impacts of biofilms include examples from such diverse areas as food service industries, chemical manufacturing plants, paper production plants and various medical settings. These impacts include increased cost, lowered efficiency, increased corrosion, fouling and increased impurities and infections. Realistic models of biofilm growth and development will aid experimentalists in proposing new experimental inquiries. Also, because detailed spatial data can be generated from model simulations more readily than by experimentation, novel hypotheses of persistent formation and detachment can be proposed based on values of concentrations and internal stresses."

Specific issues are motivated by models for activity patterns in three systems.  The first model arises in the study of the basal ganglia, a part of the brain that plays an important role in the generation of movements.  Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is associated with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea.  Experiments have demonstrated that neurons within the basal ganglia display a variety of dynamic behaviors; moreover, patterns of  activity differ between normal and pathological states.  The principal investigator is developing mathematical methods for analyzing the origins and mechanisms underlying these  firing patterns.  The principal investigator will also consider models of the  insect antennal lobe.  These neurons  exhibit complex oscillatory dynamics in response to odors; however, the mechanisms underlying both single-cell and population rhythms are not fully understood.  The principal investigator will  develop mathematical models to explore mechanisms underlying odor representations in the insect antennal lobe and their modification with learning.  Finally, the principal investigator is considering models of respiratory rhythm generation.  Breathing movements in mammals are generated by networks of neurons in the lower brain stem that produce rhythmic oscillations of neural activity. One interesting feature of this network is the apparent high degree of heterogeneity among cells.  The principal investigator will  develop analytic tools to understand how a network of heterogeneous cells can exhibit synchronized activity and how synchronization is lost as parameters in the model are varied. <br/><br/>Oscillations and other patterns of neuronal activity arise throughout the central nervous system.  These oscillations have been implicated in the generation of sleep rhythms, epilepsy, parkinsonian tremor, sensory processing, and learning.  Oscillatory behavior also arises in such physiological processes as respiration, movement, and secretion.  Models for the relevant neuronal networks often exhibit a rich structure of dynamic behavior.  Examples of population rhythms include synchronized oscillations, propagating waves and chaotic dynamics.  Computational models and mathematical analysis can be extremely useful in understanding the mechanisms underlying this complex dynamics and predicting how the dynamics may change with respect to parameters.  Specific neuronal systems to be studied in this project include the basal ganglia, a part of the brain implicated in the generation of Parkinsonian rhythms, the insect antennal lobe and the pre-Botzinger complex, a brain nuclei believed to be the origin of respiratory rhythm generation."

A large-scale, biologically realistic numerical neuronal network model will be developed for simulating how the primary visual cortex acts as a ""computer"" to make this feature recognition possible, and used to simulate a patch of the primary visual cortex of about 5 millimeters by 5 millimeters in size and containing close to a million neurons.  Coarse-grained representations of the primary visual cortex will also be developed, which treat it as a continuum rather than a set of individual neurons and incorporate the statistics of a multitude of experimental runs in the description instead of just one, thus eliminating the need for large numbers of simulations. Finally, hybrid representations will be developed, in which select groups of neurons are described by a large-scale neuronal model, while others are described by a bulk coarse-grained representation.  Such representations appear particularly promising for simulating realistic neuronal processing of stimuli in yet larger portions of the brain.<br/><br/>The models and software will be validated and showcased on two striking examples of observed processing in the primary visual cortex: patterns of spontaneous cortical activity and motion illusions.  The former were seen to encompass collective behavior of thousands of neurons on millimeter scales, and appear to get activated in areas in which neurons prefer the same orientation.  In a popular motion illusion, showing a small square immediately followed by a long bar makes the square appear as if it is ""growing"" to become the bar.  A physiological mechanism for this illusion was observed experimentally to be actual cortical activity corresponding to the perceived ""growth"" of the square into the bar, similar to that caused by real motion.  One intended task for the software and models is to explain such mechanisms governing the dynamical behavior of the primary visual cortex and underlying these and other cortical phenomena.<br/><br/>How information is processed in the visual cortex is one of the most challenging questions in neuroscience.  The proposed study of spatiotemporal activity over large scales, using a very large computational model of the primary visual cortex as well as coarse-grained theoretical methods, addresses an urgent need for scale-up in modern neuroscience, which is the theoretical complement to the recent development of multi-mode, large-scale experimental methods.  The models and software developed in this project are aimed at obtaining qualitatively and quantitatively realistic explanations of the biological mechanisms that underlie neuronal computations in the primary visual cortex, and possibly other cortical areas. The software will be made readily accessible to a large group of researchers across the neurosciences, with the aim that its results will help science make significant inroads into theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of sensory perception and possibly other brain functions."

These neurons are the first cells in the olfactory system that extend from the nose to the brain.  The conversion of a chemical signal, the odor, into an electrical signal, appropriate for processing in the brain, is carried out by two sets of ion channels embedded in the membrane (surface layer) of the cilia.  An interdisciplinary research group involving professors and graduate students in Mathematics and Experimental Neuroscience will develop procedures to determine the distributions of these channels through experimentation and the computer solution of a mathematical model.  In a typical experiment, ligands for a specific channel type will be allowed to diffuse into a cilium, leading to a current after the molecules bind.  The recorded current is the input data for the mathematical model.  To determine the ion channel distribution at this stage requires the solution of an inverse or distributed parameter identification problem (DPIP) which is a nontrivial extension of more standard such problems.  The main objectives of the work are the development of appropriate experimental procedures, mathematical models, and the solution of the resulting DPIPs.  Both computational and analytical or perturbation approaches will be considered as will generalizations to other related situations.<br/><br/>Identification of detailed features in neuronal systems, such as the distributions of ion channels in cilia, forms an important challenge in the biosciences today.  Although the properties of the olfactory channels have been determined, the distributions of the channels along the cilia are unknown.  These distributions are crucial in determining the time course of the neuronal response. This work will have applications outside of olfaction in other areas in the brain such as the photoreceptor cells in the retina or the dendrites in the neocortex.  It is also expected that this research will advance our understanding of the mathematics of inverse problems.  Further, models of olfactory transduction are relevant to efforts to create mechanical-chemical ""noses"" for the detection of hazardous biological and chemical agents.  The interdisciplinary nature of the research is also critical.  It will enhance the infrastructure at the University of Cincinnati while providing interdisciplinary training to the students."
