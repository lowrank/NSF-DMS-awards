A mathematical model was developed based on the hypothesis that 48-hour ovulation cycles synchronize through social stimulation.  This project builds on the results of the pilot study in the following three ways: 1) The mechanisms by which reproductive synchrony occurs are investigated, in which the investigators explore possible olfactory, auditory, and visual channels of communication.  2) Three classes of mathematical models are studied in order to understand the process of synchronization, the effects of synchrony on population growth and decline, and possible selective advantages of reproductive synchrony.  3) Theory is rigorously connected with data on a project involving a vertically integrated research team in which the training of undergraduates and underrepresented groups is a major focus.<br/><br/>Examples of synchrony have been documented in a wide variety of electrical, mechanical, chemical, and biological systems, including the menstrual cycles of women and estrous cycles of rats.  Socially-stimulated ovulation synchrony in birds is analogous to menstrual synchrony in women and estrous cycles in rats, and constitutes the first example of ovulation synchrony in a non-mammalian species.  Documentation of ovulation synchrony in both birds and mammals suggests the existence of taxonomically widespread and fundamental physiological and adaptive processes that deserve further attention.  Analysis of this phenomenon provides insight into three new classes of mathematical models.  Moreover, participation by undergraduates, especially those in underrepresented groups, at every stage of this interdisciplinary research produces young scientists literate in the techniques of quantitative biology."

Although extremely promising, massive data produced by RNA-seq, substantial biases, and uncertainty in short read alignment pose daunting challenges for researchers when analyzing RNA-seq data. Most of the current analytic programs enumerate total number of tags landed within each exon and use normalized counts as the expression measure. Such methods ignore variation and correlation in sequencing depth within an exon, which may result in less accurate expression measures. Because the correlation between the read counts of adjacent bases depends on the distance between them, it is referred to as spatial correlation. Large base-specific variations and between-bases spatial correlations make naive approaches, such as averaging to normalizing RNA-seq data and quantifying gene/isoform expressions, ineffective.  The presence of location-specific variation as well as spatial correlation is an outstanding characteristic of many spatial data in Geostatistics, Spatial Epidemiology, and image processing, and it has been studied in the literature of Spatial Statistics. In this project, the investigators propose to apply and extend the ideas, models and methodologies rooted in Spatial Statistics to model and analyze RNA-seq data. In particular, the investigators develop spatial Poisson mixed effects models including a hierarchical model and a mixture model to accommodate biases, variations, and correlations present in RNA-seq data so as to accurately estimate gene/isoform expression levels and to facilitate gene/isoform expression comparison and novel transcript structure or activities discovery. Furthermore, the investigators will apply the proposed methods to analyze real RNA-seq data generated from prostate cancer and psoriasis transcriptomic studies. <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>Monitoring gene expression levels genome-wide is important for understanding the mechanisms of many biological processes.  In the past decade, microarray has been the main tool in laboratories for measuring gene expression levels. Recently, RNA-seq, an emerging new technology, has been shown to offer key advantages over microarray in measuring gene expression profiles. However, existing methods for quantifying expression levels from RNA-seq data are crude and unsatisfactory. This greatly compromises the power of RNA-seq for genomic and transcriptomic studies. In this project, having carefully investigated the unique characteristics of RNA-seq data, the investigators propose a series of advanced statistical models, and aim to develop effective and efficient methods for RNA-seq data analysis. The methods generated from this project will greatly benefit a fast growing community of researchers who are planning to conduct RNA-seq experiments with data analysis. Furthermore, this project also constitutes a significant contribution to the advance of statistical methodology development. The investigators will also develop and support open-source computer software for RNA-seq data analysis based on the methods resulting from this project and make it freely available to the public online."

These problems typically involve the movement of a flexible appendage in a fluid where both inertia and viscosity are important. The fundamental computational challenge associated with these problems is the accurate and efficient simulation of the moving, flexible structure in the surrounding fluid. One aim is to extend numerical methods for Stokes flow to Reynolds numbers on the order of 1 to 10. These methods will then be applied to aerodynamics problems involving flow through bristled wings. Another aim is to incorporate viscous effects into vortex sheet methods, in order to more accurately simulate flows over a wider range of scales. These tools will then be used to understand the importance of active control of fish fin rays and other instances of fluid interactions with organisms. Finally, this work will allow for comparisons of propulsion mechanisms and numerical methods across a wide range of Reynolds numbers.<br/><br/>The numerical methods and models developed in this research project can be applied to numerous and diverse biological fluid-structure interactions problems. Some examples beyond those specific to the proposal include the pumping of blood by the heart, the flow of air in the lungs, drag reduction in flexible materials such as leaves and sessile organisms, and the dispersal of seeds in air and larvae in water. The broader impacts of this work include the improved understanding of propulsion mechanics that can be used for the design of micro air and water vehicles; the development of computational tools which are useful to study optimization questions in biology; rich examples of nonlinear dynamics for physics; research mentoring to undergraduates in experimental and modeling work and graduate students in computational and modeling research. The outreach component will help more students achieve autonomy in research and critical thinking through independent research projects. This project also addresses one of the seven questions posed by the National Academy of Sciences on the role of theory in advancing 21st century biology: ``what are the engineering principles of life?''"

This work develops models for phyllotactic patterning based on experimental insights on the interaction between biochemistry and biomechanics in plant morphogenesis, and derives equations governing defects in phyllotactic patterns.  Data will be gathered on the shape of leaf buds, wavelet methods applied to analyze the patterns, the model tested experimentally with gels that mimic biological growth, and the packing properties of the patterns studied.  Models for the growth of individual plant cells will also be extended to models for the growth of cells in tissue.  Mathematical techniques involved include multiple scales analysis and tools from dynamical systems theory.  Collaborators include Isaac Chenchiah, Todd Cooke, and Alan Newell.<br/><br/>Biologists are becoming increasingly aware that mechanical stimuli interact with biochemical pathways in plants as well as animals.  Clarifying the mechanisms and properties of these intricate interactions, while experimentally very challenging, has the potential to impact our understanding of many physiological processes.  This project focuses on modeling the biochemical and biomechanical processes involved in the patterning of leaf buds at plant apices, a topic that has intrigued scientists for centuries and that is currently the subject of much experimental work.  Patterns observed on plants present unique variations on  planforms of ripples, hexagons, or squares observed in many laboratory and natural systems such as cloud formations, animal coats, and fluid convection experiments.  These variations provide us with potential clues on the competition and cooperation between mechanisms.    The modeling and mathematical analysis is complemented by the development of simple experimental systems in which the models can be tested on gels in a laboratory, with more control over parameters than in biological systems.  The involvement of undergraduate and graduate students is an integral part of both the theoretical and experimental components of the project."

This is especially challenging since biological processes often exhibit organization and coupling over a wide hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales.  This can be readily seen when observing cellular structures, such as the lipid-protein bilayer membrane encasing the cell or the intricate filament architecture of the cytoskeleton.  It is expected that this organization is not only designed to have mechanics which allow the cell to resist outside perturbations from the environment, but also to be readily regulated and to provide feedback on cellular processes.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research aims to contribute to this area by the formulation of new paradigms and the investigation of specific hypotheses.  For lipid-protein membranes, mechanisms will be investigated for how mechanical stresses in the bilayer alter protein conformations, protein aggregation and depletion, and protein mobility.  For the cytoskeleton, mechanisms will be investigated for how bulk mechanical properties change when augmenting the filament architecture and  interactions through passive linkers and active motor proteins.  These will be explored through a combination of large-scale computational simulation studies performed by the PI and through experimental studies carried out by collaborators.

This project investigates the spatial bistable dynamics and related pattern formation problems occurring in  biological sciences.  Typical interactions between species are of consumer-resource (predator-prey) type, and phenomena caused by bistability and spatial dispersal include  catastrophic shifts in water-limited ecosystems, desertification of grassland with water shortage, success or failure of marine species population restoration, and also autocatalytic chemical reactions with deep biochemistry implications.  Often accompanying the bistable dynamics are the spatiotemporal patterns observed in experiments or in nature, such as the self-organized patchiness of many ecosystems like lakes, grassland, deserts and oceans, or spot, stripe and labyrinths spatial patterns in biochemical reactions with positive feedback.  New mathematical tools in nonlinear elliptic, parabolic partial differential equations, bifurcation theory and infinite dimensional dynamical systems are developed to understand the stationary and evolution problems in the complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Emphasis is on analyzing and undertanding the nonlinear phenomena which cannot be obtained through linearization, and formulating universal natural principles not bounded by specific mathematical models.<br/><br/>Research in this project helps to give scientific explanation to phenomena such as marine species population collapse, catastrophic environment shifts from grassland and forest to desert and arid areas, and global climate changes.  A specific component of the project is to model and simulate the native oyster (or other marine species) population, which provides direct guidance to state and federal government efforts to restore oyster population by reconstructing habitat reefs in several Chesapeake Bay locations.  Theoretical investigation in this project provides specific suggestions to the design of reef construction and larvae release.  Training on qualitative and mathematical analysis and ecological modeling is provided to undergraduate students in  College of William and Mary and other institutes, and graduate students in marine sciences from Virginia Institute of Marine Science, which broadens trainees' background and perspective, and enhances the mathematical science and marine science workforce in the 21st century.

A hallmark of cell polarity is spatial localization.  From a modeling point of view, spatial localization cannot be understood without proper modeling of the spatial dynamics governing its creation and time evolution.  At the same time, spatial dynamics are profoundly influenced by stochastic events that manifest as cellular noise. Therefore, deep understanding of cell polarity inevitably requires the proper modeling, simulation, and analysis of stochastic spatial dynamics.  The fundamental problem limiting work in this area in the past has been the computational complexity of stochastic spatial simulations.  This project develops the experimental data and algorithms for modeling, simulation and analysis of spatial stochastic dynamics arising in cell polarity in the yeast pheromone response system.  A novel algorithm is developed to address the computationally intensive task of spatial stochastic simulation.  The algorithm is then further developed and then integrated into a powerful software infrastructure to enable its widespread use.  Experiments capable of capturing stochastic variability inform model development and analysis.<br/><br/>Software developed as a result of this project enables routine simulation of highly complex spatial stochastic phenomena across the sciences and engineering.  All software will be made widely available.  Tutorial courses and presentations at meetings and workshops will be given to ensure the accessibility of the research.  Graduate students involved in this project are provided with a unique, highly multidisciplinary research experience.  Students at UCSB work as a tightly-knit team co-advised by Petzold and Khammash, with extended visits to UCI to work in Yi's experimental lab, learning about the possibilities and limitations of the experimental techniques.

The protein folding problem has been studied for three decades, and despite the great progress in recent years, there are still many questions to be answered. Only with the synergy of experimentalists and theoreticians from diverse disciplines will this challenge be answered. Moreover, there are now new computational tools along with new experimental techniques being developed for the studies of in vivo and in vitro protein folding. It is very important to bring together these scientists who are pioneering these quantitative approaches to create a novel collaboration for answering the challenges in protein folding. This workshop in Tempe, Arizona, May 9-13, 2010, will bring together a select group of some of the world's leading scientists from physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering. All have unique expertise in various aspects of protein folding, experimentation, and computational modelling. Protein folding has advanced in recent years with the use of high performance computing. The workshop will address the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of protein folding and the role of flexibility in protein sequence-structure-function relationship. Simulation and theoretical methods will be discussed in application to protein stability, folding, specific pathways and enzymatic activity.  <br/><br/>Proteins are among the most incredible molecular machines in living systems. Not only are they accurate, proficient and specific, but they also have the rare ability to acquire new functions and structures to carry out a diverse set of functions, from enzymes to cytoskeleton to membrane channels. When a protein folds into its unique 3-dimensional structure, it starts immediately performing its function that has been evolved through the years. Thus, protein folding is central in understanding of living things. The list of workshop participants represents a truly impressive and wide-ranging cast of established leaders in the field, plus some younger people who are starting to make an impact. The meeting is designed to consist of a set of highly focused and intimate sessions. Understanding protein folding and hence mis-folding, has implications for health and medicine.  We will open the meeting to local attendees from Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, including graduate students and postdocs."

More specifically, the investigators focus on several key pieces of the pathways responsible for encoding of the interaural time differences (ITDs).  ITD encoding is thought to be particularly important for localization of low-frequency sound sources or low-frequency-modulated sound sources.  First, the role of active dendritic conductances in auditory coincidence detectors is explored.  Second, the researchers investigate and classify the ranges of parameters, cellular types, and types of interaction that improve or decrease the precision and reliability of the timing information.  Third, a systematic study of a periodically driven neuronal model with additive white or colored noise as a stochastic dynamical system is conducted.  Finally, a computational model of the early auditory pathway with natural or electrical (cochlear implant) stimulation is built.  This model is used to study responses of cells to the interaural time differences in the amplitude modulated signal. All four components of the project contribute to a longer-term goal to build a comprehensive model for designing and testing new protocols for binaural electrical stimulations.  The research activities result in the creation of new computational tools for studying the auditory system, as well as other neuroscience applications.  This research also requires the development of new analytical techniques that further the mathematical research, and can be used by computational neuroscientists, probabilists, and applied mathematicians.<br/><br/>Cochlear implants are prosthetic devices that allow restoration of hearing for people with severely impaired hearing.  In normal hearing air vibrations produced by auditory stimuli are transformed by the auditory receptors into electrical signals, which travel along the auditory nerve to the brain.  In a patient with a cochlear implant this process is replaced by the direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve.  Hence, the success of the procedure crucially depends on the algorithms of converting sounds to electrical signals.  To look at it differently, the success depends on our understanding of the neural coding of the normally functioning early auditory processing.  Of special interest, recently, is the binaural processing (using information from both ears) as binaural cochlear implantation is becoming available.  In this project, several key pieces of the pathways involved in a binaural task of sound source localization are the primary focus.  Using a combination of mathematical modeling, computer simulations and theoretical analysis, the role of detailed geometrical structure of the cells, types of interaction, specific membrane channels, and tolerance to imperfect (noisy) inputs is investigated.  These are components of a longer-term goal to build a comprehensive model for designing and testing new protocols for binaural electrical stimulations."

Because these circuits are so complicated and the details of the circuitry vary from person to person, our understanding of the brain remains limited. In this project the Principal Investigator will study fundamental questions relating circuit structure and dynamics in the brain. One thing we do know about the brain is that neural circuits change, from infancy through young adulthood and into our later years. Some of these changes are part of healthy developmental transitions, such as an infant becoming able to sleep through the night or an adolescent entering puberty; other changes are pathological, such as the loss of a particular group of neurons in the sleep disorder narcolepsy. In close collaboration with laboratory scientists, the Principal Investigator seeks both to characterize these neural changes and to determine the underlying neural mechanisms. She will focus on three areas: (1) puberty, (2) sleep-wake regulation, and (3) systems of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. Changes in the cells of neural circuits can alter the activity of these neurotransmitters, with sometimes profound effects on important human behaviors such as feeding, mood, and social interactions. The Principal Investigator will carry out these investigations by studying mathematical models of different brain circuits, using mathematics that she is developing for this purpose.<br/>Mathematical investigations will include developing the theory of mixed mode oscillations, studying how stochastic dynamics on graphs change as the graph changes, using spectral analysis to understand how graph structure determines the general character of the distribution of absorption times of Markov processes, and developing the theory of doubly stochastic processes. These investigations will give understanding of the normal functioning of particular neural circuits and also help to explain what goes wrong in neuropsychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases. The Investigator will use her extensive experience in teaching, recruiting, and mentoring students to design a new pipeline program in Ohio that will encourage students to choose careers in science."

Work will consist of (1) characterization of important parameters through on-site microsensor measurements, laboratory analyses of chemistry of water column samples, and gene sequencing (and accompanying analysis) of microbial inhabitants both in the mats as well as in the water, as well as (2) community modeling of the mat ecosystem.

Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) are estimated to make up approximately half of extant biomass. Most of these microbes live in complex biofilm communities that exploit available sources of chemical free energy. As such, they are key components of almost all geochemical cycles, they are responsible for a large percentage of the global photosynthesis budget, they are everpresent threats to all multicellular organisms (which are, in the eyes of a microbe, appealing sources of free energy and substrates), while, at the same time, they assist in digestion in all animals (we bring free energy to them, and they help extract it), and so on. By any measure, ecology of these microbes, and the communities in which they reside, is a topic of keen interest. Microbial communities are able to react comparatively quickly to environmental variations, particularly those relatively slow, secular changes of the sort that are of wide current interest. Thus they potentially present a useful statistic for effects of climate change on the environment. However, a better understanding of the workings of these ecosystems will be essential before such information can be extracted. Microbial communities are also of increasing interest in many engineered systems (including, of particular relevance to this proposal, photosynthetically-driven microbial biofuel production). One of the most important challenges in these efforts, as in almost all engineered microbial systems, is ecological stability: microbial communities will evolve fairly rapidly to suit their own purposes, purposes which may not be consistent with the engineering goals of efficient, commercial-scale fuel production. With all of these points as motivation, this proposal aims to advance the state of microbial community population theory through a coordinated study of mathematical modeling with field and laboratory study."

For example, experiments have revealed the existence of a neuronal rhythm-generating system in the mammalian brainstem that maintains a stable respiratory rhythm and another in the mammalian spinal cord that drives limbed locomotion, both subject to feedback control.  This research project will lead to new insights, and generate new predictions, about how the intrinsic properties of neurons, the characteristics of their interactions, and the features of feedback signals contribute to the generation and modulation of these and other neuronal rhythms. Particular issues that will be investigated are the roles of specific ionic currents and the specific patterns of connections between respiratory neurons in generating synchronized bursting, or alternation of activity between silent and active periods, and in switching between different phases of respiration; the effectiveness of particular feedback control targets and signals in regulating respiratory neuron activity under changing environmental or metabolic demands; the relative contributions of rhythmic neuronal activity and of mechanical constraints and feedback signals to asymmetries in locomotor gait phase durations seen in response to changes in top-down drive; and possible mechanisms that can yield recovery of locomotor rhythms if loss of top-down drive associated with spinal cord injury occurs.  Results in these areas will be achieved through the mathematical analysis of neuronal network models constrained by experimental data.  The models will consist of coupled systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, with different model components often evolving at disparate rates. Techniques of fast/slow decomposition and geometric singular perturbation theory, bifurcation analysis, averaging, map derivation, and direct simulation will all be applied to develop new insights and predictions about the dynamics of respiratory and locomotor rhythms as well as general principles of neuronal rhythmogenesis.<br/><br/>Respiration and locomotion are among the many rhythmic neuro-mechanical processes that can be maintained without direct voluntary inputs.  Significant research efforts have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms through which respiratory and locomotor rhythms are produced and altered in response to changing environmental and metabolic conditions, yet many aspects of this rhythm generation and feedback regulation remain unknown. This research project will address several such open questions using the development of mathematical models constrained by experimental data as well as computer simulations and mathematical analysis of these models. In the context of respiration, this research will consider coordination of activity patterns of key rhythmically active brainstem neurons that drive muscle movements associated with respiration as well as the interaction of these neurons with feedback controls that adjust network activity to handle changing demands. These steps will be performed in collaboration with two neuroscience labs, providing direct access to experimental data and testing of model predictions. In the setting of limbed locomotion, this project will focus on a model that combines a neuronal rhythm generation system and a mechanical limb that it drives, which sends feedback signals, related to muscle actions, back to the rhythm generator. The research in this area will include analysis of how the interactions of these neuronal and mechanical components generate the properties of limbed locomotion as well as of mechanisms that can yield recovery of locomotor rhythms if damage associated with spinal cord injury occurs, which may help guide the development of therapeutic interventions currently under investigation to restore locomotion in individuals with such injuries."

A kinetic theory approach is used to describe the probability densities of the positions and velocities of all the particles. The mathematical analysis is adapted from theories used to describe ensembles of molecules, to include self-propulsion.  The resulting equations provide a means by which statistical properties of a collection of hydrodynamically interacting, self-propelled particles can be computed.  Using these methods, three properties of the dynamics of self-propelled particles are explored--their hydrodynamic coupling, their birth and death, and their interactions with boundaries.<br/><br/>The dynamics of self-propelled particles is a physical model relevant to a wide range of real-world systems including animal swarming, bacterial swimming, and multi-robot ensembles.  New, more efficient mathematical tools are needed to efficiently compute the main properties of swarms of particles. This project develops such tools using kinetic theory, in which functions describing the probabilities of each particle having a certain position and velocity.  Equations that these functions obey are derived and their solutions explored and analyzed.  Using the appropriate equations, the investigators study how particles couple to each other through their common fluid environment, how particles annihilate and reproduce, and how particles behave near solid boundaries.  Applications of the insight gained during this project include potentially a mechanistic understanding of how bacterial biofilms form, how aquatic organisms optimize their swimming, and how a collection of communicating man-made robots, such as autonomous marine vehicles, can be better controlled."

They are believed to be crucial in the regulation of cardiac activity in response to stress.  The purpose of this project is to investigate the effects of caveolar currents on cardiac electrophysiology.  In cardiac myocytes, caveolae are known to contain ion channels and their necks can be open or closed in response to adrenergic stimulation.  In the open configuration, the caveolar necks create a low resistance pathway to the extracellular space thus presenting additional ion channels to the membrane.  However, in the closed configuration, the caveolae and their ion channels are isolated from the plasma membrane and extracellular space.  Caveolae are ubiquitous in cardiac myocytes (roughly 20,000-25,000 per cell) and application of a beta agonist has been shown trigger the opening of caveolar necks leading to an increase in sodium current of up to 40%.  This caveolar current is incorporated into mathematical models of cardiac electrophysiology in order to address three fundamental questions.  First, what is the role of caveolae in healthy heart?  Answering this question requires simulations with a biophysically detailed model of the ventricular myocyte which includes the caveolar current.  Changes in both single action potentials and periodically paced tissue are explored.  Analysis (primarily dynamical systems, bifurcations and asymptotics) of a more tractable reduced model is also used to understand the results.  Second, what is the behavior of caveolae in the closed configuration?  The fundamental idea is that the channels inside a closed caveolae are exposed to a different voltage and different ionic concentration.  These channels will therefore be in a different state than those on the exterior membrane and will behave differently when the caveolae opens.  Because there are only a small number of channels per caveolae and because the caveolae are so small that the movement of a single ion across the membrane creates a significant change in voltage, a combination of continuum-deterministic and discrete-stochastic modeling is used.  Third, how do mutations in the structural protein caveolin-3 lead to changes in the action potential and arrhythmias?   The investigators hypothesize that caveolin-3 mutations can lead to changes in the opening and closing dynamics of the caveolar neck and that in some cases the neck can flicker open and close more quickly so that a single caveolae may change state one or more times within a single action potential.  A probability density approach is used in which the density of states of the caveolae evolves.<br/><br/>Changes in the primary structural protein for caveolae, known as caveolin-3 can cause a host of caveolinopathies such as muscular dystrophy, hyperCKemia, myopathy, long QT syndrome (specifically LQTS9) and sudden infant death syndrome (LQTS3-like).  Caveolae are therefore believed to play a key role in the regulation of cardiac electrical activity.  However, their effect has not yet been incorporated into existing cardiac models.  This project is among the first to model the regulatory effects of caveolae.  Preliminary results show that including the dynamics of caveolae can have dramatic and unexpected effects on the cardiac action potential.  This is a paradigm shift in caveolar research since the work up to this point has focused on the role of caveolae in signaling rather than their effects on electrophysiology.  The long term goal of this research is to understand the role of caveolae as part of the healthy human adrenergic response and to investigate the various pathologies associated with caveolar mutations."

By integrating experimental data with sophisticated, multi-scale mathematical and computational models, the potential for breakthroughs that will significantly further the understanding of tumor biology are great, thereby addressing a pressing national and global need. <br/><br/>Solid tumors are complex micro-structured materials, where the three-dimensional tissue architecture (morphology) and dynamics are coupled in complex, nonlinear ways to cellular characteristics and to molecular composition and structure of the growth environment. This close connection between the tumor morphology and the underlying cellular/molecular dynamics has fundamental scientific importance in that the cellular dynamics that give rise to various tumor morphologies also control its ability to invade the host tissue. This allows observable properties of the tumor, such as its morphology, to be used to both understand the underlying cellular physiology and predict the tumors invasion potential. In particular, the conjecture that diverse morphologic patterns of invasion observed during tumor growth are the quantitatively predictable result of molecular inhomogeneity (of both composition and structure) in the tumors growth environment will be tested. Because tumor cells use similar or identical migration and proliferation mechanisms as normal cells, and because of the multi-scale nature of these processes, the mathematical modeling, analysis and simulation that will be conducted in this project will also have application in understanding normal functional processes during development, wound-healing, stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. This project will also establish a new collaboration among five institutions and broadens the participation of women and minorities in research as trainees in the investigators? groups, thereby addressing national needs. It will provide interdisciplinary training with theoreticians and experimentalists at the interface between mathematics and tumor cell biology. Finally, a month-long summer COSMOS (California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science) course at UC Irvine will be developed for high school students on these topics. This course enhances the participation of gifted high school students in research, and helps to recruit new math and science undergraduates, which addresses another national need."

One aim is to extend numerical methods for Stokes flow to Reynolds numbers on the order of 1 to 10. These methods will then be applied to aerodynamics problems involving flow through bristled wings. Another aim is to incorporate viscous effects into vortex sheet methods, in order to more accurately simulate flows over a wider range of scales.

The specificity of cellular responses to receptor  stimulation is encoded by the spatial and temporal dynamics of downstream signaling networks. In recent years, it has become apparent that distinct spatial-temporal activation profiles of the same repertoire of signaling proteins result in different gene activation patterns and diverse physiological responses. In many cases, spatially localized scaffold proteins that bind and organize multiple proteins into complexes within a pathway have merged as essential factors in shaping the quantitative response behavior of a pathway. In order for a better exploration of spatially localized scaffold proteins in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, the first part of the project is to explore the roles of substrate sequestration in combination with multisite phosphorylation for the modulation of ultrasensitivity and multistabilities. For the second part of the project, guided by known experimental observations, the PI proposes to develop mathematical models to further computationally investigate how a spatially localized and moving scaffold interacts with other components in a cascade and promotes specific cellular responses with spatial-temporal dynamics, such as long-range signals, graded/binary responses, noise reduction and traveling waves. Furthermore, in order to meet the computational challenges and demands which arise from the mathematical models of above complicated biological systems, the PI will design and implement more efficient and more accurate numerical methods than are currently done for convection and reaction-diffusion coupled equations with complex and moving geometries in high-spatial dimensions. Through mathematical modeling and computational analysis, the PI hopes that this proposed work may be able to shed lights on such a fundamental question: What do localized scaffold proteins really do?<br/><br/>Errors in cellular information processing are responsible for a variety of life-threatening or chronic diseases, such as cancer, autoimmunity and diabetes. This project seeks to provide better understanding on proper signal propagation across the cell in space and time, and such quantitative studies closely combined with experiments will deepen and advance our understanding of signal transduction inside the cell and thus may lead to design new drugs for a better treatment of above-mentioned diseases. In addition, the computational tools developed in this work will make computational exploration of complex biological systems more efficient, by reducing simulation time and at the same time producing more accurate solution through the integrated use of fast numerical solvers, front tracking method and adaptive mesh refinement.<br/>The developed mathematical and computational methods are also expected to have a broad impact on the studies of a large class of many other biological systems when interactions and transport of many bio-chemical species are involved with complex and moving geometries, and other special target applications are but not limited to protein trafficking and embryonic development. In addition, a critical ingredient for the success of this and related projects is the education and training of the next generation of mathematicians with expertise in mathematical biology and computation. Therefore this research project will provide and enhance multi-disciplinary training at the interface among mathematics, scientific computing and biology for both graduate and undergraduate students."

The stochastic evolution of molecular sequences on such a phylogeny is an instance of a Markov model on a tree. In this project, the PI will further develop connections between the theory of Gibbs measures on trees and the phylogenetic reconstruction problem.

More detailed understanding of evaporation and lipid layer dynamics, especially as applied to tear film breakup and osmolarity variation, will emerge from this work.  Two methods will be used in the computational approaches to these problems. For eye-shaped domains, an overset grid method via the Overture framework from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory provides much of the software capability needed to manage complex boundaries; some solvers specific to the tear film problems have been and are developed at Delaware.

Differences in parasite strain, host and vector species (primarily raccoons, opossums, and woodrats, and the insect vectors Triatoma sanguisuga and gerstaeckeri), and their characteristics give each cycle distinct dynamics, but vector dispersal couples them together.  Climate changes, both long-term and seasonal, affect these dynamics by regulating vector behavior, creating a potential for geographical invasion of non-native strains, while observed cross-immunity between strains in the U.S., together with parasite adaptations particular to each cycle, set up a competition between strains that may allow native (enzootic) strains to form a barrier to such invasion.<br/><br/>The project develops detailed small-scale models (agent-based as well as analytical) to study how local effects (like dispersal) affect global dynamics, detailed large-scale models to study the result-ing global dynamics, with classical metapopulation models (dynamical systems with both ordinary and stochastic differential equations) as a baseline from which to derive not only the more detailed models but also qualitative analytical and probabilistic results which can be used to anticipate and interpret numerical results.  Four structural phases of the project develop corresponding models at low and high spatial resolution on local and regional scales, while overlaid across all model frameworks is the study of climate effects on vector feeding, maturation, mobility, and subsequent infection rates.  The mathematical focus of the project is the development of a multi-level modeling approach in which local and global factors influence each other, while the biology centers around the need to understand the complex interactions between the evolutionary adaptations to different transmission avenues (stercorarian, vertical and oral) made by T. cruzi in response to local vector behavior, changes in vector behavior driven by differences in temperature and humidity, and the communications between transmission cycles caused by dispersal.

In recent years, systems biology has emerged as a discipline to examine biological complexity from the point-of-view of integrated systems rather than separate components (the reductionists? point-of-view). A systems approach may help to resolve many fundamental issues in the life sciences that relate to systems-level interactions rather than individual biomolecular species. To achieve a full systems-level description, many new analytical techniques and theories need to be developed, in addition to new experimental advances. One major challenge concerns computational modeling of biological dynamics by differential equations. Due to the complexity of any particular biochemical control system, a large number of variables and parameters are needed to describe its dynamics. To have the desired predictive power, the values of these parameters need to be determined with sufficient precision, but for most systems the requisite experimental data are not available. This is a general problem in many areas of science, including physics and chemistry, where the powerful Mori-Zwanzig projection method is widely used for studying Hamiltonian dynamics. In this method, the complex dynamical system is first separated into primary and secondary subsystems.  Through systematic information contraction, one can focus on the primary system, which contains the variables of primary interest (in particular, experimentally resolvable variables). The secondary subsystem is not treated explicitly, but its effect on the primary system is properly accounted for mathematically. In this proposal, the researchers will develop a general formalism and numerical algorithms for non-Hamiltonian systems without detailed balance, with a focus on cellular regulatory networks. The method will be especially useful in three cases: 1) where a coarse-grained model is desirable, or available data prevents a more detailed model; 2) where the network under study is embedded in a larger network; and 3) where one wants to perform multi-scale modeling. <br/><br/>The proposed methods will provide a powerful tool for systems biologists to approach the ultimate goals of understanding complex biological processes and of  improving human health. One encounters similar situations, of dealing with a complex system with incomplete information, in many other research areas, for example: financial transactions, the power supply network, and the spread and evolution of viruses during an epidemic or a bioterrorist attack."

Consequently, the immune system attempts to build a response that is broad enough to handle the diversity of virus strains present. Biological experiments have shown that neutralizing antibodies fail to offer long-term protection because they are primarily strain-specific and lag behind viral evolution. The proposed research presents a thorough investigation of the antibody mediated immune responses against HIV with an emphasis on their neutralizing and non-neutralizing activity. Novel mathematical models of antibody responses following infection with HIV are developed, analyzed using asymptotic analysis, bifurcation analysis and numerical analysis, and validated against biological data in order to quantify the relative importance of biological processes in influencing disease evolution. The investigator aims to discover which factors (host or virus specific) influence the outcome of the infection. The specific goals are in understanding (1) the roles of competition and cross-reactivity between families of neutralizing antibodies in the presence and absence of virus evolution; (2) the necessity of antibodies to neutralize every viral spike; and (3) the role of non-neutralizing antibodies. All these questions will have implications for vaccine development as well as for disease prognosis.<br/>The ability of HIV to persist in an infected individual and eventually cause AIDS depends on its avoidance of the immune system. Of the two immune mechanisms present, the cellular response is better understood, while the antibody response is still under investigation. Understanding of how antibodies respond to the virus is crucial for the success of any future vaccine candidate, especially since current therapeutic vaccines focus on inducing both arms of the immune response. The goal of this proposal is to investigate how particular biological interactions can lead to an efficient antibody response during both immunization and natural infection with HIV. Given the difficulty and cost of experimentally examining all of the biological interactions involved, we consider alternative methods for testing new hypotheses. They consist of the development, analysis and validation against biological data of mathematical models, with the goal of providing insight into the dynamics of antibody responses. This knowledge may eventually guide treatment and prevention, and assist in establishing immunological goals for an effective AIDS vaccine.

A kinetic theory approach is used to describe the probability densities of the positions and velocities of all the particles. The mathematical analysis is adapted from theories used to describe ensembles of molecules, to include self-propulsion.  The resulting equations provide a means by which statistical properties of a collection of hydrodynamically interacting, self-propelled particles can be computed.  Using these methods, three properties of the dynamics of self-propelled particles are explored--their hydrodynamic coupling, their birth and death, and their interactions with boundaries.<br/><br/>The dynamics of self-propelled particles is a physical model relevant to a wide range of real-world systems including animal swarming, bacterial swimming, and multi-robot ensembles.  New, more efficient mathematical tools are needed to efficiently compute the main properties of swarms of particles. This project develops such tools using kinetic theory, in which functions describing the probabilities of each particle having a certain position and velocity.  Equations that these functions obey are derived and their solutions explored and analyzed.  Using the appropriate equations, the investigators study how particles couple to each other through their common fluid environment, how particles annihilate and reproduce, and how particles behave near solid boundaries.  Applications of the insight gained during this project include potentially a mechanistic understanding of how bacterial biofilms form, how aquatic organisms optimize their swimming, and how a collection of communicating man-made robots, such as autonomous marine vehicles, can be better controlled."

This is why analysis of separate elements does not give a satisfactory view of the syncope mechanisms.  In this study, the aim is to achieve a better understanding of the control mechanisms and their dynamics via patient specific mathematical modeling where knowledge of the individual elements and their dynamics is integrated.  To this end, a dynamic cardiovascular system model coupled with a control model is developed that allows the investigators to predict the autonomic nervous system's ability to adjust the heart and vessel properties to maintain blood pressure and pumping function of the heart at reference levels.  Several control models are considered including a detailed cellular model allowing prediction of the afferent baroreflex firing-rate based on analysis of ionic currents, a lumped model predicting efferent responses (changes in heart and vascular properties) as a function of sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow, and a coarse model directly predicting efferent responses.  For the latter model, the applicability of receding horizon control theory is investigated.  These models are composed of nonlinear dynamical systems whose solution poses considerable computational challenges.  Their application to clinical data involves computational and conceptual complications due to the inherent noise in the model and data.  To ensure high fidelity of our model, the investigators employ methodologies allowing computation of parameter sensitivity, identifiability, and estimation.  Sensitivity and identifiability analyses are used to formulate guidelines for model calibration including the selection of parameters best suited for estimation.  In particular, the nonlinear Kalman filter based approach is considered for the parameter estimation problem.  This method possesses several desirable properties, among them: it takes explicitly into account noise in the model and data, it is an efficient and simple to implement computational tool, and it can take into account a priori information. <br/><br/>A simple change of the body from supine to sitting or standing position requires activation of a series of control mechanisms to maintain homeostasis.  Upon postural change, the baroreceptors register a fall in arterial blood pressure and reduced filling of the heart.  Activation of the autonomic nervous system then adjusts the heart and vessel properties to increase pressure and pump function of the heart back toward their reference level.  This regulation can be disrupted in patients with peripheral and central nervous system diseases.  Such patients usually experience dizziness and syncope due to altered function of the autonomic nervous system.  These defects are often observed in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and other neurological diseases of which Parkinson?s disease is the most dominating.  This project brings to bear tools from mathematical modeling, analysis, and computation on questions related to this phenomenon, with the goal of gaining insights into the dynamics involved and a better understanding of how this regulatory system functions.  Additionally, the project involves interdisciplinary collaborations with experimentalists and includes the participation of students, providing considerable opportunities for broader impacts."

The field of ecology is largely devoted to the study of these limiting factors.  Debates concerning the relative importance of different potentially limiting factors for particular microbe, plant, and animal taxa pervade the evolutionary ecology literature; prominent examples include extrinsic versus intrinsic sources of mortality, different macro- and micronutrients required for organismal growth, physical wear or breakage of different key structural features of an organism, resources versus predators in population regulation, pollen versus resource limitation in plants, and egg versus host limitation in insects. While important progress has been made developing theory to resolve these debates in particular contexts,  these theoretical treatments have been developed in isolation from one another. Many of these debates, however, share a common logical structure: the focal organism lives in a heterogeneous environment, has a finite pool of metabolic resources to ameliorate multiple limiting factors, and can not instantaneously adjust metabolic allocations to perfectly match the environment.  This project will develop a general mathematical framework for analyzing evolutionary problems with this logical structure, apply this framework to several major limiting factor debates in evolutionary ecology, and confront the modeling predictions with empirical data. The mathematical framework will provide broadly applicable methods at the interface of stochastic processes and dynamical systems. These methods will be used to understand (i) whether insects are limited by a finite supply of eggs or a short lifespan to locate hosts and (ii)  whether plants are limited by their ability to attract pollinators or by other aspects of reproduction. To establish a dialogue between the theory and the natural world, data on egg limitation and pollen limitation will be collected and analyzed to evaluate the theory. <br/><br/>Conservation and restoration ecologists are interested in anticipating the responses of animals and plants to changing environments and in being able to manipulate those responses to beneficial ends. This project will contribute to these goals by providing a deeper understanding of how organisms evolve in response to different factors that may limit reproductive success. A population of organisms whose fitness is consistently limited by one particular factor will respond predictably to perturbations of that factor. On the other hand, a population of organisms whose fitness is limited by different factors at different times or places will respond to perturbations less predictably. A key topic of this project, pollen limitation, has direct bearing on documented global declines in the populations of pollinating insects such as bees.  These population declines threaten plant communities and crop productivity world wide. Results from this project will be incorporated into a new course on pollination ecology, into two textbooks dealing with calculus and modeling as applied to the life sciences, and into entry-level courses for biology students. Moreover, undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral associates will be trained in a vertically integrated manner."

A hallmark of cell polarity is spatial localization.  From a modeling point of view, spatial localization cannot be understood without proper modeling of the spatial dynamics governing its creation and time evolution.  At the same time, spatial dynamics are profoundly influenced by stochastic events that manifest as cellular noise. Therefore, deep understanding of cell polarity inevitably requires the proper modeling, simulation, and analysis of stochastic spatial dynamics.  The fundamental problem limiting work in this area in the past has been the computational complexity of stochastic spatial simulations.  This project develops the experimental data and algorithms for modeling, simulation and analysis of spatial stochastic dynamics arising in cell polarity in the yeast pheromone response system.  A novel algorithm is developed to address the computationally intensive task of spatial stochastic simulation.  The algorithm is then further developed and then integrated into a powerful software infrastructure to enable its widespread use.  Experiments capable of capturing stochastic variability inform model development and analysis.<br/><br/>Software developed as a result of this project enables routine simulation of highly complex spatial stochastic phenomena across the sciences and engineering.  All software will be made widely available.  Tutorial courses and presentations at meetings and workshops will be given to ensure the accessibility of the research.

Dispersal of organisms is a key component of ecological and evolutionary processes and the dispersals of many organisms depend upon local biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., food, climate, competitors, predators) and as such are often nonrandom.  In contrast with random movements, there is limited knowledge of the consequences of nonrandom dispersal, especially in the context of the spatial dynamics of interacting species.  If two competing species adopt biased movement in response to habitat quality, there can be selection against both small and large advection rates.  Is there some intermediate advection rate which is evolutionarily stable?  If random dispersal rate and biased movement rate represent values for two different traits of species, how will two traits simultaneously evolve?  Compared to variation in space only, how will nonrandom dispersal evolve in spatiotemporally varying environments?  If organisms make dispersal decisions purely based on fitness differences between habitat locations, does it always compare favorably with strategies based only on environmental cues?  Can nonrandom dispersal promote the spatial coexistence of interacting species?  All of these questions are studied in the project.<br/><br/>From habitat degradation and climate change to spatial spread of invasive species, dispersals play a central role in determining how organisms cope with a changing environment.  Understanding dispersal of organisms can significantly enhance our understanding of how diversity is maintained in complex foodwebs.  The spatial spread of invasive species is an important and challenging issue.  While a great deal is known about the spatial spread of organisms in a single species context, very little is known about how species interactions influence the spatial spread of invasive species.  For instance, one might expect spatial spread to be influenced by competition with native species for common, limiting resources, and it is very important to understand the dispersal strategies that exotic species use in response to interactions with native species, be they competitors or natural enemies.  It may be that invasive species use a different set of dispersal strategies compared to native species and such differences may be crucial in explaining why certain invasive species are able to spread quickly and displace native species while others tend to spread slowly and become integrated into the native community.  Understanding the answers to these questions can help develop better management strategies for invasive species control.  Additionally, this project involves extensive training of postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduate students in mathematical modeling and analysis of emerging biological issues related with spatial spread of invasive species and disease."

These activity patterns have been implicated in the generation of sleep rhythms, sensory processing, working memory and pathological rhythms that arise in diseased states such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.  While numerous mathematical models have been proposed for these systems, there has been very little mathematical analysis of these models.  This is because the models are highly nonlinear, they exhibit an extremely complex structure of spatio-temporal dynamic behaviors and they depend in often unintuitive ways on the numerous parameters in the model.  This research develops mathematical and computational tools for analyzing a general class of neuronal models.  In particular, the research: (i) helps explain mechanisms underlying complex spatiotemporal patterns seen in recent experiments on early sensory processing in the insect antennal lobe; (ii) develops a novel model for working memory based on calcium dynamics and excitatory-inhibitory interactions within the prefrontal cortex; and (iii) develops new mathematical and computational tools for studying calcium and membrane potential wave propagation in spatial domains with complex geometries.  The issues considered arise in many neuronal systems throughout the brain and the new mathematical tools will be very useful in the study of these other systems as well.<br/><br/>Everything that the brain does depends on the firing properties of neurons.  This includes the control of movements, learning, memory, emotion and sensory processing.  Changes in neuronal firing patterns are associated with memory and aging, and pathological patterns have been implicated in  neurological diseases such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.  With the development of new sophisticated experimental techniques, neuroscientists are now beginning to better understand the functional roles of these firing patterns in normal brain processing, the biophysical mechanisms underlying these patterns and what is responsible for changes in these patterns during learning, aging and disease. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that mathematical modeling and computational methods are critically important in accounting for the massive amounts of new data, testing new hypotheses and understanding how complicated  processes interact to generate complex brain rhythms.  Novel mathematical tools are developed for analyzing detailed models that arise in numerous brain systems. In particular, models for working memory are constructed and analyzed; this corresponds to our ability to store and manipulate information for a short time in order to carry out complex tasks.  Problems with working memory is associated with several neurological diseases including schizophrenia and the project explores how changes in neurotransmitters such as dopamine lead to pathological rhythms associated with these neurological diseases."

Modeling, mathematical, and computational tools are developed for a broad class of problems in biological tissues that have complicated geometry and connectivity, specifically the brain.  The brain-cell microenvironment is treated as a porous medium using volume averaging that has been used to study the diffusion of substances at the macroscopic level.  Mathematical models are derived to study the effects on complex brain phenomena of permeability of cell membranes, the geometrical and topological structure of brain tissue including neurons and glial cells, and the connectivity of glial cells and of the vascular network.  These models retain essential mathematical features of restricted diffusion of ionic species in biological tissue containing cells, namely coupled systems of diffusion equations with nonlinear source terms, and analytical and computational techniques are developed for studying these models.  Additional mechanisms, believed to be important in certain applications, are studied mathematically and computationally.  These studies of the brain include treating the intracellular spaces of neurons and glial cells separately and treating the extracellular space as a separate compartment.  In addition, the influence of  degenerate sources in the model equations is studied theoretically.<br/><br/>A specific application of this research is to the effects of restricted diffusion of ions due to the complex geometry of cells in the brain on cortical spreading depression (CSD), a nonlinear chemical and electrical (slow) wave phenomenon in the cortices of different brain structures.  Although physiologists have studied spreading depression (SD) for more than 65 years, identification of the precise mechanisms involved in the propagation of SD waves has remained elusive.  CSD has been implicated in migraine with aura; however, we still do not fully understand how the known and postulated mechanisms that are involved in CSD conspire to produce this enigmatic phenomenon.   A prominent neurophysiologist has said, ""No matter how many channel proteins we sequence, how many neuromodulators we identify and how many neural networks we construct, if we cannot explain spreading depression, we do not understand how the brain works.""  Mechanisms involved in CSD include ionic diffusion, membrane ionic currents, osmosis, effect of spatial buffering on fast transport of extracellular potassium ions, and effects of the vascular tree.  CSD waves are characterized by large ionic concentration changes in the cortex of many different brain structures in different animals.  It is essential to have a good understanding of the mechanisms underlying CSD waves to develop a thorough understanding of how the mammalian brainfunctions.  The continuum frameworks developed earlier by researchers studying CSD are extended and generalized in order to carry out more detailed and careful studies of the putative mechanisms that may be involved in experimental CSD wave propagation.  Also, as a step towards bridging the continuum and single neuron approaches to modeling CSD, electrodiffusion in a network of neurons is also studied."

This seasonality is responsible for the spring/autumn dual wave nature that can be seen in pandemic influenza. Current models of influenza that attempt to incorporate the seasonality of the disease into the model generally assume a harmonically forced infection rate. However, our preliminary exploratory studies have shown that a periodically forced infection rate leads to chaotic dynamics, and that different assumptions of the nature of the periodicity can thus lead to dramatic changes in the predictions of the short term dynamics of the spread of the disease in a population, particularly in the case of pandemic influenza. Using an incorrect assumption for the time behavior of the infection rate in the model can thus be quite damaging if the models are employed to assist policy-makers in disease control and interventions in the event of a new pandemic outbreak. <br/><br/>Our research thus aims to understand the short-term dynamics of pandemic influenza through the development of realistic models that accurately describe population dynamics and the seasonal nature of the disease. We model the disease through ordinary differential equations (ODE's). We will examine the sensitivity of the model predictions to changes in the model parameters; because of the chaotic nature of the system, such studies are important to ascertain the robustness of the model predictions when disease intervention strategies (such as vaccination campaigns) are assessed using the model. Our work will shed new light on the complex short term dynamics possible with pandemic influenza, which has hitherto not been well studied. Through a hierarchical advancement of model complexity, we will identify the most appropriate and pragmatic models, avoiding the development of overly complex and abstruse methods. Further, by explicitly linking the mathematical models with existing data, we ensure that the models will produce reliable results for use in the development of public health policy in pandemic preparedness."

Important cell functions such as differentiation and proliferation rely upon spatially and temporally accurate cell polarization and the induced cell morphologenesis. While polarization typically involves signal transduction through certain pathways, many recent experimental and theoretical studies revealed that, besides the feedback regulators, more machineries including substructure of the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicle trafficking are contributing to the architecture of cell polarity and cell morphogenesis. This project is concerned with a mathematical and computational investigation of the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity and the induced cell morphological change during yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating process. The first part of this project is to study the role of microdomains on the cell membrane in cell polarization, tracking directional changes of the stimuli, and attenuating noise present in the signals. The second part will investigate potential mechanisms that maintain the polarized growth of yeast cells during mating, with models including a moving cell membrane. The roles of endocytosis and exocytosis in cell polarization will be studied with these models. <br/> <br/> <br/>A major topic in cell biology is to understand how cells sense and react to a wide variety of stimuli, which convey information essential for their growth, development and functions. Cell polarization, which relies on an asymmetric organization of intracellular components, has been widely acknowledged to be a fundamental process underlying spatial sensing of stimuli. The work seeks to address two important questions in cell biology through mathematical modeling and computation: 1) how is the cell polarity established and maintained? 2) what controls the emergence and dynamics of cell morphogenesis during signal sensing? Our models are based on the known experimental observations of polarized morphological change during yeast mating process, and they incorporate important components in the signaling network. We will investigate how the machineries such as substructure of the cell membrane and vesicle trafficking, participate in generating and retaining cell polarity, and how those machineries are incorporated in cell morphogenesis during yeast mating process. Quantitative studies of cell polarization and cell morphogenesis, based on the systems biology methodology which integrates mathematical modeling with experiments, will improve our understanding on the behavior of cell in response to the environment or its physiological setting. The developed framework and models could be applied to other systems, such as T-cell and neutrophils, which also undergo polarization and morphological changes in response to external signals.

Population and network disease models yield insight into, and guide policy aimed at mitigating, the spread of these public health threats.  In such models, the central notion of contact greatly influences the disease epidemic outcomes, but its definition remains nebulous.  This project clarifies the notion of contact through developing our understanding of the fluid dynamics of respiratory disease transmission.  A hierarchy of mathematical models of increasing complexity are combined with analogue laboratory experiments to elucidate several fluid dynamics problems bearing directly on contact and disease spread.  Specifically, this project elucidates the factors influencing the generation and transport of droplet-borne pathogens inside the respiratory tract, and their subsequent dispersal through the air via coughing, sneezing or normal breathing.  Such models yield valuable insight into the range and efficacy of pathogen transport via exhalation and so guide policy on the management of infected patients in confined environments such as hospitals and airplanes.<br/><br/>This research highlights the key role played by fluid dynamics in disease transmission, and suggests novel approaches to open questions in the classical mathematical modeling of disease spread.  One principal goal is to refine the quantification of contact as input for epidemiological models, thus improving their predictive accuracy.  The research will also raise the bar on the mathematical modeling of airborne transmission, by drawing on established mathematical models of multiphase, multiscale interfacial flows to elucidate the factors influencing the likelihood of infection via bacteria- or virus-laden airborne droplets.  The research can thus inform the modeling of contact in respiratory diseases in confined environments, and so guide policy for disease transmission in hospitals and airplanes.  Finally, the project is transformative, bringing the mathematical framework of modern fluid dynamics to a new class of important biomedical problems.  Through introducing these problems to the fluid dynamics community, as resides traditionally in applied mathematics, engineering and physics departments, it initiates an exciting branch of interdisciplinary science."

This hypothesis will be tested by (1) studying in vivo responses of a feeding pattern generator to mechanical perturbations in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, whose identified neurons and well-studied biomechanics make it especially experimentally tractable, (2) using theoretical, computational and mathematical tools to develop insight into dynamical architectures of robustness, such as a globally stable limit cycles, or stable heteroclinic channels and (3) directly testing the central hypothesis using a semi-intact preparation that can generate behavior, and can respond to mechanical perturbations, to determine the role of identified sensory neurons in generating appropriate responses to these perturbations by selectively activating or inhibiting the neurons. <br/><br/>Developing an understanding of robust dynamical architectures would have many applications. In particular, the research will open up the possibility of creating control architectures for robots that can flexibly cope with unpredictable environmental changes, and successfully pursue long-term goals despite environmental perturbations. It will play an important role in developing robust prosthetic devices that cope flexibly with everyday tasks, simplifying the process of rehabilitation. Additionally, this project enhances  the efforts of the lead investigator, a neurobiologist, and the co-investigator, a mathematician, to co-mentor students in the interdisciplinary area of mathematical and computational neuroscience, and also impacts the content of the interdisciplinary courses that they teach."

The IB method is a broadly-useful approach to FSI which has been applied to diverse problems in biological fluid dynamics.  Although the IB method has been demonstrated to be a useful approach to such problems, it is generally only first-order accurate, and fine spatial grids are therefore required to obtain resolved numerical simulations.  The II method is an IB-like approach to FSI which yields second-order accuracy for certain problems, but which is currently limited to thin elastic interfaces which are closed (i.e., which do not have free edges).  The hybrid FSI methodology of this project will incorporate features of both the IB and II methods to obtain high-order accuracy for both ""thick"" and ""thin"" elastic bodies, including thin elastic interfaces with free edges.  We believe that the basic version of the methodology will be the first IB-like method to achieve full second-order accuracy for thick elastic bodies such as the muscular walls of the heart, and that the extended version of the methodology will be the first II-like method to treat interfaces with free edges, such as the thin leaflets of the cardiac valves.  These new methods will be used to simulate cardiovascular flows, especially the fluid dynamics of the aortic heart valve.<br/><br/>Problems in which a fluid flow interacts with an elastic structure, such as the writhing and coiling of DNA or, as addressed within this project, blood flow in the heart and vessels, are ubiquitous in engineering, biology, and medicine.  The immersed boundary (IB) method is a broadly-useful approach to such problems which was introduced to enable the computer simulation of the fluid dynamics of the heart and its valves.  Indeed, cardiovascular applications have motivated much work to develop mathematical and computational methods for FSI, and the large and growing number of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases (80 million people in the United States, approximately 30% of the population), such as coronary heart disease (16.8 million people) or heart failure (5.7 million people), make such applications increasingly important.  This project aims to develop an improved version of the IB method which will improve the accuracy of the methodology, possibly leading to significantly more realistic simulations of cardiovascular dynamics.  Because the IB approach is widely useful, and because the software implementing the methods of this project will be freely distributed, the potential impact of this work is quite broad, possibly affecting studies which aim to address basic scientific questions (e.g., the fluid-structure interactions which result in the beating of cilia within the oviduct or respiratory tract) to studies which aim to improve the design of medical therapies and devices (e.g., prosthetic cardiac valves or treatments for heart failure)."

The project includes three components: 1) an acoustic experiment in the vicinity of the incident to collect population estimates data and comparison to similar collected data from previous years; 2) the development of statistical models to quantitatively estimate the population of marine mammals before and after the incident in the vicinity of the disaster; 3) the development of a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of the whale population that will be used to evaluate the long term impact of the spill on whale populations.<br/><br/>This project is one of a kind to assess the adverse impact of the BP oil-spill on the marine ecosystem in general, and marine mammal populations of specific species in particular, in and around the oil-impacted area of the Gulf of Mexico. Acoustic data will be collected near the sites where marine mammal phonations were collected by the Littoral Acoustic Demonstration Center in 2001, 2002, 2007 and are as close as 9 miles from the BP oilspill incident site. Therefore, the newly collected data will be unique as we will be able to compare them to the previous data, which will provide base-line estimates of the marine mammal population density. Successful project implementation will provide not only environmental impact assessment of a large-scale oil spill on several species of marine mammals (including endangered sperm whales), but also the foundation for development of a new systematic methodology of population estimation and dynamics based on acoustic cues; this is in contrast with the traditional methodology which is based on visual observations. The<br/>collected data, which will be useful for ecologists in the future, and the theoretical research associated with the project will shed light on the debate concerning how the Gulf of Mexico has been affected by the oil-spill. This can help the policy makers in the future. This project will not only assess the impact of the BP oil-spill on marine species in the impacted area, but also can work as a paradigm in the future for similar manmade or natural disasters. The proposed research, with a strong theoretical component, will complement other existing and ongoing research on the BP oil-spill. Furthermore,  articipating graduate students will receive valuable interdisciplinary training ranging from data analysis to statistical and mathematical modeling of marine mammal population dynamics."

Although extremely promising, massive data produced by RNA-seq, substantial biases, and uncertainty in short read alignment pose daunting challenges for researchers when analyzing RNA-seq data. Most of the current analytic programs enumerate total number of tags landed within each exon and use normalized counts as the expression measure. Such methods ignore variation and correlation in sequencing depth within an exon, which may result in less accurate expression measures. Because the correlation between the read counts of adjacent bases depends on the distance between them, it is referred to as spatial correlation. Large base-specific variations and between-bases spatial correlations make naive approaches, such as averaging to normalizing RNA-seq data and quantifying gene/isoform expressions, ineffective.  The presence of location-specific variation as well as spatial correlation is an outstanding characteristic of many spatial data in Geostatistics, Spatial Epidemiology, and image processing, and it has been studied in the literature of Spatial Statistics. In this project, the investigators propose to apply and extend the ideas, models and methodologies rooted in Spatial Statistics to model and analyze RNA-seq data. In particular, the investigators develop spatial Poisson mixed effects models including a hierarchical model and a mixture model to accommodate biases, variations, and correlations present in RNA-seq data so as to accurately estimate gene/isoform expression levels and to facilitate gene/isoform expression comparison and novel transcript structure or activities discovery. Furthermore, the investigators will apply the proposed methods to analyze real RNA-seq data generated from prostate cancer and psoriasis transcriptomic studies. <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>Monitoring gene expression levels genome-wide is important for understanding the mechanisms of many biological processes.  In the past decade, microarray has been the main tool in laboratories for measuring gene expression levels. Recently, RNA-seq, an emerging new technology, has been shown to offer key advantages over microarray in measuring gene expression profiles. However, existing methods for quantifying expression levels from RNA-seq data are crude and unsatisfactory. This greatly compromises the power of RNA-seq for genomic and transcriptomic studies. In this project, having carefully investigated the unique characteristics of RNA-seq data, the investigators propose a series of advanced statistical models, and aim to develop effective and efficient methods for RNA-seq data analysis. The methods generated from this project will greatly benefit a fast growing community of researchers who are planning to conduct RNA-seq experiments with data analysis. Furthermore, this project also constitutes a significant contribution to the advance of statistical methodology development. The investigators will also develop and support open-source computer software for RNA-seq data analysis based on the methods resulting from this project and make it freely available to the public online."

In recent years, the advent of GFP has made it possible to study such binding interactions in the context of their native environments within the cell.  Two fluorescence microscopy-based techniques, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and photoactivation, have proved among the most promising ways for biologists to study the dynamics of intracellular proteins and their interactions with one another and cellular components.  Importantly, these techniques are widely accessible to an exceptionally large number of experimentalists, and when analyzed using appropriate models, hold the potential to provide quantitative measurements of the on and off rates of complex formation, as well as directly measure the diffusion rate of the bound and unbound species.  Despite this, in vivo analysis of such reaction-diffusion type processes is still in its relative infancy due to the lack of consensus about how to extract accurate diffusion coefficients (D) and binding constants from data obtained by confocal FRAP and related techniques.  Even for the case of proteins that are presumed to act as inert reporters, such as EGFP, reported measurements of D in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of cells vary considerably in the literature.  For the more complicated case of reaction-diffusion behavior, it is even less clear how to best extract reliable kinetic constants. In addition, the influence of so-called anomalous diffusion on reaction-diffusion processes in cells has been largely unexplored.  The goal of the studies proposed in this application is to address this fundamental gap in our current knowledge by developing new methods to calibrate, measure and quantify reaction-diffusion kinetics in living cells.  This will be accomplished through two aims: (1) to cross-calibrate measurements of freely diffusing proteins across techniques and assess the degree of anomalous diffusion in the cellular environment, and (2) to develop and test methods to robustly quantify reaction-diffusion type behavior from FRAP and photoactivation experiments using binding of transcription factors to DNA as a model.  <br/><br/>The proper functioning of cells relies on the ability of macromolecules such as proteins and DNA to undergo reversible binding events.  For many years, such transient interactions have been investigated using purified interacting partners in test tubes. However, this simplified environment does not fully reflect the complex milieu found within cells.  As such, scientists still lack a fundamental understanding of how strong many binding interactions actually are in cells, where in the cell such interactions occur, what controls their specificity, and how they are regulated.  Recently, it has become possible to address many of these questions using a form of fluorescence microscopy that can measure the motion of proteins in living cells.  In principle, this technique could be widely used by many researchers, as the microscopes required and tools to make the proteins visible are already widely available.  However, analysis of such data is complex, and requires careful mathematical modeling. Our proposed research seeks to develop and test mathematical methods that will enable the accurate measurement of intracellular binding events using these microscopy-based techniques.  Successful completion of this proposed work should help make these experimental approaches available to a large number of researchers that in turn can rapidly and easily apply them to a wide range of interacting molecules. In addition, related mathematical models are used to describe types of binding interactions are relevant over all scales of biology, including for example models of synchronized insect emergence and dispersal, and the geographic spread of epidemics."
