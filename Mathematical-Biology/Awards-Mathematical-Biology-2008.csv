An RNA molecule is a linear polymer that folds back on itself to form a three-dimensional functional structure. While experimental determination of precise RNA structures is a time-consuming and costly process, useful information about the molecule can be gained from knowing its secondary structure, a collection of hydrogen-bonded base pairs. Structural elements in RNA secondary structures <br/>can be separated into two large categories: stem-loops and pseudoknots. Development of mathematical models and prediction algorithms for simple stem-loop structures has started in the 1980?s. However, the tremendous demand on computer memory and time by pseudoknot prediction remains a computing challenge even today. The recently developed grid computing technology can offer a possible solution to this challenge. In this project, the investigators shall address some mathematical problems associated with the grid computing approach to RNA secondary structure prediction. To partition a large RNA molecule to smaller segments assigned to different computers on the grid, a good cutting strategy is necessary. The investigators propose to develop probabilistic models to study the inversion distribution in RNA sequences and to combine the results with the general theory of excursions to maximize the prediction accuracy using an optimal RNA segment length. The mathematical results will be integrated into a toolset for computational RNA structure analysis to test their applicability. The toolset will be used to investigate the possible association of pseudoknot types with functions using data in public domains and applied to the prediction of secondary structures adopted by nodavirus genomes. The prediction results will be compared with the secondary structures experimentally determined by mutational studies. <br/><br/>Studies on RNA secondary structures and functions contribute significantly to the understanding and control of RNA viruses in plant and animal diseases. Computational methods recently used in these RNA studies have been shown to greatly reduce time and cost. Solving computationally intensive problems is now feasible using grid computing technology that simulates high-performance computing on a superstructure of networked computers. By combining rigorous mathematical methods, current computing technology, and careful experimental verification, this project develops an interactive investigative approach in an interdisciplinary research endeavor. The validation of computational prediction results by wet-lab experiments will encourage experimental scientists to make use of computing technology with confidence to assist their scientific pursuits. Such a collaborative effort will have significant impacts on education and training of new scientists by promoting the concept of interdisciplinary research designs, by enhancing diversity in the student <br/>population from different geographical and economic areas, and by encouraging the development of long-term collaborative research and educational partnerships between minority-serving institutions and research universities. The work of these investigators will result in a research product for viral RNA genome analyses with mathematical concepts useful for studying many other patterns in genetic sequences. This project represents a direct contribution of mathematics through the advancement of computing technologies to the <br/>elucidation of diverse biological functions of RNA."

The three recent human flu pandemics of 1918, 1957 and 1968--respectively known as the ""Spanish flu"", ""Asian flu"", and ""Hong Kong flu""--caused huge devastation both in terms of the loss of human lives and consequent economic impacts.  For each of these, genetic evidence suggests that a novel influenza strain evolved from the genetic recombination (""shift"") of an animal flu strain and a human flu strain within a common host species that was co-infected by these two strains. This newly evolved strain had catastrophic effects on humans because of the absence of natural immunity by the host to this strain.  The recent cases of human infection and death from avian influenza virus in several parts of the world, and the fact that humans and other animal species (such as swine) can act as a shared host to both avian flu and human flu strains, has raised concern that we may face a near-term emergence of another novel and highly virulent strain, thus another potential pandemic. Mathematical models provide crucial tools for understanding and possibly predicting and controlling the emergence and subsequent spread of novel pathogen strains. In this project we develop and analyze mathematical and simulation models to study real-world biological scenarios, in which there is co-infection of human host by avian flu and human flu strains. We will focus in particular on characterizing conditions for invasion and persistence of emergent virulent strains within human populations.  This project will significantly advance our knowledge of the transmission dynamics and evolution of avian influenza from bird to human populations in particular, and of multi-species epidemic systems in general.  It will provide a series of usable, realistic models that are grounded on available data.  These models can serve as a solid background for future extensions incorporating and testing the efficacy of various control measures (such as vaccination, chemotherapy, and social distancing) for pandemic influenza, and suggest avenues of empirical study that are particularly important to pursue for disease prediction.<br/><br/>In terms of technical approaches, this project unites the efforts of mathematicians and biologists in developing models based on integrated partial differential equations (PDE), ordinary differential equations (ODE), and stochastic individual-based simulations (IBS), to study the evolutionary epidemiology and population biology of avian influenza (AI). The research goal will be pursued along two main directions.  1) The ""drift"" and ""shift"" mechanisms of genomic evolution of an influenza virus will be simultaneously incorporated within a multi-strain PDE model that then will be used to predict the epidemiological consequences in a human population of an evolved influenza variant -- a novel avian influenza strain with both high pathogenicity and high human-to-human transmission efficiency.  ODE versions of this model will be fitted to available World Health Organization (WHO) data of the cumulative number of human cases of avian influenza infection.  Mathematical analysis of the best fitting ODE and PDE models will then be carried out, to rigorously characterize conditions for spread and persistence.  2) Complementary individual-based simulation (IBS) models of a human population will be developed on a small-world type network that incorporate explicit social interaction (contact) neighborhoods of each individual, and stochastic processes of birth, death and infection events.  The pattern of flu outbreaks in these IBS models will be studied with respect to the underlying network structure, and related to the predictions of the corresponding ODE models.  This will help elucidate the role of stochastic factors likely to be important in the early stages of strain emergence."

The research effort will be focused on understanding the effects and evolution of conditional dispersal strategies, that is, dispersal strategies that depend on population densities and environmental conditions.  Dispersal strategies will be studied from the viewpoint of evolutionary stability. The mathematical models will primarily consist of reaction-diffusion-advection equations or systems of such equations.  There has been a great deal of research on ecological models with simple diffusion, but much less on models involving more complex conditional dispersal strategies.  Models based on simple diffusion describe random dispersal that does not depend on environmental conditions.  By incorporating factors such as advection along environmental gradients, toward prey, or away from predators, and variable diffusion rates that depend on population densities or environmental conditions, the research in this project will extend such models to describe various types of conditional dispersal and to study their effects.  The general mathematical methods that will be used include the classical theory of partial differential equations, dynamical systems theory, and nonlinear analysis.  Key mathematical ideas include using bifurcation theory, persistence theory, and the theory of monotone semidynamical systems to translate estimates on eigenvalues of differential operators into conclusions about the dynamics of systems involving those operators.  Since the models that will be studied include strongly coupled quasilinear parabolic systems (as opposed to standard reaction-diffusion systems which are usually weakly coupled and semilinear) it is anticipated that the project will involve the development of new mathematical results.  Some of the research in the project will be aimed at understanding specific ecological questions.  As an example, one aspect of the project will be the study of situations such as intraguild predation or apparent competition where a top predator preys on two other interacting species and influences their dispersal patterns.   Some of the research will be aimed at understanding the selective pressures that influence the evolution of dispersal.  That research will involve models for competing populations that are ecologically identical except for their dispersal strategies, which will be studied from the viewpoint of evolutionary stability.  Previous research suggests that in this context an important aspect of dispersal strategies is how well they allow a population to match the resources available in the environment, so that conditional dispersal leading to something like an ideal free distribution of organisms may be favored.  That idea will be explored further. The models that will be used to study evolutionary questions are in some sense special cases of the types of models used to study ecological questions.<br/><br/>The dispersal of organisms is clearly an important aspect of many ecological processes.  It drives biological invasions, allows populations to colonize empty habitats, and allows individuals to track resources and avoid predators or competitors. In this project mathematical models for interacting and dispersing species will be used to gain theoretical insights into how dispersal patterns can influence the persistence, distribution, and/or extinction of species, and what dispersal patterns are likely to appear as organisms evolve to adapt to new or changing environments.   Dispersal may reflect purely random movement or may be conditioned on properties of the environment or the presence of other organisms.  This project will be focused largely on conditional dispersal.   Conditional dispersal has not been studied as much as random dispersal, even though there is empirical evidence that it occurs and there is some theoretical evidence that it may be favored by natural selection in some situations.  Developing models that incorporate conditional dispersal will expand the scope of the current ecological and evolutionary theory of dispersal.  A broader motivation for the project is that developing models for the effects and evolution of dispersal should provide insights that may be useful in formulating policy to address ecological issues such as the conservation of biodiversity under environmental change or the assessment of the possible results of introducing exotic species or altering environments."

To advance understanding of the genetics of invading populations, two types of mathematical models will be developed and analyzed. The first is a system of integrodifference equations for the spatial moments of mutant and wild type population densities. By analyzing the stability of traveling waves for the equations, the researchers will determine how the probability of so-called ""mutation surfing""--in which mutants take over the leading edge of an advancing wave of population density--depends on biologically relevant model parameters. The second type of model is a system reaction-diffusion equations for population density and trait mean and/or variance of a quantitative trait.  The existence and stability of traveling wave solutions to such systems will be studied in order to model the evolution of a quantitative trait during an invasion. Rigorous analysis of both types of systems will be complemented both by numerical solution of the equations and stochastic population simulations as appropriate.  Finally, in a separate but related part of the project, statistical tests useful to biologists who wish to infer the age and point of origin of an allele based on mutation surfing or the presence of diversifying selection in a subdivided population will be developed. The project will provide training opportunities for a postdoctoral fellow and two undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>It is widely acknowledged that nonnative species are causing heavy damage to native ecospecies as well as economic losses (over US $300 billion per year in six large countries alone, according to one study). Effective environmental management requires assessing the risk of degradation of native species as well as the economic risk (e.g. to crops) posed by a newly introduced species or strain. All three parts of the proposed project will contribute to our ability to measure and predict changes in ecosystems, including anthropogenic changes such as the spread of nonnative species or of pesticide-resistant or engineered genotypes.  This study of adaptive evolution during invasions will contribute to improvements in prediction of the rates of invasion by nonnative species. These results will allow improved estimates of the benefits and costs of proposed control strategies.  The study of mutation surfing will also be useful to biologists whose primary goal is to infer the migration histories of populations--for example, the spread of humans from Africa to Europe, Asia and the Americas.  In particular, it will indicate the degree of uncertainty involved in making certain types of inferences the migration histories of populations."

This hemostatic response is rapid and regulated, since excessive and inappropriate clotting reduces the patency of blood flow. While knockout mice provide qualitative results about the role of particular hemostatic components, the mathematical and computational models can suggest threshold values of particular elements critical for hemostasis. Determining such thresholds will help identify hemostatic risk factors in human population. This has significant biomedical implications. For instance, deep vein thrombosis affects 250,000 Americans each year and leads to 20,000 deaths mainly from clot fragments that break off from the thrombus and cause pulmonary embolisms. The incidence will increase as the population ages.  Developing accurate, quantitative models of thrombus formation that help us understand the physical and biochemical processes involved in clot structure and stability will contribute to the development of new diagnostic approaches and therapeutic strategies.<br/>       <br/>The overall goal of this proposal is to develop three-dimensional multiscale mathematical models and a computational toolkit for simulating thrombus formation. These models will be validated with specifically designed experiments to test predictions of thrombus development, structure and stability. Moreover, the development of reasonable models will serve as a generator of new hypotheses that can be tested in experiments in vivo. To achieve this goal, a new collaboration has been formed between Dr. Alber and Dr. Xu (Notre Dame), Dr. Rosen (Indiana University Medical School) and Dr. Jiang (Los Alamos National Lab). To bring different scale levels of thrombus model together, new mathematical techniques and computational schemes will be developed and these will include elements of stochastic analysis, nonlinear analysis and kinetic theory. New methods will include coarsening methods, new numerical schemes, error estimates of numerical solutions as well as parallelization algorithms for the coupled discrete and continuous models needed for the long time simulations. The mathematical and computational models will incorporate many biological processes (platelet interactions, coagulation pathways, hemodynamic effects) into the simulation thus integrating biological fields that have traditionally been studied separately.<br/>"

The main principle of CT is based on transmitting a cone beam of x-rays through the patient from various directions. This is achieved by moving the x-ray source along some trajectory. For each source position a detector measures the intensity of the beam as it exits the patient. Then the data are inverted according to a mathematical algorithm. Prime examples of cone beam CT are helical and C-arm scanning. At present, cardiac imaging is arguably the most important challenge facing CT. Mathematically the difficulty of image reconstruction in this case comes from the fact that the object being scanned changes with time. Thus, for each source position the projection data corresponds to a different object. In this project the PI plans to concentrate on the following three directions: 1) Development of exact and efficient reconstruction algorithms for multi-source helical CT; 2) Development of exact and efficient reconstruction algorithms for the types of source trajectories used in C-arms; and 3) Development of local tomography algorithms for dynamic and motion compensated CT. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed activity will be the development of new reconstruction algorithms for cone beam CT and deeper understanding of the mathematics involved in reconstructing objects that change during the scan. It is expected that the broader impacts will include improved quality of cardiac imaging, potentially resulting in replacing an invasive diagnostic tool with a non-invasive one. The obtained results can also be used in other medical applications, such as nuclear medicine and Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy. <br/>"

In particular, it is clear that the intrinsic interactions between neuronal circuits in absence of inputs can have a strong impact on how the system responds to incoming stimuli even at the large scale cognitive level.  Thus, nonlinear dynamics methods will be applied to problems in theoretical neuroscience dealing with this question. Specifically, the research group will study the propagation of spontaneous and evoked waves in neuronal networks as well as the conditions for synchronization in these systems.  The effects of both pulsatile and frozen noise inputs on oscillatory networks of neurons will also be studied. A particular question of interest is how input correlations interact with intrinsic activity to shape the output correlations. Finally, the group will study how different ionic currents and modulators shape the ability of neurons to synchronize their behavior and how they respond to external inputs.<br/><br/>How humans perceive the world is governed both by the sensory inputs with which they are constantly bombarded and by their previous experience. This experience, as well as the natural wiring of the nervous system, shapes the spontaneous behavior of our brains and this spontaneous activity strongly modulates the sensory inputs.  In this project, computational and mathematical models of neurons are used to understand what kinds of spontaneous behavior are possible, how this depends on the wiring and how this activity interacts with sensory inputs.  For example, if many neurons fire together synchronously as a consequence of both common inputs and their intrinsic interactions, this could provide a strong signal for the importance of the sensory stimulus. These studies can help guide experiments which together with models and theory lead to a better understanding of normal brain function.<br/>"

Research and training in biomathematics can lead to substantial inroads in addressing these challenges. Addressing them is of importance not only to Africa but also to the rest of the world, including the US. The problems of Africa present particularly exciting and complex challenges for mathematical scientists, ranging from issues of mathematical modeling to issues of data analysis and interpretation. To allow US scientists to best help tackle these challenges, which range from issues of mathematical modeling to issues of data analysis and interpretation, partnerships are needed between US and African mathematical scientists so that US scientists can get first-hand understanding of the problems of Africa and the data they need for their models. Many of these challenges fall at the interface between the mathematical and biological sciences. Dealing with these challenges requires a large number of researchers working on and trained in biomathematics and prepared to deal with specific biomath challenges arising from problems of Africa. Thus, it is important to enhance development of biomathematics and to train US mathematical scientists to work in biomathematics and in international venues with international collaborations. <br/> <br/>The project features three US-Africa research workshops in Africa, focusing on challenges arising from Africa whose solution requires serious mathematical components:  (1) conservation biology and creation of ecological reserves and related issues of risk of extinction and risk of invasive species; (2) economic aspects of epidemiology;  and (3) the use of genetics to control diseases of humans and crops. The first two workshops will be preceded by an Advanced Study Institute (ASI), aimed at preparing graduate students to participate in the workshop, in follow-up research projects, and in long-term international collaborations. Small research projects catalyzed by the ASIs and workshops will involve US and African participants.  Because successful model development should never be divorced from data but sometimes is, a biomath modeling clinic with a data analysis emphasis is planned. <br/><br/>Because it is important to train some African students in more depth than is possible in the planned ASIs, the project will host African graduate students for year-long visits, in the process exposing US graduate student and postdoctoral biomathematicians to the problems of Africa in a longer, more extended mode than is possible with a two-week activity.  African faculty will also come as visitors to engage in joint research projects. Materials arising from the ASIs and workshops will be widely disseminated through books, articles, websites, CDs, and reports, so others can copy these activities. Project results will be used in a separately-funded program that brings current research into the undergraduate classroom. International partnerships with the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), the South African Centre of Excellence for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA), the African Mathematical Institutes Network (AMI-Net), the African Mathematics Millennium Science Initiative (AMMSI), and the Canadian Network of Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems (MITACS) will enhance the program.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities."

Movement is a very complex process that involves the spatial and temporal control and integration of a number of sub-processes, including the transduction of chemical or mechanical signals from the environment, intracellular biochemical responses, and translation of the intra- and extracellular signals into a mechanical response.  The force for protrusion results from localized polymerization of monomeric actin into cross-linked networks of actin filaments in lamellipodia or bundles of filaments in filopdia or pseudopodia.  In order to produce directed cell movement the interaction of the actin sub-networks and force transmission to the substrate must be properly integrated in space and time.  Understanding the interplay between the processes involved requires a mathematical model that links molecular-level behavior with macroscopic observations on forces exerted, cell shape, and cell speed, but how to formulate a multiscale model that integrates the microscopic steps into a macroscopic model is poorly understood in this context.  This study will focus on a number of simpler problems that will lead to the component modules in an integrated model sequentially.  The major issues to be addressed are (i) the dynamic control of the actin network at the leading edge of a cell, (ii) models and analysis of the role of focal adhesion construction and lifetime, and how the level of motor activity and the adhesiveness of the substrate determines the cell speed, (iii) analysis of whole-cell models of simple systems with a view toward understanding how the mechanical balances between various components produces stable steady states of actin turnover, motor activity and cell shape, and whether perturbations of this steady state can lead to polarization and movement in the absence of external signals.<br/><br/>Cell movement is an essential process at various stages in the life cycle of most organisms.  Early development of multicellular organisms involves individual and collective cell movement, leukocytes must migrate toward sites of infection as part of the immune response, and in cancer directed movement is involved in invasion and metastasis.  This research addresses various aspects of cytoskeleton dynamics, the integration of these dynamics with the reaction network of actin-binding and cell-signaling proteins, and the related control mechanisms regulating the mechanical properties of cytoskeletal structures involved in cell motility.  Understanding the interplay between the processes involved requires a mathematical model that links molecular-level behavior with macroscopic observations on forces exerted, cell shape, and cell speed, but how to formulate a multiscale model that integrates the microscopic steps into a macroscopic model is poorly understood in this context.  Developing such descriptions is a major component of our research effort."

Thus, their ability to sense and respond quickly to environmental cues is finely regulated and well-evolved. We are particularly interested in the exquisite ability of photosynthetic microorganisms, like cyanobacteria, to sense and respond to light, in a process called phototaxis.  Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that the motility of cyanobacteria in space and time is a result of an intricate interplay between the characteristics of an individual bacterium and the social dynamics of the colony. We aim (1) To experimentally monitor surface dependent motility of Synechocystis sp. under defined, biologically relevant conditions.  (2) To derive, study, and test mathematical models that will be integrated with the new biological data.  (3) To use phototaxis mutants to extend and refine mathematical models in the context of biologically relevant questions. <br/><br/>This project deals with fundamental biological questions about cell motility and social behavior.  A successful completion of the proposed activities will shed light on how single cells perceive light signals and the importance of communication for social behaviors that lead to group movement.  The project is designed as a truly interdisciplinary effort to deal with a complex phenomenon.  It extends the promising preliminary results of the work of the investigators bringing together math and biology.  A considerable intellectual effort is embedded in designing the mathematical research directions that will provide answers that are relevant to solving biological problems. This project potentially has a direct impact on fundamental biological questions in other fields. The widespread importance of mixed bacterial communities and surface dependent motility is becoming increasingly apparent in the field of pathogen biology as well as in environmental microbial ecology.  Mathematical models that directly address group dynamics could be potentially very relevant to other problems: biological (such as modeling the behavior of ant colonies), and non-biological (such as crowds behavior in models in economics and social networks).

While the list of molecular systems that exhibit oscillations is growing, the grasp of the common principles is challenged by the variety of underlying network structures. The presence of negative feedback is the only feature shared by all oscillatory networks; beyond this each system seems to be unique.  The goal is to formulate a common principle that is shared by all oscillatory networks.  It is expressed in terms of broad tendencies of the dynamics, rather then the detailed structure of the supporting networks.  Cells constantly communicate with their environment and their neighbors.  This mutual communication often results in synchronization of their behavior.  A theory will be developed to explain synchronization of periodic signals in cell communities.  The synchronization of biochemical oscillators will be studied via the nearest neighbor coupling, and the coupling with a communally produced and sensed molecule.<br/><br/>A recent unprecedented explosion in our knowledge of structure and function of genetic regulatory networks promises revolutionary changes in how human disease is viewed and treated.  Many biological processes ranging from the cell cycle to the human 24 hour circadian rhythm are periodic in time. This periodicity is driven by oscillations in the concentration of chemicals in individual cells.  In many cases these signals synchronize across populations and the periodic signal can be detected on a macroscopic level.  The regulatory networks that are responsible for production and maintenance of these rhythms are being discovered every day.  While the structures of these networks vary, they often produce similar periodic signals.  This project will study the underlying broad dynamics principles behind the oscillations, emphasizing the function of the network over its implementation.  Further, it will study synchronization of the periodic rhythms in population of cells.  The lack of synchronization in the population can result in developmental and functional defects.  This project will develop a theory that will be able to predict collective dynamics, as well as suggest repair mechanisms in the case of failure.<br/>"

In doing so, this research will bring together two complementary perspectives on what controls neural activity in sensory systems: receptive fields and neural network dynamics.  In joint work with Carina Curto, we have developed a novel theoretical approach that enables building stimulus spaces directly from neural activity, thus circumventing knowledge of network connectivity and of receptive fields that may be difficult to communicate from one area of the brain to another.  This is achieved using some elegant ideas from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry that are largely unknown to neuroscientists, and opens up a new avenue for the analysis of the structure and function of recurrent neural networks.  By investigating compatibility conditions between patterns of activity emerging from recurrent neural networks and experimentally observed receptive fields, this project will find constraints on recurrent network connectivity, ultimately generating experimentally testable predictions.  The theoretical framework will also be translated into novel data analysis tools that will be useful for in analyzing large-scale electrophysiological recordings. <br/><br/>A central question in neuroscience is to understand how the brain creates representations of the external world.  Although a great deal of experimental work has uncovered correlations between neural activity and sensory stimuli, there is very little understanding of how the brain encodes relationships between distinct stimuli of similar type.  This research develops a novel theoretical framework to investigate this question by studying the interplay between stimulus encoding and the structure of recurrent neural circuits, typical of mammalian brain areas such as neocortex and hippocampus.  The findings will yield new insight into the role of neural circuits in learning and memory, and of how the brain organizes knowledge.  Progress in the basic understanding of neural circuits is essential for improving our understanding of learning disabilities and diseases (such as epilepsy and schizophrenia) that are believed to be related to the malfunction of neural circuits."

Many current approaches to assess gene signal fit data to statistical models; in contrast, the investigators will develop a thermodynamics-based algorithm to compute the hybridization free energy between probe and specific (i.e. intended) target as well as non-specific (i.e. non-intended) target molecules.  This new approach takes into consideration the fact that thermodynamics of hybridization for two molecules in aequeous solution is different that than where one molecule (probe) is tethered to a glass slide. A new probe-specific position-dependent hybridization partition function will be computed by a dynamic programming algorithm PPH using free energy parameters from labs of Turner, Santalucia, and Sugimoto. The partition function accounts for (Boltzmann-weighted) sum of all possible partial as well as complete hybridizations betwenn probe and target, including secondary structure of both probe and target. Applying PPH to all probes and all (specific and non-specific) targets is not computationally feasible, so the algorithm PPHx will be developed to compute the hybridization free energy between probe and a Markov model representing all non-specific targets.  Ensemble free energies are immediately obtained from partition function values Z, and can be used to derive concentrations of messenger RNA from microarray fluorescence intensity values.  <br/><br/>High-density oligonucleotide arrays (gene-expression arrays, tiling arrays, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, microRNA arrays, etc.) constitute a powerful tool in molecular biology for the discovery of genes and their function, with far-reaching applications in population biology, systems biology, pathobiology and other fields. In this method, fluorescently tagged cRNA or cDNA derived from messenger RNA is washed over a glass slide to which hundreds of thousands up to millions of short cDNA probes are attached. Hybridization between fluorescently tagged molecules and probes occurs, non-hybridized molecules are removed, and fluorescence intensities are measured by an optical scanning device. Despite technical improvements in various commercial platforms, it is still not possible to infer messenger RNA concentrations from microarray fluorescence intensity values, due to noise from cross-hybridization (also called non-specific binding).  A computer algorithm to compute the cross-hybridization free energy will be developed and implemented, directly allowing one to estimate cross-hybridization effects.  <br/><br/>Findings from this research will be made publicly accessible through a web server and distribution of source code, by journal publications, and presentations in meetings. Due to the prevalent use of microarray technology, this research will have a very broad impact on molecular biology (genetics, genomics, systems biology, population biology) as well as to disease pathology and drug dosage and design.

Their intricate geometry presents many challenges for cell function, in particular with regards to the efficient trafficking of newly synthesized proteins from the cell body or soma to distant locations on the axon or dendrites.  In healthy cells, the regulation of protein trafficking within a neuron provides an important mechanism for modifying the strength of synaptic connections between neurons, and synaptic plasticity is generally believed to be the cellular substrate of learning and memory.  On the other hand, various types of dysfunction in protein trafficking appear to be a major contributory factor to a number of neurodegenerative diseases associated with memory loss including Alzheimer?s.  This project involves the mathematical modeling and analysis of one important aspect of protein trafficking, namely, the transportation of glutamate receptors in dendrites.  These receptors mediate the majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system, and changes in the number of synaptic glutamate receptors contribute to the most studied forms of synaptic plasticity, namely, long term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD).  Building upon recent work of the PI, the research will consider a novel reaction-diffusion model of receptor trafficking that combines diffusion along the surface membrane of the cell membrane with biochemical processes within individual synapses.  This mathematical model will be used to investigate the regulatory mechanisms that control the distribution of glutamate receptors along a dendrite under basal conditions, during synaptic plasticity and during neurodegeneration.  A quantitative understanding of these regulatory mechanisms could help to identify important molecular and cellular processes underlying learning and memory in healthy brains, as well as memory-loss in diseased brains.  The work will have a broader impact through its interdisciplinary training of graduate students and through the University of Utah?s Brain Institute, which plays a major educational role in promoting awareness and understanding within the local community."

The models also accommodate the effect of recombination by permitting phylogenetic histories to change between regions of an alignment. These evolutionary patterns will be derived from the data, rather than from a priori assumptions, through the innovative use of genetic algorithms to search for good-fitting models.  The investigators will assess convergence and coverage properties of different algorithms. As there may be many models with similar fits to the data, inference based upon the best fitting model will be compared with those obtained by a weighted average over a sample of models. The unparalleled level of biological realism and statistical sophistication accommodated by our models will permit the research team to perform rapid and accurate high-resolution comparative studies of large collections of genes. New techniques will help bridge the emerging gap between meta-genomic analyses made possible by modern sequencing techniques and existing evolutionary analysis techniques developed in the single-gene era. These models will be developed and validated using a variety of viral datasets, focusing on the three pathogens - human immunodeficienty virus type 1, influenza A virus and hepatitis C virus - for which there is a wealth of sequence data.<br/><br/>Over time, evolutionary processes, such as natural selection, mold every gene into a unique mosaic of sites evolving rapidly and resisting change - an ""evolutionary fingerprint"" of the gene.

The central dopamine system has implications in many behavioral and cognitive tasks. A high-frequency response of the DA neuron is one of a few cellular events for which a clear physiological meaning has been proposed, and an immediate behavioral implication is the main determinant for great interest in properties of this cell. In a two-compartmental model of the DA cell, the canard and singular perturbation analysis will be applied to the bifurcation transition that corresponds to the onset of high-frequency oscillations. Timescale separations will be introduced to make the analysis possible. Then, the accuracy of proposed asymptotic approximations will be evaluated by comparison with simulations. In a morphological reconstruction, the investigators will reproduce distinctive properties of the spike generation mechanism of DA cells: 1. Its dependence on the subthreshold currents; 2. the contribution of active dendritic properties; 3. axonal initiation and presence of two components of a spike. Modeling will combine data on identified currents. Functional criteria will be applied to validate the model. Using the constructed model, synaptic integration properties of the DA neuron will be identified. Attenuation properties for a single spike and spike trains evoked at different dendritic locations will be measured in simulations. The dendritic tree is expected to be compartmentalized in such a way that synaptic inputs at certain locations elicit only somatic or only axonal spiking due to a significant spatial separation of the axon origin from the soma in DA neurons. Additionally, compartmentalization of the neuron may depend on the stimulation frequency because distal dendrites and the axon have much higher natural frequencies than the soma. Synchronization of spontaneously-evoked dendritic spikes and classical coincidence detection of synaptic inputs will be addressed in the model.<br/><br/>The above research will integrate experimental data on firing patterns and spike initiation of the DA cell to make conclusions about functional properties of the neuron. The project will open new possibilities to move the investigation of various behavioral functions involving the DA cells from the abstract to the biophysical context. It will layout the groundwork for further experiments. In its analytical part, the research will advance dynamical explanations to nontrivial biological phenomena and contribute to the extension of singular perturbation techniques to the vicinity of a bifurcation boundary. In the long perspective, understanding of DA cell functions will advance the development of new therapies to cure numerous disorders in which the central dopamine system is impaired. This interdisciplinary study will promote the usage of mathematical and modeling methods in biosciences. The models will be submitted in a public domain database to be used for educational and scientific purposes.

An integral aspect of many systems involved in genetic recombination, gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA repair is that proteins bound at different locations along a single DNA molecule interact through looping and wrapping of the bound DNA.  Understanding the detailed structure and interactions of these large assemblies poses a major challenge to structural biologists because the intact protein-DNA complexes are too large for high-resolution techniques such as x-ray crystallography or NMR.  Other techniques such as single-molecule experiments require at least a low-resolution model of the complex for their interpretation.  Tangle analysis, a branch of mathematical knot theory, in conjunction with difference-topology experiments has become a powerful emerging approach for the analysis of looped nucleoprotein assemblies both in vitro and in vivo.  At present, tangle analysis provides only two-dimensional information in the form of solutions to topological equations; moreover, the solutions to many problems of interest are often not unique.  Knowledge of the relative energies of tangle solutions is essential in order to evaluate the physical and biological plausibility of a particular structural model.  Tangle analysis will be fused with semi-analytical and numerical calculations of DNA-loop free energies to develop a theoretical description of the structure of complex nucleoprotein assemblies. These new methods will be implemented in the computer program KnotPlot, a powerful and extensible multi-platform tool for visualizing and manipulating physical knots.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Insights into the structures of looped protein-DNA assemblies are crucial for developing new molecular strategies for treating cancer, understanding the immune system, and ameliorating the biological effects of aging.

However, the diversity of brain areas and stimuli make a complete sampling of these patterns and their effects impossible. Furthermore, the evidence of correlations in stimulus response is strong, yet its role in neural coding difficult to intuit.  Therefore, a combined, predictive theory of correlation formation and impact is required.  This challenge is approached in three stages.  First, a general mathematical theory is developed that relates input correlations of a stochastic forcing to the output correlations of resultant spike trains.  The underlying tools will be linear response, population density, and Monte-Carlo methods for the nonlinear stochastic differential equations of spiking neural circuits. Next, this theory is applied to a variety of neural models to quantify how neuron biophysics, morphology, and coupling influence input-output correlation transfer.  Finally, information-theoretic analyses are performed to estimate the impact of spike train correlations on the encoding and propagation of sensory inputs in representative neural circuits.  Throughout the project, the investigators will work with experimental collaborators to refine and test these predictions.<br/><br/>Understanding the mechanisms by which the nervous system represents and processes information is a fundamental challenge for mathematical biology. It has long been known that information is represented by the intensity of individual neurons' responses.   However, new multi-neuron recording and brain imaging techniques are revealing that the information carried by neural tissue is much more (or much less) than the summed contributions of individual neurons.  In other terms, the cooperative, correlated features of neural responses can be essential.  This poses a pair of fundamental, but unresolved theoretical questions: What are the basic mechanisms by which correlated activity is generated and propagated through layers of neural tissue?  What are the consequences for information processing in neuronal networks?  The answers will, in stages, make predictions for ongoing neurobiological experiments.  For instance, understanding the relation between correlations and neural coding stands to impact the design of neural prosthetics, which code motor and sensory signals via cortical, retinal, thalamic, and cochlear implants.  From an alternative perspective, many neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease, involve excessive correlation in neural tissue--describing the genesis of correlations and its negative impact on neural coding will aid in designing appropriate treatments that ultimately reduce correlation in the nervous system.  Along the way, graduate students involved in this research will receive training in a highly interdisciplinary field, and will gain a broad perspective on mathematical neuroscience through regular visits between three research groups in different regions of the United States.  The active involvement of the investigators in undergraduate research and course development will provide an opportunity to translate the questions addressed here into compelling educational topics on the cooperative activity in neural networks that will be accessible to a wide audience."

In particular, the conjecture that diverse morphologic patterns of invasion observed during tumor growth are the quantitatively predictable result of molecular inhomogeneity (of both composition and structure) in the tumors growth environment will be tested. Because tumor cells use similar or identical migration and proliferation mechanisms as normal cells, and because of the multi-scale nature of these processes, the mathematical modeling, analysis and simulation that will be conducted in this project will also have application in understanding normal functional processes during development, wound-healing, stem cell differentiation and tissue regeneration.

This project focuses on two of these rhythms, theta (4 - 12 Hz) and gamma (30 - 80 Hz), that have been observed in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC), and have been implicated in learning, memory, spatial navigation and path integration (the ability to calculate a path on the basis of self motion cues).  Using biophysical (conductance-based) modeling, dynamical systems techniques and computational simulations, the investigator explores how these rhythms emerge at the single cell and network leves, and what are their dynamic properties.  The goal is to understand the basic dynamic and biophysical principles governing the generation of these rhythms over a wide spectrum of interacting levels of organization, ranging from the subcellular, through the cellular to the network leves, and how all this contributes to the functional role of these rhythmic oscillations.  At the cellular level, the focus is on the so called stellate cells (SCs) from layer II of the medial EC that display mixed-mode oscillations (subthreshold oscillations interspersed with spikes) in the theta frequency regime. Using reduction of dimensions techniques we uncover a minimal biophysically plausible model that reproduces the observed mixed-mode oscillatory patterns. This model is both nonlinear and multi-scale.  The study of its underlying dynamic structure, the so called canard structure, allows the investigator to understand how the observed patterns emerge from the interaction between a persistent sodium and a hyperpolarization-activated currents, as experimentally observed.  This knowledge will be used to understand two important aspects of network activity: How SCs process structured information (sinusoidal, noisy and synaptic inputs), in particular how the intrinsic and synaptic currents interact to maintain the SC activity in the theta frequency regime, and how all these properties cooperate to generate rhythmic activity at theta and gamma frequencies in networks that include SCs along with interneurons, pyramidal cells and other cell types.  More specifically, the questions of how and under what conditions the same network is able to generate theta and gamma rhythmic activity will be investigated, as well as how the abrupt transitions between both rhythms occur.  Single SCs have the potential ability to spike in the gamma frequency regime, but the associated time scale is hidden in single isolated cells and it is uncover in the network level when the level of inhibition is deficient.<br/><br/>This project addresses the general issue of how the brain is able to generate rhythmic activity at various frequency bands as the result of the biophysical properties of the networks that are substrate to these rhythms.  A set of problems that are motivated by experimental results and are key to the understanding of the neural circuitries that are substrate to the observed rhythmic oscillations in the EC are considered. The results of this research provide valuable information about the biophysical mechanism of generation of these rhythms, not only in the EC, but also in the hippocampus where cells and networks with similar biophysical and dynamic properties can be found, and which receives direct inputs from the EC.  In addition, the results will provide important insights into behavioral issues such as navigation where the theta rhythms in both the hippocampus and the EC plays a relevant role.  Finally, this research will shed light into the role that the transition from theta to a hyper-excitable (gamma) frequency regime plays in the generation of epileptic seizures."

The biochemical network controlling cell cycle progression in Caulobacter consists of parallel and consecutive, highly nonlinear processes, comprising positive and negative feedbacks.  Many proteins of this network dynamically localize at the poles of the cell in a cell cycle-dependent manner, providing a spatial dimension to cell cycle regulation.  In this project the complexity of the control system will be approached from a dynamical systems perspective, by means of mathematical modeling and computer simulation.  To this end, the investigators will construct an experimentally verified, dynamical mathematical model that will describe the relevant molecular events in space and time.  The model will provide a rigorous account of current intuitive ideas of bacterial cell cycle control, advance our understanding of bacterial cell division, integrate available experimental data, reconcile apparently conflicting data, identify data gaps, and suggest new experimental designs.  Principles of mathematical modeling, dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, and numerical computation will be used and advanced by this work.<br/><br/>The quantitative study of the molecular mechanism controlling cell division in Caulobacter will contribute to our understanding of cell cycle regulatory mechanisms and also of a fundamental issue in developmental biology (how morphogenesis is coordinated with cell cycle progression).  Comparative analysis of the molecular regulation of the cell cycle in bacteria and eukaryotes can be insightful for evolutionary biology.  Recent studies have shown that many of genes and mechanisms discovered in Caulobacter are evolutionarily conserved among other members of the alpha-proteobacteria.  Thus, the mechanism of cell replication in Caulobacter and the mathematical model that the investigators will develop may be extendable to the whole class of alpha-proteobacteria.  Several alpha-proteobacteria (including Sinorhizobium, Agrobacterium, Rickettsia, and Brucella) have important roles in a wide range of environmental, medical and biowarfare-defense applications.  Therefore, this fundamental research on Caulobacter growth, replication and differentiation may have far-reaching implications.  In particular, insights gained into temporal and spatial control of gene expression and protein interactions could provide new clues for rational design of antibacterial agents.  On a larger scale, this study will contribute to a conceptual understanding and mathematical description of the dynamics of living systems and to extending the quantitative transformation of molecular cell biology."

While nucleosome occupancy in promoter regions typically occludes transcription factor binding, thereby repressing global gene expression, the role of histone modification is more complex. Histone tails can be modified in various ways, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination. Even the regulatory role of histone acetylation, the best characterized modification to date, is still not fully understood. Mass spectral and genome-wide microarray data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae have offered new opportunities for investigators to evaluate the regulatory effects of histone modifications. The investigators will develop statistical methods for identifying target genes of histone modifications and associated DNA sequence features of histone modifications. The investigators will also develop computational and statistical methods for predicting histone modifications and their interactions. <br/><br/>Experimental data are noisy and high dimensional, which renders many tradition statistical methods ineffective. How to build prediction models with only a small set of informative variables adds another layer of complexity. New statistical methods will be developed to surmount the challenges.  The proposed methods lead to a statistical framework for integrating multiple types of proteomic and genomic data. A complete framework for such integration has not been developed and tested in the statistics and computational biology literature.  The proposed method can produce innovative methodologies for analyzing very large amounts of heterogeneous data, suggest new lines of quantitative investigations in systems biology, and offer opportunities for students to participant in inter-disciplinary research."

These problems are motivated by structural and functional characterization of biological abstractions, with significant implications for understanding disease and intervention. There are foundational mathematical challenges at the heart of these problems. To address these, the project introduces the concept of mutation and Darwin channels to model flow of genetic information.

An RNA molecule is a linear polymer that folds back on itself to form a three-dimensional functional structure. While experimental determination of precise RNA structures is a time-consuming and costly process, useful information about the molecule can be gained from knowing its secondary structure, a collection of hydrogen-bonded base pairs. Structural elements in RNA secondary structures <br/>can be separated into two large categories: stem-loops and pseudoknots. Development of mathematical models and prediction algorithms for simple stem-loop structures has started in the 1980?s. However, the tremendous demand on computer memory and time by pseudoknot prediction remains a computing challenge even today. The recently developed grid computing technology can offer a possible solution to this challenge. In this project, the investigators shall address some mathematical problems associated with the grid computing approach to RNA secondary structure prediction. To partition a large RNA molecule to smaller segments assigned to different computers on the grid, a good cutting strategy is necessary. The investigators propose to develop probabilistic models to study the inversion distribution in RNA sequences and to combine the results with the general theory of excursions to maximize the prediction accuracy using an optimal RNA segment length. The mathematical results will be integrated into a toolset for computational RNA structure analysis to test their applicability. The toolset will be used to investigate the possible association of pseudoknot types with functions using data in public domains and applied to the prediction of secondary structures adopted by nodavirus genomes. The prediction results will be compared with the secondary structures experimentally determined by mutational studies.<br/> <br/>Studies on RNA secondary structures and functions contribute significantly to the understanding and control of RNA viruses in plant and animal diseases. Computational methods recently used in these RNA studies have been shown to greatly reduce time and cost. Solving computationally intensive problems is now feasible using grid computing technology that simulates high-performance computing on a superstructure of networked computers. By combining rigorous mathematical methods, current computing technology, and careful experimental verification, this project develops an interactive investigative approach in an interdisciplinary research endeavor. The validation of computational prediction results by wet-lab experiments will encourage experimental scientists to make use of computing technology with confidence to assist their scientific pursuits. Such a collaborative effort will have significant impacts on education and training of new scientists by promoting the concept of interdisciplinary research designs, by enhancing diversity in the student <br/>population from different geographical and economic areas, and by encouraging the development of long-term collaborative research and educational partnerships between minority-serving institutions and research universities.

In the models, interactions within a household occur much more often than interactions between different households.  Primary goals of the models are to better understand how and why spatially targeted and/or clustered treatments affect dynamics of infections, for example varying the rates of pesticide application to crop fields based on the levels of insect infestations among those fields.

It will address such open questions as the precise sequence of steps linking calcium ion entry into the cell to exocytosis, the involvement of individual calcium channels in neurotransmitter release, and the mechanisms of transient calcium-dependent facilitation of synaptic response, presumably caused by the accumulation of calcium at the exocytosis site.  More specifically, this project will focus on the impact of intrinsic and externally applied calcium binding substances termed calcium buffers on exocytosis and its facilitation, using mathematical and computational modeling of calcium diffusion inside the cell.  The importance of calcium buffers stems from the fact that they absorb more than 95% of calcium ions entering the cell; further, the sensitivity of exocytosis and facilitation to applied buffers provides one of the most widely used methods to probe the intrinsic calcium sensitivity of these processes.  The first specific goal of this project is to reveal the effect of such buffers on the cooperativity of individual calcium channels in triggering exocytosis of a single vesicle, and to re-examine the so-called calcium current cooperativity measurements that probe the arrangement of channels at the release site.  The second specific goal is to examine the proposed non-local property of the buffer saturation phenomenon, whereby the transient whole-terminal depletion of free buffer by calcium influx through one group of channels may cause subsequent opening of the same or another group of channels to produce a greater calcium elevation.  Further, the competition between two calcium buffers in their regulation of intracellular calcium will be explored.  Finally, this project will examine the possible functional consequences of synaptic facilitation for the dynamics of neural circuits.<br/><br/>Neurotransmitter release at chemical synapses (exocytosis) represents the most common form of communication between two neurons in any biological neural system, including the mammalian cortex, and the knowledge of its mechanisms is indispensable for a full understanding of inter-neuronal interactions and neural information processing.  Further, the regulation of neurotransmitter release and binding to receptors represents the main pharmacological treatment method in many neurological and psychiatric pathologies. The importance of this project stems from its combined use of advanced computational tools and experimental physiological techniques in gaining deeper understanding of the neurotransmitter release process, known to depend on the action of calcium ions inside the cell.  This project will focus on the precise sequence of exocytosis steps starting with the entry of calcium through cell membrane calcium channels, their subsequent accumulation and binding to intracellular calcium-binding substances, and ending with the calcium-triggered release of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles into the synapse.  This investigation should also lead to a better understanding of other vital physiological processes controlled by calcium ions, from gene expression regulation to muscle cell contraction in the heart.  Further, this project will involve the use and further development of a publicly accessible computational modeling tool called CalC (""Calcium Calculator""), designed by the Principle Investigator for the modeling of three-dimensional calcium ion diffusion inside the cell (http://www.calciumcalculator.org).  This will contribute to the infrastructure for computational modeling in the biological sciences and will also serve as a useful training instrument in the fields of cell neurophysiology and biophysics. All modeling results obtained in the course of this project will be made publicly available through the on-line model database, ensuring the most rapid and effective dissemination of the obtained results.  Finally, this project will create student training opportunities in the highly interdisciplinary fields of mathematical biology, biophysics and computational neuroscience, including the training of students from under-represented ethnic groups, since this work will be conducted in an institution with one of the most ethnically diverse student bodies in the country (NJIT)."

The bacterium E. coli is a single-celled organism which swims in a viscous fluid by rotating its helical flagellar filaments.  Two successive motions are involved in the cell motility:  Runs (straight swimming propelled by flagellar bundling) and tumbles (random reorientation by interspersing flagella).  This project will focus on the study of the hydrodynamic interaction among flagella and flagellar filament shapes that arise through polymorphic transformations?local changes in helical wavelength, helical diameter, and handedness?during swimming.  A generalized version of the immersed boundary method combined with the unconstrained Kirchhoff rod theory is used to study biological fluid mechanics in the bacterium.  A new feature of this method is that the interaction of the immersed boundary with the fluid now involves not only translation of the immersed boundary points at the local fluid velocity, but also rotation of the associated triads at the local fluid angular velocity.  <br/><br/>This method will find numerous applications in biological fluid dynamics, where filamentous structures interact with a viscous fluid.  Examples include the supercoiling of DNA during transcription and replication and protein folding.  In addition, one of the challenges in nanotechnology is to develop machines at the nanoscale which can be used in the treatment of disease.  Understanding swimming mechanism by means of rotary motors will help to create a nanomachine, operated by self-propelled biomolecular nano motors, that could be used for drug delivery inside the body.

To analyze the conflict, the mathematical frameworks for multi-scale selection and drift in cells will be extended, focusing on conflict suppression mechanisms, meta-control of selfishness, and how cooperation is prevented by clonal interference.  In addition, an experimental platform will be developed to test how different conditions select for altruism or selfishness, and monitor the dynamics of the conflict by mapping arising mutations to the known control systems. <br/><br/>All social elements--from microorganisms to humans--can benefit from both cooperation and selfishness, and the most successful behavior depends on the parameters of the social scene. The investigators have identified a clean-cut conflict between selfish and altruistic elements in one of the simplest and best studied processes in bacterial cells: Self-replicating pieces of DNA get an immediate advantage by selfishly over-reproducing, but then instead indirectly suffer because they impose a larger burden on the cells upon which they rely. Because other aspects of this system are so well-studied, this provides a unique opportunity to rigorously analyze a complex phenomenon like cooperation in terms of molecular mechanisms and physical chemistry.   General rules for such conflicts will be mathematically derived and experimentally tested, determining conditions for altruistic behavior and identifying mechanisms that enhance or suppress selfishness. By focusing on testable theorems and broad intuitive principles, the results are equally important for education and research."

The collaborative effort involves four groups: Kopell, (Boston University), Moore (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Graybiel (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Boyden (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The project is the first collaborative research effort of the newly formed Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative (CRC), a group of Boston Area faculty members from Boston University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts General Hospital Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Brandeis University and Tufts University. The aims of the CRC, which fosters research and training, are to map the spatio-temporal structure of brain dynamics and connect these dynamics to brain function. This is the first project to try to understand from basic electrophysiology the growing literature suggesting that the low frequency brain rhythms are critical for both attention and learning, and that interactions among brain structures such as the basal ganglia and neocortex are central for such functions. The project makes use of the electrophysiology skills of the Graybiel lab, which is focused on the dynamics of the basal ganglia, and those of the Moore lab, focused on the neocortex, to understand the flow of information between the cortex and the basal ganglia during learning and attention. This collaboration is enriched by new molecular biology technology developed by the Boyden group. This technology, in which cells can be activated and inactivated by light, provides powerful new techniques for figuring out circuits by looking at effects of perturbations, even in behaving animals. The experimental work is guided by modeling ideas from the Kopell and Moore labs, and the output of the modeling can be tested almost immediately by the labs for quick feedback and changes.

The field of Computational Cell Biology encompasses several topics that have been studied long enough to be well established in their own right such as calcium signaling, molecular motors and cell motility, the cell cycle, and gene expression during development. In addition to providing a recognizable larger community for topics such as these, this course will provide a base for the development of newer areas of inquiry--for example the dynamics of intracellular second-messenger signaling, of programmed cell death, of mitotic chromosome movements, and of synthetic gene networks. Unlike computational genomics or bioinformatics, computational cell biology is focused on simulation of the molecular machinery (genes-proteins-metabolites) that underlie the physiological behavior (input-output characteristics) of living cells. Such complete and in-depth training in this emerging discipline is currently unavailable elsewhere.<br/><br/>Computational cell biology is the field of study that applies the mathematics of dynamical systems together with computer simulation techniques to the study of cellular processes. Just in the past decade there has been an explosion of research aimed at creating mathematical models of the processes that occur inside living cells. Without such models it will be impossible to understand the remarkably complicated interactions of components that allow cells to function. We are now at the point where we can begin to move Computational Cell Biology from relatively obscure laboratory research done by specialists to the realm of the textbook. In other words, the pioneers that have had to figure out how to do this work themselves can begin to teach it to graduate students and other trainees in a format that the community of specialists agrees is appropriate. The development of such a course--really the first of its kind--represents an important milestone in the evolution of Computational Cell Biology as a field of study. Students will leave the course having been exposed to a diversity of examples of cutting edge research in the field demonstrated by worlds' experts. Faculty members will leave the course both with an example of how to communicate this material at their own institutions and having had the opportunity to live together and participate in informal discussions about the material, the future of the field, and potential collaborations. While it is called a ""summer course,"" in reality Computational Cell Biology will be a teaching and learning laboratory and a research incubator. It is completely appropriate that the National Science Foundation nurture this cutting edge field of science, and the investment will pay many dividends well beyond mere education going forward."
