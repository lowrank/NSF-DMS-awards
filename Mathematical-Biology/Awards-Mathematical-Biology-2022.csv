Algebraic Geometry is broadly interpreted to be the part of mathematics that studies systems of polynomial equations and inequalities. While Algebraic Geometry has often been considered a solely pure area of mathematics, the community of researchers of CCAAGS-22 promotes its applied and computational nature. Participants of CCAAGS-22 combine Algebraic Geometry with the techniques and methods from symbolic and numeric computation, algorithms, complexity theory, as well as problems motivated by applications in multiple fields. These methods have already seen applications in biology, coding theory, cryptography, combustion, computational geometry, computer graphics, quantum computing, control theory, geometric design, complexity theory, machine learning, nonlinear partial differential equations, optimization, robotics, and statistics, among others. The interaction between algebraic geometry and any of these other disciplines is beneficial for both sides.<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers and promotes interdisciplinary work in a fast growing area. After the lack of contact during the pandemic, this is a long overdue event. It is particularly useful for junior researchers whose careers strongly depend on making connections and networking. CCAAGS-22 is indeed planned with junior researchers and underrepresented groups as the primary audience we want to attract.

This flow carries oxygen, nutrients, and waste around the body. It also drives the development of blood vessels and other organs in vertebrate embryos. So, understanding how these hearts produce flow is key to understanding the development of vertebrate embryos and the evolution of their circulatory systems. This project will develop a computational model of the most essential features of this system: the electrical activity of the heart, muscle contractions of the tube walls, and the fluid-structure interactions of the heart walls and blood within. This computational framework aims to be faithful to that of a real, model animal (tunicate, or sea squirt). The model will then be analyzed with mathematical tools to determine the physical limits of the pumping system. Results of this project will improve the understanding of human heart development at the earliest stages. Also, it will point to how the large, multi-chambered hearts of vertebrates could have evolved from smaller structures. The results will be released through university courses, scientific conferences and seminars, online repositories, and regular publications. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. <br/><br/>An accurate computational model of flow produced by valveless tubular hearts will be developed and validated using observations and experiments on the solitary tunicate, Ciona savignyi. The Immersed Boundary Method with Adaptive Mesh Refinement and a Windkessel model will be used to mathematically model fluid flow within the system. A Mitchell-Schaeffer model of cardiac electrodynamics will be tuned using optical mapping of heart electrical activity. Measurements on live C. savignyi circulatory flow with micro-Particle Image Velocimetry will be used as model validation. With the completed model, uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques based on physics-constrained generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory will be used to study the uncertainty and analyze the parameter sensitivity on the model. The physics-constrained gPC expansion can construct a computationally cheaper surrogate based on the fluid flow simulations at the properly chosen input points in the parameter space. The mixed types of uncertainty in the fluid flow quantities of interest will be determined using DS theory combined with the gPC method, and the sensitivity of parameters will be used to develop hypotheses regarding parameter evolution. The performance data corresponding to various parameter combinations in live animals will be collected and used to improve the 2D computational fluid dynamic model by utilizing model correction methods. The improved model can be used to provide more accurate predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The formation of specific cell types plays pivotal roles in all aspects of life, and different tissues are composed of hundreds of types of cells. As one of the underlying mechanisms, the 3D structure of DNA undergoes dynamic reshaping and instructs this complex process. However, it is under-studied and quantitative models are lacking due to the complexity of the system and large amounts of noisy data. The project will establish a novel mathematical framework to understand the dynamics of DNA structures and its effects on new cell type formation. Efficient computational and statistical algorithms will also be designed to discover the molecular drivers, which will be interrogated by cutting-edge experiments. The integrative strategy will lead to new systems-level insights into the molecular mechanisms of the formation of diverse cell types, with broad impacts on human health, synthetic biology and disease analyses, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. To expand the societal impacts, the project will integrate the scientific discoveries with a series of outreach activities for public engagement, including new interactive educational modules and platforms. Interdisciplinary hands-on training will be developed for both undergraduate and graduate students, with an emphasis on increasing the diversity and participation of under-represented groups of students for STEM education.<br/><br/>The overall goal is to theoretically and quantitatively delineate the functional roles of dynamic 3D genome structures in the process of multi-lineage cell differentiation. Due to the complexity of multi-scale 3D organizations of chromatin, the coupled dynamics of transcription and epigenetic factors, and the high rates of missing data in genome-wide experiments, systems-level modeling of the temporal dynamics of 3D chromatin through specific cell differentiation trajectory has been challenging. The project tackles this fundamental problem using an integrative strategy by combining mathematical, computational, statistical and experimental approaches. Specifically, the project will: 1) establish a new multi-scale mathematical model for the dynamics of 3D chromatin architecture through cell differentiation, by integrating different experimental observations; 2) design novel computational algorithms to reconstruct the trajectories across cell differentiation from large-scale noisy data; and 3) develop efficient statistical inference tools to discover the underlying molecular events of cell fate determination. Both theoretical and computational predictions will be thoroughly analyzed by experimental techniques, including 3C-HTGTS and 3D FISH.  The new methodology generated by the project, along with the genome-wide predictions across diverse panels of cell types, will have broad impacts on multiple scientific fields in both mathematics and biology, and will significantly improve the mechanistic understandings, predictive capacities and experimental engineering of cell differentiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Core mathematical epidemiological models have provided useful insight about pandemic risks, but typically do not account for the wide variety of people?s responses to the risk from the disease and the ways these responses shape ongoing transmission. Behavior affects disease spread: nature affects people, and people affect nature?connecting the natural and human systems in feedback loops that determine the course of outbreaks. The multi-disciplinary research team will bridge disciplines, toolkits, and data to advance knowledge about these feedbacks between human behaviors and infectious disease outcomes. The PIs will extend mathematical epidemiological models by including heterogeneity in behavioral responses to risks and social norms (e.g., mask/vaccines acceptance) involving feedback from both aggregate public health outcomes and the diverse responses from individuals. The models will be informed by data from three countries with unique characteristics representing health risks, public policies, information sources, and government trust: the United States, Norway, and Sweden. Real-world data will be supplemented by data collected in controlled settings?through surveys and behavioral laboratory experiments?to gain a deeper understanding of the individual factors and social processes that shape people?s responses to epidemic risks. The project will improve the abilities of epidemiological models to predict both disease outcomes and the economic impacts of public health regulations or guidelines, enhancing the capacity of public policy-makers to design and evaluate epidemic control measures during future outbreaks.<br/><br/>This project will develop and estimate behavioral reaction functions that can be included in systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that comprise most epi-models, with the goal of better informing policy design during novel epidemics. The PIs will focus on two overarching research questions: Q1 How do people?s behavioral reactions influence the evolution of an infectious disease outbreak through feedbacks on pathogen spread? and Q2 How are people?s behaviors during an outbreak moderated by the pronounced uncertainties and frequent policy changes that are characteristic of novel epidemics? To address these questions, the PIs will: (i) develop a new epidemiological-behavioral system of coupled ODEs, (ii) use observational, survey, and experimental data and methods to estimate people?s reactions to epidemic risks and top-down control policies, (iii) integrate our empirical findings into our new epi-model, and (iv) use their parameterized epi-model to conduct retrospective and prospective policy simulations and comparisons. In addition, the PIs will use observational data from three developed countries that undertook distinct policy approaches to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic: the United States, Norway, and Sweden. Moreover, the PIS will design surveys and behavioral laboratory experiments to gain a deeper understanding of responses to risk in contexts that are similar to novel epidemics. This multi-method approach will provide opportunities to test hypotheses about the mechanisms that underlie associations in the observational data and examine the external validity of the survey and laboratory studies.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular structure-function relationships, which is the central theme of biological sciences, are their tremendous structural complexity and excessively large datasets. The project will address grand challenges in understanding the biomolecular structure-function relationship from massive datasets by introducing new concepts in graph theory and differential geometry. The results from this project will open a new direction and foster similar approaches in biological data analysis. The graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in data analysis, biological modeling, and algorithm development from this project. In addition, novel mathematical frameworks will be available in the software packages to ensure extensive usage by the community of researchers throughout biology, computer science, and mathematics.<br/><br/>This project will develop new spectral graph theory and differential geometry-based approaches to revolutionize the current practice in biomolecular data analysis and modeling. First, investigators will introduce multiscale weighted colored algebraic graphs (spectral graphs) to reduce the structural complexity of biomolecular data. These methods will be tailored for various biological systems, such as protein binding to protein, ligand, DNA, and RNA, protein folding stability changes upon mutation, drug toxicity, solvation, solubility, and partition coefficient. Secondly, investigators will construct low-dimensional element interactive manifolds for the first time to properly encode chemical and biological information. These methods will be carefully integrated with advanced machine learning or deep learning algorithms to uncover biomolecular structure-function relationships.

A critical component of these forecasts is understanding how variation in limiting environmental factors such as food, water, or shelter drive population fluctuations. In the absence of specific data on these factors, ecologists must use the properties of the observed variation in the data to make projections about future risk. In ecology, these forecasts often make simplifying assumptions about the underlying biology that may impact their accuracy. The project will integrate new mathematical ideas and models with empirical field observations to study the properties of populations that experience large fluctuations, allowing the PIs to test fundamental assumptions about how populations are structured. This work will focus on populations that experience regular cycles, a common phenomenon arising through factors such as competition for resources among individuals or predator-prey interactions. This work will improve both the tools used in the management and conservation of wildlife and the understanding of how external factors drive variation in nonlinear dynamical systems. The mathematical ideas and models developed in this project will use techniques similar to those that economists use to project stock market fluctuations or meteorologists use to predict paths of hurricanes; thus, the results may have important implications for many areas of general societal interest. <br/><br/>Emerging work has shown that universal laws describe the fluctuations of biological systems, regardless of the biological scale at which these processes operate. A key prediction of these laws is that the fluctuations of many biological systems will increase monotonically in response to increases in extrinsic variability, often termed ?environmental noise?. However, this scaling has only been studied in linearized models that are valid when fluctuations are small. When populations exhibit larger fluctuations, the assumptions underlying this theory break down. This project will develop the mathematics needed to study the variance scaling properties in nonlinear biological systems subject to increased environmental variation. In particular, the PIs will study the scaling properties of extrinsic noise in nonlinear biological systems focusing on how increases in the magnitude of external perturbations may drive declines in total system variance. The goal is to understand how nonlinearities in ecological systems may lead to robust or sublinear responses to environmental noise. The research scope includes developing mathematical theory to model how environmental variation interacts with highly nonlinear population dynamics, mainly for single species.  The PIs will also develop the statistical approaches to better detect the signal of the predicted variance scaling relationships from empirical population surveys. This work will be the first to determine how increases in external variability can drive increases in the stability of biological systems, an essential step in constructing a more nuanced description of how nonlinear biological systems interact with and respond to noisy environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite a significant volume of clinical and experimental studies for the detailed mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is a lack of understanding about the host immune response to the virus, which is largely responsible for the variability in disease severity. To accelerate and supplement our understanding of key target pathways in the immune response, this project will develop and analyze a fundamental, comprehensive model for the host immune dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Given we continue as a nation under pandemic conditions with new variants emerging and vaccination rollouts, the theoretical explorations through mathematical modeling will serve as a complement to lab-based and data-based approaches. Other features of this work include student involvement in this research, development of a network of collaborators across three institutions, curricula development, recruitment of students from underrepresented groups, and efforts to bring a broad community of researchers studying the host immune dynamics of COVID-19 together to advance our understanding of the interactions between the immune system and SARS-CoV-2. <br/> <br/>This project aims to accomplish two specific research goals: (i) development of a mathematical model of the host immune dynamics of COVID-19; and (ii) exploration of the model to address important COVID-19 treatment-related questions. For the first goal, the PI will develop and analyze a mathematical model that explicitly represents the virus, immune cells, cytokines, and their interactions, formulated in a system of coupled ordinary and delay differential equations. The main objective is to obtain a better understanding of key aspects of immune response to SARS-CoV-2, specifically its sensitive pathways. For the second goal, the PI will investigate the importance of timing of specific immune responses in disease severity and divergent outcomes, and the emergence of the so-called cytokine storm, excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines in the immune system. The aim is to identify the key mechanisms responsible for disease severity, which could help to identify other pathways to target therapeutically. The primary tools to be used for this project are model parameterization using a series of clinical and experimental data, sensitivity analysis, and numerical simulations. The primary mathematical contribution is the development of computational techniques to analyze high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. In addition, the results from this study on the mechanisms involved in COVID-19 pathology and identification of several therapeutic targets would provide hypotheses to be clinically tested, thus, serving as a foundation for the development of evidence-based treatment protocols to address the global challenge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will use behavior theories and detailed data to develop behavior-driven epidemic models, study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, and generate improved forecasting systems in urban settings. Studies will focus on New York City (NYC), a densely populated metropolitan area with large socioeconomic disparities that often experiences outbreaks earlier than surrounding regions. The proposed model will incorporate contact patterns indoors, where most transmission occurs, the adoption of protective measures such as mask-wearing, and reactive behavior change in response to infection risk. Research results will deepen understanding of behavior-disease interaction and produce next-generation predictive models for emerging respiratory diseases with validated forecasting accuracy. These efforts will fundamentally improve disease model realism by accurately incorporating behavior into mathematical models and improve the accuracy of respiratory disease forecasts. The developed forecasting systems can be deployed in real time to support epidemic control in the event of public health emergency. Research findings will be disseminated promptly to federal and local public health authorities leveraging ongoing collaborations to translate research into strategies for disease prevention and mitigation. The project will have long-term benefits for capacity building in pandemic preparedness and response.<br/><br/>This project will be supported by rich and diverse datasets including neighborhood level COVID-19 data, detailed foot traffic records, mask-wearing survey data, socio-economic indicators, and behavioral characteristics collected from surveys in NYC neighborhoods. Proposed studies are organized around three synergistic research objectives: 1) use of core behavioral science theories ? namely temporal discounting, loss aversion, agency, and norms and deviation ? to quantify risk-driven behavior change; 2) incorporation of dwell time and crowdedness in different indoor settings and population-level masking into a metapopulation epidemic model at the neighborhood scale; 3) development of a predictive model for COVID-19 with behavior-disease feedbacks and systematic evaluation of its predictive skill through retrospective forecasts. The project will employ a breadth of interdisciplinary skills in mathematical modeling, statistical inference, behavior science, data science, and infectious disease epidemiology. These efforts will produce novel mathematical models incorporating human behaviors that enable improved operational forecasting of respiratory diseases.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Science (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for a new suite of mathematical models and corresponding inference tools to better understand the interdependence between the spread of infectious disease and changing human behaviors. Exciting progress has been made separately in mathematical biology and in economics.  This project takes a convergent approach, incorporating how humans respond and make decisions as an epidemic unfolds, using key ideas and methodologies from both disciplines. This is critical to enable reliable forecasting and effective, real-time policy. This project is funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>In this project, an economic (game-theoretic) model of individual decision-making is integrated into a continuous-time Markov chain framework for disease and contact dynamics. Under this approach, epidemic and contact network rates are affected by individually optimal agent behavior, which in turn depend on agents' (unobservable) social-economic costs. Likelihood-based inference methods to accommodate time-inhomogeneous rate parameters are derived, considerably extending the flexibility and realism of existing models, alongside rigorous algorithms for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. Bayesian data augmentation is used to account probabilistically for unobservable quantities as well as missing data via latent variables. Model selection using information-theoretic criteria simultaneously quantifies the improvement in fit reaped from behavioral models and guards against overfitting. Based on learned model parameters, proposed models are tested, possible outbreak scenarios are evaluated, and the impacts of alternative policies are compared via simulation studies and analyses of limiting behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deciphering the dynamics of disease is essential to earlier and more effective interventions to mitigate disease spread. To fully understand these dynamics, information across systems that operate on multiple spatial and time scales, as well as evolving via feedback, must be combined. This research project aims to develop a mathematical framework to combine and analyze such information to further the understanding of infectious disease spread, providing insight for ongoing and future disease outbreaks. The results are also intended to be applicable to multi-scale questions in ecology and immunology more generally. The educational component will serve to train a diverse generation of interdisciplinary scientists, building the capacity of the STEM workforce. Through focused short courses aimed at providing specific, relevant skills in quantitative techniques and cross-disciplinary communication, graduate students in the mathematical and life sciences will learn to collaborate and communicate effectively. Training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students will take place through focused research projects and opportunities to garner translational skills, for example developing and implementing project-based work and participating in outreach activities. Additionally, interactive presentations will engage middle school students through exposure to cutting-edge mathematical biology research.<br/> <br/>The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of interpretable, quantitative models that link mechanisms with data while accounting for variability. However, infectious disease dynamics remain incompletely understood, in part due to the lack of heterogeneity considered in models of immunological, ecological, and epidemiological aspects. Complex, non-linear feedbacks arise from heterogeneities; thus, novel quantitative frameworks are needed to better understand and control infectious disease. This project builds on work in ecology involving integral projection models to develop a framework incorporating trait-based variation. This framework aims to describe development of immunity in a population and, thus, determine disease risk over time. Results will be useful for monitoring infectious disease, selecting interventions, and informing public policy. The educational component aims to strengthen quantitative literacy to help produce a more interdisciplinary workforce. A group of graduate students, across applied, mathematical, and computational disciplines, will be introduced to fundamental quantitative skills such as statistical analyses, model building, parameter estimation, data visualization, and coding.

While the principles of mutant evolution in homogeneous populations are well-understood and are commonly part of textbooks, they do not directly apply to any realistic population with a spatial, hierarchical structure (such as stem cells that maintain the tissue and more differentiated cells that perform tissue function). These features are, however, a common theme of cell dynamics in tissues of higher organisms, as well as microbial populations such as biofilm forming bacteria, which are also characterized by both spatial and hierarchical structure (cell sub-populations with different specializations). This research project will extend fundamental laws of evolution to be applicable across a much greater variety of biological systems. The mathematical theory will be applied to experimental data that follow the evolution of cells in a mouse model of Rhabdomyosarcoma, which is a pediatric cancer. Finally, the project will develop a new mentoring program that facilitates interactions between students and professors, geared especially towards underrepresented students.<br/><br/>A large mathematical literature exists about mutant spread and invasion, focusing on measures such as the mutant fixation probability or the time to mutant fixation in constant populations, as well as mutant load in growing populations. Scaling laws of evolutionary dynamics have been derived, including the equilibrium population density in spatial models, the rate of stochastic tunneling (double-mutant generation from a minority of single mutants), and the mutant content in expanding colonies. In various biological scenarios, however, cells and organisms evolve in more complex settings than those traditionally considered by evolutionary theory. Of particular importance are spatially structured, hierarchically organized cell populations that are regulated by signaling mechanisms. Examples include tissues consisting of stem and more differentiated cells, solid tumors, and biofilms containing bacterial cells with specialized functions. A comprehensive evolutionary theory for such population structures currently does not exist. This project seeks to mathematically define evolutionary scaling laws for spatially structured populations that are hierarchically organized and contain regulatory feedback loops that control cell fate decisions.  This will be done by (a) developing efficient numerical methods that describe spatially expanding, evolving populations, and (b) deriving laws of spatial population dynamics, including rates of fitness valley crossing and scaling laws for the mutant load for different mutant types. The evolutionary theory will be applied to data on cellular evolution in Rhabdomyosarcoma mouse xenografts, which are characterized by both spatial and hierarchical structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The disease, which is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium parasites, is spread between humans via the bite of infected adult female mosquitoes and creates severe public health and socio-economic burdens in regions inhabited by almost half of the world?s population. Each year, malaria infects an average of over 230 million people and causes over 400,000 deaths (mostly in children under the age of five) in endemic areas globally. The widescale use of insecticides-based interventions, notably in the form of long-lasting insecticidal (LLINs) nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS), during the period 2000-2015, has resulted in a dramatic decrease in malaria burden in endemic areas, prompting a concerted global effort to eradicate the disease by 2040.  Unfortunately since 2015, the malaria mosquito has developed widespread resistance to all five chemicals used in LLINs and IRS.  Insecticide resistance and changes in climatic variables are two of the main impediments to malaria eradication. Since LLINs and IRS are the cornerstone interventions for malaria control, one of the most crucial challenges in the malaria ecology community is to determine whether insecticide resistance affects malaria epidemiology. This project will use mathematical modeling approaches, backed by novel empirical data collected in the laboratory as well as in the field, to provide realistic insight into the impact, control and mitigation of the impediments. The project will provide strategies for realistically achieving malaria eradication using existing insecticides-based control resources.  The methodologies and results generated will be made available for broad application, and for studying the transmission dynamics and control of other vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, Lyme disease, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the participation of local high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>The project will develop a genetic-epidemiology modeling framework for providing realistic insight into the malaria transmission dynamics and control, subject to insecticide pressure. The modeling framework extends the classical Ross-Macdonald compartmental modeling framework for malaria by adding, inter alia, the detailed lifecycle and population genetics of malaria mosquitoes (i.e., genetics of insecticide resistance) and the complex host-vector-parasite interactions. The models will allow for the assessment of the impacts of local changes in climatic variables (notably temperature) on the population abundance of the malaria mosquitoes by genotype. The approach of modeling the host-vector-parasite dynamics, in the context of malaria, will offer significant advances in applied mathematics and numerical analysis, particularly in designing and applying dynamical systems and numerical discretization theories and techniques for studying the transmission dynamics and control of diseases caused by vectors (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Specifically, PIs will (i) design a modeling framework for assessing the role of insecticide resistance on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance at different environmental conditions, (ii) evaluate the role of insecticide resistance on the ability of resistant mosquitoes to transmit malaria and (iii) assess the role of natural environmental factors on the abundance of insecticide resistance genotypes and how it relates to malaria incidence. This project will generate hard-to-get data on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance and impact of resistance on malaria parasite development in mosquitoes, which are so invaluable to the design and parametrization of realistic mathematical models for studying the role of insecticide resistance on the dynamics of malaria mosquitoes and disease. This will provide a realistic framework for the design and testing of resistance management strategies for malaria-endemic areas that only have a small chemical arsenal left to fight the disease. Ultimately, this project will generate conditions, in parameter space, for the effective control or elimination of malaria using existing insecticides-based resources, thereby contributing to the global malaria eradication efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While numerous methods have been developed to perform various analysis tasks, this initial step of representing the structure of data is understudied. This project will develop new topological and geometric methods, a formal language of describing shapes, to investigate and characterize the structure of single-cell data. The structural characterizations will be linked to cell functions to reveal structure-function relationships. These methods will be integrated into the large collection of existing analysis tools for single-cell data to improve the reliability and robustness of the biological conclusions and predictions. Application of these tools will help to identify cells carrying critical functions and the properties of these cells. The methods will be implemented as publicly available open-source software packages. The research will promote interdisciplinary collaborations between biologists and mathematicians with an interest in advancing the structure-function relationship in single-cell data. This project will also provide training for students and underrepresented groups at the interface of advanced mathematics and modern biological data analysis.<br/><br/>Numerous single-cell data analysis tools rely on structural representations with reduced dimensions, and the observations could be sensitive to the low-dimensional representation used. A systematic exploration of structural representations is thus needed to control the reliability and interpretability of downstream analysis results. Methods based on applied topology and geometry will be developed to extract low-dimensional structural characteristics from the high-dimensional single-cell omics data by scanning a wide range of scales and parameters. Methods will be developed to adapt to the application of single-cell omics data analysis, for example, local topological fingerprints and topology-guided optimal transport. An atlas of structural representations for a single-cell dataset with well-defined metrics quantifying the difference between structures will be assembled to provide a systematic way of representing the structures of single-cell omics data. A generally applicable pipeline of applying downstream analysis tools upon this structure atlas will be introduced and evaluated in various application cases. The systematic structural analysis method will be combined with machine learning to further address two important questions: establishment of structure-function relationships in single-cell datasets, such as identifying transition cells based on their local structures in the dataset, and integration of single-cell multi-omics datasets based on topological and geometric characterizations, especially for datasets without shared features.

The remarkable efficiency of microorganisms at moving and navigating through a surrounding fluid has inspired recent construction of microfluidic devices for mixing and transport, and micro-machines for drug delivery and manipulation of cells. Since theoretical analyses and experimentation are challenging in this setting, mathematical modeling and numerical simulation have become indispensable in these developments. This project aims to create improved computational and visualization tools for advancing understanding of the motility of microorganisms and our capability to harness this process. The project will develop an interactive three-dimensional visual computing system to serve as (1) a research tool for studying the hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms, (2) an engineering tool for testing and improving the design of artificial, bio-inspired micro-swimmers, and (3) an educational tool for introducing students of all levels to this field. The project will also provide direct training and research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and high school teachers. The project includes plans to develop virtual reality games based on microswimmers to be exhibited at the Museum of Science & Technology as well as public libraries. <br/><br/>Research objectives in this project include the development of an efficient, multigrid-like method for manipulating the large, dense matrices arising from the simulation of interacting micro-swimmers, a data-driven, reduced order model for tracking fluid particles, an efficient numerical method for optimizing the design of bio-inspired swimmers given a task, and a three-dimensional interactive visual computing system for real-time fluid visualization and manipulation. Multigrid methods exploit the geometry of the swimmers and are therefore expected to be more efficient than current numerical approaches. An artificial neural network will be leveraged as a data-driven, reduced order model for the change in a fluid particle?s position. This approach is intended to simulate a fluid particle's trajectory very efficiently, since it does not require calculating fluid-structure interactions, an important aspect in real-time and/or multi-query scenarios. The planned numerical optimization method takes advantage of both the reliability of a genetic algorithm at finding global optima and the efficiency of a gradient-based method when a good initial guess is given.

Computational methods will be developed to describe the motion and the mechanical loading conditions of the diaphragm during respiration. The project aims to improve understanding of diaphragm mechanics and will generate analytical tools to quantify the performance of the diaphragm. In particular, the project will provide quantitative relations between the level of muscle activation and the amount of air displaced by the diaphragm during normal breathing or intense physical activities.

The main objectives are to: (1) Develop a constitutive theory for respiratory muscles, especially diaphragm muscle fibers which have complex microstructures with sarcomeres as the basic motor unit. The constitutive function relates the stress to the deformation in response to activation of the diaphragm muscles. (2) Develop a continuum mechanics theory for active material surfaces to model the diaphragm function. The model will accurately account for large deformations of the diaphragm muscle fibers. (3) Derive the equations of motion for the diaphragm, which, in corporation with the constitutive theory, will lead to the differential equations governing the motion of the diaphragm under the actions of the muscle activation and the transdiaphragmatic pressures. Novel computer programs will be developed to facilitate the solutions of the differential equations. (4) Perform in vitro experiments to supply the experimental data needed for the constitutive functions of the diaphragm. (5) Validate the theory and the computational models by comparing the predicted behavior of diaphragm with experimental measurements.

DNA can become linked and unlinked, or knotted and unknotted, during replication, recombination, and in other enzymatic reactions. The global topology of knotted nucleic acids and the local activity of enzymes can be modeled with objects and operations from knot theory.

The research uses Floer homology, Khovanov homology, and techniques in geometric topology to explore the relationships between knots, links, and three-manifolds. The first aim is to resolve fundamental questions in knot theory on crossing changes, tangle decompositions, and unknotting. New interpretations of Heegaard Floer and Khovanov-theoretic invariants of tangles in terms of immersed curves on surfaces are a major component of the methodology. The second aim is to investigate the relationship between invariants of links and three-manifolds through an exploration of Milnor's invariants and Dehn surgery. The third aim seeks to uncover new connections between knot theory and the structure of biopolymers, and to probe the broad geometric structure of Gordian-type knot graphs with methodology in geometric and low-dimensional topology and graph theory. The project includes biologically motivated questions that center on spatial theta-curves and models of entanglement in nucleic acids. The project provides avenues for graduate and undergraduate students to contribute to research in theoretical and applied knot theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This motion is a result of internal neuromechanical processes that translate neural signals into the activation of muscular tissue. As tissue-engineered pumps and biohybrid robotics improve with every technological advancement, developing the theory behind the actuation of their excitable materials is paramount. While much of the theory in organismal biomechanics and biomimetic materials has examined their performance in the context of mechanical resonance, very little work has been done examining the internal actuation of excitable materials. The interplay between neural time scales, that signal for muscular activation, and mechanical time scales, that are inherent to the elastic profile of the structure, have been found to play an important role in the resulting motion of an actuated material. Furthermore, understanding the role pacemakers play in driving the neural signaling can elucidate how robustness can be ingrained into excitable systems. This research program will develop and employ a suite of mathematical models that describe neuromechanical activation and pacemaker processes, as well as incorporate ?living? materials into computational fluid-structure interaction models. The mathematical principles developed here are relevant in the design of actuators for other biological pumps and systems with excitable materials. The project will involve work with both graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The focus of this research program will be to both examine the mathematical theory that girds the interplay between the neuromechanical actuation wave speed and the material wave speed, as well as examine the role pacemaker processes play in driving these neuromechanical systems. To examine this interplay, a moon jellyfish is chosen as a model organism due to the relative simplicity of their nervous system and muscle morphology. To develop this framework the investigators will employ three different classes of mathematical models: (1) 1-D/2-D elastic wave equation model with internal actuation; (2) a coupled neuronal network model to describe the neurophysiological activity that leads to actuation; (3) a 3-D computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model to describe the forces and motion of a jellyfish bell. The research program's focus is on the roles of actuation wave speeds, pacemaker processes, and the fluid environment plays in the performance of organismal pumps and excitable materials. The resulting framework will be used to develop the first 3-D model of a swimming organism that fully couples the surrounding fluid with an animal whose emergent kinematics are a consequence of neuromuscular activation, elastic properties, and pacemaker processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is an integration of mathematical modeling and experimental analysis of an insect herbivore and predator system to explore the effects of habitat fragmentation, interspecific competition, and predation on the population dynamics and coexistence of species from the patch to the landscape level. Results from this project aim to answer two key ecological questions: (1) For competing species, what effect does the density of the same or different species have on dispersal-reproduction and dispersal competition tradeoffs arising from the evolution of dispersal in fragmented habitats? (2) How does the presence of a shared predator affect the relationship between density and emigration, tradeoffs involving dispersal? The project will also provide significant contributions towards the analysis of mathematical models created to study this behavior via development of new mathematical tools to better understand model dynamics. Finally, results from this study are expected to be applicable to conservation programs and reserve design. This project will involve the training of graduate and undergraduate students through PI-hosted workshops and mentorship of independent research projects. Moreover, an app that estimates key dispersal parameters from field data will be created and made publicly available.<br/><br/>This collaborative project comprises integrated reaction-diffusion modeling, mathematical analysis, and experimental research to explore the effects of habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal, interspecific competition, and predation on the population dynamics and species coexistence from the patch to the landscape level. The Investigators will use diffusive Lotka-Volterra competition and predator-prey systems with nonlinear boundary conditions modeling density dependent emigration (DDE) at the patch and landscape levels. Experiments will be performed using two Tribolium flour beetle species to examine how the DDE relationship and life-history tradeoffs are affected by a shared predator (Xylocoris flavipes). This project is expected to be novel and significant by providing (1) experimental evidence that interspecific competitors and predators affect boundary behavior, the strength and form of DDE, and important life-history tradeoffs linked to species coexistence; (2) the first theoretical framework for the effects of conditional dispersal on the population dynamics and coexistence of competing species and a shared predator in fragmented landscapes; and (3) a significant contribution toward the analysis of systems of elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions, as new mathematical tools will be developed to better understand the models? dynamics. Knowledge of species? life histories, coupled with predictions regarding how competitors and predators can alter the magnitude and form of DDE and life history tradeoffs, can help determine whether existing reserves are adequate for species long-term coexistence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental challenge in the life and health sciences is explaining hidden physiological and disease mechanisms. These hidden mechanisms shape experimental and clinical observations, and medicine strives to improve health by influencing them with new therapies such as drugs. Machine learning can now make stunningly accurate predictions of biological phenomena based on observed data from variable sources. These predictions, however, are difficult to interpret and exploit, because they usually do not address the underlying physiological mechanisms from which the data and predictions derive. On the other hand, mechanistic models replicate features of the experimental and clinical data and address their causes with model parameters that represent the underlying physiology. But these models usually fail to address inherent cell-to-cell and patient-to-patient variability. This project will develop a hybrid deep learning/mechanistic modeling framework that can capture and explain the inherent variability in biological data through identification of parameter sets that result in model outputs consistent with data. The framework is intended to be versatile enough to find input parameters of a model for multiple conditions distinguished by some factor (e.g., treatment, age, or disease state) simultaneously; such ?intervention? scenarios are common in practice. The framework will advance the state of the art by enabling researchers to incorporate additional constraints based on prior knowledge about the nature of an intervention. This project will provide interdisciplinary industrial research experiences to community college and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project will develop and apply novel hybrid modeling architectures that use generative adversarial networks, a class of machine learning algorithms in which two artificial neural networks compete, to map distributions of experimental observations to distributions of biophysical model parameters. The system will tackle a set of important biological questions involving the electrophysiology of circadian clock neurons and aging, cardiac arrhythmias, and Alzheimer?s disease using datasets provided by experimental collaborators. First, the system will be employed to identify which ion channel conductances are involved in the age-related decline of circadian rhythm amplitude in suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons and the altered excitability properties of hippocampal neurons in mouse models of Alzheimer?s disease. Second, the system will be employed on human electrocardiogram data to test the hypothesis that circadian rhythms in cardiac excitability can affect the efficacy of drugs used to treat cardiac arrhythmias.

Better understanding of the role of respiratory muscle in healthy and pathological conditions is expected to lead to improved patient outcomes. This collaborative research will develop comprehensive mathematical models for respiratory muscles, with a special focus on diaphragm, the major muscle of respiration. Computational methods will be developed to describe the motion and the mechanical loading conditions of the diaphragm during respiration. The project aims to improve understanding of diaphragm mechanics and will generate analytical tools to quantify the performance of the diaphragm. In particular, the project will provide quantitative relations between the level of muscle activation and the amount of air displaced by the diaphragm during normal breathing or intense physical activities. By providing a foundation for basic understanding of functionality of respiratory muscles, the research project could improve the management of patients in hospital intensive care units leading to a long-term positive impact on public health. The project will provide training, education and learning opportunities for students at the University of Houston and Baylor College of Medicine with a focus on training underrepresented students. <br/><br/>The project will take an innovative approach to explore fundamental mechanics of diaphragm function and to develop computational methods that are capable of simulating and predicting the complex shape, kinematics, and the mechanical stress field in the diaphragm during respiratory efforts. The main objectives are to: (1) Develop a constitutive theory for respiratory muscles, especially diaphragm muscle fibers which have complex microstructures with sarcomeres as the basic motor unit. The constitutive function relates the stress to the deformation in response to activation of the diaphragm muscles. (2) Develop a continuum mechanics theory for active material surfaces to model the diaphragm function. The model will accurately account for large deformations of the diaphragm muscle fibers. (3) Derive the equations of motion for the diaphragm, which, in corporation with the constitutive theory, will lead to the differential equations governing the motion of the diaphragm under the actions of the muscle activation and the transdiaphragmatic pressures. Novel computer programs will be developed to facilitate the solutions of the differential equations. (4) Perform in vitro experiments to supply the experimental data needed for the constitutive functions of the diaphragm. (5) Validate the theory and the computational models by comparing the predicted behavior of diaphragm with experimental measurements. Refined computational models will allow researchers to predict the motion of diaphragm with user-input constitutive functions, geometry, and loading conditions.

Techniques of analyzing the suitability of the model components, including methods for model selection and validation, will be implemented to compare with multiple experimental data sets in close collaboration with biological experimentalists.

Results of this project will improve the understanding of human heart development at the earliest stages. Also, it will point to how the large, multi-chambered hearts of vertebrates could have evolved from smaller structures.

However, the complex aspects of frameshifting must be understood before therapeutic strategies can succeed. Following a 2020 NSF RAPID award, the Schlick mathematics/computational biology lab, in collaboration with the Laederach experimental RNA group, will combine graph theory applications to RNA (RAG: RNA-As-Graphs) with biophysical studies and biomolecular modeling/simulation to unravel structures and mechanisms of the RNA FSE of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. The collaborative research program will be the basis for interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral fellows, including women and minorities, in mathematics, computer science, biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering, through computer program development, data analysis, and biological interpretations. Students and postdocs will learn to analyze, process, and visualize biological data; devise and validate models; develop simulation algorithms and coarse-grained models; and collect and interpret structural/functional patterns to yield new mathematical and biophysical relationships.<br/><br/>The project will describe conformations and structural transitions of the FSE of SARS-CoV-2 from phylogenetic and biophysical viewpoints by exploiting global representation of mathematical RNA graphs. Specifically, the researchers will gain insight into the evolutionary path of the FSE of coronaviruses by computing and validating experimentally RNA secondary-structure conformational landscapes of the FSE of SARS-CoV-2 relatives; probe frameshifting mechanisms by determining the SARS-CoV-2 FSE's transition pathway; and identify and test experimentally structure-altering mutations to transform the FSE into complex intertwined motifs by RAG inverse folding and genetic algorithms to hamper frameshifting. This unique approach applied to frameshifting elements in coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 using novel mathematical graph-theory tools and biophysical models will yield crucial insights into the structure, mechanisms, and evolutionary trends in related viruses to explain the relationship between viral structure and frameshifting efficiency/viral viability. By looking at structure from a global graph theory point of view, patterns can be discerned and related more easily than sequence or atomic-based models.

However, the complex aspects of frameshifting must be understood before therapeutic strategies can succeed. Following a 2020 NSF RAPID award, the Schlick mathematics/computational biology lab, in collaboration with the Laederach experimental RNA group, will combine graph theory applications to RNA (RAG: RNA-As-Graphs) with biophysical studies and biomolecular modeling/simulation to unravel structures and mechanisms of the RNA FSE of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. The collaborative research program will be the basis for interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral fellows, including women and minorities, in mathematics, computer science, biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering, through computer program development, data analysis, and biological interpretations. Students and postdocs will learn to analyze, process, and visualize biological data; devise and validate models; develop simulation algorithms and coarse-grained models; and collect and interpret structural/functional patterns to yield new mathematical and biophysical relationships. <br/><br/>The project will describe conformations and structural transitions of the FSE of SARS-CoV-2 from phylogenetic and biophysical viewpoints by exploiting global representation of mathematical RNA graphs. Specifically, the researchers will gain insight into the evolutionary path of the FSE of coronaviruses by computing and validating experimentally RNA secondary-structure conformational landscapes of the FSE of SARS-CoV-2 relatives; probe frameshifting mechanisms by determining the SARS-CoV-2 FSE's transition pathway; and identify and test experimentally structure-altering mutations to transform the FSE into complex intertwined motifs by RAG inverse folding and genetic algorithms to hamper frameshifting. This unique approach applied to frameshifting elements in coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 using novel mathematical graph-theory tools and biophysical models will yield crucial insights into the structure, mechanisms, and evolutionary trends in related viruses to explain the relationship between viral structure and frameshifting efficiency/viral viability. By looking at structure from a global graph theory point of view, patterns can be discerned and related more easily than sequence or atomic-based models. The determined structures, mechanisms, and structure-altering mutations define gene therapy and anti-viral targets for therapeutic interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Epidemiological models are mathematical and computational tools that can help guide public-health decisions to mitigate morbidity, mortality, and economic impacts of communicable diseases. Their effectiveness could be further improved by addressing two issues. First, people differ from one another in their perceptions of risk, social network size, number of contacts per day, willingness to engage with public-health measures, and in their receptivity to mis- and dis-information. This heterogeneity is a major challenge in accurately characterizing human behavior that is central to ensuring prediction accuracy in epidemiological models. Second, uncertainty pervades all epidemiological modeling. All models rely on input parameters, such as the fraction of infections that are asymptomatic, that cannot be known with certainty, yet model predictions can vary dramatically as the unknown parameters vary over plausible ranges. Ignoring this intrinsic uncertainty in key input parameters can lead to overly confident predictions of models and, in turn, to poor decisions that do not consider an appropriate range of potential outcomes. This model development is carried out working with organizations of public health officials at state and federal levels to ensure relevance and practicality.  This project is funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>In this project, a range of statistical and machine-learning methods are employed on publicly available data sets to fit parametric and non-parametric models of human behaviors relevant to epidemiological models. Advanced techniques are developed and used to elicit human behavior from contact-tracing data, adjusting for the missing data and selection bias that is inherent in such data. The resulting analyses provide input into optimization methods that are designed to optimize policy interventions while explicitly accounting for heterogeneity and uncertainty. Tailored optimization methods optimize over both short time scales (days), through optimization of graph models that depict social networks and through eigenvalue optimization problems on contact-structure models that minimize rates of spread, and over longer time scales (weeks or months), that take into account behavioral response to interventions, such as fatigue.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The disease, which is caused by the protozoan Plasmodium parasites, is spread between humans via the bite of infected adult female mosquitoes and creates severe public health and socio-economic burdens in regions inhabited by almost half of the world?s population. Each year, malaria infects an average of over 230 million people and causes over 400,000 deaths (mostly in children under the age of five) in endemic areas globally. The widescale use of insecticides-based interventions, notably in the form of long-lasting insecticidal (LLINs) nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS), during the period 2000-2015, has resulted in a dramatic decrease in malaria burden in endemic areas, prompting a concerted global effort to eradicate the disease by 2040.  Unfortunately since 2015, the malaria mosquito has developed widespread resistance to all five chemicals used in LLINs and IRS.  Insecticide resistance and changes in climatic variables are two of the main impediments to malaria eradication. Since LLINs and IRS are the cornerstone interventions for malaria control, one of the most crucial challenges in the malaria ecology community is to determine whether insecticide resistance affects malaria epidemiology. This project will use mathematical modeling approaches, backed by novel empirical data collected in the laboratory as well as in the field, to provide realistic insight into the impact, control and mitigation of the impediments. The project will provide strategies for realistically achieving malaria eradication using existing insecticides-based control resources.  The methodologies and results generated will be made available for broad application, and for studying the transmission dynamics and control of other vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, Lyme disease, West Nile virus and Zika virus. The project will support the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the participation of local high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>The project will develop a genetic-epidemiology modeling framework for providing realistic insight into the malaria transmission dynamics and control, subject to insecticide pressure. The modeling framework extends the classical Ross-Macdonald compartmental modeling framework for malaria by adding, inter alia, the detailed lifecycle and population genetics of malaria mosquitoes (i.e., genetics of insecticide resistance) and the complex host-vector-parasite interactions. The models will allow for the assessment of the impacts of local changes in climatic variables (notably temperature) on the population abundance of the malaria mosquitoes by genotype. The approach of modeling the host-vector-parasite dynamics, in the context of malaria, will offer significant advances in applied mathematics and numerical analysis, particularly in designing and applying dynamical systems and numerical discretization theories and techniques for studying the transmission dynamics and control of diseases caused by vectors (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Specifically, PIs will (i) design a modeling framework for assessing the role of insecticide resistance on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance at different environmental conditions, (ii) evaluate the role of insecticide resistance on the ability of resistant mosquitoes to transmit malaria and (iii) assess the role of natural environmental factors on the abundance of insecticide resistance genotypes and how it relates to malaria incidence. This project will generate hard-to-get data on the fitness costs of insecticide resistance and impact of resistance on malaria parasite development in mosquitoes, which are so invaluable to the design and parametrization of realistic mathematical models for studying the role of insecticide resistance on the dynamics of malaria mosquitoes and disease. This will provide a realistic framework for the design and testing of resistance management strategies for malaria-endemic areas that only have a small chemical arsenal left to fight the disease. Ultimately, this project will generate conditions, in parameter space, for the effective control or elimination of malaria using existing insecticides-based resources, thereby contributing to the global malaria eradication efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the growth of root hairs with one-cell width effectively increases the surface area of the plant roots to absorb water and nutrients. Although experimental approaches have been able to track cell wall morphology and kinematics on the expanding cell wall surface for more than a century, the regulation of cell wall growth needs further elucidation. This project will develop mathematical models and computational methods to simulate the cell wall expansion due to the spatial patterning of new cell wall materials and mechanical interaction with the cell interior. Further, inference methods will be devised to predict the spatial patterning of wall-material trafficking from the cell wall geometry and quantify how volume growth inside the cell wall is distributed and rearranged to sustain the cell wall geometry during expansion and under mechanical constraints. The methods developed in this research can be applied to filamentous growth systems such as pollen tubes, root hairs, fungus hyphae, thus having significant implications in advancing agriculture and improving public health. Complementary to the research, the investigator will engage students, including K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students, in research mentorship, journal clubs, and a new interactive learning platform ""Filaform?, to promote interest and transdisciplinary understanding of this biological process by leveraging geometry and other mathematics in conjunction with modern and emerging experimental techniques.<br/> <br/>To reach the research and education goals, two complementary mathematical models at different scales will be developed. The first will be a thin-shell model approximating the cell wall surface as a growing elastic boundary inflated by turgor pressure from the cell interior. Cubic-spline solutions will be developed to simulate the evolution of surface growth under the influence of turgor pressure and the distribution of exocytosis, a process that distributes new cell wall material along the cell wall interior surface. In addition, an inverse problem coupled with a subset of the model equations will be formulated to infer the distribution of exocytosis given the steady-state cell shape. Taking the exocytosis distribution as an input, the second model will be a three-dimensional model that describes the growth distribution and directionality (anisotropy) across the cell wall thickness. An energy-based material-point method will be developed to simulate the dynamics of the moving cell-wall domain. The investigator will infer the spatial map of the volume growth and anisotropy in the cell-wall domain by formulating optimization problems constrained by the three-dimensional model. Theoretical predictions from both models will be validated by experiments tracking the cell wall morphology, signals of protein complexes involved in exocytosis, and new polymers in the cell wall. The investigator will create an open-source interactive teaching and learning platform for outreach to K-12 educators and students based on the thin-shell model and its simulation. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Science and by the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology (BMMB) program in the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This motion is a result of internal neuromechanical processes that translate neural signals into the activation of muscular tissue. As tissue-engineered pumps and biohybrid robotics improve with every technological advancement, developing the theory behind the actuation of their excitable materials is paramount. While much of the theory in organismal biomechanics and biomimetic materials has examined their performance in the context of mechanical resonance, very little work has been done examining the internal actuation of excitable materials. The interplay between neural time scales, that signal for muscular activation, and mechanical time scales, that are inherent to the elastic profile of the structure, have been found to play an important role in the resulting motion of an actuated material. Furthermore, understanding the role pacemakers play in driving the neural signaling can elucidate how robustness can be ingrained into excitable systems. This research program will develop and employ a suite of mathematical models that describe neuromechanical activation and pacemaker processes, as well as incorporate ?living? materials into computational fluid-structure interaction models. The mathematical principles developed here are relevant in the design of actuators for other biological pumps and systems with excitable materials. The project will involve work with both graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The focus of this research program will be to both examine the mathematical theory that girds the interplay between the neuromechanical actuation wave speed and the material wave speed, as well as examine the role pacemaker processes play in driving these neuromechanical systems. To examine this interplay, a moon jellyfish is chosen as a model organism due to the relative simplicity of their nervous system and muscle morphology. To develop this framework the investigators will employ three different classes of mathematical models: (1) 1-D/2-D elastic wave equation model with internal actuation; (2) a coupled neuronal network model to describe the neurophysiological activity that leads to actuation; (3) a 3-D computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model to describe the forces and motion of a jellyfish bell. The research program's focus is on the roles of actuation wave speeds, pacemaker processes, and the fluid environment plays in the performance of organismal pumps and excitable materials. The resulting framework will be used to develop the first 3-D model of a swimming organism that fully couples the surrounding fluid with an animal whose emergent kinematics are a consequence of neuromuscular activation, elastic properties, and pacemaker processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These predictions guide the allocation of health resources and interventions to reduce disease spread or mitigate its burdens. While these models incorporate information about how an infection is transmitted, the disease course in infected individuals, and the effects of interventions like vaccines, they rarely capture how individuals make behavior decisions or how these choices respond to an epidemic. As individuals face different economic and health circumstances, the population will not uniformly respond to the epidemic or policy interventions. This omission materially affects the accuracy of these models and by extension, the effectiveness of policies deployed to combat the disease and its impacts. To address this limitation, this project brings together expertise in epidemiology, mathematical biology, systems engineering, economics, and decision science at Johns Hopkins University to develop a new integrated modeling framework that combines traditional epidemiological models of disease spread with economic models of individual decision-making. The three most significant benefits of this new approach are: 1) Improving future epidemic forecasts for existing and new emerging infections; 2) Allowing for a cost-benefit analysis of disease mitigation policies that reflects changes in human behavior and economic outputs; 3) Helping predict the disparate impact of an epidemic and mitigation policies across socioeconomic groups facing different health-wealth tradeoffs. The broader impacts of the project include dissemination of research results to broad audience and training of public health practitioners.<br/> <br/>The tools to understand the complex dynamic interactions between human behavior and pathogens during disease emergence, dissemination, and control are lacking. Current epidemiological models generally do not endogenize individual behaviors, while agent-based models from economics that have this feature miss critical aspects of disease transmission and progression. The goals of this study are to: 1) More accurately predict disease spread and health outcomes during an outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic; 2) Enable multi-objective policy design by simultaneously quantifying both the disease burden and economic costs of proposed policies, allowing for the evaluation of both economic and health policies; and 3) Evaluate heterogeneity and equity by quantifying the distributional impacts of disease burden and economic cost across socio-demographic and risk groups. To address these goals, this project brings together a multi-disciplinary team at Johns Hopkins?with expertise in epidemiology, mathematical biology, systems engineering, economics, and decision science?to develop a novel integrated mathematical framework that combines mechanistic models of infectious disease dynamics with economic models of human behavior. This framework is designed to capture behavioral responses to both the epidemic state and policies in place, and the effect of individual-level behavioral responses on the trajectory of the disease within a population.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES) in the Directorate of Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
