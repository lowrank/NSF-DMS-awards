Important applications of molecular surfaces include protein folding, protein-protein interfaces, protein-membrane interaction, DNA binding and bending, macromolecular docking, enzyme catalysis, solvation energy and molecular dynamics.  Despite extensive effort in the past three decades, the generation and analysis of molecular surfaces remain a bottleneck in the structure prediction of biomolecules.  To overcome this difficulty, investigators introduce a partial differential equation (PDE) based approach of molecular surface modeling.  A set of curvature-controlled PDEs is designed for molecular surface generation.  Two new concepts, molecular multiresolution surfaces and minimal molecular surfaces, which naturally arise in the proposed PDE modeling, are introduced to the field of molecular biology.  The proposed molecular multiresolution surfaces provide a unified description of the van der Waals surface, solvent accessible surface, and solvent excluded surface.  The proposed minimal molecular surface is also consistent with surface free energy minimization.  Numerical techniques, including PDE solution algorithms and isosurface extraction schemes will be investigated.  Numerical tests will be carried out to validate the proposed ideas.<br/><br/>This project will lead to reliable methods in the structure prediction of biomolecules.  Structural information is particularly important for rational drug design efforts specifically targeting proteins and/or membranes.  It can be expected that the availability of more protein/membrane structures will lead to accelerated drug development efforts.  The mathematical analysis proposed in this project will also impact image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision.  The results of the proposed project can be used for detailed control of PDE surfaces according to industrial and scientific needs and objectives.  In particular, nonlinear diffusivities in the proposed equations can be used to control the shape of a PDE surface locally according to its curvature.  The proposed research has a strong educational component.  The project will support the training of a Ph.D. student researcher in mathematical biology.  PDE-based molecular surface modeling is a suitable topic for graduate theses and undergraduate projects. Project results will be incorporated in graduate courses in biological modeling and simulation."

The rapid growth of computer capability in the past few decades not withstanding, our ability to model three-dimensional wave propagation and scattering involving geometrically complicated dielectric interfaces is severely limited. Mathematically, the wave solutions are usually non-smooth or even discontinuous across the material interfaces, so that our effort in designing efficient algorithms is easily foiled, unless the complex interfaces are properly treated. The complex interfaces and geometries are commonly tackled by using body-fitted grids in the literature. Even though considerable progress has been made in grid generation, the formation of a good quality body-fitted grid system in geometrically complex domain remains a difficult and time-consuming task. Alternatively, in this project, the investigator will explore how to accommodate dielectric interfaces with complex geometries by using Cartesian grids including the staggered Yee grids. The resulting Cartesian grid methods, which in some sense fit the numerical differentiation operators to the complicated geometries, are less well studied in the literature, in contrast to the body-fitted grid methods. The development of high order Cartesian grid methods with complex interfaces being accurately treated, is of imminent practical importance to efficient wave simulations, but remains unsolved. In this project, innovative fourth order Cartesian grid approaches will be constructed based on the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method newly developed by the investigator and his collaborators for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving material interfaces or inhomogeneous media. To address a widespread variety of electromagnetic applications, a complete set of fourth order MIB methods will be developed for different electromagnetic formulations including the Helmholtz equation, the wave equation, and Maxwell's equations, and for different scenarios including the transverse magnetic mode, the transverse electric mode, and fully three-dimensional mode. <br/><br/>Computational electromagnetics (CEM), an interdisciplinary field where one witnesses mutual contributions from mathematicians and engineers is of paramount importance for a wide range of applications, including analysis and synthesis of antenna, calculation of radar cross section (RCS), simulation of ground or surface penetrating radar, to name only a few. The proposed numerical approaches aim to address challenging CEM applications involving large-scale and irregularly shaped structures, for which currently existing methods encounter great difficulties. By delivering more accurate and efficient wave simulations, the proposed methods will lead to breakthroughs in resolving long-standing problems in the real CEM applications. Moreover, the proposed methods will have considerable impact on other challenging interface problems in scientific computing, such as the immersed interface and moving interface problems in fluid dynamics, electrostatic interface problems for structural prediction of large biomolecules in computational biology.<br/><br/><br/>"

The work will also help reduce the schism between mathematics and biology by pursuing a paradigm of tight interdisciplinary vertical integration involving undergraduate students, graduate students, and research faculty.<br/><br/>This research allows us to evaluate scientific questions such as: 1) Can mathematical equations predict animal behavior?

The ability to predict animal behavior in field populations also can be applied to such practical concerns as the spread of disease, including bird flu, Salmonella, Shigella, West Nile fever, and Lyme disease; reduction in the risk of bird-aircraft strikes, which cause major loss of human life and property; and wildlife management. Despite the accelerating use of mathematics in research biology, the schism between mathematics and academic biology has been very difficult to close, and is perpetuated at the undergraduate level.

The thermal fluctuations are taking into account by including appropriate stochastic forcing terms in the fluid equations.  These methods are then applied to study the dynamic membrane rearrangements involved in the functions of two cell organelles, the Golgi Apparatus and Mitochondria.  The main biological questions that are addressed concern the role that membrane geometry and spatial distribution of biochemical species play in the functions of these organelles, as induced by the membrane biochemistry, osmotic stresses, fluid flow, and thermal fluctuations.  With advances in biochemical assays and electron tomography data is now becoming available which hint at how these cell organelles function both in healthy and in diseased cells.  While a comprehensive understanding remains elusive, mathematical modeling may help clarify our present understanding and aid in postulating basic mechanisms by which these cell organelles function.  The detailed, large-scale mathematical modeling of this project is intended to shed light on some of these mechanisms, by generating and refining experimentally testable hypothesis about cell organelles' dynamical structures.  This work may also advance our understanding of cell organelle processes in general, and possibly give insight into the cellular mechanisms which break down during diseased states suggesting new medical intervention strategies.  In addition to contributing to basic science, the knowledge gained in this research will be used in training graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and in the design of research-influenced mathematical biology courses for which materials will be posted on the web.  Software packages will also be made available for the general computational methods developed.<br/><br/>With advances in cell biology compelling information has been obtained about many cellular processes from mathematical models which consider primarily the interactions between a collection of biochemical species.  An even deeper understanding may become possible if in addition the spatial organization of these components and their interactions with cellular structures are modeled.  In this project the role cellular structures play through spatial distribution of biochemical species is studied, with a specific emphasis on modeling at a coarse-level the Golgi Apparatus and Mitochondria cell organelles.  The mechanics of many cellular structures can be regarded at a coarse-level as flexible structures which interact with a fluid.  This common mechanical feature of biological systems presents many challenges in formulating models which are amenable to mathematical analysis and computational simulation while being realistic enough to capture relevant features of the biological phenomena being studied.  The Immersed Boundary Method, a computational method simultaneously accounting for flexible structures and fluid, has been used to perform simulations of these mechanical features in the study of a variety of biological systems, including blood flow around valves in the beating heart, wave propagation in the cochlea, and lift generation in insect flight.  Simulating cellular processes at microscopic scales presents further challenges requiring that thermal fluctuations be taking into account for the fluid and immersed structures."

Beta-cells secrete insulin in a pulsatile fashion, with pulse period of approximately five minutes.  Disruption of this oscillatory pattern is observed in diabetics and their near relatives.  The two primary aims of this project are (1) to better understand the mechanism for pulsatile insulin secretion, and (2) to investigate potential mechanisms for the synchronization of the population of islet oscillators.  We focus on oscillations in glycolysis, coupled to the electrical activity of the cell, as a mechanism for pulsatile insulin secretion. This is based on data in the literature and from a collaborating lab showing oscillations in mitochondrial variables.  From a mathematical viewpoint, the model consists of two mutually coupled oscillators, which we call a dual-oscillator model.  Glycolysis is the slowest of the two oscillators, while electrical bursting in the cell is the faster oscillator.  Much of our analysis focuses on the dynamics of this dual-oscillator system.  The pancreas contains a large number of islets, and their activity must be synchronized for the insulin release from the islet population to be oscillatory.  In this project, two mechanisms for synchronization are investigated.  One is the entrainment of islets by peripheral nerves in intrapancreatic ganglia.  This will be investigated by applying periodic pulses to the dual-oscillator model and identifying conditions for entrainment and entrainment windows.  The other synchronization mechanism is the feedback of insulin onto insulin receptors on the beta-cells.  This provides a relatively weak coupling effect on the model islets, but it may be sufficiently strong to achieve synchronization.<br/><br/>Failure of beta-cells to secrete the proper amount of insulin in response to changes in the glucose level in the blood is a major factor for type II diabetes. For this reason, it is important to understand the biological mechanism for insulin secretion, and the coordination of the insulin-secreting cells. The beta-cells are very complex, and our approach to understanding their behavior is to combine mathematical modeling and computer simulations with experimental studies, performed at a collaborating lab. Both undergraduate and graduate students are involved in the mathematical modeling and computer simulations, and will meet with experimental collaborators to discuss data and future experiments motivated by the modeling.  Our goal is to understand how proper insulin secretion is achieved at the cellular level, and then extend this to understand how beta-cell disfunctions can lead to type II diabetes."

There are many unresolved scientific questions about the transmission of the HIV virus, among them the relative infectivity of people at different stages of the disease and the extent to which people can acquire resistance to the virus.  A model for HIV transmission among homosexual men has been developed, based on a detailed data set from the onset of the AIDS crisis in San Francisco. By taking into account the widely varying levels of sexual activity in the population, the data can be fit quite well with parameters that imply a higher late stage infectivity than has been commonly believed.  A similar model will be developed for heterosexual HIV transmission and to incorporate additional features into these models, such as acquired resistance and the effect of various prevention measures. By comparing these models with additional data sets, infectivity rates for men and women will be estimated, the effect of acquired resistance will be quantified, and the effectiveness of various prevention strategies will be evaluated.  Answering the HIV questions described above will have an impact both on public health policy and on the development of new methods for prevention and treatment of HIV. The results will be critical to understanding the value of screening for infected individuals in slowing the epidemic.  Another question studied is the ""Repetitive DNA"", which refers to separate regions of genomes of various species that are very similar to each other.  These repetitive regions are important for several reasons:  They are a major obstruction to correctly determining the genomic sequence, they provide valuable information about the evolution of the genome, and in all likelihood they have more biological function than is currently understood.  Remarkable statistical features of the repetitive regions for several genomes have been discovered.  Long repetitive regions and the mechanisms by which these regions are created, destroyed, and mutated over time are of particular interest.  A detailed analysis of the differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes will be performed; in some cases, one genome will have an extra (repetitive) copy of a DNA segment that is in both genomes, and in other cases one genome will be missing a segment that is in the other genome.  The processes by which these segments are copied and deleted as a species evolves will be modeled."

The two main analytic approaches will make use of different mathematical approximations available when the strength of selection is relatively weak or strong. The scope and accuracy of these new methods will be verified using computer simulations. The new mathematical tools will also be used to address two important questions in community coevolution. First, does the number of potential hosts influence transitions between generalist and specialist parasites? Second, does coevolution lead to different ecological network structure in mutualistic vs. antagonistic communities?

The fact that there are many polymer networks with gel-like properties in biological systems has been largely overlooked by experimentalists and theorists.  Indeed, quantitative studies of biogels are scant in comparison with those of other physiological structures and processes.  One aim of this project, therefore, is to bring to bear the tools of applied mathematics to several closely related problems of biogel growth and dynamic behavior.  More specifically, the goal of this proposal is to study the processes of gel formation, secretion, and degradation; their regulation; and the relationship between these and function in dynamic physiological biogels.  The investigators will study these issues by examining three specific problems: i) The growth of fibrin gel networks during blood clotting.  ii) Vesicular exocytosis of mucin gel.  iii) The growth and regulation of the mucin layer in the stomach and its role in gastric protection.  The studies will involve multiple spatial and temporal scales, and will examine how microscopic properties and events affect macroscopic function.  Mathematical models will be developed to understand how physical properties such as the viscoelastic constitutive properties and the gel morphology are determined and controlled, and how these properties affect the physiological function of the biogel.  At the same time, the investigators will look for general principles of biogel dynamics that have consequences in other systems.<br/><br/>Polymer networks with gel-like properties arise in a wide range of physiological settings and processes.  Better insight into how such gels are formed and how their properties are regulated is critical to understanding these important processes and how they can be manipulated to improve human health.  Because the formation and regulation of biogels is governed by physical and chemical properties and because these properties can be expressed mathematically, mathematical tools can be brought to bear on these problems.  Through mathematical analysis and computational simulations of biogels, a wealth of detailed data can be obtained that complements the data obtainable from traditional laboratory experiments. Hence the combination of mathematical and experimental investigators brought together in this project is expected to lead to important new insights about biogel behavior in important physiological and pathological situations including blood clotting, mucin secretion, and protection of the stomach lining.<br/>"

In order to expose students to the questions and problems regularly confronted by practicing scientists, our institutional level program takes advantage of two industry sponsored capstone initiatives at The Claremont Colleges.  As such, student evaluation criteria will be based primarily on performance, and, in particular, on the performance of student teams to obtain implementable solutions to novel problems.

Armed with skills necessary to use computers for data collection and running experiments, students can see for themselves the application of mathematics as a laboratory tool.  During the summer of their junior year, student teams composed of members with varying academic backgrounds engage in mentor-supervised research projects in biology.  Here they learn to use the computer as a meeting point between empirically and quantitatively oriented researchers.  The research questions and problems addressed by student teams in their senior year are typical of those confronted by scientists in biotechnology: the proposed solutions must work in practice and be delivered by a specified deadline.   Summative evaluations are based on special examinations that challenge student teams to obtain practical solutions to open-ended problems that differ from those encountered during their research experiences.  Formative evaluations are based on inputs provided by both the participants and their peers.  An annual conference is an integral part of this project and serves to provide a venue for student recruitment, the assessment of students, and the evaluation of the program by an external review committee.

The so-called phyllotactic patterns of plants are particularly striking because the patterning process reaches beyond the simple steric interactions used to explain crystal symmetries.  The goal of this project is to characterize mathematically the universe of all possible phyllotactic configurations and to determine formally and empirically why some configurations are more common than others in plants.  To investigate the universe of all phyllotactic patterns it has been necessary to develop the concept of multilattices, a geometric framework that offers a much greater flexibility than the traditional concept of lattices.  Multilattices encompass all the regular phyllotactic configurations found in Nature (including whorls and lattices).  Another aspect of this project is to generate a comprehensive data-set of time-resolved phyllotactic configurations both during normal development and following perturbation so as to explore the set of stable configurations that are accessible to plants.  The extensive data set will serve to calibrate the dynamical systems.  The concept of multilattices is the first formalism that does not constrain observed patterns into rigid classes but in fact fully accounts for the variation found in plants and beyond.  One broad impact of this project will be to provide the scientific community with a large data-set of time-resolved phyllotactic configurations as well as tools to explore these data.  The project will also offer multidisciplinary training for female undergraduates from Smith College both in basic experimental techniques and mathematics. <br/><br/>Many structures found in the living world show patterns of great regularity.  It may not come as a great surprise that proteins can assemble to create patterns that emulate the beautiful symmetries of crystals.  However, when the same regularity is found at the level of an entire organism, one may justly be astonished.  Yet, this is a common occurrence in plants where the placement of leaves and flowers around the stem can give rise to exquisite patterns.  The common geometrical features found in plants and crystals are unlikely to be explained by their molecular constituents since these diverge widely.  Plants and crystals must share some general developmental rules leading to the similarities in pattern.  The goal of this project is to study these rules mathematically and empirically.  The types of patterns found in plants and other living structures are much richer than those of 2-D crystals, therefore their description has required a new mathematical framework called multilattices.   Another aspect of this project is to generate a comprehensive data set of the types of patterns observed in plants.  A formal understanding of multilattices may have many important applications.  For example, the packing of flowers and seeds often determines yield in plants while the positioning of leaves around the stem determines the efficiency of a plant at capturing light which, ultimately, influences overall plant growth.  Moreover, many human diseases such as Alzheimer involve the formation of protein crystals known as amyloids within cells. Understanding the rules under which proteins crystallize may help pinpoint the origin of these diseases.<br/>"

Mathematically we will be dealing with a complex free boundary problem.  Continuum theory will be used to model the motion of these interfaces. The dynamics of the liquids surrounding the interface will be governed by a set of partial differential equations.  These equations will be coupled to a system of partial differential equations along the interface. A boundary integral numerical method will be used to solve these complicated three-dimensional free-boundary problems.  Recent experimental work will be used as a guide in selecting our mathematical models. A computational investigation beyond the parameter ranges of current experimental results will be done in order to fully understand our models.  Several limiting cases will be investigated analytically using perturbation methods.<br/><br/>The dynamics of biological interfaces is an important and relatively unexplored field.  It is central to cellular activities and especially in vesicle transport and delivery processes. A number of diseases are related to a malfunction of vesicle transport in cells; hence the results of this research could lead to new treatments and drugs.

In addition to the formal sessions, there are two afternoon poster sessions. The session chairs and invited speakers consist of both established leaders and energetic new researchers. Consistent with tradition, a wide variety of topics ranging will be represented at this conference: noise in biological systems, biological polymers and membranes, biological networks, cancer, environmental stoichiometry, calcium dynamics, social insects, synaptic plasticity and immunology. The breadth of topics cover many spatial and temporal scales of biological phenomena, reflecting the theme of this year's conference, ``From Molecules to Networks.'' Invited speakers have been selected based on their expertise and accomplishments, while trying to balance gender and minority representation.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this conference are numerous. Its multidisciplinary nature fosters new collaborations between biologists and researchers from the mathematical sciences.

The models are based on lubrication theory and the resulting high-order nonlinear partial differential equations will be solved using analytical and computational methods.  The results will be closely compared with in vivo measurements of the tear film thickness.  Currently, a finite-difference spatial discretization together with backward-differentiation-formula software for numerically solving ordinary differential-algebraic equations (Daspk) is being used to solve the simplest of our models; two new computational approaches will be developed as well.  One new approach will use radial basis functions as a basis for the method.

This project will develop new mathematical models for the human tear film and will develop new computational methods to solve these problems.  The computational methods will be developed jointly with mathematicians at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and University of Delaware professors and students.  The results will be closely compared with in vivo measurements of tear film thickness dynamics made in the College of Optometry at the Ohio State University.  The impacts of these results will be twofold.  First, we will provide new quantitative understanding of the tear film for optometrists and ophthalmologists; we hope it will help improve treatment for DES.

In the US alone, 36% of 45 year olds and 80% of those 75 and older have CVD (American Heart Association Statistics 2005).  Atherosclerotic plaques may rupture without warning and cause acute cardiovascular syndromes such as heart attack and stroke.   Many victims of the disease who are apparently healthy die suddenly without prior symptoms. Non-invasive screening and diagnostic methods are urgently needed to identify the victims early and avoid those tragic events.  The objective of this project is to combine computational modeling, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathological analysis to simulate plaque progression and quantify critical blood flow and plaque stress/strain conditions under which plaque rupture is likely to occur.  MRI and pathological analysis will be used to quantify human carotid plaque morphology and progression and to assess plaque vulnerability.  For the first time, multi-year MRI patient-tracking data will be obtained to quantify human atherosclerotic plaque progression.  MRI-based three-dimensional (3D) computational models with multi-component plaque structure and fluid-structure interactions (FSI) will be developed and solved by numerical methods based on the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) method to obtain critical flow and plaque stress/strain conditions, to identify suitable plaque rupture risk indicators for more accurate plaque assessment, and to simulate plaque progression for early prediction and diagnosis of related cardiovascular diseases.<br/><br/>The computational model, MLPG method, and a better understanding of plaque progression and rupture will be considerable contributions to computational mathematics, biological sciences, bioengineering, especially in the cardiovascular research area with realistic potential clinical applications.  The combination of computational fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, MRI multi-spectral plaque analysis and patient tracking, in vitro plaque modeling, and histopathological analysis can create a realistic integrative model for plaque progression and rupture.  The models and methods will be applicable to problems in biological and material sciences involving multi-physics, growth, and moving geometries.  This integrative computational model can be adapted to other less costly non-invasive modalities such as ultrasound to facilitate a wider use. This collaborative project will establish a research-teaching infrastructure that facilitates multi-disciplinary research-teaching activities for all related areas. Multi-disciplinary courses will be developed and offered to graduate and undergraduate students. Participation of underrepresented groups (African Americans, women, people with disabilities, and other minority groups) will be strongly encouraged. The multi-disciplinary oriented graduates will have skills and knowledge in applied and computational mathematics, bioengineering, and general biological applications. Research progress will be posted on the web with frequent updates, presented at professional meetings, and published in professional journals.  Success of this project will lead to a better and quantitative understanding of plaque progression and rupture and considerable improvement in accuracy, reliability and applicability of computational modeling in real life biological applications.  Improved diagnosis of all stages of carotid atherosclerosis will expand options for early treatment and result in a reduction of cerebrovascular events and healthcare costs, and improve quality of life.<br/>"

Insufficient attention has been paid to fact that these local networks do not exist in isolation but are interconnected with many other such local networks in the cell.  Because the global gene-biochemical network is so highly interconnected, one would expect that large changes in one local network would propagate and potentially disrupt the normal functions of other local networks.

The investigators will analyze how random fluctuations are attenuated in large complex networks (both random and deterministic) with homogeneous local reaction dynamics.  They will also investigate the regulatory properties of specific biochemical mechanisms in small inhomogeneous networks that stabilize particular concentrations and fluxes against outside perturbations. The research builds on previous work of the investigators who discovered a range of novel regulatory mechanisms that produce homeostasis in one-carbon metabolism. <br/><br/>The properties of cells depend on a large, highly interconnected, hierarchical network of genetic and biochemical interactions.

Specifically, the model includes comprehensive fluid dynamics for a fluid flowing over a generic biofilm domain. The major advance in this model is to allow for the motion of the biofilm due to the fluid motion and growth processes. The biofilm is composed of multiple species of bacteria that consume multiple types of nutrients and produce both bacteria and exo-polymeric substance (EPS). The EPS is responsible for the redistribution of the biomass by virtue of the osmotic pressure that typifies hydrogels.  By producing EPS in regions of higher nutrient concentration, gradients of EPS concentration are set up. These gradients induce a force on the biofilm tending to equilibrate the concentration of EPS.  This physical description of biomass redistribution coupled with realistic motion of the biofilm due to growth is a substantial improvement over existing models. Much of the focus of the early investigations will concern numerical methods to incorporate the free boundary that marks the permanent separation between the bulk fluid and the biofilm regions.  The methods that we are using are based on boundary integral methods that have been used successfully to model two fluid systems with various types of boundaries (e.g. elastic, passive).  To use these methods, a generalized reciprocal theorem will be derived which includes the growth of the biofilm in the constitutive relationship. Once the reciprocal theorem is established, an integral equation can be derived that determines the velocity of the fluid/biofilm system.<br/><br/>Microbial biofilms have a significant impact on virtually all areas of our lives. While these impacts can be beneficial, such as the use of biofilms in bioremediation and wastewater treatment, the majority of current research focuses on the detrimental processes associated with biofilm contamination.  Negative impacts of biofilms include examples from such diverse areas as food service industries, chemical manufacturing plants, paper production plants and various medical settings. These impacts include increased cost, lowered efficiency, increased corrosion, fouling and increased impurities and infections. Realistic models of biofilm growth and development will aid experimentalists in proposing new experimental inquiries. Also, because detailed spatial data can be generated from model simulations more readily than by experimentation, novel hypotheses of persistent formation and detachment can be proposed based on values of concentrations and internal stresses."

The general objective of this research is to develop quantitative biomechanical models for brain morphogenesis. The mathematical models will be based on fundamental mechanical principles and state-of-the-art experimental measurements of structure, microstructure, and mechanical properties, combined with precise, quantitative descriptions of growth and remodeling. In conjunction with experiments, these models will be used to test the hypothesis that spatial and temporal variations in mechanical stress, viscoelastic properties, and growth of the developing brain produce observed changes in shape. This project focuses on two specific periods of brain development where dramatic changes in form are apparent: (1) the early period of expansion and differentiation of the neural tube into the primary vesicles of the brain (forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain); and (2) the later period of folding of the cerebral cortex (gyrogenesis). Mathematical and computational modeling of the nonlinear, three-dimensional continuum mechanics of brain formation is a necessary complement to classical biological approaches to this basic problem in neurobiology. The results from this project will provide fundamental new insight into the biomechanical mechanisms of brain development.<br/><br/>In this project, mathematical models for growth and development of the brain will be built and tested. The brain's form is closely related to its function, but the mechanisms that drive the brain into its final shape are poorly understood. The project focuses on two stages that appear particularly important: (1) the stage of early development when three primary segments of the brain emerge; (2) the stage of later development when the outer surface of the brain folds into a convoluted pattern. Many educated guesses about the process of brain development have been proposed, but none have been supported by convincing evidence. Hypothesized mechanisms will be described in quantitative, precise, computer simulations, and the results will be assessed objectively. New experimental studies will provide physical parameters for these computer models. The objective is a coherent, physically plausible, understanding of the form-function relationship that drives brain development. This information is of fundamental importance to understanding the normal brain. In addition, many disabilities and diseases of the brain, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, and mental retardation are associated with abnormal brain shape. This project will address important gaps in the fundamental knowledge of brain development needed to address these problems."

There are about 1 million nephrons in the human kidney, and a significant fraction of these may be closely coupled through the microvasculature. Through computational and analytical methods, two major research questions will be addressed: how does coupling of a large number of nephrons affect the dynamics of the collective system, and how can uncertainty, in modeling paradigms and in the parameters inherent in modeling, be incorporated into computational simulations of renal blood flow. Coupling arises in vivo, and must be included in models. Uncertainty in model parameters is a recognized consequence of our limited knowledge of the systems under study; uncertainty regarding the limitations of the very models used in our studies may alter major findings identified in the analysis. Answering these two questions will provide important steps in linking simulations with experiment. <br/> <br/>Because of the nephron's role in filtering blood, it is frequently assumed, either explicitly or implicitly, that the behavior observed in a single nephron is representative of whole kidney function.  This assumption has proven valid and useful in many contexts.  However, the coupling of two individual nephrons is known to induce dynamics of the pair that is not present in the individual. Massive coupling of nephrons, as it is thought to occur in the kidney, will likely elicit collective behavior from the system that cannot be guessed beforehand. Likewise, idealized modeling and specification of model parameters may not accurately reflect the environment in which the nephron exists in vivo. This project brings new mathematical ideas to the study of renal blood flow regulation, a complex biological system that plays an important role in human health."

Mathematical models of coevolution with even modest amounts of biological reality usually defy transparent, general analyses of coevolution. This project will develop innovative mathematical tools for analyzing coevolution in complex communities, including both evolutionary and population dynamics. The two main analytic approaches will make use of different mathematical approximations available when the strength of selection is relatively weak or strong. The scope and accuracy of these new methods will be verified using computer simulations. The new mathematical tools will also be used to address two important questions in community coevolution. First, does the number of potential hosts influence transitions between generalist and specialist parasites? Second, does coevolution lead to different ecological network structure in mutualistic vs. antagonistic communities? In each case, theoretical predictions will be tested in the laboratories of empirical collaborators. Ongoing studies of host use in bacteriophage will evaluate predictions for specialist-generalist transitions in parasites; data from well-studied plant-insect interactions will test predictions for the coevolution of community network structure.<br/><br/>The proposed work will contribute to the continued integration of analytic methods into the biological sciences. Results will be widely disseminated through publication, scientific presentations, and software packages developed during the project. Training will introduce at least three post-doctoral researchers, four graduate students, and five undergraduates to cutting-edge analytical and computational techniques. The research collaboration also reinforces existing interactions between biology and mathematics departments in geographically proximate Washington State University and the University of Idaho. In addition, the project supports a unique international collaboration, and strengthens emerging regional ties between mathematical biologists at institutions in Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia.<br/>"

As a response to changes in blood pressure, this control system modulates cardiovascular parameters to maintain a constant cerebral blood flow. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound measurements are routinely used to measure blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral arteries, one of the largest suppliers of blood to the brain. These measurements are then used to estimate blood flow and assess efficacy of cerebral autoregulation. However, these measurements do not currently provide reliable indicators for early diagnosis of potential impairments in the cerebral arteries, as they lack the necessary accuracy. One problem from basing the estimates derived from measurements is the questionable assumption that regulation only influences the diameter of microvasculature, while the diameter of larger vessels, such as the middle cerebral artery, remains constant. It is now clear that the large arteries are compliant suggesting that the diameter of the middle cerebral artery can indeed change in response to variations in pulsatility. In addition, estimates derived from measurements do not account for topological variations in network of cerebral arteries, such as the main distribution system, the circle of Willis.  These questions will be studied using a new one-dimensional fluid dynamic model of the circle of Willis.  Geometric data for this model will be obtained from magnetic resonance angiographs. To solve these equations, new numerical methods will be used.  Viscoelastic equations describing the compliance of the vascular wall will be introduced and the effects of including non-Newtonian flow will be studied.  Additionally, the effects of curvature of the vessel topology will be estimated. In particular, the internal carotid artery, curves about 180 degrees from when it enters the scull to it is attached to the circle of Willis. To validate this model, computed results will be compared with measurements of cerebral blood flow and network topology. The model will be used to predict effects of changes in the topology as well as changes in outflow boundary conditions. For example,  plan to study the effects on distribution of blood flow in response to changes in boundary conditions and compare this with changes in diameters of the proximal vessels. Furthermore, we plan to study changes between healthy subjects and in elderly DM patients.

In response to changes in blood pressure, this control system modulates cardiovascular parameters to maintain a constant cerebral blood flow.

In seasonally breeding fishes, environmental signals (e.g., length of daylight) trigger brain production of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) that initiates a reproductive cascade leading to eggs in the female or sperm in the male.  GnRH signals the pituitary gland to produce two gonadotropins (GTHs), follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.  Carried by the blood these hormones bind to specific gonadal receptors, which stimulates the gonads to synthesize the sex steroid hormones (estrogens, progestins, and androgens).  The sex steroids act within the gonads for proper gametogenesis in each sex and provide feedback to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus to regulate GTH production and secretion.  Underlying this complex network are key genes involved in the endocrine signaling and in the downstream events triggered by this hormonal cascade.  To clarify relationships among this signaling system, gametogenesis, and associated gene activity, a hormone-signal-(GnRH, GTHs, sex steroids)-based, mathematical model will be developed in a salmonid fish, the female rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at 12oC.  Novel mathematical techniques will be developed to characterize the impact of the persistence of circadian rhythms on the stability and sensitivity properties of the photoperiod-adjusted model.  Gene array technology will enable the identification of activated and suppressed transport and signaling genes, whose qRT-PCR levels will be statistically associated with hormonal stimulation and response, and consequent ovarian development.  The signaling system will be modulated by photoperiod-controlled advancement of annual spawn timing, both to evaluate the capacity of the model to accommodate changes induced by photoperiod and to better understand the sensitivity of the spawning cycle to this environmental cue.  <br/>     <br/>Reproduction in the rainbow trout involves an annual cycle of egg development over several months in the female, followed by egg deposition and fertilization by sperm from the male.  The cycle is controlled by a complicated signaling system that includes stimuli such as length of daylight and water temperature.  These environmental cues operate through the brain to prompt the pituitary gland and the gonads to produce several hormones.  The annual reproductive cycle and associated hormone signals are understood qualitatively, but not at the gene level where the hormone signals activate hundreds of genes to produce proteins that carry out the production of eggs and sperm.  To better understand the reproductive cycle, the concentrations of the hormone signals and the activity of the genes that they turn on or off will be measured.  A mathematical model of the hormone signals and gene activity will be constructed.  Mathematical model development will provide insights into the complex reproductive hormone system of the rainbow trout, and the interplay of genes involved in this important signaling cascade.  The resulting novel mathematical model and gene activity analyses will be generally applicable to other species.  The model will aid exploration of environmental cues on reproduction in fishes.  The model will be particularly relevant to salmonid fishes, but will also provide a template for other fish species and egg laying vertebrates in general.  It will provide a framework for characterization of species differences in the reproductive endocrine system and associated gene activity.  Finally, the model will provide knowledge useful for guiding the management of wild and cultured populations of fish."

The so-called phyllotactic patterns of plants are particularly striking because the patterning process reaches beyond the simple steric interactions used to explain crystal symmetries.  The goal of this project is to characterize mathematically the universe of all possible phyllotactic configurations and to determine formally and empirically why some configurations are more common than others in plants.  To investigate the universe of all phyllotactic patterns it has been necessary to develop the concept of multilattices, a geometric framework that offers a much greater flexibility than the traditional concept of lattices.  Multilattices encompass all the regular phyllotactic configurations found in Nature (including whorls and lattices).  Another aspect of this project is to generate a comprehensive data-set of time-resolved phyllotactic configurations both during normal development and following perturbation so as to explore the set of stable configurations that are accessible to plants.  The extensive data set will serve to calibrate the dynamical systems.  The concept of multilattices is the first formalism that does not constrain observed patterns into rigid classes but in fact fully accounts for the variation found in plants and beyond.  One broad impact of this project will be to provide the scientific community with a large data-set of time-resolved phyllotactic configurations as well as tools to explore these data.  The project will also offer multidisciplinary training for female undergraduates from Smith College both in basic experimental techniques and mathematics. <br/><br/>Many structures found in the living world show patterns of great regularity.  It may not come as a great surprise that proteins can assemble to create patterns that emulate the beautiful symmetries of crystals.  However, when the same regularity is found at the level of an entire organism, one may justly be astonished.  Yet, this is a common occurrence in plants where the placement of leaves and flowers around the stem can give rise to exquisite patterns.  The common geometrical features found in plants and crystals are unlikely to be explained by their molecular constituents since these diverge widely.  Plants and crystals must share some general developmental rules leading to the similarities in pattern.  The goal of this project is to study these rules mathematically and empirically.  The types of patterns found in plants and other living structures are much richer than those of 2-D crystals, therefore their description has required a new mathematical framework called multilattices.   Another aspect of this project is to generate a comprehensive data set of the types of patterns observed in plants.  A formal understanding of multilattices may have many important applications.  For example, the packing of flowers and seeds often determines yield in plants while the positioning of leaves around the stem determines the efficiency of a plant at capturing light which, ultimately, influences overall plant growth.  Moreover, many human diseases such as Alzheimer involve the formation of protein crystals known as amyloids within cells. Understanding the rules under which proteins crystallize may help pinpoint the origin of these diseases.<br/>"

This new knowledge will not substantially impact society unless it is organized and interpreted correctly.  A crucial step in this process is the development of theories that explain why the data are what they are.  This is where the current proposal aims at making a contribution.<br/><br/>Many biological systems are extremely complex, especially those in molecular cell biology.  The inner workings of single cell hold many mysteries, even today.  Why does a cell become cancerous?  How and why does it move?  Why can cell A be infected by a virus, while cell B cannot?  The answer to these questions hinges upon the understanding of the dynamics of the chemical networks inside the cell.  We have all seen graphical representations of these networks consisting of thousands of nodes and arrows.  It is therefore not surprising that to go a step further by inquiring about the dynamics, and not just the structure of these systems, is a very challenging problem.<br/><br/>An idea that comes naturally is to break the networks into smaller parts, and study these in isolation.  Later we can then put the pieces back together to understand the overall system.  It often happens that the isolated subsystems have particular properties.  One such property is monotonicity, and this proposal explores the consequences for the full network whenever it consists of monotone subsystems.  The current state of the art in this area is geared towards showing global stability.  This proposal aims at broadening this spectrum by focusing on results that predict more complicated behavior such as bistability or the existence of periodic solutions.  A second component of this proposal is the design of feedback control laws for bioreactors containing several competing species.  An important application area of this research is the commercial production of growth factor.  In this case, the reactor contains species with DNA containing a plasmid that codes for the production of growth factor.  Upon cell division however, this plasmid can be lost, leading to a wildlife competitor that is not burdened by the production of growth factor, yet consumes nutrient for growth.  It is clear that controlling such reactors is an important economical problem.  The design of feedback control laws in this proposal could be helpful in this context."

The project consists of three parts. The first is to combine a model for the sliding filaments of a sperm flagellum with resistive-force theory in the Maxwell model for a linearly viscoelastic fluid, and then to determine the swimming speed.  This simple model will capture many of the features which will be present in more complicated but realistic models, and illuminate the fundamental principles of swimming in a viscoelastic fluid.  The aim of the second part is to derive the slender-body equations for the forces acting on thin rods in a viscoelastic medium, analogous to the slender-body equations familiar from Stokes flow.  Finally, the aim of the third part is to apply these models to the case of sperm swimming in mucus. For example, at a certain point during fertilization, sperm cells change their beat pattern to the asymmetric whip-like ""hyperactivated"" state. We will study how hyperactivity affects motility in the viscoelastic environments of the uterus and oviduct.<br/><br/>This project is motivated by the fact that many swimming microorganisms encounter biological fluids with solid-like (elastic) properties as well as liquid-like (viscous) properties.  Examples range from mammalian sperm in cervical fluid to the ulcer-causing bacterium Helicobacter pylori in the mucus layer lining the inside of the stomach. Despite the great importance of these examples for fertility and health, there have been few attempts to develop a quantitative theory for swimming in viscoelastic fluids; almost all previous efforts have focused on purely viscous fluids such as water. It is important to develop a theory for viscoelastic swimmers, since it will deepen our understanding of the physical constraints faced by mammalian sperm, leading to a better understanding of their biology and perhaps new clinical strategies for contraception or enhancing fertility for humans or livestock."

Defining new types of GRCs, studying the effect of STSP on these GRCs and exploring the connection between GRCs and feedback will be a major focus of the project.  Specific problems to be addressed include determining how phase relationships are maintained in central pattern generating networks, determining how networks combine synaptic and intrinsic resonance information to choose a preferred frequency of operation and understanding the origins of multi-stability in networks with cells that contain T-type calcium currents.  Many of these problems are being considered in parallel with an experimental group that works on the crab stomatogastric ganglion.<br/><br/>Short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) refers to the ability of a synapse to change its strength as a function of its usage.

By considering the effect of STSP on feedback networks, this project will enhance our understanding of how networks of the central nervous system organize their components to perform behavioral tasks such as chewing, swimming or breathing.

A common underlying assumption in theoretical studies of population dynamics is that dispersal rates are uniform across space.  However, such simplification can yield misleading results because the surrounding environment can vary both spatially and temporally.  Indeed, animals tend to sense and respond to local environmental cues by dispersing directionally, and their movements are often combinations of both random and directed ones.  Reaction-diffusion-advection equations serve as one of the major approaches to understanding spatial-temporal processes such as dispersal, and are used in this research to model both random and directed movements of species and population dynamics.  Three kinds of conditional dispersal strategies will be studied in this project.  The first one is the direct movement of populations along environmental gradients or along density-dependent growth rate gradients, and the goal is to determine the effects of such biased movement on both single population and multiple competing species.  The second dispersal strategy concerns area-restricted search of predators, and the purpose is to understand how biased foraging behaviors of predators can induce the aggregation of predators.  The third is a dynamical model for ideal free distribution theory, which assumes that species choose habitats in such a way that each individual tries to maximize its reproduction fitness.  The aim is to obtain a better understanding of interactions between such dispersal strategy and population dynamics. To address these biological questions, the principal investigator will use mathematical methods which include regularity theory for elliptic and parabolic operators, analysis of eigenvalue problems, maximum principles, bifurcation analysis, monotone system theory, permanence theory, and perturbation analysis.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to increase our understanding of how populations disperse in response to spatially varying environments, to determine which patterns of dispersal strategy can confer some selective or ecological advantage, and to provide insights on biodiversity issues such as habitat fragmentation and invasions of new species.  Preliminary investigations show that the geometry of habitat can play important roles in the evolution of dispersal, and also that strong directed movement of a species can induce coexistence with its competitors.  Materials from this project will be modified and used as team projects for a Mathematical Biosciences Institute Summer Program for college teachers and graduate students in mathematics and biology."
