Postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates will gain experience with mathematical modeling, numerical methods, and modern data analysis/statistical tools relevant to biological problems. Trainees will perform individual research in an interdisciplinary environment focusing on the mathematical modeling of current problems in experimental and computational biology. Each trainee will benefit from having two mentors, one from applied mathematics and one from a biological discipline. Trainees will gain knowledge and experience beyond that of their own research areas via regular group meetings organized around specific biological themes, and research internships outside Northwestern University will broaden trainee perspectives. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will gain pedagogical experience through creation of new course materials in collaboration with participating faculty. Trainees and undergraduates will also receive coaching in written and oral communication as part of the program. A major goal of this project is to expand the preparation of applied mathematics students and postdoctoral fellows for interdisciplinary research in the life sciences and for their subsequent careers. <br/><br/>Research performed as part of this project will focus on mathematical models in fields including neuroscience, developmental biology, evolutionary biology, and ecology. Models will encompass state-of-the art mathematical, computational, and statistical data-analysis methods appropriate for these application areas. New high-throughput experimental techniques have produced a wealth of data from biological systems in recent years, and major efforts are now underway to integrate these datasets to understand fundamental biological mechanisms and functionality. Within an interdisciplinary environment, trainees participating in this project will analyze imaging, sequencing and other data to address pressing biological questions. Co-mentorships and programmatic oversight of students by interdisciplinary faculty, creation of new courses, and development of a new vertical and peer teaching structure will greatly expand undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral training in applied mathematics in the high impact area of biological modeling. This will lead to a new generation of mathematicians, cross-trained and attuned to the particular needs of the field. The project will further connect faculty across Northwestern University and other research institutions, strengthening research progress in the focus areas."

This project develops mathematical tools for reconstructing the evolutionary history of large collections of organisms, and for constructing a single tree that encapsulates the conflicting stories told by different pieces of the genome.  Ten undergraduate students, many recruited from groups underrepresented in STEM fields at this primarily undergraduate institution, will be trained in techniques at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and biology that are required for the algorithmic developments. <br/><br/>Most methods of super-tree or species tree reconstruction rely on accurately reconstructed gene trees.  In practice, however, most inferred gene trees used in these reconstructions do contain errors. By identifying and explicitly accounting for gene tree estimation error, this project will improve algorithms for super-tree and species tree reconstruction. Alternative approaches for which species trees are reconstructed without dependence on the prior estimation of gene trees will also be developed."

In hemodynamics, FSI models have been used to describe the interaction between blood and arterial walls. More precisely, numerical algorithms for fluid-structure interaction problems can provide predictions in many cardiovascular diseases, such as aneurysms or atherosclerosis. Since combining state-of-the-art algorithms with non-invasive clinical measurement tools provides an innovative approach to medical diagnosis and surgical decision making, there is an increasing demand for fast and efficient numerical schemes to solve FSI problems. The PI will develop and analyze a class of stable and robust high-order partitioned numerical methods for FSI problems. The development of stable and efficient algorithms for fluid-structure problems is crucial for performing patient specific diagnostic tests, and this work will make a major contribution in biomedical research.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is a development and analysis of a class of higher-order partitioned numerical methods for interactions between an incompressible, viscous fluid and a thin, elastic structure. The discretization in space will be performed using the finite element method, and different partitioned methods will be proposed based on the time discretization. In particular, algorithms will be developed based on the kinematically coupled scheme (Project 1), the Strang operator splitting approach (Project 2) and the Crank-Nicolson and Leapfrog method (Project 3). Energy estimates and convergence rates will be derived for each proposed algorithm. A comparison of all the proposed methods based on their performance, stability and convergence properties will be made, allowing other researchers to identify optimal algorithms for specific choices of parameter values. The proposed algorithms, numerical analysis and simulation results will be published and made available to the community.

The brain is one of the most complex biological structures, and we are still far from understanding how it functions. Understanding the computations performed by the brain will require significant contributions from multiple disciplines. Mathematical techniques have served an integral role in advancing neuroscience research for many decades. The International Conference on Mathematical Neuroscience will provide a forum for researchers to discuss current mathematical innovations emerging in neuroscience. The lectures will discuss new tools and methods for analyzing complex data sets and building rigorous mathematical models of brain function. A major aim of the conference is to attract and train young researchers on current methods in mathematical neuroscience. To fulfill this goal, there will be a tutorial component held the day before the main meeting. For broader impact, a collection of tutorial chapters will be solicited from presenters and published as a  collection of lectures, and presentations will be made available on the conference website. The conference  is in line with the present national BRAIN initiative, aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying neural computation. The topics discussed during the tutorial sessions and main meeting are relevant to scientific disciplines beyond neuroscience: including systems biology, economics, and ecology.<br/><br/>The meeting provides an opportunity for mathematicians to gain exposure to current research in neuroscience and communicate with neuroscientists. At the same time, it enables experimental neuroscientists to discuss current progress on understanding the dynamics and function of neural systems with mathematicians who develop new tools and methods to address present challenges. The meeting will begin with a tutorial day (May 30) featuring topics from three major areas in mathematical neuroscience: stochastic and nonlinear dynamics, information theory, and probability and statistics.  The tutorials will introduce junior researchers to fundamental techniques used in contemporary mathematical neuroscience through lectures given by leaders in the field. The main conference (May 31 - June 2) will feature a broader set of topics in mathematical neuroscience, with a focus on the use of experimental data in modeling studies as well as using theory and models to explore hypotheses and design better experiments. A new challenge in modern neuroscience is to extract understandable patterns and features from high-dimensional data sets including neuronal activity, functional connectivity, and anatomy. To understand how the human brain functions and performs complex computations, improved methods for handling data are needed, together with rigorous mathematical models of neural systems. This conference will bring together leaders in applied mathematics and neuroscience that are developing new mathematical techniques for understanding high-dimensional data sets, building models to capture activity patterns and emergent computation, and working closely with experimentalists to address more targeted questions about brain function. Synergistic interactions between these topics will also be identified, to understand the full complexity of the nervous system.

This ranges from the development of new models and theories that provide insights into biological processes, to the development of new analytic tools and software that are useful in experimental design and in the analysis of experimental data. In cell biology, lipid bilayer membranes can be thought of as effectively two-dimensional materials comprising of a heterogeneous mixture of lipids, proteins, and other small molecules. The individual and collective dynamics of these molecules are fine-tuned to carry out complex cellular processes ranging from signaling to synaptic transmission to the regulation of shapes of organelles. The effective two-dimensional fluid-elastic nature of cell membranes yields interfacial phenomena and complicated geometric shapes effecting both molecular interactions and dynamics that can be very distinct from their bulk three dimensional counterparts. To gain a deeper understanding of cellular processes in curved protein-lipid bilayers, there is a need for new approaches for incorporating the important roles played by geometry. This research develops new mathematical approaches and software for handling complicated geometries in investigations conducted through laboratory experiments and computational simulations of membrane-protein systems. The educational activities of the project will further enhance the training of both undergraduate and graduate students in new quantitative approaches to the biological sciences. <br/><br/>The research of this project will develop new mathematical approaches to capture diffusive transport of proteins within curved membranes arising from both active collective motions and passive thermal fluctuations, hydrodynamics and viscoelastic deformations of curved surfaces, and discrete heterogeneous interactions between inclusions incorporating stochastic kinetics. Mathematical approaches will be extended for both continuum mechanics and coarse-grained molecular descriptions so as to provide insights into the emergent mechanics and dynamics of inclusions within bilayer membranes. To perform computational simulations, a general class of numerical methods based on exterior calculus will be designed to address the challenges associated with solving differential equations on curved manifolds. The research of this project advances the next generation of theoretical models and analysis tools for investigating membrane-protein systems. Societal impacts of the work derive from fundamental contributions to the understanding of membrane-protein systems in cell biology, which may give insights into processes relevant to membrane-related technologies such as drug delivery through permeation or design of antimicrobials such as membrane disruptors."

Since the world is noisy and brain activity is highly variable, it is remarkable that organisms can perform cognitive tasks as accurately as they do. One feature of the human brain that may account for its exceptional computational ability is its modular structure. The entire network of the brain is organized into a collection of densely connected subnetworks, helping to localize certain neural computations. Studying the effects of this underlying structure could ultimately help in the analysis of increasingly large data sets collected by experimental neuroscientists. This project will consider the impact of modular structures in the brain, focusing on networks known to perform specific cognitive tasks like categorization, short-term memory, and spatial navigation. These computations are performed by networks that can represent spatial position, and the associated mathematical models often describe variables that change in space and time. This project will facilitate the development of new methods for studying how noise impacts the dynamics of neuronal networks with multiple temporal and spatial scales, specifically in networks with a multi-layered structure. This project will contribute to the national BRAIN initiative by identifying new computational tools for understanding the role of the brain's network architecture in cognition. Furthermore, trainees supported by this award will learn cutting-edge methods in statistics, nonlinear dynamics, and stochastic processes. These methods are broadly applicable to many fields in science that utilize large-scale data such as genetics, social science, and climatology.<br/><br/>This research project addresses the problem of understanding how the multi-layered structure of many areas of the brain shape neural computation. This problem will be addressed in three main ways: (i) building multi-layer network models of observed brain circuits that process spatial information; (ii) developing mathematical tools for studying these equations to extract information about their dynamics; and (iii) corroborating this work with experimental collaborators that record and image propagating activity in brain tissue. The cognitive tasks of spatial navigation, spatial working memory, and visual input categorization will be studied. Spatial navigation requires the integration of both angular and linear self-motion cues, and models developed in the project will explore different ways multi-layered network architecture can dampen variability in position codes. The investigation of how multi-layered architectures with different scales of spatial heterogeneity can robustly represent spatial position will improve our insights into the function of spatial working memory. Experimental recordings from visual brain areas have found that interfaces between network layers modify the propagation of stimulus-related activity. The impact of this phenomenon on stimulus processing will be explored in detail using mathematical models of sensory brain activity. All these projects require the development of new tools for determining how noise influences multi-scale systems, metastability, and spatiotemporal patterns, of broad applicability to other scientific fields including epidemiology, systems biology, and ecology."

The development of ecotoxicological models have contributed significantly to our understanding of how contaminants impact organisms and cycle through aquatic food webs. However current models do not incorporate dynamical interactive effects of contaminant stressors and elemental constraints, such as nutrient/light availability and food quality.  Investigators will design and conduct laboratory experiments in conjunction with mathematical models that account for both nutritional value of diet and toxicant load.  The results will generate knowledge and enhance understandings of the environment and global change.  The project will shed light on nutrient and chemical contaminant cycling and ultimately improve toxicological risk assessment protocols, which will be beneficial to environmental managers and policy decision makers.  User-friendly versions of the models will be disseminated on the project's webpage.  Graduate students will receive interdisciplinary training in the fields of mathematics and ecotoxicology to gain a broad understanding of scientific problems, necessary to communicate effectively across disciplines.  Investigators and graduate students will be involved in K-12 outreach initiatives organized by the STEM Center for Outreach, Research, and Education at Texas Tech University.<br/><br/>The theory of ecological stoichiometry emphasizes the balance of multiple chemical elements and the relative abundance of essential elements in organisms that shape ecological dynamics.  Investigators will develop and analyze a series of empirically testable and robust mathematical models of population dynamics structured under the framework of ecological stoichiometry.  In parallel to model development, investigators will integrate data from the literature and from new experiments designed in this research, in order to parameterize, test, and improve the models. Dynamical systems theory and tools will be used to interpret and analyze the models including analytical, computational and numerical, as well as bifurcation analysis.  The synthesis of the models and experiments will result in the development of a robust theoretical framework appropriate for improved risk assessment applications in ecotoxicology that incorporate the effects of stoichiometric constraints on concurrent ecological and toxicological processes."

Cells need to be sensitive to environmental signals, while being robust to unwanted cell-to-cell and environmental variability.  This research will characterize the chemical reaction networks that are absolutely robust with respect to some proteins in the system (background noise and variability) but not to others (molecular signals).  While there are many mechanisms for implementing robustness, the proposed framework relies on intrinsic structural properties of the network. Key downstream proteins are activated and deactivated, so that at steady state the active form has exactly the same concentration in all cells, while inactive forms act as buffers to absorb excess protein.  The goals include: (1) generalizing existing results on absolute robustness to allow for robustness with respect to some proteins but not others, and applying these results to bacterial two-component models; (2) determining the viability of ultrasensitivity, specificity and other signal processing mechanisms in absolutely robust networks; (3) calculating the mean and variance of stochastic absolutely robust systems, and implementing the results to better understand systems of cellular differentiation.<br/><br/>Modern techniques to make measurements inside individual cells are increasingly demonstrating that protein concentrations routinely vary several fold from one cell to the next in cellular tissues.  An important question is to understand how cells handle such variability and perform in a consistent manner.  This question is relevant for many medical issues including abnormal cellular signaling and development.  It could also underlie problems of inconsistent cellular responses to drugs such as chemotherapies.  This grant will develop mathematical methods that are grounded in experimental data, which can help discover new molecular design principles for robustness to total protein concentrations."

Images of three dimensional, volumetric, structures provide indispensable spatial information about organs, tissues, and molecules that cannot be captured using two dimensions. The development of tools for efficient and effective analysis of such volumetric data sets is, therefore, urgently required. This project will develop generally applicable mathematical and computational frameworks to effectively and accurately represent, compare, and retrieve biological and medical data in three dimensions. The methods to be developed will provide a general foundation for the analysis of volumetric images obtained using multiple imaging modalities and for multiple data types, not only from the biological domain. For example, the techniques have broader impact in areas such as human face recognition, analysis of geographical and climate data, and computer-aided design. This project, therefore, contributes to general promotion of the progress of science and technology in many domains in which imaging analysis is crucial and is of significant societal impact. <br/><br/>In this project, two complementary and synergistic methods will be developed and integrated. The first method to be developed is a mathematical moment-based approach that provides a compact representation of volumetric data and is very suitable for localized three dimensional image data comparison. A two dimensional image comparison method that is based on a moment-based invariant will be expanded to handle volumetric data. The second method is a machine learning approach that will be powerful in classifying volumetric data. These two approaches will be integrated to take advantage of both methods and validated using three dimensional protein structural data. Analyzing global and local similarities between protein shapes is critical for understanding protein function but challenging because proteins with substantially different shapes may perform the same function. Further, proteins are appropriate for this validation step not only because many structures are available in well-established public databases but also because they lack intrinsic orientation, unlike previously studied datasets of man-made objects such as cars, cups, and tables. As the proposed methods are defined for a general voxel representation of a given volume, they will be generally applicable for any data set yielding a voxel representation, including biomedical data collected using electron microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Along side the scientific impact of the project, it also leverages efforts in the interdisciplinary computational life sciences and engineering departments at Purdue University and Eastern Kentucky University by recruiting and training students through interdisciplinary coursework and direct involvement with the project."

Although it is a complex disease with many interacting factors, there is agreement that a major component is dysfunction of the pancreatic beta cells that release the hormone insulin. In normal individuals, these cells release insulin in pulses, with the pulse amplitude reflecting the glucose level. There is now conclusive evidence that pulsatile insulin is more effective than constant insulin at stimulating glucose-lowering actions of the liver. In addition, it has been shown that type II diabetics, and their nearest relatives, show disorganized insulin levels, rather than the more regular insulin pulses of non-diabetics. This project seeks to better understand the intracellular pathways that result in pulsatile insulin secretion from beta cells. It also seeks to understand how mice, which also exhibit pulsatile insulin secretion, compensate for genetic knockouts of key proteins in such a way that rhythmic cellular activity and insulin secretion is maintained. Overall, the project will yield insights into the complex biology of pulsatile insulin secretion, and will push forward mathematical analysis techniques that are useful in complex intracellular signaling systems such as those in pancreatic beta cells. Graduate students involved in this research project will receive broad interdisciplinary training in answering mathematical questions driven by experimental data. Publicly available software will also be produced. <br/><br/>The Dual Oscillator Model has been under continuous development by Bertram and associates since it was first published in 2004. This model describes how three signaling pathways, metabolism, intracellular calcium dynamics, and electrical activity combine to produce pulsatile insulin secretion that is modulated by the extracellular glucose level. The complexity of the model makes it difficult to understand the dynamics of the system, but application of the fast/slow analysis technique allows one to take advantage of the separation of time scales of the model variables and formally decompose the system into subsystems that vary at different rates. This powerful multi-scale analysis technique will be applied to improve our understanding of oscillations in activity of the model beta cell that are induced by glucose and other substrates, as well as oscillations that are present in cells from mice in which different key proteins are genetically knocked out. Because there are several slowly changing variables, there are a number of different ways in which the fast/slow analysis technique can be used. These different approaches are explored, and will yield complementary insights. While the focus of the project is on oscillations in beta cell activity, the analysis approach used is applicable to a wide range of dynamic models, so the mathematical developments made in this project can be adapted to other complex biological systems."

The main focus is on quantitative traits (characteristics like body size affected by many genes), which have been studied less in this context than traits determined by a single gene.  A combination of rigorous pencil-and-paper analysis and computer simulation is used to provide insight into how evolution affects the speed, success and ultimate extent of biological invasions.  The results can inform thinking on environmental management issues, such as deciding how to allocate conservation measures among marginal or central populations.  By elucidating general principles that can guide the construction and interpretation of more specific models for management of natural populations, this research helps to address the economically important environmental challenges of management of invasive species and response to climate change.<br/><br/>Mathematically, this project will result in the development of new methods for proving existence and stability of localized solutions (representing populations whose territory is not expanding) and traveling waves (representing invasive species), for a class of differential equations and similar systems that do not admit analysis via commonly employed methods.  Specifically, this analysis will result in the development of new methods for proving existence and stability of localized solutions and traveling waves, for a class of biologically meaningful systems that do not admit analysis via phase plane or comparison principle methods.  Since those techniques cannot readily be extended to many systems or equations, progress in devising alternative approaches will help to fill a significant gap.  Biologically, the resulting analysis of general range dynamics models involving quantitative traits will contribute to understanding of the interplay between gene flow and numerous other demographic, genetic and environmental factors that help shape a population's distribution in space and time.  It will highlight factors, such as long-distance dispersal and habitat patchiness, that are not yet integrated into the relevant theory.  This work will help show how incorporating adaptive genetic change into invasion models alters the predictions of such models."

Misalignment of the circadian clock with respect to 24-hour environmental cycles occurs after rapid travel across time zones and leads to symptoms of jet lag including sleep disturbances, digestive problems, and decreased cognitive performance. The circadian clock is highly conserved across animal species, and there are many similarities in the genes and neural circuits involved in the circadian systems of humans and the fruit fly Drosophila. The goal of this project is to obtain a mathematical understanding of the biology underlying jet lag by developing a detailed model of the circadian clock in Drosophila and then systematically analyzing how the clock is disrupted by sudden changes in the timing of the external light-dark cycle. The predictions of the computational model will then be tested in flies through experiments that simulate transmeridian travel. This project will also create new tools for building mathematical models directly from observed data by bringing together techniques from applied mathematics, statistics, and neuroscience. A unique graduate-level course at the intersection of these fields will be developed. Graduate, undergraduate, and community college students will be involved in this research and obtain interdisciplinary training. The undergraduate and community college students will form integrated summer research project teams. Community college students will be recruited to enroll in an undergraduate-level mathematical modeling course at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and will receive mentorship on pursuing four-year STEM degree program opportunities.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the interface between dynamical systems and statistical data analysis in the context of neuronal modeling. The research goal of this project is to develop novel data assimilation methodologies for inferring models of neuronal dynamics directly from time-course data that enable insights into biological mechanisms. Specifically, this project will create new data assimilation tools to identify and parameterize neurophysiological models from voltage traces recorded from the Drosophila circadian (~24-hour) clock network. This research effort will address two major gaps in the mathematical/computational neuroscience field: a scarcity of methods for inferring parameters of unobserved ionic currents from measurements of membrane voltage alone, and a lack of models that link molecular, cellular, and behavioral scales. This will be accomplished by developing a method to design stimulus protocols for use in data assimilation algorithms that optimally unmask the dynamics of unobservable neuronal variables and improve inference of electrophysiological models and parameters. The method will be used to build a model of the Drosophila clock network that links circadian rhythms in gene expression to changes in neuronal activity and behavioral outputs. These models will be used to analyze how the internal circadian oscillator re-entrains following phase shifts in the external light-dark cycle. More generally, this work aims to elucidate fundamental aspects of synchronization and entrainment in oscillatory systems."

Cells actively transport cargo in membrane enclosed sacs between different regions of the cell and to the cellular periphery and back. This is accomplished in large part by teams of molecular motors that can attach to the cargo and use chemical energy to power mechanical motion along a road network that is an assembly of protein filaments called the cytoskeleton. Remarkably, while intracellular transport is typically robust, it occurs in an extremely hostile environment where cargo undergo constant collisions from surrounding molecules and the cytoskeletal networks continually change in time. This project will produce a comprehensive mathematical model of intracellular transport that integrates features at the level of single molecular motors, teams of motors and also at the level of the cytoskeleton which spans the cell.  This model will provide understanding of how cells maintain robust transport in highly noisy environments and will also help ascertain how the parameters governing transport can be tuned for minimizing variability and promoting efficient transport. Since intracellular transport is essential for cellular function and its breakdown can lead to multiple neurodegenerative and cardiac diseases, results from this project can potentially  inform the optimal design of drug and gene delivery systems as well as therapeutic interventions to repair transport. This project will also produce new teaching and training materials and aid in their dissemination to the local community colleges in the historically underserved and economically disadvantaged California Central Valley region. This project is also aimed at providing training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, including women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>At the cellular scale, motion is governed by molecular-level events and is inherently stochastic. In addition, the environment in which the transport takes place is typically structurally complex as well as dynamic, either due to thermal noise or via regulation by the cell itself. Intracellular transport of cargo between different cell organelles and to the surface and back, occurs by a combination of diffusion and active motor-driven transport along the cytoskeleton which is a hierarchically assembled, oriented, interconnected network of multiple filament types that are inherently dynamic. While there has been considerable work addressing the mechanistic details of molecular motors, much less is known about actual transport properties in naturally occurring complex and dynamic settings.  Current approaches to transport at a large scale usually sweep molecular details into effective parameters though it is becoming clear that collective transport can sensitively depend on these details. Furthermore, in virtually all cases, the explicit structure and dynamics of the cytoskeletal network is ignored. This project takes a multi-scale approach that incorporates the various microscopic processes at the level of a single motor, the mesoscopic properties of collections of motors and the macroscopic features of the cytoskeletal network which all conspire to give rise to robust transport.  This work will provide fundamental insight into the role of microscopic stochastic motion and environmental dynamics on experimental observations of in vivo transport. The project results will also help  with  ascertaining what regions of parameter/design space are best for minimizing variability and promoting efficient transport. This project's results are therefore likely to have a significant impact on the optimal design and control of transport processes for general application in therapeutics and biotechnology."

Neuronal networks consist of a wide array of cells types, each having a distinct morphology and functionality.  Neurons communicate among them through complex voltage signaling mechanisms called spikes, which may or may not exhibit regular behavior along time.  Yet, from chaos rises structure: neuronal networks are able to exhibit periodic oscillations emerging from their collective spiking activity, and disruption of this activity may result in diseases of the nervous system.  Prominent among these oscillations is the theta band (4-10 Hz) rhythm, which is believed to form a temporal framework for information processing and transmission.  How these oscillations emerge is still an open question.  Studies in reduced preparations show that the so-called principal cells exhibit a preference for theta-frequency subthreshold oscillatory activity (resonance) when they are forced with periodic inputs.  This might suggest that the network theta oscillations are ""inherited"" from this resonance.  However, we have recently found that in behaving animals, the resonance observed at the network level requires the interaction between single-neuron and circuit properties in ways that are more complex than previously thought.  In this project, the investigators will study the mechanisms underlying network resonance using a two-pronged approach: The US team will carry out detailed computational modeling, and the Israel team will perform experiments with behaving mice.  This research is expected to generate a framework for describing and understanding network resonance and to lay mechanistic foundations for understanding brain oscillations in general.  Therefore, the results of this work are expected to have implications for cognitive and motor function in both health and disease.<br/> <br/>The central hypothesis of this project is that the resonant behavior of spiking neurons in the theta frequency band (4-10 Hz) can be generated locally in various areas of the brain, and crucially depends on the interplay of the intrinsic properties of the participating neurons and the network connectivity.  The investigators will test this hypothesis in hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3 and in the neocortex, regions in which the theta rhythm is prominent.  While resonance in single neurons has been studied for almost three decades, the effect of the subthreshold oscillatory properties of neurons on shaping the dynamics of oscillatory networks has only recently become the focus of increasing experimental and theoretical attention.  One reason for the sub vs. suprathreshold gap in our understanding is the lack of a theoretical framework that could provide the basis for a systematic study, is described in terms of the biophysics of neuronal systems, and is grounded in experimental results.  This research is aimed at filling this void.  By combining biophysically constrained computational modeling and in vivo experiments using multi-site/multi-color optogenetic manipulations, the investigators will construct the various plausible scenarios linking the intrinsic oscillatory properties of neurons to circuits and test them experimentally.  In this way, causal relations will be established by interrogating these neuronal circuits both theoretically and in practice.  This will contribute to the understanding of the neuronal circuits that underlie the generation of rhythmic oscillations in the hippocampus and the neocortex, which have implications for cognition and motor behavior.  In addition, this research will contribute to the development of a theory of resonance and to the understanding of the interplay of oscillatory networks.  Furthermore, the innovative tools that will be used in this project will pave the way for the development of hybrid computational-in vivo experimental tools reminiscent of the use of the dynamic clamp in vitro.

Where vegetation-environment feedbacks are significant (e.g., in savannas), predicting responses to climate can be especially difficult.  Recent work suggests that feedbacks with fire may make savannas much more common than they would be were their distributions solely determined by climate; as a result, savanna and forest responses to global change may thus be drastic, sudden, and difficult to foresee.  However, existing work does not explain why savanna is spatially aggregated with savanna and forest with forest -- a pattern that indicates that spatial processes may also play a role in determining ecosystem responses to climate.  Here the investigators will consider the impacts of those spatial interactions between savanna and forest on their distributions and on their potential responses to climate and land-use change, both in the past and into the future.<br/><br/>The investigators have identified three hypotheses to explain the spatial aggregation of savanna and forest: H1) that savanna and forest are bistable, and that spatial structure in initial conditions (as a result of past climate) determines their distributions, H2) that savanna and forest are bistable, but that spatial processes within savanna (e.g., fire spread) result in spatially structured distributions, and/or H3) that nearest neighbor interactions between savanna and forest change their distributions on long time scales, impacting their long-term stability.  These hypotheses are variously supported in the empirical literature, and existing work has not attempted to disentangle these processes.  Results will allow the research team to generate informed theoretical and empirical predictions about the past and future distribution of savanna and forest globally.  The proposed work will also generate novel mathematical results. Possible outcomes of theoretical, spatial-stochastic models include a) savanna and forest coexistence in landscapes, b) forest exclusion by savanna, c) savanna exclusion by forest, or d) alternative stable states in biome savanna/forest dominance.  The last outcome would be unlikely in a homogeneous spatial stochastic model, where the winning biome is decided by the direction of movement of the biome boundary (i.e., the front), but most closely resembles real biome distributions. Spatial stochastic model results will be reconciled with observations using theoretical and simulation modeling."

Through coordinated beating, cilia in the lung and respiratory tract help to clear the airway of potentially harmful particles and mucus. Impaired cilia motion can result in serious respiratory infection. This impairment can be caused by an altered fluid environment, a characteristic of cystic fibrosis, by defects in the cilia themselves as with primary ciliary dyskinesia, or by other respiratory diseases. Similarly, a sperm is only able to reach and fertilize an egg if its flagellum can propel it forward; impaired motility results in infertility. Cilia and sperm beating is highly dependent on the fluid environment, which contains fibrous, protein networks as well as chemical signals. Understanding this relationship between elastic structure and heterogeneous fluid is vital for development of delivery strategies for inhaled drugs and medicines, new contraceptives, and aiding in infertility due to reduced sperm motility.  This project will focus on the development of new computational models and numerical methods that account for these fibrous, protein networks within the fluid to infer in vivo behavior of cilia and sperm.<br/><br/>Recent experiments have shown that i) sperm-flagella waveforms are altered when immersed in fluids containing networks of large proteins and also with flagellar calcium concentration, ii) the previously-considered `watery' fluid surrounding airway cilia actually contains a network of large proteins, or, 'brush'. This project will focus on identifying emergent waveforms of sperm flagella and airway cilia when nonplanar bending and internal flagellar biochemistry are taken into account. Cilia and flagella will be modeled as slender, elastic, structures immersed in a fluid governed by the Brinkman equation. A regularized framework and fundamental solutions will be used to derive new numerical methods for various confined geometries. The new numerical methods will be computationally-efficient and developed for use on high-performance computing systems. This research will identify factors that modulate sperm progression towards the egg, explore various waveforms of cilia and sperm, and investigate how a 'brush' in the fluid surrounding cilia might affect transport of particles within that fluid."

This is a rare but rapidly progressing cardiovascular disease with a high mortality rate.  Pulmonary hypertension involves both elevated blood pressure and changes in vessel wall stiffness, and thickness within the pulmonary circulation. These issues worsen with the severity of the disease. Diagnostic disease categories are associated with different parts of the pulmonary circulation network, yet pinpointing locations where the disease initiates is challenging. Models will be developed in conjunction with the use of experimental data provided by collaborators. This data will be obtained from non-invasive imaging of vascular blood flow and vessel network structure, and from invasive measurements of blood pressure in pulmonary vessels in mice and humans obtained via catheterization.  Effects of the heart chambers, large vessels, small vessel networks and their interactions will be captured based on modeling and methodological approaches from fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, network analysis, inverse problems and parameter estimation. The proposed pulmonary cardiovascular model has potential to be incorporated into diagnostic protocols predicting pressure using non-invasive measurements to reduce the number of the invasive follow-up procedures, and to serve as a vital component for identifying signatures associated with disease diagnostic categories and the degree of disease progression.  The overall project also provides a variety of opportunities for integrated training of a postdoc, and graduate and undergraduate students, in data-driven biomedical research.<br/><br/>System-level, one-dimensional mathematical and computational fluid dynamics models of the pulmonary circulation will be developed. These models will include the right ventricle, left atrium, the large and small pulmonary arteries and veins, and account for alterations in the system components due to pulmonary hypertension. A physiologically based arterial and venous wall model that accounts for collagen and elastin content and that can also capture remodeling of wall constituents in response to pulmonary hypertension will be designed. This model will be rooted in nonlinear elasticity theory and will yield a more robust pressure-area relation that can be integrated within the  fluid dynamics model, and linearized to facilitate the transition from large to small vessels.  A second physiologically based right ventricle model combining ideas from simple elastance functions and single-fiber models will also be provided. This model will enable  prediction of elastance as a function of right ventricle thickness. The analysis will focus on the pulmonary circulation, but impacts on modeling systemic circulation in a comprehensive closed loop model will also be considered. The models developed in these two aims will be used to simulate and identify flow and pressure waveforms that predict features associated with disease progression and, via sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation, to render the model patient-specific.  With these innovations it will be possible to use the one dimensional system level model combined with pulmonary arterial blood pressure from non-invasive measurements of flow to assess disease progression associated with pulmonary hypertension while also reducing the number of invasive measurements."

A recent study reveals that nutrient supply dramatically changed the prevalence and interaction strength between two plant viruses, barley yellow dwarf virus and cereal yellow dwarf virus. Since viruses hijack host cell machinery to replicate which requires nitrogen and phosphorus to synthesis nucleic acids and proteins, given more amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus, one would expect to see higher numbers of virus replication.  By studying and understanding the complex relationship between key nutrients and disease dynamics, we may help in planning and advising the future of agricultural practice.  This project will also provide opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students in research and instructional environments; interdisciplinary training and professional development for graduate students; and broad dissemination of our results to a diverse range of mathematicians, modelers, ecologists and biomedical researchers.  Our efforts will provide undergraduate and graduate students of diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds with first-hand educational experience in cross-disciplinary communication and exploration.  <br/><br/>All cells are made of chemical elements. Ecological stoichiometry (ES), is the study of the balance of chemical elements in ecological interactions.  ES and the theory of evolution have been found to be crucial lenses through which one can view and understand the dynamics of populations and communities of microorganisms.  ES covers multiple biological scales, and it allows the construction of robust, mechanistic, and predictive mathematical models based on cell nutrient levels.  Within this theory, the utilization of energy and multiple chemical elements (especially carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) between organisms and their environment occupies a central position.  However, the ES framework has yet to be effectively integrated into the modeling of host-pathogen interactions.  This project seeks to identify the relationships of some key biological mechanisms to the rich dynamics often observed in simulating host (plant)-pathogen models incorporating nutrient quality and quantity in host and pathogen populations.  These relationships may provide novel insights for better plant disease control. Specifically, we will construct mathematical models of host-pathogen interactions that are based on empirical discoveries.  The models that the research team will investigate are novel both mathematically and computationally, as they will motivate challenging problems in areas of qualitative and computational studies of nonlinear differential equations and delay differential equations."

This is the first region of the cerebral cortex (the convoluted part of the brain responsible for higher cognitive function in primates) to receive and process visual information from the eyes. It can be viewed as a two-dimensional sheet of millions of brain cells (neurons) communicating with each other via electrical signals. The electrical activity patterns of these neurons encode information about a visual image, which is then processed by other regions of the brain, resulting in the visual perception of a dynamically changing three-dimensional world. Visual information is often represented by spatially structured or coherent activity patterns. Understanding the mechanisms that underpin the origin and maintenance of these dynamical patterns is not only important for understanding the normal functioning of the visual brain, but also the occurrence of pathological states during epileptic seizures and migraines. One of the major challenges in neuroscience is determining how the wiring of the visual brain contributes to the generation of cortical activity patterns. The investigator has developed mathematical models of the primary visual cortex based on models that describe the generation and spread of electrical activity across the two-dimensional cortical sheet. Recent experimental studies indicate, however, that the laminar or layered structure of the primary visual cortex plays a crucial role in the production of these activity patterns. This research project, which is part of a larger collaborative program with the Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah, aims to extend previous mathematical models in order to take into account the laminar structure and determine how it affects a range of spontaneous visual phenomena. The main focus of the collaboration is to use a combination of neurophysiology, anatomy, and computational modeling to understand the functional architecture of the primary visual cortex and its role in visual processing. The Moran group is currently developing the use of light to control genetically modified cells and virus labeling techniques in order to understand the fine-structure of the visual cortex, which will be used to refine the mathematical models. The underlying idea linking the two projects is that the neural circuits used in the mathematical models to understand spontaneous activity are the same as those used to explain observations of the normal response of the cortex to visual stimulations. This project promotes scientific progress in the interdisciplinary field of mathematical neuroscience and vision and contributes to the interdisciplinary training of graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The modeling of the primary visual cortex involves the construction and analysis of continuum neural field models, in which the large-scale dynamics of spatially structured networks of neurons is described in terms of nonlinear, integro-differential equations. A major advantage of working with neural fields is that powerful methods from the mathematical theory of nonlinear partial differential equations can be adapted to analyze such models. Almost all previous studies of neural fields have ignored the fact that the cerebral cortex has a laminar structure, with neurons in distinct layers often having distinct stimulus response properties and participating in distinct circuits. There is also extensive coupling between layers via so-called vertical connections. In this project the laminar neural field models will be used study two important examples of spontaneous visual phenomena, namely, binocular rivalry waves and visual hallucinations. One possible mechanism for the latter is based on the idea that some chemical or physical disturbance can destabilize the visual part of the brain, inducing a spontaneous pattern of cortical activity. The geometry of the resulting hallucination thus reflects the intrinsic architecture and symmetry of the visual cortex. Analyzing such patterns can provide further insight in how the brain processes images in normal vision. Binocular rivalry is the phenomenon where perception switches back and forth between different images presented to the two eyes. The resulting fluctuations in perceptual dominance and suppression provide a basis for non-invasive studies of the human visual system and the identification of possible neural mechanisms underlying conscious visual awareness."

Drug-addicted HIV patients often suffer from enhanced HIV-associated pathogenic consequences, such as reduced host defenses against infection and development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND).  Despite being a critical problem for both science and society, the HIV infection dynamics in the context of drug abuse currently remains one of the least understood areas of HIV biology.  In the absence of such knowledge, the ability to devise effective strategies to properly manage the virus infection under drug-abuse conditioning remains one of the biggest challenging efforts.  In this project, mathematical and computational models are developed to study HIV dynamics in the circulation and in the brain under drug-abuse conditioning, such as the presence of morphine within the host.  Further complex models are developed to study the effects of pharmacodynamic properties of morphine on HIV infection in the circulation and in the brain.  The developed models are also used for formulating optimal control problems in order to identify ideal antiretroviral treatment as pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-infected drug abusers.  In addition to improving our current knowledge of HIV dynamics, pathogenesis and development of HAND under conditioning of drugs of abuse, this research endures a significant positive and practical impact on developing therapies and vaccines to control the burden of HIV among drug abusers.   <br/><br/>This project produces autonomous models of the HIV dynamics under conditioning of drugs of abuse in the circulation and in the brain, as well as nonautonomous models incorporating the effects of pharmacodynamic properties of drugs of abuse on HIV infection dynamics.  The models are parameterized using experimental data from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections of morphine-addicted macaques (animal model of HIV).  The developed models are extensively analyzed using the tools of mathematical modeling, dynamical systems theory, bifurcation theory, asymptotic analysis, theory of periodic systems, stability and persistence theory, as well as statistical and numerical methods. Mathematical challenges anticipated in this research offer opportunities to develop new mathematical theories that advance the field of applied differential equations and optimal control theory.  Results, including optimal antiretroviral therapy treatment protocols, help healthcare professionals to mitigate burdens from HIV infection and HAND in drug abusers, thereby, providing the quality of life to drug-addicted HIV infected patients and their families.  In addition, this project provides extensive interdisciplinary collaborative research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from mathematics and biology departments, as well as the School of Pharmacy at University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC).

The workshop will bring together a diverse group of experts in complementary areas of complex systems and will be preceded by a series of weekly webinars. The overarching goal of the activity is to address scientific issues that are relevant to the scientific community and bring to surface possible areas of opportunity for multidisciplinary research in the study of complex systems. The specific goals of the workshop include: 1) identifying the most substantive research questions that can be addressed by fundamental complex systems research; 2) recognizing community needs, knowledge gaps, and barriers to research progress in this area; 3) identifying future directions that cut across disciplinary boundaries and that are likely to lead to transformative multidisciplinary research in complex systems. The outcomes of the workshop will include the preparation of a report to inform the scientific community at large of the current status and challenges as well as future opportunities in multidisciplinary complex systems research as perceived by the participants of the workshop.<br/><br/>The workshop is motivated by the observation that many processes in natural, engineered, and social contexts exhibit emergent collective behavior and are thus governed by complex systems. Because challenges in understanding, predicting, designing, and controlling complex systems are often common to many domains, a central objective of the workshop is to facilitate the exchange of ideas across different fields and avoid disciplinary boundaries typical of many traditional scientific meetings. The workshop participants will include experts both in theory and in applications as well as a selection of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students from various domains. Because of the cross-disciplinary nature of the workshop, the participants themselves will become aware of the latest developments in fields related to but different from their own. This environment will foster discussions on the state of the art, potential issues, and most promising directions in multidisciplinary complex systems research. The inclusion of early-career researchers will help to promote the transfer of this expertise to the next generation of engineers, mathematicians, and scientists."

Dramatic improvements in the acquisition, resolution, and extent of two relevant types of data have recently occurred: remotely sensed environmental data and high-resolution animal location (telemetry) data.  These data drive a statistical industry serving wildlife management agencies, private companies, and academia. Improvements in tracking technology are likely to cause a revolution in movement ecology analogous to the impact of gene sequencing on molecular genetics.  This project synthesizes theoretical advances (statistical techniques for estimating movement probability between sites and how environmental resources are selected), existing results (mathematical techniques for rapidly predicting the envelope of future animal positions using mechanistic assumptions) and untapped data (remotely sensed habitat maps and high resolution individual telemetry) to rigorously characterize how landscape features condition population movement and habitat choice.  The research will encompass case studies investigating the movement of mule deer and elk in Utah, harbor seals off southeastern Alaska, and Canada lynx, which have recently been reintroduced in Colorado and are dispersing throughout the Rocky Mountains.   Research students will be cross-trained in mathematics, statistics, and movement ecology; undergraduates will be included in the research process by developing individual-based models to test estimation technologies.  A teaching lab in mathematical biology, illustrating movement models using real biological systems, will also be developed and distributed.<br/><br/>Statistical point process models provide well-understood statistical approaches for obtaining inference from individual-based telemetry data, with resource selection functions describing individual habitat preferences and availability functions describing dispersal probability between locations. However, point process models require numerical quadrature for proper normalization, making them slow for large data sets.  Classical availability functions are not constructed to handle major issues like movement constraints, autocorrelation, and landscape resistance, affecting quality of resource selection inference and computational feasibility.  However, a parallel and untapped literature of partial differential equations predicts dispersal likelihood based on mechanistic assumptions about individual movement.  Ecological diffusion and ecological telegrapher's equations provide natural scalings from Lagrangian to Eulerian perspectives. They are fully mechanistic and allow for population-level dynamics, but are not inherently statistical nor automatically suited to handling individual-based telemetry data.  This project will reconcile point process modeling with mechanistic dispersal equations to arrive at a unified method for analyzing telemetry data.  Homogenization techniques, which are well-accepted in physical sciences but not often applied in mathematical biology or statistics, will be used to speed up solutions in heterogeneous environments. Coupled point process models and homogenized partial differential equations will accelerate model fitting, provide resource selection inference and naturally accommodate environmental heterogeneity and barriers/constraints to movement.  The ecological movement equations will be homogenized and simplified using asymptotic approximations suitable for point process models, addressing correlation among position observations and velocity constraints.  Rapid numerical techniques for movement models will be developed to allow facile representation of movement barriers (e.g., shorelines, major rivers or roads) as boundary conditions. To develop efficient computational techniques for resource selection functions and landscape resistance inference, the homogenized ecological movement equations will be dovetailed with point process models in a hierarchical framework.  The integrated approach will be applied to telemetry data from foraging ungulates in Utah, harbor seals in the Gulf of Alaska, and Canada lynx in Colorado."

Recent work suggests that feedbacks with fire may make savannas much more common than they would be were their distributions solely determined by climate; as a result, savanna and forest responses to global change may thus be drastic, sudden, and difficult to foresee.  However, existing work does not explain why savanna is spatially aggregated with savanna and forest with forest -- a pattern that indicates that spatial processes may also play a role in determining ecosystem responses to climate.

These hypotheses are variously supported in the empirical literature, and existing work has not attempted to disentangle these processes.  Results will allow the research team to generate informed theoretical and empirical predictions about the past and future distribution of savanna and forest globally.  The proposed work will also generate novel mathematical results.

The occurrence of different cell types in different parts of a tumor, the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor, can lead to failure of therapy that is directed only against one type of cancer cell. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity is associated with a worse prognosis in many cancer types, and the spatial distribution of nutrients and oxygen can favor the development of more aggressive tumor cell populations. By analyzing spatial cancer models, this research will provide new insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of intra-tumor heterogeneity in solid tumors, and into the role of cellular mobility in shaping tumor phenotypes with poor prognosis. To guarantee that the results are relevant to treatment, the project will be carried out in collaboration with physicians and a cancer biologist. The involvement of graduate students in this research will enhance their ability to work at the interface between mathematics and biology. <br/><br/>This project addresses critical challenges in the quest for more effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches in the fight against cancer. Complex agent-based models have often been employed to investigate the impact of space on cancer evolution. However, even if a simulation successfully reproduces observed phenomena, it does not mean that the true underlying mechanism has been found. For this project the investigators plan to extend prior work on spatial Moran models by adding new features to the basic model. To further reduce the gap between analytically tractable and complex computational models, the behavior of the new systems will be analyzed mathematically. The biological questions to be addressed by the project are motivated by recent experimental findings, including studies of the impact of cancer cell migration on solid tumor growth and elucidation of the role of cancer stem cells in driving cancer evolution. Mathematical models that can include genomic data will be used to study genealogies and intra-tumor heterogeneity in colon cancer. Rigorous results for hybrid models that describe tumor-microenvironment interactions will also be derived. More generally, the rigorous analyses of the models will require the development of novel mathematical techniques that will contribute to a deeper understanding of spatial stochastic systems and the behavior of genealogies in an expanding population."

This automation is made possible by particular sets of neurons that are specialized to produce the outputs that drive these behaviors. There are many unanswered questions about how these neurons generate activity with the appropriate features in a way that adapts quickly and automatically to evolving conditions, such as changes in respiratory demand that occur in a switch from a walk to a run.  This project uses mathematical and computational approaches to address several such questions that arise in the context of breathing.  A first set of issues that will be studied relates to the understanding of how processes that evolve on very different timescales contribute to respiratory rhythms.   A second set of issues relates to how neurons involved in a particular phase of respiration, as well as populations of neurons active at different phases, become coordinated to produce effective breathing rhythms.  How these interactions break down to yield respiratory dysfunction, particularly in the context of the severe breathing disruptions arising in Rett syndrome, will also be studied.  The work will be completed in collaboration with experimentalists, and results of the project will lead to improved models of respiratory data and novel ideas on how to counter respiratory disorders.   In addition to enhancing understanding of respiratory function and dysfunction, this project will have broad implications, since rhythmic patterns produced by interacting networks of dynamic components involving multiple timescales are common across a wide range of biological and physical systems.  Trainees contributing to this research will gain experience with using computational methods to address data-driven questions in neuroscience.  Methods and findings developed will contribute to the training of students via local group meetings and courses and will be disseminated more broadly via publications, presentations, and model sharing.  <br/><br/>A variety of repetitive behaviors fundamental to animals' interactions with the environment are driven by the rhythmic activity of networks of coupled neurons.  This project will address rhythm generation and control via a focus on neuronal networks in the mammalian brainstem associated with respiration.  In the rhythms that these networks produce, multiple populations of neurons take turns activating at specific relative times within each breathing cycle, and the activity within each population is synchronized when it arises.  This work will analyze how synchronized activity with complex dynamic features, called bursting, arises in a particular brainstem region during the inspiratory phase of breathing.  Doing so will involve novel mathematical analysis of the dynamics of systems with components that evolve on several distinct timescales. This work will lead to new insights into how respiratory processes should be modeled, which will be useful for the study of particular respiratory phenomena such as sighing and which will also generalize to other biological and physical systems with multiple timescale dynamics.  New results will also be attained, using mathematical and computational methods, about how synchronized bursting in neuronal networks depends on how the neurons in the network are interconnected and communicate with each other.   Respiratory rhythms must be robust to changes in environmental and metabolic demands, and these findings will yield predictions about what features provide this robustness.   Finally, this project will use analysis methods that reveal the dynamic effects of particular parameter variations to elucidate how the intrinsic properties of neurons within particular respiratory areas and the patterns of connections between areas contribute to overall respiratory rhythmicity and to disruptions of respiratory dynamics.  These steps will be guided by novel experimental data and will result in advances in basic understanding as well as predictions about effective interventions to counter respiratory dysfunction."

As such DNA methylation plays a vital role in many biological processes. There are many instances in which DNA methylation between samples is different.  Examples are: 1) different organs (liver vs brain), 2) health vs disease (cancer exhibits methylation patterns that are different from those of healthy tissue), and 3) environmental responses (plants that endure heat and drought stress).  These differences are known as differential methylation. Recently, technology has been developed to simultaneously query the millions of methylation sites in DNA. This technology, however,creates computational and statistical challenges. A pressing question in the field of biology is how to analyze the massive amount of data generated in this way so as to draw biologically relevant, and statistically sound conclusions, without requiring expensive computing equipment. The output of this project will provide statistical methods for detecting differential methylation. This information can then be used by specialists to understand cell function, develop therapeutic interventions, or tackle questions associated with environment such as climate change.  Freely available statistical tools that can be used by all scientists interested in analyzing differential methylation will be developed. This interdisciplinary research project between the mathematical and biological sciences also supports the training of students in these fields. <br/><br/>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that directs gene expression and chromatin conformation. The most common form of DNA methylation in vertebrates is an addition of a methyl group to a cytosine base that is directly followed by a guanine, which is referred to as a CpG site. There are approximately 30 million CpG sites in the human genome with an even larger combination of states of methylation.  A differentially methylated region is a region in the genome where mean methylation levels of CpGs are different between two sample groups, such as disease versus normal. Bisulfite sequencing methods are typically used for measuring DNA methylation at CpG sites. Expansion of this technology to permit simultaneous query of all CpG sites, known as whole genome bisulfite sequencing, has created computational and statistical challenges. These include improving the capability to distinguish signals from noise  in very large datasets, a current focus of much modern statistics. The project team will develop statistical methods to detect differential methylation between sample groups. Specifically, the methods in this research project improve existing approaches by recognizing and accounting for correlations among methylation sites based on their genomic locations. Such model assumptions ensure that statistical results are biologically meaningful and interpretable. In addition, the methods will borrow information across the whole genome to improve estimation and statistical testing reliability. Bayesian models with theoretical justifications will be developed and implemented using efficient and scalable algorithms to ensure their applicability to a wide variety of high-throughput methylation datasets. Methods will be implemented into software tools and will be freely available for biology and statistics researchers."

Due to ongoing renewal of tissue, some individual human cells divide as many as 5000 times during a lifetime, accumulating deleterious mutations that may result in a cell becoming cancerous. The principal investigator will test how the probability of tissues accumulating mutations depends on the spatial organization of cells, and the developmental stage of the cell where the initial cancer-causing mutation occurs. Determining which cellular division patterns slow down mutation accumulation and delay the onset of cancer will advance our understanding of mechanisms driving tumorigenesis and provide quantitative predictions that can be validated experimentally. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students through research involvement in an interdisciplinary field.  The mathematical models developed in this research project will be incorporated into a summer course on Cancer Dynamics in the q-bio Summer School that introduces students from diverse disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer science to modeling in biology.  <br/><br/>Dynamical models will be used to study the effects of cellular differentiation hierarchy on the estimated time to cancer development and treatment outcomes in various cancer types. Trade-offs between symmetric cell division and the production of more differentiated cells via asymmetric division will be explored in a stochastic model of different cell types and their spatial locations. On an intracellular level, a model for unequal distribution of cellular components (cellular polarity) that regulates asymmetric divisions will be developed.  Computational tests will examine the effects of mutations of different key proteins in the polarity biochemical network and relate them to macroscopic behavior in a population level model of tissue.

The cortex, which lies just below the outer membrane of the cell, consists primarily of polymerized filaments of the protein actin. These actin filaments are cross-linked by a variety of proteins that can reorient and even move the filaments, making the cortex a highly dynamic structure. Despite the importance of the actin cortex for critical cell functions, it is not clear how small scale interactions give rise to large scale patterns and functions associated with the cortex. This project will use mathematical modeling to bridge disparate time and space scales associated with cortical actin dynamics, directly linking molecular level interactions to the emergence of cell level functional structures. For this project, novel models will be constructed that draw on a variety of mathematical approaches, including stochastic models which take into account infrequent interactions, and continuum models which can track the moving boundary of the cortex as well movement of proteins in time and space. The development and analysis of these biologically based models will result in an improved understanding of actin and its regulation in a cellular context. This research will also be leveraged to recruit and retain women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields through the development of an integrated undergraduate course in mathematical modeling, with recruitment of students through a number of existing programs at Ohio State University, including Women in Mathematics and Science and Women in Engineering. Students involved in this project, and in the undergraduate course, will be exposed to real world mathematics applications and will interact with peers from other disciplines in a supportive interdisciplinary environment.<br/><br/>Mathematical modeling is an ideal tool for the investigation of complex biological systems, where experimental techniques are not available or are not feasible. At the macro-scale level, systems of partial differential equations  will be used to investigate the interplay between biochemical and mechanical actin dynamics, and the consequence of these dynamics on cell shape. Asymptotic analysis will be used to explicitly study the role of curvature in actin dynamics, and moving boundary simulations will be used to study changes in cell shape. At the mesoscale level, integro-differential equations, which use integral kernels to describe actin filament dynamics, will be used to study the formation of large scale actin filament patterns such as asters, vortices and aggregates. At the micro-scale level, stochastic individual-based models will be used to determine physical properties of the local actin meshwork and to determine under what conditions the actin meshwork behaves as a viscoelastic material. By enforcing consistency across multiple time and space scales in the proposed models, mechanisms that give rise to cellular structures will be revealed. Analysis and simulations of these models will present unique challenges leading to improvement of techniques in several areas of applied mathematics, including asymptotic analysis, moving boundary simulations, nonlocal model analysis, and stochastic simulations. The proposed models will be motivated and validated in a single experimental organism, avoiding complications from combining in vitro data with in vivo data from multiple organisms and cell types. The integrated computational and analytical models resulting from this research will increase our understanding of a fundamental protein that is critical for proper cell function."

Much information about past evolutionary events can be inferred from the analysis of DNA sequence data collected from existing species. A notable feature of the evolution of molecular sequences is the significant role played by chance. In recent years, probability theory, the mathematical study of randomness, has provided key new insights in analyzing the power of statistical methods to reconstruct evolutionary processes in large-scale phylogenetics. The overall goal of this research project is to further investigate these connections. Through the development, analysis, implementation, and dissemination of algorithms for the alignment of molecular sequences and the reconstruction of evolutionary trees, this research will help advance the state of knowledge in evolutionary biology. The project aims to contribute to the numerous benefits to society of phylogenetic research such as the protection of ecosystems from invasive species, the identification of emerging diseases, and the prediction of disease outbreaks. Integration of research and education is a major component of this project. In addition to providing research training for graduate students, course materials will be developed in conjunction with the activities and made widely available. <br/><br/>In evolutionary biology, the speciation history of a group of organisms is represented graphically by a phylogeny, that is, a rooted tree whose leaves represent current species and whose branchings indicate past speciation events. Phylogenies are commonly estimated from molecular sequences collected from the species of interest. Despite breathtaking advances in sequencing technologies and the development of increasingly more powerful methods, phylogenetic reconstruction remains a challenging problem, and many evolutionary relationships continue to be the source of controversy. Most traditional phylogenetic reconstruction methods involve two steps: multiple sequence alignment and tree estimation. This two-step approach introduces systematic biases that can adversely affect the final tree estimate and other downstream analyses. The general objective of this project is to provide new mathematical insights on alignment methods and their effects on phylogenetic analyses as well as to develop new tools to analyze methodologies that go beyond the traditional two-step approach to phylogenetic reconstruction. This objective will be achieved by further developing the fruitful interface between probability theory and mathematical phylogenetics."

The symposium aims to: (1) recognize and advocate collective achievements by female mathematicians in the Midwest, and (2) stimulate collaborations, networking, and mentoring relations. The meeting builds upon the success of previous symposia to establish the WIMS as an annual event rotating among colleges and universities in the Midwest. The symposium will attract female mathematicians in the Midwest at all stages of their careers; it is expected to draw about 100 participants, in particular, graduate students, early-career researchers, and faculty at small institutions who have limited access to resources enabling them to attend conferences. <br/><br/>The symposium will feature two plenary lectures by distinguished senior researchers and eight shorter ones by promising junior researchers. The speakers are chosen to reflect the variety of institutions in the Midwest. Collectively, they will discuss a broad spectrum of cutting edge research. Lectures will be accompanied by open problem sessions, where the participants will work in small groups to discuss field-specific problems and develop new collaborations. Students and recent PhDs will contribute to the intellectual activity of the symposium by making poster presentations. This workshop is jointly funded by eight programs within the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences: Algebra & Number Theory, Analysis, Applied Math, Infrastructure, Mathematical Biology, Topology & Geometric Analysis, Foundations, and Probability.

While phylogenetic analyses are widely used throughout the biological sciences, there remain fundamental questions about how to reconstruct trees most effectively under a host of increasingly complex data scenarios.  This project addresses fundamental scientific challenges in phylogenetics using a range of mathematics tools from probability, combinatorics, and geometry.  One main goal of the project will be to develop better methods for reconstructing evolutionary histories.  The project will further develop STEM infrastructure by training graduate students in mathematical methods in biology.<br/><br/>This research develops tools from probability, combinatorics, and geometry to solve problems in phylogenetics, that area of mathematical biology concerned with reconstructing evolutionary histories between collections of species.  The particular problems to be addressed include the development of new algorithms for alignment free phylogenetic tree reconstruction, the study of the distribution of maximum agreement subtrees for random trees, and the development of geometric tools to better deploy distance-based phylogenetic algorithms.  The implementation assuming alignment free phylogenetic tree reconstruction will be the first statistically consistent method that takes into account both substitution and insertion/deletion processes.  The project on maximum agreement subtrees makes connections to longest increasing subsequences and related tools from combinatorial probability.  The project on distance-based methods will use tools from polyhedral combinatorics and tropical geometry to better understand the comparison between greedy algorithms procedures and the underlying approximate optimization procedures."

Images of three dimensional, volumetric, structures provide indispensable spatial information about organs, tissues, and molecules that cannot be captured using two dimensions. The development of tools for efficient and effective analysis of such volumetric data sets is, therefore, urgently required. This project will develop generally applicable mathematical and computational frameworks to effectively and accurately represent, compare, and retrieve biological and medical data in three dimensions. The methods to be developed will provide a general foundation for the analysis of volumetric images obtained using multiple imaging modalities and for multiple data types, not only from the biological domain. For example, the techniques have broader impact in areas such as human face recognition, analysis of geographical and climate data, and computer-aided design. This project, therefore, contributes to general promotion of the progress of science and technology in many domains in which imaging analysis is crucial and is of significant societal impact. <br/><br/>In this project, two complementary and synergistic methods will be developed and integrated. The first method to be developed is a mathematical moment-based approach that provides a compact representation of volumetric data and is very suitable for localized three dimensional image data comparison. A two dimensional image comparison method that is based on a moment-based invariant will be expanded to handle volumetric data. The second method is a machine learning approach that will be powerful in classifying volumetric data. These two approaches will be integrated to take advantage of both methods and validated using three dimensional protein structural data. Analyzing global and local similarities between protein shapes is critical for understanding protein function but challenging because proteins with substantially different shapes may perform the same function. Further, proteins are appropriate for this validation step not only because many structures are available in well-established public databases but also because they lack intrinsic orientation, unlike previously studied datasets of man-made objects such as cars, cups, and tables. As the proposed methods are defined for a general voxel representation of a given volume, they will be generally applicable for any data set yielding a voxel representation, including biomedical data collected using electron microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Along side the scientific impact of the project, it also leverages efforts in the interdisciplinary computational life sciences and engineering departments at Purdue University and Eastern Kentucky University by recruiting and training students through interdisciplinary coursework and direct involvement with the project."

Dramatic improvements in the acquisition, resolution, and extent of two relevant types of data have recently occurred: remotely sensed environmental data and high-resolution animal location (telemetry) data.  These data drive a statistical industry serving wildlife management agencies, private companies, and academia. Improvements in tracking technology are likely to cause a revolution in movement ecology analogous to the impact of gene sequencing on molecular genetics.  This project synthesizes theoretical advances (statistical techniques for estimating movement probability between sites and how environmental resources are selected), existing results (mathematical techniques for rapidly predicting the envelope of future animal positions using mechanistic assumptions) and untapped data (remotely sensed habitat maps and high resolution individual telemetry) to rigorously characterize how landscape features condition population movement and habitat choice.  The research will encompass case studies investigating the movement of mule deer and elk in Utah, harbor seals off southeastern Alaska, and Canada lynx, which have recently been reintroduced in Colorado and are dispersing throughout the Rocky Mountains.   Research students will be cross-trained in mathematics, statistics, and movement ecology; undergraduates will be included in the research process by developing individual-based models to test estimation technologies.  A teaching lab in mathematical biology, illustrating movement models using real biological systems, will also be developed and distributed.<br/><br/>Statistical point process models provide well-understood statistical approaches for obtaining inference from individual-based telemetry data, with resource selection functions describing individual habitat preferences and availability functions describing dispersal probability between locations. However, point process models require numerical quadrature for proper normalization, making them slow for large data sets.  Classical availability functions are not constructed to handle major issues like movement constraints, autocorrelation, and landscape resistance, affecting quality of resource selection inference and computational feasibility.  However, a parallel and untapped literature of partial differential equations predicts dispersal likelihood based on mechanistic assumptions about individual movement.  Ecological diffusion and ecological telegrapher's equations provide natural scalings from Lagrangian to Eulerian perspectives. They are fully mechanistic and allow for population-level dynamics, but are not inherently statistical nor automatically suited to handling individual-based telemetry data.  This project will reconcile point process modeling with mechanistic dispersal equations to arrive at a unified method for analyzing telemetry data.  Homogenization techniques, which are well-accepted in physical sciences but not often applied in mathematical biology or statistics, will be used to speed up solutions in heterogeneous environments. Coupled point process models and homogenized partial differential equations will accelerate model fitting, provide resource selection inference and naturally accommodate environmental heterogeneity and barriers/constraints to movement.  The ecological movement equations will be homogenized and simplified using asymptotic approximations suitable for point process models, addressing correlation among position observations and velocity constraints.  Rapid numerical techniques for movement models will be developed to allow facile representation of movement barriers (e.g., shorelines, major rivers or roads) as boundary conditions. To develop efficient computational techniques for resource selection functions and landscape resistance inference, the homogenized ecological movement equations will be dovetailed with point process models in a hierarchical framework.  The integrated approach will be applied to telemetry data from foraging ungulates in Utah, harbor seals in the Gulf of Alaska, and Canada lynx in Colorado."

Perturbations of intracellular transport can lead to intracellular traffic jams, cell death, and various diseases, analogous to the damage to a city when the transportation system breaks down. The investigator will develop multiscale models and methods to understand how the cytoskeleton and intracellular transport are affected in diseases inside an axon, which is a long thin projection of a neuron. The research results will have profound implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is anticipated that the new mathematical models can be readily generalized to other cellular transport problems. The new mathematical theory on interacting particle systems will have wide applications in biology and social sciences.  The research plan will be tightly integrated with the educational plan that will engage graduate students on interdisciplinary research and expose K-12 students to mathematical biology and scientific computing through residential summer camps. This project will also broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The axonal cytoskeleton is an intracellular polymer system that is responsible for the active transport of various cargoes along an axon. Disruptions of the axonal cytoskeleton and axonal transport, including radial segregation of the cytoskeleton and abnormal accumulations of cargoes, have been observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The investigator will develop multiscale models to study the axonal cytoskeleton dynamics and axonal transport in health and disease. There are three aims. The first is to derive macroscopic models for the organization of the axonal cytoskeleton in cross-section from microscopic models, and use them to investigate the striking radial segregation of the axonal cytoskeleton in disease. The second is to develop new multiscale modes for cargo transport along an axon that incorporate cargo-cargo interactions, and use them to investigate potential mechanisms that cause focal accumulations of cargoes, which are early hallmarks of nerve degeneration. The third is to develop fully three-dimensional stochastic models for the axonal cytoskeleton dynamics and axonal transport for investigation of biological questions that concern dynamics near the nodes of Ranvier, which are naturally occurring narrowing points in large axons. The multiscale modeling strategy and the close collaboration with experimentalists will lead to significant insights into the biological problem and help guide new experiments."
