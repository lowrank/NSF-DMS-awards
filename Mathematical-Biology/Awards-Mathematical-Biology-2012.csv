The major challenge is the lack of an appropriate modeling framework for gene family evolution. To address this challenge, the investigators develop a probabilistic model for gene family evolution that is able to describe the relationship between the history of a gene family and the history of species by taking into account the effects of different evolutionary mechanisms of gene retention (neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, dosage balance). The model involves two stochastic processes - a non-homogeneous birth and death process and a mutation process. The probability distribution of a gene family tree given the species tree is derived from a non-homogeneous birth and death process in which a hazard function is employed for modeling the loss rate associated with different evolutionary mechanisms. The probabilistic model provides a systematic way of handling the estimation error of gene family trees when analyzing gene family data and is thus able to more accurately estimate the gene duplication and loss events along the phylogeny of species.<br/><br/>Advanced biotechnologies provide a vast amount of genetic data for the studies on gene family evolution. The main goal of the project is to develop a probabilistic model for gene family evolution, which can be used to effectively analyze gene family data. Gene duplication is the major resource of evolution novelty and plays an important role in gene family evolution. Thus this project will significantly advance our understanding on the process and biological consequences of gene duplication. As gene duplication played a pivotal role in evolution, the outcomes of the project will have significant impacts and important applications on a variety of fields, including evolutionary biology, phylogenetics, and cancer genetics that are closely related to human health and medicine."

The lack of topographic structure in hippocampus has made it a natural inspiration for associative memory models, such as the Hopfield model, for encoding memories in unstructured recurrent networks. At the same time, studies in rodents have uncovered the critical role of hippocampus in spatial navigation and, more recently, time-tracking. In contrast to associative memory encoding, these functions have been successfully modeled using spatially structured networks. How can these viewpoints be reconciled? The central goal of this research is to develop a mathematical theory of memory encoding in spatially structured networks, and to study the neural codes that arise from such networks.  Specifically, the research will develop mathematical theory to answer the following questions: (1) How can overlapping memory patterns be encoded precisely as attractors of an unstructured neural network, without introducing unwanted ""spurious states""? (2) How can memories be encoded in a spatially structured network, such as a bump attractor network, while maintaining functions that depend on the network's spatial organization?  (3) Aside from error correction, what are the advantages of redundancy in a neural code, such as the hippocampal place field code, that is characterized by heavily overlapping receptive fields? This last question will also be explored via the analysis of cortical and hippocampal data sets provided by collaborating labs.<br/><br/>The hippocampus is often thought of as a ""Swiss knife"" in the brain.  Decades of experimental work have uncovered its essential role in learning and memory, as well as in spatial navigation.  From a theoretical standpoint, it is puzzling how the same neural network can achieve such disparate functions.  In particular, mathematical models of memory encoding are fundamentally quite different from models of spatial navigation.  This work will integrate these two major types of neural network models, with the goal of understanding how the hippocampus can support multiple important functions.  At its core, the research will advance the mathematical theory behind our understanding of network-level computation in the brain."

Specifically, we address the problem of integration and analysis of multiple sources of high dimensional biological data with network structure. It is a well documented fact that correlation between different molecular compartments is relatively low, while the information derived from a single compartment is often highly noisy or even incomplete. Hence, there is a need to develop advanced models and techniques for integrating multiple data sets from diverse Omics platforms, while taking explicitly into consideration the available information of interactions within and between compartments. Particular emphasis is placed on pathway analysis and enrichment due to their role in complex diseases onset and progression. The following directions will be pursued: (1) Development of network based methods that integrate data from multiple Omics platforms for pathway analysis and enrichment. (2) Development of fast computational algorithms for estimating large scale network based integrative models. Investigation of associated inference problems and study of properties of proposed estimators together with their robustness to the noise levels of the network information employed. (3) Introduction of novel hypergraph models for assessing differential activity of pathways that utilize different degrees of information about the structure and accuracy of the underlying network. (4) Development of a novel scheme based on perturbed P-values for detecting active members of pathways that would aid in biomarker discovery. (5) Implementation of the propose methodology into an easy to use software tool.<br/><br/>The proposed research program will have a three-pronged impact: methodological, scientific and educational. On the methodology front, the research based on this project will lead (a) to a developing a comprehensive framework for assessing differential activity of pathways based on different models that integrate data from multiple Omics platforms and utilize different degrees of information about the structure and accuracy of the underlying network, (b) a systematicunderstanding of the computational issues involved in large scale (generalized) mixed linear models;and (c) a novel scheme based on perturbed P-values for identifying active members of pathways that become potential targets for therapeutic drugs. The enhanced scientific understanding will provide tangible impact at the level of applications. A number of the proposed methods have already been used in the analysis of high dimensional genomic, proteomic and metabolomic data with emphasis on identifying active pathways (subnetworks) in different disease (primarily cancer) states. Further, a number of new experiments are in the design stage that would utilize some of the advanced models and techniques proposed in this project. Another key aspect of this proposal is the development of an easy to use by practitioners open source software, built within a domain independent workflow management system. This allows users to enhance the software by adding their own functionality and computational tools in an easy and transparent manner. The novel methodological procedures ensuing from this research agenda will be disseminated to the relevant scientific communities, both via inter-disciplinary interaction and collaboration and through presentations at conferences and specialized workshops. Finally, on the educational front, the material from the project will provide research topics for doctoral students working under the supervision of the PIs; it will therefore play an important role in the training of future quantitative scientists."

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of the subtype H5N1, which now threatens to mutate and cause a major pandemic, evolves from the low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) while circulating in poultry. Understanding evolution of viral pathogens requires a detailed analysis of interactions between different genetic types of the virus in the context of host population structure. The first part of this project studies the interplay of HPAI and LPAI in wild birds and domestic birds, particularly questions related to the cross-immunity that LPAI potentially provides to HPAI. The principal investigator and her colleagues develop and analyze multi-strain age-structured models in a two-host-species system (corresponding to domestic bird stocks, and wild bird populations) to study competitive exclusion and persistence of HPAI and LPAI strains.   Furthermore,  mathematical techniques are developed  that elucidate the dynamical behavior of the system. Preliminary results suggest that time-since-recovery structure coupled with cross-immunity may be responsible for more complex, oscillatory behavior of LPAI and HPAI  when there is coexistence in birds. The second part of the project builds  on these models to study the symbiotic effect of multiple control strategies applied to control highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza in poultry.   Preliminary results suggest that strategies applied to poultry, such as vaccination and culling, should be significantly more efficient than strategies applied to humans, such as wearing protective gear, in reducing the prevalence of H5N1 among humans.   Further efforts are made  to understand the interplay of vaccination of poultry and culling as the two primary control measures applied today, in order to provide quantitative insight into alternative potential measures of disease control.<br/><br/>This project produces models of highly pathogenic avian influenza (bird flu, caused by an H5N1 influenza virus) that are well-grounded in the complex biology of the virus and validated with available data. Such models are required both to understand the basic disease dynamics, and to develop and implement effective control measures. The models are designed to fit available data on the cumulative number of human H5N1 cases and to be able to perform reasonable projections of future cases. Furthermore, the threat of a world-wide human epidemic (pandemic) caused by H5N1 requires strict control measures for the virus. These control measures (especially culling, the killing of all birds in a poultry operation when H5N1 infection is detected) cause significant economic losses in the poultry industry in many parts of the world. The models and methods developed as a part of this project evaluate the effectiveness of alternative control measures in reducing the number of H5N1 human cases.   Analysis of these mathematical models expands our ability to choose the best control measures. In addition, the project studies the emergence of highly pathogenic strains from low pathogenic strains and their circulation in wild birds and domestic birds. The evolution of highly pathogenic strains capable of infecting humans is a major pathway through which a pandemic strain can emerge. Understanding the circumstances that foster such evolution increases our preparedness in identifying and combating potential pandemic threats caused by avian influenza."

Revolutionary opportunities have emerged for mathematically driven advances in biological research. Experimental exploration of self-organizing biomolecular systems, such as HIV viruses, molecular motors and proteins in Alzheimer's disease, has been a dominating driven force in scientific discovery and innovation in the past few decades.  However, the emergence of complexity in self-organizing biological systems poses fundamental challenges to their quantitative description because of the excessively high dimensionality.  This Focused Research Group (FRG) will provide a platform, led by leading researchers from Michigan State University, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Pennsylvania State University, who will synergistically merge their expertise in theoretical modeling, scientific computing and mathematical analysis, for quantitative descriptions of biomolecular systems.   The research addresses grand challenges in the structure, function and dynamics of self-organizing biomolecular systems due to exceptionally massive data sets. These challenges are tackled through the introduction of new variational multiscale models, which reduces the dimensionality and number of degrees of freedom by a macroscopic continuum description of the aquatic/membrane environment, and a microscopic discrete description of biomolecules. Additionally, to further reduce the dimensionality of excessively large biomolecular systems, the investigators introduce a coarse-grained approach based on the density cluster dynamics which extracts stable manifolds in molecular dynamics simulations. This FRG project offers innovative new approaches to the massive data management, dimensionality reduction, computer simulation, theoretical modeling and mathematical analysis of biomolecular systems.<br/><br/>This project is a timely effort to promote the quantitative transition of biological science, which will lead to emerging new fields in both mathematical and biological sciences. In particular, the proposed effort will significantly strengthen the leading role that the U.S. researchers can play in mathematical molecular biosciences by aggressively pursuing cutting-edge research and collaboratively training a new generation of mathematicians in this emerging interdisciplinary field.  Three annual workshops and international meeting will be held in Michigan State (Year 1), Wisconsin (Year 2) and Penn State (Year 3) to strengthen the collaboration and extend the societal impact."

In the case of transcription of ribosomal RNA in bacteria, the density of elongating complexes is sufficiently high to experience traffic jams.  Since the growth rate in a fast growing E. coli population is determined by the availability of ribosomes, which in turn is limited by ribosomal RNA transcription rates, the elongation process of ribosomal RNA is a key factor determining the E. coli growth rate.  This research project uses a nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) as a mathematical model for the transcription process of ribosomal RNA.  The PDE takes the form of a nonlinear conservation law, and it was first proposed as a mathematical model for traffic patterns in the 1950's.  Although this type of model was superseded in the study of traffic flow by models that take into account driver reactions, it is suitable for modeling elongation processes as it incorporates density dependent velocities and the presence of transcriptional pauses.  The PDE model is used to estimate an instantaneous elongation rate in the presence of a non-uniform distribution of pauses, which are biologically important yet experimentally inaccessible quantities.  The second major element of the research is the development of analytical as well as sophisticated numerical methods for verification, validation and sensitivity analysis of the model.  Discontinuous Galerkin methods form the foundation of the computational schemes, allowing efficient numerical solution of systems of nonlinear conservation laws with discontinuous coefficients that encode the presence of pauses.  These new tools will be used to determine the limits that transcriptional pauses impose on the mean and variance of the transcription rate of ribosomal RNA. <br/><br/>Maintenance of homeostasis, capacity to grow and ability to respond to stimuli are just a few of the characteristics of life that depend on each cell's ability to regulate production of molecules such as mRNA and proteins. Proteins are produced by ribosomes sliding along a long thin strand of messenger RNA (mRNA).  In turn, mRNA is generated by a transcription complex sliding along the DNA template.  These translation and transcription processes fall within the broad classification of ""elongation processes.""  Although recent revolutionary advances in cell biology have improved scientists' qualitative understanding of life on a molecular level, efforts to construct predictive quantitative models are often limited by a lack of quantitative experimental data.  However, one important system, transcription of ribosomal RNA, is sufficiently experimentally characterized to allow delineation of the limits it imposes on cellular physiology.  The current work develops quantitative models of this transcription process in order to quantify limitations it imposes on bacterial growth rates.  Connections between the molecular biophysics of elongation processes and the macroscopically observable growth rate are quantitatively studied.  The current research combines careful modeling of a complex biological process with the development of new mathematical and numerical techniques to answer fundamental biological questions.  The results may have a broad impact on our understanding of bacterial physiology and, through a better understanding of the driving mechanisms of bacterial growth, may have a long term impact on molecular biotechnology."

Recent advancements in computational fluid dynamics have enabled researchers to efficiently explore problems that involve moving elastic boundaries immersed in fluids for problems such as cardiac fluid dynamics, fish swimming, and the movement of bacteria. These advances have also made modeling the interaction between a fluid and a neuromechanical model of an elastic organ or organism feasible. This project will focus on the development and implementation of such models for two problems: 1) fluid transport through the pumping of tubular hearts, and 2) feeding currents generated by the pulsation of jellyfish bells. This proposal leverages existing computational algorithms for fluid-structure interactions, whereas the mathematical novelty lies in coupling this technology to living boundaries. The models will integrate feedback between the conduction of action potentials, the contraction of muscles, the movement of tissues, and fluid motion. For example, mathematical models will be developed that couple action potentials triggered by noisy pacemaker cells to the generation of tension through appropriate muscle and Ca2+ models. The non-Hookean material properties and geometry of highly deformable heart tubes and jellyfish bells will also be quantified and accurately modeled using discrete differential geometry. <br/><br/>This work will combine computational, mathematical, and experimental tools to ultimately answer some of questions posed in one of the five grand challenges in organismal biology: Integrating living and physical systems. Integrative mathematical models of the neurobiology, muscular mechanics, elasticity, and fluid dynamics of pumping tubular hearts and jellyfish bells will be developed. While great strides have been made in the modeling and simulation of each of these components separately, coupling these fields remains elusive. The working proposition that motivates this research is that modeling the complete neuromechanical system is more tractable for the two selected problems than almost any other given their relative simplicity. The results of this research may also provide a framework for the development of integrative models of other fundamental biological problems such as the movement and regulation of waste through the intestines, air through the lungs, and lymph through the lymphatic system. The educational focus of this proposal is to implement a unified training program for mathematicians and biologists centered on mathematical modeling in biology. The proposed educational activities will include a first year seminar in epidemiology, a course and associated text on mathematical modeling in comparative biomechanics for biologists and mathematicians, and a summer program for mathematical biologists at the UNC Galapagos Center. This educational program is motivated by the fact that it will be critical to train mathematics and biology students at this interface in order to rise to the scientific challenges that will be posed during the 21st century."

The time at which cancer recurrence occurs (i.e., survival benefit of therapy) is governed by a complex balance between many factors such as initial tumor size, mutation rates, the type/number of resistance mechanisms, and drug efficacy and schedule. This research aims to develop a comprehensive mathematical understanding of how these factors conspire to control the temporal dynamics of the evolutionary processes driving cancer recurrence, using branching process models of tumor growth.  The first part of the work will focus on developing a detailed understanding of the temporal dynamics of cancer recurrence, under the basic assumptions that tumor cell populations are ?well-mixed? in a constant selective environment. The analysis will characterize both mean dynamics and fluctuations in the system due to both demographic stochasticity and random mutational fitness changes. In the second part of the work, the investigators will relax these basic assumptions to quantify and compare the effects of additional factors that may significantly impact recurrence dynamics. These additional factors include temporally varying selective environments, spatial structure and inhomogeneity, and hierarchical population structure. All of these investigations will be performed using stochastic process models of escape from extinction, and both analytical and computational tools will be utilized to study recurrence dynamics.<br/><br/>This research will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms driving variability in patterns of cancer progression following acquired resistance to treatment.  The results can eventually aid in the development of better statistical tools for prognosis, evaluating drug efficacy, and improving treatment strategies.  For example, an understanding of how the timing of cancer recurrence reveals information about the composition or prior genetic history of the tumor can aid in determining optimal treatment strategies post-recurrence.  In addition, this project will contribute to a general mathematical understanding of the dynamics of escape from population extinction.  Thus, the theory developed will be broadly applicable, with minimal extension, to understanding similar issues in evolution, health (e.g. bacterial and viral drug resistance), and ecology.  This project will support for trainees at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in research at the interface of mathematics, biology, and medicine.<br/>"

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) applies concepts from algebraic topology to address this challenge. Topological techniques have been used successfully in engineering and biology but are seldom applied to the analysis of genomic data. In cancer genomics, the identification of copy number aberrations (CNAs) such as gains and losses of DNA segments is an important problem because CNAs are known to contain cancer genes and therefore to be involved in misregulation of key signaling pathways. CNAs may occur independently or may co-occur. The latter are believed to act synergistically and therefore result in unforeseen consequences. For example, the finding that CNAs in 8p12 and 11q13.3 are co-amplified in some breast cancers led to the discovery of functional interactions between the MYC and the TP53 pathways. Such interactions offer an important paradigm for cancer research because many tumors are believed to use similar mechanisms for their progression. Identification of co-occurring CNAs has traditionally been hindered both by the large sample sizes required to find co-occurrences and by the lack of mathematical methods to identify them efficiently. Recently, large microarray-based data sets have become available for breast cancer. The proposed research aims to develop a new TDA-based method to detect independent and co-occurring CNAs in breast cancer. In the proposed approach each CNA profile is characterized by a set of biologically-meaningful topological spaces. Topological invariants of these spaces (i.e., Betti numbers) will be used to de-noise the data and identify CNAs. This project will yield broadly-applicable methods for: (1) representing complex data sets in forms that are amenable to topological analysis; (2) determining the statistical significance of TDA results; (3) computing topological invariants from large data sets.<br/><br/>Rapid advances in the sciences have generated large, complex data sets of unprecedented proportions. New mathematical methods are urgently needed in order to solve fundamental problems in the analysis of such high-dimensional data. In the field of genomics, thousands of measurements have been obtained with the goal of unveiling molecular signatures that characterize essential biological processes. This field has significantly influenced the direction of breast cancer research because of its potential for differentiating various subtypes, pathways and prognoses of the disease. Currently, the major approach to detecting genomic signatures is focused on the identification of single independent events. However, there is increasing evidence that copy number aberrations (CNAs)-- such as amplifications and deletions of the genome--are not always independent of one another; rather, they may co-occur with synergistic and unforeseen consequences. For example, co-occurring CNAs detected in breast cancer have led to the identification of cross-talk between different signaling pathways. The systematic search for co-occurring CNAs has been hampered by a lack of mathematical methods adequate to identify them. The PI proposes to develop new methods in Topological Data Analysis to identify co-occurring CNAs in breast cancer. Further, because copy number changes are associated with other diseases and with evolutionary processes, this project will have important impacts across the sciences, both basic (e.g. evolution and development) and applied (e.g. diseases with a genetic component such as cancer, autism and multiple sclerosis). The proposed research will advance the field of mathematical genetics/genomics with new tools for analyzing complex interactions among genetic elements in genetic/genomic data. The methods developed also have the potential for extension to identify co-occurring events in large, complex longitudinal data sets. Furthering its broader impacts, the project will implement a series of public lectures on real-life applications of computational mathematics with special outreach to local school teachers, students and professionals."

These communities are ubiquitous from the laboratory to the ocean, and the objective of this research is to advance understanding of microbial flocculation, the process whereby proliferating clusters of organisms in suspension fragment and aggregate. Specifically, the researchers use semigroup, fractal, partial differential equation, and computational analysis to advance the theory and applications for a novel class of structured population models. The close coupling between the model development, analysis, and experimental validation allows insight into the biomechanical and metabolic adaptations of this globally pervasive and fundamental state of microbial existence.  The investigator and his colleagues are guided by three motivating questions:  1) what are the dominant mechanisms driving floc fragmentation?   2) How does floc structure variability impact population proliferation?  and   3) Why do some floc population distributions converge to self-similarity and others decay to mono-dispersion? Insight into the dominant microscale mechanisms could dramatically change both modeling and consequently control of microbial populations.<br/><br/>Micro-organisms suspended in a fluid often do not live as single cells - by collision and separation they combine and recombine in a process called flocculation. These microbial communities exist everywhere from the laboratory to the ocean and the tendency to flocculate has a surprising impact on human life. For example, industrial biotechnologies based on cell cultures (e.g., in the manufacturer of proteins as drugs) rely heavily on predictions of the physical properties of microbial communities. Bacterial clusters are used in municipal sewage treatment plants across the country as an environmentally sustainable part of cleaning human and industrial wastewater. Moreover, bacterial and algal communities in a fluid are an essential part of the bioplastic, biofuel, and biogas industries.  In natural settings, the flocculation properties of algae play an important role in algal blooms (and thus in the resultant negative economic and health impacts). The investigator and his colleagues develop and study mathematical models of flocculation and perform experiments to validate predictions of the distribution of cluster sizes and growth rates. This project aims to transform scientific understanding of microbial flocculation from one based upon simplified, idealized models of clusters to one based on microscale mechanistic and metabolic first principles. Advances in our understanding of the population behavior of these microbial aggregates could lead to dramatic improvements in such diverse societal challenges as biofuel production efficiency, sustainable means of handling wastewater, and management of oceanic algal blooms.<br/>"

Specifically, we address the problem of integration and analysis of multiple sources of high dimensional biological data with network structure. It is a well documented fact that correlation between different molecular compartments is relatively low, while the information derived from a single compartment is often highly noisy or even incomplete. Hence, there is a need to develop advanced models and techniques for integrating multiple data sets from diverse Omics platforms, while taking explicitly into consideration the available information of interactions within and between compartments. Particular emphasis is placed on pathway analysis and enrichment due to their role in complex diseases onset and progression. The following directions will be pursued: (1) Development of network based methods that integrate data from multiple Omics platforms for pathway analysis and enrichment. (2) Development of fast computational algorithms for estimating large scale network based integrative models. Investigation of associated inference problems and study of properties of proposed estimators together with their robustness to the noise levels of the network information employed. (3) Introduction of novel hypergraph models for assessing differential activity of pathways that utilize different degrees of information about the structure and accuracy of the underlying network. (4) Development of a novel scheme based on perturbed P-values for detecting active members of pathways that would aid in biomarker discovery. (5) Implementation of the propose methodology into an easy to use software tool. <br/><br/>The proposed research program will have a three-pronged impact: methodological, scientific and educational. On the methodology front, the research based on this project will lead (a) to a developing a comprehensive framework for assessing differential activity of pathways based on different models that integrate data from multiple Omics platforms and utilize different degrees of information about the structure and accuracy of the underlying network, (b) a systematicunderstanding of the computational issues involved in large scale (generalized) mixed linear models;and (c) a novel scheme based on perturbed P-values for identifying active members of pathways that become potential targets for therapeutic drugs. The enhanced scientific understanding will provide tangible impact at the level of applications. A number of the proposed methods have already been used in the analysis of high dimensional genomic, proteomic and metabolomic data with emphasis on identifying active pathways (subnetworks) in different disease (primarily cancer) states. Further, a number of new experiments are in the design stage that would utilize some of the advanced models and techniques proposed in this project. Another key aspect of this proposal is the development of an easy to use by practitioners open source software, built within a domain independent workflow management system. This allows users to enhance the software by adding their own functionality and computational tools in an easy and transparent manner. The novel methodological procedures ensuing from this research agenda will be disseminated to the relevant scientific communities, both via inter-disciplinary interaction and collaboration and through presentations at conferences and specialized workshops. Finally, on the educational front, the material from the project will provide research topics for doctoral students working under the supervision of the PIs; it will therefore play an important role in the training of future quantitative scientists."

What role does such correlated activity play in neural coding?  The retina provides a strong opportunity for progress:  widespread correlated activity is generated by key circuit mechanisms that recur throughout the brain.  Moreover, the impact of these mechanisms can be studied in the context of stimuli with clear functional significance.  Nevertheless, circuit-level nonlinearities at multiple locations cause retinal outputs to depend on stimuli in a manner that defies traditional filter-based models. This demands a tightly coupled computational and experimental approach:  purely computational attacks will become lost in the combinatorics of all possible circuit configurations at the difficult ""mesoscales"" relevant to retinal computation, where averaging approaches fail; purely experimental strategies cannot predict and prioritize the most critical circuit mechanisms and stimulus parameters to explore.  The investigators apply this interdisciplinary approach to the mechanisms producing correlated activity in directionally-selective (DS) ganglion cells.  In particular, they determine how convergent and divergent pathways in the DS cell circuit interact to shape correlations and encoded information across the cell population, and asses the possible roles of recurrent coupling in modulating this process.  These circuit features are the basis of correlated activity in many retinal pathways, and in circuits throughout the brain.  Thus, our findings will guide studies of collective neural computation and dynamics currently under intense study in a variety of domains. <br/><br/>The brain translates the sensory environment into its own code, that of neural spikes distributed across vast numbers of neurons.  Neuroscience seeks to understand the nature of this code -- what aspects of the spiking activity carry what information, how it is implemented by the cellular hardware of the brain, and how this process can fail in disease.  A key puzzle is deciphering what it means when many neurons spike simultaneously -- is this just inevitable statistical coincidence, an artifact of neural hardware, or a key symbol in the code?  The investigators take a direct approach to answering this question in the earliest stage of the visual pathway, the retina.  Here, the team rigorously combines experiment and theory to connect biological circuit mechanisms and coding, and to identify principles that could be tested in other brain areas.  Matching the interdisciplinary demands of this endeavor, investigators from Applied Mathematics and Physiology and Biophysics will unite, and will mentor a small team of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers with diverse backgrounds including both mathematics and biology. They will share their results with peers through an open, user-friendly database, and their most exciting findings with students in the interdisciplinary courses that they teach."

How does the epidermal system robustly obtain its desirable spatial pattern while satisfying many biological constraints? The investigators use a systems biology approach integrating modeling and experimentation to study these questions. In addition to identifying new critical regulatory circuits and determining their specific functions in the developing epidermis, the research team characterizes and searches for generic principles on capabilities, limitations, and tradeoffs of different regulatory circuits and modules for proliferation, differentiation, and spatial organization during development.

We record a cell's electrical activity and use features of this to calibrate a mathematical model. This calibration is done with the aid of a graphics processing unit (GPU) for fast optimization of a fitness function that compares features of the model voltage trace to those of the experimental recording. Once calibrated, the model is used to make predictions about the effects of changes in biological parameters, such as the conductances of various types of ionic currents. These predictions are then tested on the same cell that was used to calibrate the model, using the dynamic clamp technique to inject a model-based ionic current into a real cell. To help with our understanding of the model, and thus to make more useful predictions, we use geometric singular perturbation methods to understand the basis for spiking and bursting patterns of electrical activity, and the parameter ranges where different types of activity occur.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of mathematical models for biological systems is to generate hypotheses that can be tested in the lab.  If the model is well calibrated, then testing a prediction made by the model is the best way to determine if our understanding of the biology that is reflected in the model is correct. In particular, if a test of a model prediction fails, then it means that something is wrong with our understanding of the biology that was the basis for the model. However, this is only true if the model is well calibrated, since a model that is correct in its formulation, but incorrect in its parameterization, can lead to incorrect predictions. This caveat is particularly important given the great degree of cell-to-cell heterogeneity that exists in many biological systems. For example, a cell may exhibit one type of pattern of activity, while a neighboring cell of the same type may exhibit a very different pattern of activity, reflecting differences in biological parameter values. In this project, we combine fast model calibration with the dynamic clamp technique to calibrate a model based on a single cell's activity, and then test predictions made by the model on the same cell, overcoming problems associated with cellular heterogeneity."

Revolutionary opportunities have emerged for mathematically driven advances in biological research. Experimental exploration of self-organizing biomolecular systems, such as HIV viruses, molecular motors and proteins in Alzheimer's disease, has been a dominating driven force in scientific discovery and innovation in the past few decades.  However, the emergence of complexity in self-organizing biological systems poses fundamental challenges to their quantitative description because of the excessively high dimensionality.  This Focused Research Group (FRG) will provide a platform, led by leading researchers from Michigan State University, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Pennsylvania State University, who will synergistically merge their expertise in theoretical modeling, scientific computing and mathematical analysis, for quantitative descriptions of biomolecular systems.   The research addresses grand challenges in the structure, function and dynamics of self-organizing biomolecular systems due to exceptionally massive data sets. These challenges are tackled through the introduction of new variational multiscale models, which reduces the dimensionality and number of degrees of freedom by a macroscopic continuum description of the aquatic/membrane environment, and a microscopic discrete description of biomolecules. Additionally, to further reduce the dimensionality of excessively large biomolecular systems, the investigators introduce a coarse-grained approach based on the density cluster dynamics which extracts stable manifolds in molecular dynamics simulations. This FRG project offers innovative new approaches to the massive data management, dimensionality reduction, computer simulation, theoretical modeling and mathematical analysis of biomolecular systems.<br/><br/>This project is a timely effort to promote the quantitative transition of biological science, which will lead to emerging new fields in both mathematical and biological sciences. In particular, the proposed effort will significantly strengthen the leading role that the U.S. researchers can play in mathematical molecular biosciences by aggressively pursuing cutting-edge research and collaboratively training a new generation of mathematicians in this emerging interdisciplinary field.  Three annual workshops and international meeting will be held in Michigan State (Year 1), Wisconsin (Year 2) and Penn State (Year 3) to strengthen the collaboration and extend the societal impact."

Several recent datasets demonstrate that CTL attack can occur simultaneously at multiple epitopes, and that HIV escapes such attack through multiple mutation pathways that lead to rapid selective sweeps of mutant variants. However, HIV escape dynamics from CTL attack and the effect of such attack on HIV genetic diversity are not well understood. Current models of HIV escape from CTL attack typically involve deterministic dynamical systems that model CTL selection but not HIV mutation. In a different context, HIV genetic diversity is often explored through phylogeny construction using evolutionary models that include mutation but not CTL mediated selection. This project bridges these two approaches by developing stochastic birth-death models that include both CTL attack and HIV mutation. Using such models as a basis, this project involves construction of mathematical and computational tools through which the effect of CTL attack on HIV genetic diversity can be explored. Further, novel statistical methods and algorithms will be developed to infer HIV escape dynamics under multi-epitope CTL attack by exploiting both population dynamics and genetic sequence data.<br/><br/>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are immune system cells thought to play a central role in controlling HIV infection. CTLs kill cells infected by HIV, but HIV escapes this attack through mutation. HIV escape from CTL attack is complex as CTLs mount many simultaneous attacks while the HIV population escapes through many different mutations. Currently we do not have a quantitative understanding of HIV escape from CTL attack, especially in the context of multiple, simultaneous CTL attacks. One reason for this is that current mathematical and statistical techniques typically fully model either CTL attack or HIV mutation, not both. This project will develop mathematical, statistical, and computational tools for understanding HIV escape by bridging existing approaches that consider CTL attack with those that consider HIV mutation. Using these newly developed tools, HIV escape will be quantitatively explored through data-based inference and theoretical analysis. A quantitative description of HIV escape from CTL attack is useful in understanding the role of the immune system in controlling HIV infection and, potentially, in designing vaccines. Further, lessons learned from HIV may be transferred to the numerous other viruses exposed to CTL attack.<br/>"

The lipid bilayer is the main structural component of the elastic biological membranes that consist of different lipid species, and contain many kinds of proteins, and many other molecules such as cholesterols and surfactants. In addition, the biomembranes are asymmetric double leaflets coupled to a cytoskeleton that is crucial for cellular adaptation of different shapes and motility.  It is now known that lipid composition may set limits to the possible shapes and deformations, while the actual shape of the cellular membrane depends on both the force (from the cytoskeleton, for example) and membrane-deforming proteins. Much progress has been made to uncover and decipher the mechanisms by which proteins can sense and/or induce membrane curvature. However, recent experiments have shown that interaction between lipid membranes and amphipathic molecules, such as surfactant and amphipathic peptides, also leads to changes in total membrane area, curvature and rigidity. No mathematical modeling of these effects have yet been obtained to help elucidate the asymmetry in the lipid bilayer due to surfactants and proteins, or how cells may utilize these mechanisms to perform diverse biological functions. This project aims to establish mathematical understanding of the roles of surfactants and proteins in causing the asymmetries in lipid double leaflets and their subsequent shape and dynamics. The particular focuses are on (1) surfactant-induced membrane area regulation and shape change, and (2) effects of transport, assembly, and organization of trans-membrane proteins on membrane shape and dynamics. In addition, the experiments (by Stone) will validate and refine the modeling approach (by Young), which will in turn facilitate the numerical simulation (by Veerapaneni) of the elastic lipid bilayer interacting with surfactant and protein. Results will help uncover the complex organization and interplay between proteins and lipid domains in cellular membranes.  <br/><br/>The theme of this project is the development and analysis of mathematical models of the interaction between lipid membranes and surfactant or protein over large spatial (microns) and long time (seconds to minutes) scales, which is difficult to achieve using state-of-the-art coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative comparison between experiments, mathematical modeling, and numerical simulations will be conducted. Broader impacts of the research include the development of new mathematical models, numerical methods and complementary analysis and experiments that will be of benefit to scientists and engineers studying rafts dynamics as well as emerging applications in drug delivery, cellular adhesion, motility and mechanosensing. The concepts and methods described here go beyond the context of moving boundary dynamics mediated by an active species, and extend to other problems featuring reaction-diffusion of chemicals.  The approach has the potential to be adapted to more complicated biological membranes that are similar from a mathematical point of view.

These communities are ubiquitous from the laboratory to the ocean, and the objective of this research is to advance understanding of microbial flocculation, the process whereby proliferating clusters of organisms in suspension fragment and aggregate. Specifically, the researchers use semigroup, fractal, partial differential equation, and computational analysis to advance the theory and applications for a novel class of structured population models. The close coupling between the model development, analysis, and experimental validation allows insight into the biomechanical and metabolic adaptations of this globally pervasive and fundamental state of microbial existence.  The investigator and his colleagues are guided by three motivating questions:  1) what are the dominant mechanisms driving floc fragmentation?   2) How does floc structure variability impact population proliferation?  and   3) Why do some floc population distributions converge to self-similarity and others decay to mono-dispersion? Insight into the dominant microscale mechanisms could dramatically change both modeling and consequently control of microbial populations.<br/><br/>Micro-organisms suspended in a fluid often do not live as single cells - by collision and separation they combine and recombine in a process called flocculation. These microbial communities exist everywhere from the laboratory to the ocean and the tendency to flocculate has a surprising impact on human life. For example, industrial biotechnologies based on cell cultures (e.g., in the manufacturer of proteins as drugs) rely heavily on predictions of the physical properties of microbial communities. Bacterial clusters are used in municipal sewage treatment plants across the country as an environmentally sustainable part of cleaning human and industrial wastewater. Moreover, bacterial and algal communities in a fluid are an essential part of the bioplastic, biofuel, and biogas industries.  In natural settings, the flocculation properties of algae play an important role in algal blooms (and thus in the resultant negative economic and health impacts). The investigator and his colleagues develop and study mathematical models of flocculation and perform experiments to validate predictions of the distribution of cluster sizes and growth rates. This project aims to transform scientific understanding of microbial flocculation from one based upon simplified, idealized models of clusters to one based on microscale mechanistic and metabolic first principles. Advances in our understanding of the population behavior of these microbial aggregates could lead to dramatic improvements in such diverse societal challenges as biofuel production efficiency, sustainable means of handling wastewater, and management of oceanic algal blooms.<br/>"

Such spatial spread is important in a variety of ecological contexts, such as when non-native species invade new habitat and when species shift their spatial distributions in response to global change processes. Meeting these challenges requires population models that capture essential aspects of the dynamics of spatially spreading species, including demography and dispersal. Integro-difference equations will be used to describe the spread of populations with separate growth and dispersal stages wherein vital rates and dispersal abilities are determined by age, size, or developmental stage. Semi-discrete models (hybrid dynamical systems) involving reaction-diffusion equations and integro-differential equations will be employed to study the spread of populations in which different processes or different rates occur inside versus outside a species' reproductive period. Models with Allee effects will be developed for plant populations with pollination limitation, and for two-sex populations with reproductive asynchrony and imperfect mate-finding. Data from two well-studied field systems matching the structure of specific models will be used to parametrize key model components. The investigators will examine the existence of spreading speeds and traveling waves for the models, provide formulas for spreading speeds and traveling wave speeds, and calculate the sensitivity and elasticity of the speeds to changes in demographic and dispersal parameters. Methods from differential equations, integral equations, and dynamical systems will be used to investigate the spatial dynamics for the models. The outcomes of this research will also have broader impacts in other scientific disciplines where wave propagation is addressed. New rigorous mathematics will be integrated with extensive field and laboratory data to bridge the gulf between abstract mathematical results and ecological observations. To further broaden the impacts of this research, the investigators will also develop a MathBench module (.umd.edu) relating to ecological invasion dynamics. This module will feed into the larger, NSF-funded MathBench Initiative, which is designed to improve the quantitative literacy of undergraduate biology students and give them a deeper appreciation of the role of mathematics in understanding biological problems.<br/> <br/>Through new research at the interface of mathematics and biology, this project will contribute to the growing body of information on the spatial spread of species. Research on the dynamics of species spatial spread is essential to understanding when and where resource managers can act to limit the spread and impacts of non-native, invasive species. Likewise, better understanding of the dynamics of spatial spread is essential for forecasting species responses to global change processes. In this project the investigators will develop and analyze mathematical models incorporating species birth, growth, death, and movement to identify points in species? life-cycles that are critical to the rates of population spatial spread. Models for plant species limited by pollen supply and for populations featuring imperfect mate finding will be explored, with a focus on understanding the effects that particular population processes have on the rate and nature of species spatial spread. By focusing on two ecological case-studies in addition to novel mathematics, this project will help to point out specific targets and opportunities for natural resources management."

Due to these new data, it became possible to understand how different levels of organization (scales) of living beings interact. This new science is called systems biology. From the very outset, systems biology has been more mathematically inclined than traditional disciplines of biology. In particular, it is attempting to understand the role randomness (or stochasticity) plays in functioning of living beings. For example, how is it possible that individual biological cells respond in very different ways to environmental stimuli, whereas the organism as a whole is capable of mounting a coherent response? Answers to this and other related questions are the subject of the conference.<br/><br/>"

These include the role of focal adhesions, the spatio-temporal organization of actin flow, the response of the leading-edge membrane to actin polymerization and conversely the role of myosin minifilaments in creating contractile stress at the rear.  It is now an opportune time to combine this knowledge into a mathematical model which can treat the morphodynamics of the whole cell, and correlate motion with both mechanical data (such as traction-force measurements) and sub-cellular signaling information (such as localization data for specific molecular players.)  This proposal aims at constructing and validating such a model for endothelial cells.  From the mathematics side, the novel element includes embedding all of the aforementioned processes into a moving cell geometry, enabled by the phase-field approach; the latter has shown its relevance in many moving boundary problems in fields ranging from solidification to multiphase fluid flow.  Experimental data will be obtained by utilizing state-of-the-art microfluidic devices so as to provide controlled cell environments and will include the measurement of spatial patterns of signaling molecules (location and activation) as well as forces. Model predictions will be tested in a number of different cell lines and in cells subject to a variety of pharamacological treatments.<br/><br/>Obtaining a quantitative understanding of cell motility is of importance for many critical biomedical systems, ranging from cancer metastases to inflammatory response to pathogens.  Biophysical tools have reached the point where one can obtain high-quality data about various parts of the motility mechanism; for example, we can measure the forces exerted by the cell on the substrate on which it moves.  At the same time, advances in computational modeling have shown how to tackle complex problems involving fluid flow and chemical reactions taking place inside a moving domain.  Our proposal aims at combining these two capabilities, experimental biophysics and computational modeling to create a quantitative approach to the motion of a specific type of mammalian cell.  Once successful, our methodology could be extended to other cell types and to cells moving in more complicated spaces.  The eventual payoff would be both an increased fundamental understanding and an increased capability of affecting cell motility, perhaps to prevent cells from a primary tumor from establishing secondary colonies in target tissues.<br/><br/>The proposal was submitted in response to the Joint DMS/NIGMS Initiative to Support Research at the Interface of the Biological and Mathematical Sciences.

The lipid bilayer is the main structural component of the elastic biological membranes that consist of different lipid species, and contain many kinds of proteins, and many other molecules such as cholesterols and surfactants. In addition, the biomembranes are asymmetric double leaflets coupled to a cytoskeleton that is crucial for cellular adaptation of different shapes and motility.  It is now known that lipid composition may set limits to the possible shapes and deformations, while the actual shape of the cellular membrane depends on both the force (from the cytoskeleton, for example) and membrane-deforming proteins. Much progress has been made to uncover and decipher the mechanisms by which proteins can sense and/or induce membrane curvature. However, recent experiments have shown that interaction between lipid membranes and amphipathic molecules, such as surfactant and amphipathic peptides, also leads to changes in total membrane area, curvature and rigidity. No mathematical modeling of these effects have yet been obtained to help elucidate the asymmetry in the lipid bilayer due to surfactants and proteins, or how cells may utilize these mechanisms to perform diverse biological functions. This project aims to establish mathematical understanding of the roles of surfactants and proteins in causing the asymmetries in lipid double leaflets and their subsequent shape and dynamics. The particular focuses are on (1) surfactant-induced membrane area regulation and shape change, and (2) effects of transport, assembly, and organization of trans-membrane proteins on membrane shape and dynamics. In addition, the experiments (by Stone) will validate and refine the modeling approach (by Young), which will in turn facilitate the numerical simulation (by Veerapaneni) of the elastic lipid bilayer interacting with surfactant and protein. Results will help uncover the complex organization and interplay between proteins and lipid domains in cellular membranes.  <br/><br/>The theme of this project is the development and analysis of mathematical models of the interaction between lipid membranes and surfactant or protein over large spatial (microns) and long time (seconds to minutes) scales, which is difficult to achieve using state-of-the-art coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative comparison between experiments, mathematical modeling, and numerical simulations will be conducted. Broader impacts of the research include the development of new mathematical models, numerical methods and complementary analysis and experiments that will be of benefit to scientists and engineers studying rafts dynamics as well as emerging applications in drug delivery, cellular adhesion, motility and mechanosensing. The concepts and methods described here go beyond the context of moving boundary dynamics mediated by an active species, and extend to other problems featuring reaction-diffusion of chemicals.  The approach has the potential to be adapted to more complicated biological membranes that are similar from a mathematical point of view. The students involved in this project will receive valuable interdisciplinary training in a wide range of mathematics, biophysics and computer science."

Although the details of the biology of these processes are vastly different, a common theme is that each involves a complex viscoelastic material mixture whose behavior is determined by the dynamic interplay of mechanics, flow, physical structure, and chemistry.  The mathematical description of these processes requires equations describing multiphase flow, the evolution of composition, structure and chemistry, and the relationship between stresses and composition/structure.  The solution and analysis of sophisticated models that combine these elements will pose substantial mathematical and computational challenges.  To meet these challenges, the investigators will develop and apply advanced numerical algorithms to gain fundamental insights into the mechanisms of function of these important physiological processes.  This work will lead to novel and important advances in understanding the essential role of the mechanics and dynamics of complex materials in the function of biological systems.  This, in turn, will support improved diagnosis and treatment of a range of serious medical disorders including coronary artery disease, cancer, and metabolic disease.  The work will also lead to better understanding of complex materials in general and contribute to the design of novel new materials for meeting pressing technological challenges.  Furthermore, the design of new computational algorithms will lead to new capabilities in the use of high-performance computing in science and engineering.  The highly interdisciplinary nature of the project will provide many opportunities for training young scientists in the new multi-disciplinary approach to science.<br/><br/>Many important physiological processes involve interactions between materials of different types (for example, water and cells or water and polymer gels) and which move relative to one another.  The physical interactions between the materials can be strongly influenced by chemical reactions, and the chemical reactions in turn are influenced by the materials' motion and other interactions.  Better insight into how such complex systems work and are regulated is critical to understanding these important processes and how they can be manipulated to improve human health.  Because these processes are governed by physical and chemical principles and properties, and because these principles and properties can be expressed mathematically, mathematical tools can be brought to bear on these problems. Through mathematical analysis and computational simulations, new insights into the materials' behavior can be developed and a wealth of data can be obtained that complements the data obtainable from traditional laboratory experiments.  Hence the combination of mathematical and experimental investigators brought together in this project is expected to lead to significant new insights in important physiological and pathological situations including blood clotting, metabolism, and cancer metastasis.  Further the mathematics and computational tools developed in the project will impact the development of non-biological complex materials to meet pressing technological challenges."

In particular, it is clear that the intrinsic interactions between neuronal circuits in absence of inputs can have a strong impact on how the system responds to incoming stimuli even at the large scale cognitive level. Thus, nonlinear dynamics methods will be applied to problems in theoretical neuroscience dealing with this question. Various forms of spatiotemporal activity are observed in experiments which include spatially localized activity, oscillations, and propagating waves. Perturbation and numerical methods will be used to analyze the dynamics of these patterns when subjected to various stimuli such as spatially local short lasting perturbations, correlated broad-band inputs, and moving or oscillatory stimuli. One type of persistent activity observed both in behaving animals and in reduced experimental preparations is the cortical up-state. We will study a new model for this state in order to understand how it propagates across the cortex as well as its ability to induce spontaneous pattern formation. A new class of mean field models for spiking neural activity will be developed in order to study how perturbations affect large networks of coupled neurons.  <br/><br/>How we perceive the world is governed both by the sensory inputs with which we are constantly bombarded, by ongoing activity in the brain, and by our previous experience. This activity as well as the natural wiring of the nervous system shapes the spontaneous behavior of our brains and this spontaneous activity strongly modulates the sensory inputs.  Here we use computational and mathematical models of neurons (the cells that make up the brain) to understand what kinds of spontaneous behavior are possible, how this depends on the wiring and how this activity interacts with sensory inputs. The ongoing and evoked behavior is carefully controlled by a balance of positive (excitatory) and negative (inhibitory) influences. The loss of this balance can disrupt normal behavior and lead to diseases such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. Mathematical models of the nervous system provide a way to test hypotheses put forth by experimentalists and to also suggest new experiments based on the predictions of these models."

Due to the range and complexity of the potential effects of dispersal, mathematical modeling is essential to the understanding of these effects.  Movement and dispersal have long been recognized as crucial features of ecological systems.  They influence the persistence and interactions of populations and drive range expansions, biological invasions, and colonization of empty habitats.  More recently, as epidemiology has become increasingly understood through the lens of ecology, they have also come to occupy a central place in epidemiological modeling.  Consequently, understanding movement and dispersal is indispensable for effective decision-making on numerous significant policy issues related to ecology, epidemiology, and environmental science, such as the conservation of biodiversity as habitats are altered by environmental change, the evaluation of risks of biological invasions by exotic or genetically modified organisms, the impact of human movement on vector-borne diseases, the effect of global movement in communicable diseases, and the development of strategies for controlling pests and disease vectors.  The meeting brings together experts and young scientists to enhance the capacity of science to address these important questions."

However, current studies on the approach are mostly restricted to the water solvent, due to modeling and algorithmic complications that arise in the case of ionic solvents. The current ionic models that do exist fail to incorporate crucial nonlocal dielectric effects. Recent developments also indicate that entropic changes due to protein-ligand association are critical to understanding binding affinity. The computation of entropy, however, remains a very difficult task. Motivated by these challenges, this project aims to develop new nonlocal continuum electrostatic models and new numerical quadratures for the direct calculation of entropy and free energy for protein in ionic solvent. The new nonlocal models will be constructed from a novel combination of the nonlocal dielectric approach with the fundamental measure theory of hard-sphere mixture fluids under the constrained functional optimization protocol. They are expected to significantly improve the accuracy of electrostatic potential calculations in comparison to the classic Poisson-Boltzmann equation, since they reflect both ionic size effects and polarization correlations among water molecules. The new numerical quadratures will be developed by using a special prismatic element interpolation constructed from a prismatic mesh of a bounded state region near a potential energy minimum point. The computing complexity will be further reduced through using a new nonlocal model for computing involved electrostatic potential. Lastly, new fast numerical algorithms and program packages will be developed for solving the new dielectric models and for implementing the new numerical quadratures.  <br/><br/>Calculation of electrostatic potential energy, entropy, and free energy for protein in ionic solvent is a fundamental task in biomolecular simulations. The new nonlocal dielectric models, numerical quadratures for computing entropy and free energy, and the accompanying efficient numerical algorithms and program packages produced from this project will be a considerable contribution to the fields of mathematical biology, computational biochemistry, computational mathematics, and computer science. They will play important roles in ion channel studies, rational drug design, and other bioengineering applications, and will improve our quantitative understanding of critical physiological processes, cellular energetics, and affinity in protein-ligand binding, and of health and disease in general.  The findings from this project are expected to have a significant impact on the development of mathematics, computer science, biochemistry, and bioengineering.  Because there has been substantial interest recently in algorithms for solving high-dimensional problems, any advances made in this project will have broad potential impact in a variety of areas that are related to high-dimensional integrals with integrands that decay exponentially."

Genomes of admixed individuals can be modeled as mosaics of chromosomal tracts that originate from a finite number of ancestors and populations.  Current models of admixture are limited by simplifying assumptions regarding the amount, duration, or direction of the admixture process and fail to accurately predict patterns of genetic variation observed in real data.  To redress this issue, the investigators propose a family of higher order Markovian models and coalescent approaches that provide much greater flexibility.   AIM 2: To develop statistical inference tools for estimating historical admixture.  This project will improve upon existing methods for robustly inferring the population of origin of chromosomal segments in admixed genomes. Given the distribution of ''admixture tracts'', one then wishes to model the recent demographic history of the population.  The investigators will use the results of Aims 1 and 2 along with a growing database in the investigator's lab on genomic variation in the Americas to provide detailed models of admixture that can empower medical and association studies in the Americas.  AIM 3: To develop a Linkage/Admixture Map of Hispanic/Latino populations.  Recently, it was shown that motifs associated with population specific alleles at the PRDM9 locus account for a significant fraction of recombination rate variation among populations.  The investigators propose analyzing data from more than 20,000 genetically and ethnically diverse U.S. participants across at least 2.5 million markers to identify population-specific recombination hotspots and their relationship with ancestry.  Specifically, the investigators aim to identify Native-American specific recombination hotspots and produce the highest-resolution recombination map of the human genome to date.<br/><br/>Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have dramatically increased the scientific community's understanding of the genetic basis of complex disease by identifying thousands of genetic variants associated with chronic diseases including Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and many cancers.   A key limitation of existing studies is that they have focused largely on participants of European descent and some of these genotype/phenotype associations do not readily translate from one ethnic group to another.  Furthermore, since the next generation of studies will focus largely on querying rare genetic variants (i.e., <5% frequency) for association, this ''transferability problem'' is likely to get worse and risks perpetuating or even widening existing health disparity among ethnic groups in the U.S.   Broadening representation in medical genomics studies is a key mechanism for redressing these biases.  Critical to enabling trans- and multi-ethnic medical genetic studies is a rigorous understanding of how 500 years of admixture among diverse European, African, and indigenous American source populations have shaped the genomes of African-American, Hispanic/Latinos, and Native Americans today.  A key outcome of this research will be user-friendly software that implements a comprehensive, probabilistic, and flexible family of methods for inferring genetic ancestry. The investigators will train undergraduate, high school, community college, graduate, and post-doctoral students including many from underrepresented minority groups.  Project results will be disseminated to the public through the San Jose Tech Museum and participation in conferences aimed at minority groups including SACNAS and the National Urban League.  Partnerships with key industry leaders will allow us to reach potentially millions of participants."

Synchrony among populations has a serious implication for conservation biology.

Synchrony results from migration among populations and from environmental variation that affects multiple populations. The relative importance of these two mechanisms remains unknown.  The current statistical methods of analyzing synchrony have shortcomings.  The degree of synchrony between two population time series is usually measured by a single number, such as a correlation coefficient. However, the strength of synchrony between two time series can vary with the time scale on which it is examined, that is, synchrony may have frequency-specific components. To increase our understanding of metapopulation synchrony, this project will (1) analyze data from large spatio-temporal ecological databases, (2) develop new theory and statistical methods, and (3) conduct new laboratory experiments. The implications for climate change, extinction risks, and the mechanisms that drive synchrony (migration and environmental variation) will be assessed. Long spatially-extensive time series of environmental variables and population numbers will be analyzed to characterize the frequency-specific nature of synchrony.  Analytical and numerical analyses of mathematical models will develop theoretical expectations for how frequency-specific environmental synchrony affects population synchrony and probabilities of metapopulation extinction.  Experiments with laboratory populations of flour beetles will extend earlier studies in several ways.  First, the investigators take a time-scale-specific perspective on both environmental and population synchrony. Second, they examine both equilibrium and chaotic populations.  Previous theoretical work has show that these two dynamics respond differently to synchronizing processes.  Third, their experiments will involve two sibling species of insects whose population dynamics are controlled by different density-dependent mechanisms: cannibalism of immature life stages and delay of metamorphosis.  The former leads to rapid responses to perturbations and increases the tendency for demographic cycles whereas the latter leads to slow responses to perturbations and non-cyclic dynamics.  The use of both species will allow an evaluation of the generality of the experimental results. This multidisciplinary approach will enhance our understanding of ecological synchrony and its relevance to society.<br/><br/>This project will have important practical implications for the effects of global climate change on species extinction and will lead to more sophisticated methods for conserving threatened or endangered species whose populations have become fragmented.  The research will capitalize on existing ecological databases and will generate and disseminate high quality laboratory data that can be used to further our understanding of the interactions among environmental variation, dispersal, and population dynamics.  The mathematical and statistical tools developed will extend the traditional methods for examining synchrony to consider different time scales and will be applicable to data from other fields.  The project will also contribute to the interdisciplinary education of undergraduates and graduate students, including underrepresented groups, and will create and distribute instructional materials to facilitate the use of the flour beetle system for training in quantitative ecology at the undergraduate and graduate levels."

This project has three primary aims. The first extends development of a new method for constructing hierarchical trees from sequence data using maximum likelihood and modal inference. The tree construction is based upon application of either one of these two inference methods to an ancestral mixture model, a model whose parameters describe the population structure at each fixed time point T in the past.  If one estimates this structure over a fine grid of time points T, the relationship between the estimates over time can be graphically described as a hierarchical tree. The second project aim is to enhance the biological realism of the ancestral mixture model to include (a) multi-state characters, (b) advanced models of sequence evolution, and (c) recombination. The extensions are based on using diffusion kernels constructed from continuous time Markov Chains. Empirical Bayes methods are also proposed to be employed to improve overall estimation precision. The third aim is development of a new method for reconstructing haplotype sequences from genotype data without knowing the parental information. The methods and algorithms are based on the ancestral mixture models together with a multi-moment approach that simplifies computation. In addition, the investigators propose to extend the method to long sequences by sliding a window along longer genotype sequences, then using the information from the overlapping estimates to construct longer haplotype estimates.<br/><br/>The current release of the National Center for Biotechnology Information's(NCBI) database dbSNP contains over 11.5 million human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) records, representing a 10-fold increase over the last 4 years. Analysis of such data has become a focus of much research within bioinformatics and computational biology because it is the SNPs that carry the information that distinguishes the individuals within a species. Encoded in this data is important information about the relationship between the characteristics of an individual and their genetic code. The investigators are developing methods and models for this data that are fundamentally different in approach from the standard techniques currently used in two areas where SNP data is used, coalescent and phylogenetic inference, in which one reconstructs genetic relationships similar to family trees based on the current ancestors only. The broader impacts of this project include the development of methods and models with potential wide ranging uses across broad scientific disciplines, the increased fusion of biological and mathematical innovation, and opportunities for broad interdisciplinary training of diverse students.<br/><br/>"

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide and yet its pathogenesis and treatment are not fully understood.  Glaucoma is primarily associated with elevated intraocular pressure and is treated with interventions that lower this pressure.  Paradoxically, it has been observed that many people develop glaucoma despite relatively low intraocular pressure and that many people never develop glaucoma despite elevated intraocular pressure.  A link between impaired ocular circulation and glaucoma has been identified and helps to explain this paradox.  It is unclear, however, if alterations in blood flow are a cause or effect of the retinal cell death associated with glaucoma.  Therefore, the objective of this study is to use a mathematical model of ocular blood flow regulation and tissue perfusion and oxygenation to determine whether hemodynamic alterations are primary or secondary to glaucomatous damage. Specifically, the effects of impaired vascular regulation mechanisms and elevated intraocular pressure on blood flow will be compared using model simulations.  These effects will be related to model predictions of tissue oxygenation in order to understand whether impaired ocular circulation causes cell death or if cell death is the cause of impaired circulation.<br/><br/>The results of this study will aid the interpretation of clinical measurements of eye structure and blood flow and provide insight for new treatment strategies for glaucoma.  The non-standard techniques required to obtain model solutions are active areas of research in mathematics, and thus this project will provide significant contributions to both medical and mathematical fields.  Moreover, conducting studies in the eye is of particular importance because it is the only environment in the human body where blood flow and systemic vascular features can be observed and measured easily and non-invasively down to a very small level (capillary vessels).  These measurements identify risk indicators not only of glaucoma but also of many systemic diseases currently diminishing the quality of human life, including diabetes, hypertension and atherosclerosis.  By combining theoretical interpretations and descriptions of underlying principles of human physiology with experimental and clinical measurements, this study has a unique potential to impact the knowledge and treatment of multiple diseases.<br/>"

The lipid bilayer is the main structural component of the elastic biological membranes that consist of different lipid species, and contain many kinds of proteins, and many other molecules such as cholesterols and surfactants. In addition, the biomembranes are asymmetric double leaflets coupled to a cytoskeleton that is crucial for cellular adaptation of different shapes and motility.  It is now known that lipid composition may set limits to the possible shapes and deformations, while the actual shape of the cellular membrane depends on both the force (from the cytoskeleton, for example) and membrane-deforming proteins. Much progress has been made to uncover and decipher the mechanisms by which proteins can sense and/or induce membrane curvature. However, recent experiments have shown that interaction between lipid membranes and amphipathic molecules, such as surfactant and amphipathic peptides, also leads to changes in total membrane area, curvature and rigidity. No mathematical modeling of these effects have yet been obtained to help elucidate the asymmetry in the lipid bilayer due to surfactants and proteins, or how cells may utilize these mechanisms to perform diverse biological functions. This project aims to establish mathematical understanding of the roles of surfactants and proteins in causing the asymmetries in lipid double leaflets and their subsequent shape and dynamics. The particular focuses are on (1) surfactant-induced membrane area regulation and shape change, and (2) effects of transport, assembly, and organization of trans-membrane proteins on membrane shape and dynamics. In addition, the experiments (by Stone) will validate and refine the modeling approach (by Young), which will in turn facilitate the numerical simulation (by Veerapaneni) of the elastic lipid bilayer interacting with surfactant and protein. Results will help uncover the complex organization and interplay between proteins and lipid domains in cellular membranes.  <br/><br/>The theme of this project is the development and analysis of mathematical models of the interaction between lipid membranes and surfactant or protein over large spatial (microns) and long time (seconds to minutes) scales, which is difficult to achieve using state-of-the-art coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative comparison between experiments, mathematical modeling, and numerical simulations will be conducted. Broader impacts of the research include the development of new mathematical models, numerical methods and complementary analysis and experiments that will be of benefit to scientists and engineers studying rafts dynamics as well as emerging applications in drug delivery, cellular adhesion, motility and mechanosensing. The concepts and methods described here go beyond the context of moving boundary dynamics mediated by an active species, and extend to other problems featuring reaction-diffusion of chemicals.  The approach has the potential to be adapted to more complicated biological membranes that are similar from a mathematical point of view. The students involved in this project will receive valuable interdisciplinary training in a wide range of mathematics, biophysics and computer science."

Particularly, software employs a discretized Gamma distribution and important statistical properties of that model, such as model identifiability and how many rate classes can be or need to be used, are unknown.  We propose to determine the statistical properties of such models. Moreover, even the most sophisticated models fail to mimic many real data sets analyzed in phylogenetics: for instance, while the general time reversible model allows for arbitrary base frequencies, it requires that all the species under study have the same base frequencies as each other. The natural non-parametric alternative is the method of maximum parsimony which suffers from the phenomenon of long branch attraction: when data are generated under some model of genetic evolution on certain types of trees and then analyzed under parsimony methods, parsimony methods return an incorrect tree with some probability that does not  tend to zero as the amount of data increases to infinity. Thus, it is often said that the method of maximum parsimony is not a consistent statistical method for phylogeny reconstruction. However, this criticism has the potential of applying to all phylogenetic reconstruction methods, including model-based methods, when the data are not generated under the model used to analyze them. We propose to determine the model conditions under which the natural non-parametric alternative, parsimony, is a consistent method for phylogenetic estimation. The goal of both projects is to provide solid mathematical foundation for phylogenetic reconstruction methods.<br/><br/>Phylogenies are trees describing the evolutionary relationships of species. Having an accurate description of these relationships can help researchers discover the genetic basis of human diseases and the reasons for varying pathogenicity of viruses and bacteria. This project aims to understand the mathematical properties of the statistical methods used to infer phylogenies from genetic data. These mathematical properties tell which methods are most appropriate for use on specific kinds of data and whether a method can be useful at all on any data. This information, in turn, will lead to more accurate phylogenies."

Such spatial spread is important in a variety of ecological contexts, such as when non-native species invade new habitat and when species shift their spatial distributions in response to global change processes. Meeting these challenges requires population models that capture essential aspects of the dynamics of spatially spreading species, including demography and dispersal. Integro-difference equations will be used to describe the spread of populations with separate growth and dispersal stages wherein vital rates and dispersal abilities are determined by age, size, or developmental stage. Semi-discrete models (hybrid dynamical systems) involving reaction-diffusion equations and integro-differential equations will be employed to study the spread of populations in which different processes or different rates occur inside versus outside a species' reproductive period. Models with Allee effects will be developed for plant populations with pollination limitation, and for two-sex populations with reproductive asynchrony and imperfect mate-finding. Data from two well-studied field systems matching the structure of specific models will be used to parametrize key model components. The investigators will examine the existence of spreading speeds and traveling waves for the models, provide formulas for spreading speeds and traveling wave speeds, and calculate the sensitivity and elasticity of the speeds to changes in demographic and dispersal parameters. Methods from differential equations, integral equations, and dynamical systems will be used to investigate the spatial dynamics for the models. The outcomes of this research will also have broader impacts in other scientific disciplines where wave propagation is addressed. New rigorous mathematics will be integrated with extensive field and laboratory data to bridge the gulf between abstract mathematical results and ecological observations. To further broaden the impacts of this research, the investigators will also develop a MathBench module (.umd.edu) relating to ecological invasion dynamics. This module will feed into the larger, NSF-funded MathBench Initiative, which is designed to improve the quantitative literacy of undergraduate biology students and give them a deeper appreciation of the role of mathematics in understanding biological problems.<br/> <br/>Through new research at the interface of mathematics and biology, this project will contribute to the growing body of information on the spatial spread of species.

Likewise, better understanding of the dynamics of spatial spread is essential for forecasting species responses to global change processes. In this project the investigators will develop and analyze mathematical models incorporating species birth, growth, death, and movement to identify points in species? life-cycles that are critical to the rates of population spatial spread. Models for plant species limited by pollen supply and for populations featuring imperfect mate finding will be explored, with a focus on understanding the effects that particular population processes have on the rate and nature of species spatial spread.

However, current studies on the approach are mostly restricted to the water solvent, due to modeling and algorithmic complications that arise in the case of ionic solvents. The current ionic models that do exist fail to incorporate crucial nonlocal dielectric effects. Recent developments also indicate that entropic changes due to protein-ligand association are critical to understanding binding affinity. The computation of entropy, however, remains a very difficult task. Motivated by these challenges, this project aims to develop new nonlocal continuum electrostatic models and new numerical quadratures for the direct calculation of entropy and free energy for protein in ionic solvent. The new nonlocal models will be constructed from a novel combination of the nonlocal dielectric approach with the fundamental measure theory of hard-sphere mixture fluids under the constrained functional optimization protocol. They are expected to significantly improve the accuracy of electrostatic potential calculations in comparison to the classic Poisson-Boltzmann equation, since they reflect both ionic size effects and polarization correlations among water molecules. The new numerical quadratures will be developed by using a special prismatic element interpolation constructed from a prismatic mesh of a bounded state region near a potential energy minimum point. The computing complexity will be further reduced through using a new nonlocal model for computing involved electrostatic potential. Lastly, new fast numerical algorithms and program packages will be developed for solving the new dielectric models and for implementing the new numerical quadratures.  <br/><br/>Calculation of electrostatic potential energy, entropy, and free energy for protein in ionic solvent is a fundamental task in biomolecular simulations.

In light of the wealth of experimental results now available on the genes and proteins controlling this process, the funded project will address the pressing need for accurate and predictive mathematical models that connect detailed molecular mechanisms with the observed properties of Caulobacter reproduction and differentiation. Two types of mathematical models will be considered. Deterministic models--based on systems of nonlinear partial differential equations--will be used to describe the average behavior of a population of Caulobacter cells, which is the type of data collected in many experimental protocols. Stochastic models--based on the reaction and diffusion of individual molecules within a single cell--will be used to describe the precise spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of specific proteins within cells, as measured by microscopic studies of fluorescently labeled proteins. This project will provide new ideas, methods, algorithms and software for spatiotemporal modeling of gene expression and protein dynamics in living cells. It will also provide training for two graduate students, a life scientist and a computer scientist, in modern methods of computational cell biology, mathematical modeling and spatial stochastic simulations.<br/><br/>The processes by which bacteria grow, divide and differentiate are of great importance to human welfare because we live in intimate relationships with many types of bacteria. Beneficial bacteria colonize our digestive tract, fix nitrogen for our crops, and produce valuable products in our bioreactors. Pathogenic bacteria cause diseases in us and in our crops and domestic animals. To gain control over both beneficial and pathogenic bacteria, we need to understand the molecular mechanisms governing bacterial reproduction and differentiation. Mathematical models are useful tools for exploring hypotheses about these mechanisms because they integrate a wealth of experimental evidence into a realistic and accurate computer representation of molecular interactions. Computer simulations then serve to test the hypotheses against known experimental facts in a comprehensive fashion and to predict the outcome of novel experimental studies. The cell division cycle of Caulobacter is a favorable case for testing the utility of mathematical modeling in molecular cell biology. In addition, because Caulobacter is closely related to both nitrogen-fixing and disease-causing bacteria and because its asymmetric mode of division is analogous to the reproduction and differentiation of human stem cells, the mathematical methods and biological results expected from this project may ultimately lead to practical developments in agriculture and medicine."

The major challenge is the lack of an appropriate modeling framework for gene family evolution. To address this challenge, the investigators develop a probabilistic model for gene family evolution that is able to describe the relationship between the history of a gene family and the history of species by taking into account the effects of different evolutionary mechanisms of gene retention (neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, dosage balance). The model involves two stochastic processes - a non-homogeneous birth and death process and a mutation process. The probability distribution of a gene family tree given the species tree is derived from a non-homogeneous birth and death process in which a hazard function is employed for modeling the loss rate associated with different evolutionary mechanisms. The probabilistic model provides a systematic way of handling the estimation error of gene family trees when analyzing gene family data and is thus able to more accurately estimate the gene duplication and loss events along the phylogeny of species.<br/><br/>Advanced biotechnologies provide a vast amount of genetic data for the studies on gene family evolution.

Electrophysiological experiments, in conjunction with conditioning trials, will be carried out to determine which features of the complex response are in fact relevant to the moth's adaptive encoding of its olfactory environment, and how these features are resculpted when the moth learns to appreciate a new odor. Specifically, we will direct experiments measuring (a) high-order dynamical structures associated with odor-response in the hawkmoth's antennal lobe and other synaptic centers including the lateral protocerebrum and mushroom bodies, and (b) the plasticity-induced shift in these structures following a conditioning paradigm. These experiments will facilitate development of both computational and theoretical models of neuronal networks. Specifically, we will develop (c) a large-scale spiking network model of the hawkmoth olfactory system which will be benchmarked using the experiments mentioned above, and (d) a theoretical framework capable of analyzing the rich dynamics found in these networks.<br/><br/>An abundance of recent experiments indicate that insects as well as other animals such as mammals, primates and humans, exhibit brain states that are incredibly rich, some directly induced by stimuli and some born from learning processes, all possessing dynamic properties on a variety of scales. The intricacies of these dynamic regimes are still a mystery. We currently do not know what these brain states are capable of, nor how they are used to drive decision making or learning. The hawkmoth -- ""Manduca sexta"" -- has a brain which is considerably simpler than a human's, but nevertheless has an olfactory system not too dissimilar from our own. By investigating the link between neuronal network dynamics, behavior and learning within this animal, we will draw conclusions relevant to some of our basic cognitive functions."

Specifically, we address the problem of integration and analysis of multiple sources of high dimensional biological data with network structure. It is a well documented fact that correlation between different molecular compartments is relatively low, while the information derived from a single compartment is often highly noisy or even incomplete. Hence, there is a need to develop advanced models and techniques for integrating multiple data sets from diverse Omics platforms, while taking explicitly into consideration the available information of interactions within and between compartments. Particular emphasis is placed on pathway analysis and enrichment due to their role in complex diseases onset and progression. The following directions will be pursued: (1) Development of network based methods that integrate data from multiple Omics platforms for pathway analysis and enrichment. (2) Development of fast computational algorithms for estimating large scale network based integrative models. Investigation of associated inference problems and study of properties of proposed estimators together with their robustness to the noise levels of the network information employed. (3) Introduction of novel hypergraph models for assessing differential activity of pathways that utilize different degrees of information about the structure and accuracy of the underlying network.

The enhanced scientific understanding will provide tangible impact at the level of applications. A number of the proposed methods have already been used in the analysis of high dimensional genomic, proteomic and metabolomic data with emphasis on identifying active pathways (subnetworks) in different disease (primarily cancer) states. Further, a number of new experiments are in the design stage that would utilize some of the advanced models and techniques proposed in this project. Another key aspect of this proposal is the development of an easy to use by practitioners open source software, built within a domain independent workflow management system. This allows users to enhance the software by adding their own functionality and computational tools in an easy and transparent manner. The novel methodological procedures ensuing from this research agenda will be disseminated to the relevant scientific communities, both via inter-disciplinary interaction and collaboration and through presentations at conferences and specialized workshops.

The stochastic evolution of molecular sequences on such a phylogeny is an instance of a Markov model on a tree. In this project, the PI will further develop connections between the theory of Gibbs measures on trees and the phylogenetic reconstruction problem.

In recent years, probability theory, the mathematical study of randomness, has provided key new insights in assessing the power of statistical methods to reconstruct evolutionary processes in large-scale phylogenetics. The main theme of this project is to further investigate these connections. In particular, more realistic models of evolution will be considered.

As a result, one is led to consider forests of gene histories as well as more complex network representations of the evolutionary history of life.  The main goals of the research are to improve large-scale likelihood-based gene tree estimation, develop computational methods to assemble species phylogenies from gene histories, and detect network-like signal in molecular data.

A large-scale biologically faithful computational network is built to describe the parkinsonian state of the basal ganglia and thalamocortical circuit. In the computational method, the investigators conduct multi-site delayed feedback stimulation (MDFS) on the computational network. Various algorithms are developed to optimize the administration of MDFS. Based on the hypothesis that pathological outputs from the internal segment of the golobus pallidus (GPi) may induce parkinsonian signs by compromising thalamocortical (TC) relay, the objective function in the optimization is to diminish TC relay error in the parkinsonian state. In the mathematical method of synchrony breaking and burst reduction, a five dimensional system of nonlinear differential equations of GPi neuron is considered. A map reduction approach is applied to the GPi model neuron to obtain more tractable representation of the Poincare map that can capture the fundamental behavior of the GPi neuron. The reduced map is used to derive conditions that will settle a subgroup of uncoupled and fully synchronized GPi ensemble into different stable states of subthreshold oscillation, tonic fire and bursts with various spike numbers. The investigators expect to find the existence conditions of chimera states-the coexistence of synchrony and asynchrony-in this ensemble of GPi neurons that may lead to methods of mild stimulation of pathological synchrony breaking.<br/><br/>The conventional deep brain stimulation delivers an ongoing stream of high frequency electrical pulses to a stimulation target in the brain. Even though the conventional deep brain stimulation has achieved remarkable successes in alleviating symptoms of Parkinson's patients, it has several significant drawbacks, such as high energy cost and laborious tuning in stimulation parameters. More importantly, such form of stimulation is considered ""dumb"" because the external stimulation force is not guided by the changes in the brain's electrical activity relevant to the disorder being treated. The computational frame work in this project will address the important challenges in advancing deep brain stimulation via less invasive and ""smarter"" closed loop protocols, multi-site delayed feedback stimulation, guided by the changes in the brain. The investigation of chimera states will link the phenomena of chimera states observed in dynamical systems to biophysically faithful models of neurological movement disorders. The successful finding of chimera states will assist in finding methods to break the synchrony of parkinsonian states with minimal amount of stimulation intervention."

Although the details of the biology of these processes are vastly different, a common theme is that each involves a complex viscoelastic material mixture whose behavior is determined by the dynamic interplay of mechanics, flow, physical structure, and chemistry.  The mathematical description of these processes requires equations describing multiphase flow, the evolution of composition, structure and chemistry, and the relationship between stresses and composition/structure.

This research project develops and analyzes differential equation models for the number of follicles (eggs) and blood levels of reproductive hormones during a woman's reproductive years from age 20 until menopause. The investigators' models already predict hormone levels that agree with data in the literature for normally cycling women, and the models have other solutions reflecting characteristics of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a leading cause of female infertility. Building on this work, the researchers will develop more complex, mechanistic models to describe a woman's cycling throughout her reproductive life and to track the ""primordial pool"" of follicles with which a woman is born and that continually decreases as she ages. Ad hoc techniques will be devised to estimate model parameters using data sets from multiple age groups. Model simulations will be used to predict and to study age-related and pathological changes in cycling. These include a decrease in serum inhibins, which is one of the earliest signs of reproductive aging, and erratic luteal levels of estrogen and progesterone, which may occur in women in their 40's. Tools from numerical analysis and dynamical systems, e.g., parameter identification methods, sensitivity analysis, stability theory, and bifurcation techniques, will be used to develop and to study these models. <br/><br/>A woman's peak fertility occurs between the ages of 20 and 30. However, in North America and Europe more women are postponing childbearing until their 30's and must deal with the consequences of reduced natural fertility due to a decreasing number of follicles and changes in reproductive hormones. In addition, women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) often exhibit hormonal imbalances and insulin insensitivity. A goal of this research project is to model and study the interplay between PCOS, excess androgens, and glucose metabolism. A lifelong model for hormonal control of the female reproductive cycle may be used to predict optimal types, doses, and durations of hormonal therapies for young and aging women. In turn, given the broad consensus that hormone therapies be used at lowest doses for the shortest intervals necessary to achieve specific therapeutic aims, the impact of these modeling studies on women's health should be beneficial. This research also may advance our understanding of several types of increasingly prevalent diseases, including PCOS, infertility in general, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders."

Oscillations and other complex dynamic behaviors have been implicated in several neurological diseases. Both animal models and humans with Parkinson?s disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy and sleep disorders exhibit changes in the firing properties of neurons within certain brain regions. These changes often take the form of increased correlation in spiking activity, changes in bursting and other rhythmic behavior and changes in the firing rates of neurons. Although the functional role of rhythmic activity in cognitive processing remains poorly understood, it is clear that these pathological rhythms depend on specific cell types and network properties. Recent technological advances such as optogenetics allow for the targeting of specific biological cells and the recording from multiple cells lying in separate brain regions. This provides novel opportunities for theoreticians to model the role of different cell types and network properties in the generation of neuronal activity.  A series of five workshops will be conducted, each devoted to a separate neurological disease: Parkinson?s disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, Alzheimer?s and anesthesiology/sleep disorders. Each workshop will bring together neuroscientists, mathematicians and clinicians, so that the most relevant issues and latest research associated with the workshop?s topic will be presented from several different viewpoints. In this way, the workshops will: (i) attract newcomers to the field; (ii) broaden and deepen perspectives of those in the field; and (iii) consider what mathematical tools and analyses would be most helpful, and where further developments are most needed, to move forth in tackling neurological disease.  <br/><br/>Millions of people suffer from some form of neurological disease. Experiments have demonstrated that many brain disorders, including Parkinson?s disease, schizophrenia, sleep disorders and epilepsy, are associated with the onset of pathological neuronal firing patterns. For example, recordings from both monkeys and humans have shown that Parkinson?s disease is associated with increased synchronization among neurons within the basal ganglia. Changes in the synchronization properties of neurons may also play a critical role in epilepsy and pathological firing patterns within the prefrontal cortex, and other brain regions, have been implicated in patients suffering from schizophrenia. While there has been tremendous progress in developing experimental techniques for identifying cellular processes involved in the generation of neurological diseases, the mechanisms underlying these pathological firing patterns remain poorly understood. It has become increasingly evident that mathematical models, together with both computational and mathematical analysis of them, can play an important role in making sense of the data, testing hypotheses and generating new ones.  A series of five workshops will be conducted, each devoted to a separate neurological disease: Parkinson?s disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, Alzheimer?s and anesthesiology/sleep disorders.

Although forced unitary oscillators have been heavily studied, there are very few studies of the effects of periodic forcing on networks of oscillators with multiple internal degrees of freedom.  Understanding such systems is an essential step in understanding how the brain makes use of its rhythmic dynamics to communicate signals among regions. The networks in this project have an almost universal property of networks of neurons: there is exponentially decaying inhibition that feeds back to the excitatory cells of the network. In these projects, the decaying nature of the inhibition is important for the emergence of lower-dimensional dynamics and the ability to produce and analyze simplified models of network phenomena. The initial three subprojects concern noise, multiple periodic inputs, and intrinsic currents providing extra timescales that interact with periodic forcing.  The work will relate the properties of network interaction, such as the decaying inhibition, to geometric ideas of invariant manifold theory.  The aim is to produce a level of mathematical clarity that is not generally a part of initial modeling work, and to expand the set of tools and concepts available for further study of forced networks.  The project focuses on networks producing gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations and beta (12-30 Hz) oscillations, with physiological descriptions of the neurons appropriate to those rhythms.<br/><br/>The dynamics of the nervous system are central to cognitive function, but how the brain makes use of its dynamics is barely beginning to be understood.  Rhythms of the nervous system have long been known to be highly associated with cognitive processes including sensory coding, attention, learning, memory, and motor planning.  The study of such rhythms, and their use in brain communication, is an excellent bridge between physiology and function. This project deals with the response of networks of neurons to periodic and other input, as would be seen from signals arriving from other parts of the brain. The purpose of the project is to understand how brain networks process their temporally and spatially coded inputs. This work is being done in the context of a broad initiative to study the origin and significance of brain rhythms.  Kopell is the founder and current head of the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, a group of over two dozen Boston-based senior investigators interested in the physiological and dynamical mechanisms of neural activity, their importance in cognition, and their pathology in neurological diseases including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, as well as their changes in anesthesia; it includes experimentalists working in vivo and in vitro, mathematicians, statisticians and medical personnel, who are already incorporating ideas from the mathematical research into clinical practice."

As silicon-based nanodevices reach their natural size limitations, carbon-based materials such as nanotubes and graphene have emerged as exciting alternatives. Because graphene consists of a single 2D planar layer of carbon atoms, and possesses unique physical properties, graphene is thought to be better suited for large-scale circuit design than nanotubes, which typically exhibit large intrinsic resistance in contacts that limits their effectiveness. To realize their promise, large and defect-free graphene sheets must be grown or placed on non-metallic substrates. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms that govern the growth and morphology of graphene. Indeed, controlling the graphene morphology has proven to be a major challenge, and the kinetics of graphene growth remain poorly understood. The investigators will address these issues here. The main objective of this proposal is to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of the mechanisms that govern the growth and morphology of graphene and develop strategies to control its growth by (1) developing and applying state-of-the-art adaptive numerical methods to large-scale computation and (2) performing analytical, numerical and modelling studies of important constituent processes. More specifically, the investigators will perform fundamental studies of the growth of graphene films from a thermal treatment of a silicon carbide substrate. This process is unique among epitaxial growth mechanisms because there is no deposition flux of carbon. Rather, silicon desorbs from the surface freeing carbon atoms to diffuse on the surface and nucleate first to form a precursor layer and then a graphene layer. A significant challenge is that the structure and morphology of graphene layers is determined both by atomic-scale phenomena and by the elastic interaction of surface features over length scales of hundreds of nanometers. Consequently, no single model is able to describe all the processes involved in the formation of graphene sheets on silicon carbide. The investigators will therefore adopt a multiple-scale approach that includes atomic scale simulations, genetic algorithms for determination of surface structure, and continuum models for shape evolution and patterning. The highly nonlinear nature of these problems makes fast, accurate and robust numerical methods essential to their study.<br/><br/>Nanocrystalline materials have physical properties that make them ideally suited for a wide range of potential applications including areas of Federal strategic interests such as nanotechnology, information technology (via advanced optoelectronic and magnetic storage units), biotechnology, (via biological or chemical sensors), and energy technology (via photovoltaic devices). Because of their unique structural and electronic properties, carbon-based devices, such as defect-free graphene layers, can extend miniaturization beyond the natural limits of their silicon-based counterparts. Recent advances in experimental techniques indicate that the key obstacle in achieving large and uniform graphene layers necessary for device applications is the roughness of the surface on which it grows. However, a quantitative understanding of the interaction among the surface properties and graphene growth processes remains elusive. The investigators will develop new mathematical theory and advance the state-of-the-art in numerical simulation to perform fundamental studies of graphene growth. These studies will provide guidance in the quantitative interpretation of experimental measurements on the dynamics of graphene layer formation and will suggest mechanisms to control graphene growth. The theory and methods developed here will also be useful in the study of other nanoscale materials arrays of semiconductor quantum dots. Two Ph.D. students will receive interdisciplinary training while performing the proposed work. The investigators will develop and teach a course on crystal and epitaxial growth for gifted high school students as part of the Calif.

Better insight into how such complex systems work and are regulated is critical to understanding these important processes and how they can be manipulated to improve human health.  Because these processes are governed by physical and chemical principles and properties, and because these principles and properties can be expressed mathematically, mathematical tools can be brought to bear on these problems. Through mathematical analysis and computational simulations, new insights into the materials' behavior can be developed and a wealth of data can be obtained that complements the data obtainable from traditional laboratory experiments.  Hence the combination of mathematical and experimental investigators brought together in this project is expected to lead to significant new insights in important physiological and pathological situations including blood clotting, metabolism, and cancer metastasis.  Further the mathematics and computational tools developed in the project will impact the development of non-biological complex materials to meet pressing technological challenges."

The conference website is http://www.math.wfu.edu/SEARCDE2012. This conference has met annually since 1981. It was initiated by members of the Department of Mathematics at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and has since then rotated among the research institutions in the southeast. The location chosen for this year event is the Wake Forest University campus, which is centrally located in the southeast and has hosted many well-attended meetings in the past, including two previous SEARCDE conferences. <br/><br/>This conference brings together many researchers under the broad umbrella of Differential Equations. Both theoretical and applied approaches are well represented. Distinguished plenary speakers are invited from both within and without the region. The conference also provides a supportive environment where students and new PhDs can present their research and interact with more seasoned experts. Supporting the development of new researchers is one of the central goals of SEARCDE."

These epigenetic factors, also known as parent-of-origin effects, have been increasingly explored for their roles in complex traits as part of a concerted effort to find the ""missing heritability"". Research on parent-of-origin effects has taken on a new dimension as the next generation sequencing technology becomes wildly available. However, despite the great biological and technological progress and innovation, statistical methods are lacking behind.  Most existing methods for studying imprinting/maternal effects are restricted to data from nuclear families. The applicability of such methods is further hindered by the need to make strong but unrealistic assumptions to reduce the number of parameters to avoid overparametrization. In addition, imprinting and maternal effects are confounded and maternal effect is believed to be heterogeneous; all these further complicate modeling and analysis efforts.  This project takes up this challenging problem and aims to develop novel statistical and computational models/methods and software for extended families and nuclear families without making the strong but unrealistic assumptions. For nuclear family data from retrospective studies, in addition to case families, the study design also considers controls, which can be in the form of control nuclear families or internal controls from unaffected siblings of case families.  This novel design makes it possible to formulate a partial likelihood approach, wherein the likelihood component of interest is free of the nuisance parameters.  This circumvents the problem of overparametrization and unrealistic assumptions that plague existing methods.  For extended pedigrees from prospective studies, the focus is on the development of a method for incorporating heterogeneous maternal effects and addressing the issue of missing data, which is common for extended pedigrees.  Methods proposed will be implemented in software that will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>The importance of epigenetics in the twenty first century cannot be overstated.  To borrow science writer David Shenk's words, epigenetics is ``perhaps the most important  discovery in the science of heredity since the gene''.  In this regard, genomic imprinting and maternal effects,  two aspects of the epigenetic process, holds important roles as they are essential for normal mammalian growth and development but can also cause devastating diseases and birth defects. Genetic imprinting refers to the epigenetic marking of the parental origin of a gene, which leads to the same DNA sequence being expressed differently depending on whether it is inherited from the mother or from the father.  It is well known that Prader?Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome are genetic disorders involving genetic imprinting. Maternal effect refers to the influence of the prenatal environment provided by a mother, which may arise from the expression levels of some genes carried by the child being altered by the additional genetic materials passed from the mother during pregnancy. Biological research increasingly reveals the presence and importance of maternal effect in many diseases such as childhood cancer and birth defects. This projects aims to develop novel statistical methods and computational software that circumvent difficulties in identifying genes that bear imprinting and/or maternal effects using nuclear and extended family data.  The tools developed will be made available to the larger scientific community to aid scientific discoveries and finding treatments for genetic diseases.  This project will also contribute to the training of the next generation of researchers in a cutting-edge interdisciplinary research area that fuses knowledge in biology, statistics and computer science."
