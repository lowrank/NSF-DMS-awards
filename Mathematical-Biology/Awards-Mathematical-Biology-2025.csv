These networks must operate reliably even in the face of unpredictable changes, such as random mutations or environmental shifts. One key to that stability is a biological concept called canalization. This project investigates how gene regulatory networks (GRNs) achieve such stability by studying how their structure shapes their behavior. Using simple but powerful mathematical models, the research will uncover underlying design principles that make these networks robust. To achieve this, the project will analyze hundreds of previously published expert-curated GRN models using new computational tools and theoretical insights.  The findings will be validated through biological experiments in a model plant species, Arabidopsis. The broader impacts of this project include the creation of public databases and software tools that will allow scientists to explore how gene networks function. By involving students in all aspects of the research, this project contributes to the interdisciplinary training of the STEM workforce. Moreover, this project has the potential to support efforts in agriculture, biology and medicine by helping scientists better understand how genetic systems function and maintain their resilience.<br/><br/> <br/>This project seeks to elucidate design principles of GRNs using discrete dynamical systems, specifically Boolean and multistate network models. The central focus is on the biological concept of canalization, which refers to the process of creating stability in a gene regulation program despite genetic and environmental variability. This project will develop a biologically meaningful definition of canalization for multistate functions. A meta-analysis of all published, expert-curated discrete GRN models will be conducted to identify structural and dynamical features that are overrepresented compared to random expectations, including canalization, redundancy, and long-term dynamic behavior.  To assess the functional relevance of identified design principles, GRNs with varying properties will be simulated, and dynamical outcomes, such as robustness and phenotypic switching, will be measured.  Analysis methods will be implemented in open-source software tools, integrated with existing software libraries such as CANA and BooleanNet. Experimental validation will be performed using Arabidopsis root GRNs, revealing biological insights into correlations between phenotypes, transcription factor expression levels and root GRN robustness. This multi-faceted approach combining theory, computation, and experiment will yield new insights into how GRN topology governs dynamics and how stability is achieved through canalization and other structural features.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, how many mutations drove the tumor's progression, and what specific mutations were most important? Doctors can use this information to determine the best courses of treatment and the frequency of surveillance tests. In recent years, scientists have developed novel sequencing technologies -- including single-cell sequencing, multi-region sequencing, and sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). In this project, the investigators will develop new mathematical and statistical tools to analyze the large amounts of data generated by these new sequencing technologies.  Their methods will leverage the latest knowledge of biological mechanisms driving cancer progression to develop constrained statistical models that maximize insights from cancer sequencing data.  The investigators will incorporate real-world limitations of cancer sequencing data availability, e.g. limited time points and samples.  This project will support the training of graduate students in inter-disciplinary science that combines mathematics, statistics, and bioinformatics.<br/> <br/>The mathematical tools will be built upon the underlying principles of population genetics which govern tumor progression.  Due to the rapid expansion of tumor cell populations, work will primarily be done with branching process models; however, variants of the branching process model that incorporate finite carrying capacity will also be used, allowing for the accurate representation of real-world observations of tumor cell growth rates that decrease over time. Within the context of these stochastic models, the investigators will study several quantities related to new genomic sequencing technologies. For example, they will study the behavior of the site frequency spectrum in a branching process model with selection. This study will enable the development of tools to better detect the presence of so-called driver mutations in the genetic history of tumors. The investigators will also develop techniques based on multi-type branching processes for understanding data generated from multi-region sequencing. Additionally, techniques for utilizing single-cell sequencing to identify the mutations responsible for driving tumor progression will be developed. Finally, the investigators will study how ctDNA can be used to predict cancer recurrence and quantify the population dynamics of recurrent tumors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These changes often result in reduced species diversity and fewer interactions between species. To predict how future ecosystems will respond, it is essential to study the dynamics of past ecosystems, especially those from the distant past. Earth's history includes environmental disturbances of similar magnitude and direction to what we are experiencing today, and the imprints of these events are left on ancient ecological communities that are recorded in the fossil and historical record. This research aims to uncover how marine communities have responded to climate change and resource exploitation in the past, focusing on the evolution of large-bodied filter-feeding baleen whales and their apex predators near the Eocene-Oligocene transition, as well as the more recent anthropogenic impacts of industrialized fishing on these species. By studying these evolutionary and anthropogenic shifts, the aim is to reveal how past changes have shaped marine food web structures and their broader ecological function, providing insight into the potential future of marine ecosystems. The project will support the training of graduate student researchers at the University of California Merced and the University of Alaska Fairbanks.<br/><br/>This project introduces a novel framework for reconstructing and analyzing the dynamics of historical and paleo-ecosystems, connecting physiological constraints of species to community structure. The aim is to address three primary questions: (1) Do species interactions predict specific body size constraints shaping marine communities throughout the Cenozoic? By integrating bioenergetic and generalized dynamic models, we will explore how energetic flows among small groups of interacting species (motifs) influence population persistence. (2) How do the dynamics of size-structured species interactions provide insight into structural constraints of food webs? The objective is to assess interaction feasibility based on body size and predict structural constraints in broader community contexts. (3) How do the dynamic limitations of size-structured species interactions impact the stability of Cenozoic marine food webs? This study will evaluate how ancient marine community changes resulted in unique ecosystem structures, offering insights into current and future marine ecosystems impacted by climate change and exploitation. The proposed integrative modeling approach aims to uncover new insights into the structuring forces of ecological communities and pave the way for reconstructing the dynamics of no-analog paleo and historical food webs. By improving our ability to predict and understand the complexities of past, present, and future ecosystems, the proposed approach, rooted in fundamental energetic trade-offs, can be broadly extended to communities across various timescales, from pre-Cenozoic to future climate scenarios yet to be experienced.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Polar Programs Antarctic Organisms and Ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These communities often contain thousands of interacting species, forming complex webs of relationships that are difficult to observe directly. A key challenge in microbiome research is identifying keystone species?organisms that play a disproportionately important role in maintaining community stability and function. Traditional methods to detect these keystone species rely on constructing detailed microbial interaction networks, a process that is both time- and computation-intensive. This project introduces a new interdisciplinary framework that uses tools from algebra and geometry to develop new tools for analyzing microbiome data. By applying this approach to microbial communities across stream, land, and sea environments, the researchers will identify keystone species and test their influence through laboratory experiments. This project will enhance interdisciplinary education, student research, and workforce preparation in mathematical biology.<br/><br/>This project develops algebraic approaches to analyze microbial co-occurrence and ecological structure using tools from computational algebraic geometry and algebraic statistics. The research focuses on three core aims: (1) developing a low-rank method for identifying keystone taxa using algebraic conditions on sample covariance matrices, circumventing the need for full network inference; (2) using pseudo-monomial and toric ideals to study species niche space geometry and distribution continuity based on presence/absence data; and (3) constructing statistical tools for comparing microbial networks via exponential random graph models, enabling rigorous assessment of network structure across environmental conditions. These methods will be applied to a large microbiome dataset collected across an environmental gradient in Hawai'i, and predictions of keystone species will be validated through co-culturing experiments that test community responses to species removal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An immune digital twin could predict how an individual?s immune system may respond to an infection, how inflammation becomes harmful, or how therapies work before they are even tested on patients. To this end, this CAREER project will focus on two fundamental questions: What level of mathematical abstraction and granularity is required to represent an immune digital twin, and how can diverse data types ? categorical, qualitative, and quantitative ? be integrated to calibrate and validate its components? These research efforts will be complemented by the development of summer research programs for undergraduates aimed at introducing students to mathematics and STEM applications through the lens of digital twins. Courses and publicly available code will be specifically designed for undergraduate students interested in research, with the goal of bringing more students into digital twin science.<br/> <br/>To address the project's research questions, the first objective will bring forward the mathematical theory and concepts necessary to conceive a generic digital twin of an immune cell. The mathematical foundations of stability, identifiability, and well-posed immune digital twins will be developed. The second objective will integrate data from different labs into multi-scale algorithms to calibrate immune digital twins. The causal effects of these twins and calibration algorithms will be evaluated in a ground truth model that will provide a transparent setting for interrogating the proposed research questions. The third objective will leverage the previous two to create a blueprint of an immune cell.

Important outcomes may occur during a particular season, such as pests eating crops, but those outcomes are driven by recurring effects between seasons. For example, pests eating during summer affects their hibernation during winter, and survival during winter affects reproduction for the next summer. Accurately quantifying this type of effect is important for understanding long-term outcomes in seasonal ecosystems. This work studies a mathematical description of recurring change, which combines two well-established frameworks into a more complex approach. In particular, this work is concerned with how well the approach can match real-world data. An important factor is whether information obtained from data is accurate and how this affects confidence in mathematical results. The work begins with a simulated test of these problems, before incorporating real data from two studies. The studies concern mosquitoes and bees, highlighting the broad potential applications of this approach. Mosquitoes are common disease vectors that impact human health, and bees provide pollination that impacts agriculture and food security. The project also includes an education component that aims to improve quantitative preparation of biology students alongside interdisciplinary preparation of mathematics students.<br/><br/>In this work, feedback between seasonal behaviors is described by hybrid-timescale models. These models couple continuous differential equations (for fast, short-term interactions) with discrete difference equations (for slow, seasonal behaviors). Use of these models may be complicated by intractable analysis and high sensitivity to model inputs. Moreover, their application-level utility depends on the ability to accurately represent true ecosystems. This work will assess parameter estimation and identifiability for these models (or, whether model parameters can be uniquely and reliably recovered from data). Preliminary work will establish appropriate methods and criteria to assess identifiability, using simple models fit to synthetic data. The resulting methods will be applied to empirical data in two applications, under increasingly complex conditions. Taken together, these assessments will establish conditions under which hybrid-timescale models can be practically implemented in seasonal ecosystems.

This project aims to address deficiencies in current mechanistic modeling paradigms by further integrating the often-neglected feedback loop among various public health policies (such as vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions), dynamic public opinions toward these policies during different phases of an epidemic, and critical outcomes such as hospitalization and death. This project establishes a detailed, integrated system encompassing policy, opinion, and epidemic dynamics, supported by robust mathematical methodologies and novel computational opinion mining approaches. This system will serve as a resource for developing, evaluating, and adjusting public health policies. The methodology developed can be applied to mechanistic models beyond the scope of this project, contributing to the broader field of mathematical epidemiology. Additionally, this project seeks to train the next generation of multidisciplinary modeling and public health teams, ensuring more precise situational awareness and policy support, ultimately enabling our society to stay ahead of the curve in future epidemics. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop and deliver innovative mathematical models for the co-evolution of public opinions and epidemic dynamics within the framework of mean field games (MFGs), resulting in an integrated system of epidemic MFG equations.

MFGs will significantly enhance our ability to track the coupled public opinion-epidemic system under spatially and temporally heterogeneous health policies. Additionally, this project will develop robust convexification numerical methods with guaranteed global convergence to accurately infer critical parameters (e.g., transmission coefficient, recovery rate, ...) from observed data, treating these as coefficient inverse problems. Furthermore, advanced natural language processing techniques, including content analysis and sentiment analysis, will be developed to characterize real-time public opinion and estimate compliance with various health policies across time and space. The integrated MFG system will be simulated under various scenarios, such as different public health policies and varying compliance, to predict future epidemic outcomes for policy decision support. <br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology program and Division of Environment Biology (DEB). This project was also co-funded in collaboration with the CDC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Testing is the fastest most reliable way to inform a person whether they are infected, and thus whether they should adjust their behavior to prevent onward spread. Testing policies have long contributed to public health, including in the control of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. During the COVID-19 pandemic, various test-based policies were successful, including pre-event screening (e.g., testing before entering a sporting event), traveler screening (e.g., testing before boarding a flight), and regular screening (e.g., weekly testing at universities). Such policies could also help control the spread of other existing and novel respiratory pathogens. However, we currently lack a robust, data-driven framework to estimate the potential impact of testing-based infection control strategies in general. To fill this gap, this project will develop a flexible modeling framework to simulate how different testing policies might perform for various pathogens, tests, and human behavioral scenarios. This project will also develop the statistical tools needed to infer how diagnostic test results, infectiousness, and behavior relate to one another, informed by data on SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens. To maximize the impact of these findings, this project will build mature, open-source software products to compare testing-based policies, accompanied by tutorials for policymakers and a new open-source data hub to consolidate information relevant to testing-based policies. The successful completion of this project will improve our ability to control existing respiratory pathogens and enhance our preparedness for future pandemics. <br/><br/>Fundamental to this project is the characterization of how infectiousness, detectability, symptoms, and behaviors change over the course of a respiratory infection ? a collection of features called an infection trajectory. While the details of an infection trajectory can be omitted for some types of policy assessments, testing-based policies depend critically on an accurate and statistical understanding of infection trajectories. Infection trajectory-based models allow for the separation of individual-level features of disease transmission from the between-host dynamics, permitting a ?plug-and-play? approach to policy design, without compromising the ability to tailor solutions to local needs and populations. This project?s policy modeling framework will develop a stochastic description of infection trajectories, represented by a joint distribution of an infection?s measurable variables. This will allow the researchers to assess variability in policy outcomes and to identify cross-policy interactions. This project will develop a framework to infer infection trajectory distributions from multimodal data and will deploy that framework to guide the design of studies for collecting new infection trajectory data. Finally, this project will create a suite of software, educational, and data tools for informing infection trajectories and associated policies. For the public health policy community, successful completion of this project will produce new, high-quality policy design models and assessment tools, complemented by educational and interactive exploration webpages. For the scientific community, this project will provide statistical tools and data sharing standards for infection trajectory data, supporting advances in virology and modeling.

Instead, they behaved according to their own objectives, where demographic and socioeconomic factors seemed to have influenced their responses to the set policies. Therefore, this project aims to improve the policymaking processes to mitigate the transmission of respiratory pathogens by incorporating the individuals? decision-making and socio-demographic heterogeneities. To do this, the investigators propose to develop and study game theoretical mathematical models, as well as simulation tools and numerical approaches that can be adapted to specific public health problems of interest to practitioners and researchers. These tools will be made publicly available. This project will also involve interdisciplinary training for graduate students in applied mathematics, statistics, operations research, epidemiology, and quantitative biology.<br/><br/>To model many interacting agents, the investigators will develop and study extensions of mean field games (MFGs).  First, they will focus on building multi-population MFGs and graphon games to incorporate socio-demographic heterogeneities while finding the Nash equilibrium responses of individuals under different disease mitigation policies (e.g., vaccination policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions). Furthermore, different equilibrium notions to incorporate altruism in the populations will be explored through the introduction of mixed multi-population MFGs that include both cooperative and non-cooperative individuals. Later, the investigators will focus on finding optimal mitigation policies by using Stackelberg MFGs that include the optimization of a regulator (e.g., a governmental institution). The extensions of Stackelberg MFGs that include heterogeneities in the mean field populations, altruistic behaviors, and possible state variables for the regulator will be developed and analyzed. Surveys and analyses of publicly available data will be conducted to calibrate and parameterize the mathematical models to capture real-life patterns. Finally, numerical approaches and simulation toolboxes will be implemented to solve large dimensional and more complex models, which will allow policymakers to adapt and parametrize our models according to their specific needs. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) and the CDC Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division (CORVD).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the importance of viruses, most microbial ecology studies overlook their impact. A major challenge is disentangling the interaction of viruses and bacteria in the environment because most of these microbes cannot be grown in laboratory conditions. The project addresses this gap by introducing a new data science and mathematics approach to model the complex dynamics of virus and bacteria and testing it in lakes that resemble ancient oceans. These lakes are an ideal controlled environment because they have stable, oxygen-free layers that are dominated by photosynthetic bacteria and viruses but lack complex life forms. The research will identify the key viruses influencing the dynamics of the bacterial communities. Characterizing the dynamic role of these viruses will help reinterpret the geological records from these lakes, which provide insights into early microbial life on Earth. Additionally, the project will create a user-friendly software for others to apply the technology to investigate the impact of viruses in different ecosystems. This project will train new interdisciplinary scientists and share their findings to the public in international journals and museum exhibits to highlight the complex role that viruses play.<br/><br/>Viruses infecting bacteria display two main infection modes: lytic and lysogenic. In the lytic mode, the virus uses cell machinery to produce viral particles, imposing predation pressure on microbial communities. During lysogeny, the virus remains latent, often providing new cell functions, including protection against new infections. Currently, no technology can identify the dynamics of the most impactful (keystone) lytic and lysogenic viruses in complex microbiomes. This project will fill this gap integrating viral and microbial omics data with an innovative transient dynamics method, leveraging the long-term collaboration between PI Luque and co-PI Silveira in viral ecology. The research will model the dynamics of viruses and bacteria in the chemocline of meromictic lakes, which serve as analogs for ancient oceans. Their stability and lack of complex organisms are ideal to study the impact of viruses on microbial communities and biogeochemistry. The project will use bioinformatics to predict the life traits of bacteria and viruses from microbial abundances, infection networks, metagenomics, and transcriptomics. It will also develop and calibrate an adaptive Boolean transient dynamic method using mesocosm experiments. The calibrated model will simulate year-long natural microbiome dynamics to identify keystone viruses and their infection strategies. The impact of these viruses will be projected to reinterpret biogeochemical profiles in the lakes. The developed mathematical technology will be released as an accessible software package, available via GitHub, Colab, and Python repositories. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, international conferences, public exhibits, and online platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
