Important outcomes may occur during a particular season, such as pests eating crops, but those outcomes are driven by recurring effects between seasons. For example, pests eating during summer affects their hibernation during winter, and survival during winter affects reproduction for the next summer. Accurately quantifying this type of effect is important for understanding long-term outcomes in seasonal ecosystems. This work studies a mathematical description of recurring change, which combines two well-established frameworks into a more complex approach. In particular, this work is concerned with how well the approach can match real-world data. An important factor is whether information obtained from data is accurate and how this affects confidence in mathematical results. The work begins with a simulated test of these problems, before incorporating real data from two studies. The studies concern mosquitoes and bees, highlighting the broad potential applications of this approach. Mosquitoes are common disease vectors that impact human health, and bees provide pollination that impacts agriculture and food security. The project also includes an education component that aims to improve quantitative preparation of biology students alongside interdisciplinary preparation of mathematics students.<br/><br/>In this work, feedback between seasonal behaviors is described by hybrid-timescale models. These models couple continuous differential equations (for fast, short-term interactions) with discrete difference equations (for slow, seasonal behaviors). Use of these models may be complicated by intractable analysis and high sensitivity to model inputs. Moreover, their application-level utility depends on the ability to accurately represent true ecosystems. This work will assess parameter estimation and identifiability for these models (or, whether model parameters can be uniquely and reliably recovered from data). Preliminary work will establish appropriate methods and criteria to assess identifiability, using simple models fit to synthetic data. The resulting methods will be applied to empirical data in two applications, under increasingly complex conditions. Taken together, these assessments will establish conditions under which hybrid-timescale models can be practically implemented in seasonal ecosystems. Additionally, the primary educational aim of this work is to revise lower-level math sequences for biology majors. The courses will use a project-based curriculum which builds towards a research experience in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Population and Ecology Cluster in the Division of Evolutionary Biology in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to address deficiencies in current mechanistic modeling paradigms by further integrating the often-neglected feedback loop among various public health policies (such as vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions), dynamic public opinions toward these policies during different phases of an epidemic, and critical outcomes such as hospitalization and death. This project establishes a detailed, integrated system encompassing policy, opinion, and epidemic dynamics, supported by robust mathematical methodologies and novel computational opinion mining approaches. This system will serve as a resource for developing, evaluating, and adjusting public health policies. The methodology developed can be applied to mechanistic models beyond the scope of this project, contributing to the broader field of mathematical epidemiology. Additionally, this project seeks to train the next generation of multidisciplinary modeling and public health teams, ensuring more precise situational awareness and policy support, ultimately enabling our society to stay ahead of the curve in future epidemics. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop and deliver innovative mathematical models for the co-evolution of public opinions and epidemic dynamics within the framework of mean field games (MFGs), resulting in an integrated system of epidemic MFG equations. The MFG approach captures the complex feedback among public health policies, dynamic public opinions, and epidemic outcomes that are not well captured by the commonly used susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR)-type compartment and agent-based models. MFGs will significantly enhance our ability to track the coupled public opinion-epidemic system under spatially and temporally heterogeneous health policies. Additionally, this project will develop robust convexification numerical methods with guaranteed global convergence to accurately infer critical parameters (e.g., transmission coefficient, recovery rate, ...) from observed data, treating these as coefficient inverse problems. Furthermore, advanced natural language processing techniques, including content analysis and sentiment analysis, will be developed to characterize real-time public opinion and estimate compliance with various health policies across time and space. The integrated MFG system will be simulated under various scenarios, such as different public health policies and varying compliance, to predict future epidemic outcomes for policy decision support. <br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology program and Division of Environment Biology (DEB).

Despite the importance of viruses, most microbial ecology studies overlook their impact. A major challenge is disentangling the interaction of viruses and bacteria in the environment because most of these microbes cannot be grown in laboratory conditions. The project addresses this gap by introducing a new data science and mathematics approach to model the complex dynamics of virus and bacteria and testing it in lakes that resemble ancient oceans. These lakes are an ideal controlled environment because they have stable, oxygen-free layers that are dominated by photosynthetic bacteria and viruses but lack complex life forms. The research will identify the key viruses influencing the dynamics of the bacterial communities. Characterizing the dynamic role of these viruses will help reinterpret the geological records from these lakes, which provide insights into early microbial life on Earth. Additionally, the project will create a user-friendly software for others to apply the technology to investigate the impact of viruses in different ecosystems. This project will train new interdisciplinary scientists and share their findings to the public in international journals and museum exhibits to highlight the complex role that viruses play.<br/><br/>Viruses infecting bacteria display two main infection modes: lytic and lysogenic. In the lytic mode, the virus uses cell machinery to produce viral particles, imposing predation pressure on microbial communities. During lysogeny, the virus remains latent, often providing new cell functions, including protection against new infections. Currently, no technology can identify the dynamics of the most impactful (keystone) lytic and lysogenic viruses in complex microbiomes. This project will fill this gap integrating viral and microbial omics data with an innovative transient dynamics method, leveraging the long-term collaboration between PI Luque and co-PI Silveira in viral ecology. The research will model the dynamics of viruses and bacteria in the chemocline of meromictic lakes, which serve as analogs for ancient oceans. Their stability and lack of complex organisms are ideal to study the impact of viruses on microbial communities and biogeochemistry. The project will use bioinformatics to predict the life traits of bacteria and viruses from microbial abundances, infection networks, metagenomics, and transcriptomics. It will also develop and calibrate an adaptive Boolean transient dynamic method using mesocosm experiments. The calibrated model will simulate year-long natural microbiome dynamics to identify keystone viruses and their infection strategies. The impact of these viruses will be projected to reinterpret biogeochemical profiles in the lakes. The developed mathematical technology will be released as an accessible software package, available via GitHub, Colab, and Python repositories. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, international conferences, public exhibits, and online platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Instead, they behaved according to their own objectives, where demographic and socioeconomic factors seemed to have influenced their responses to the set policies. Therefore, this project aims to improve the policymaking processes to mitigate the transmission of respiratory pathogens by incorporating the individuals? decision-making and socio-demographic heterogeneities. To do this, the investigators propose to develop and study game theoretical mathematical models, as well as simulation tools and numerical approaches that can be adapted to specific public health problems of interest to practitioners and researchers. These tools will be made publicly available. This project will also involve interdisciplinary training for graduate students in applied mathematics, statistics, operations research, epidemiology, and quantitative biology.<br/><br/>To model many interacting agents, the investigators will develop and study extensions of mean field games (MFGs).  First, they will focus on building multi-population MFGs and graphon games to incorporate socio-demographic heterogeneities while finding the Nash equilibrium responses of individuals under different disease mitigation policies (e.g., vaccination policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions). Furthermore, different equilibrium notions to incorporate altruism in the populations will be explored through the introduction of mixed multi-population MFGs that include both cooperative and non-cooperative individuals. Later, the investigators will focus on finding optimal mitigation policies by using Stackelberg MFGs that include the optimization of a regulator (e.g., a governmental institution). The extensions of Stackelberg MFGs that include heterogeneities in the mean field populations, altruistic behaviors, and possible state variables for the regulator will be developed and analyzed. Surveys and analyses of publicly available data will be conducted to calibrate and parameterize the mathematical models to capture real-life patterns. Finally, numerical approaches and simulation toolboxes will be implemented to solve large dimensional and more complex models, which will allow policymakers to adapt and parametrize our models according to their specific needs. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) and the CDC Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division (CORVD).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Testing is the fastest most reliable way to inform a person whether they are infected, and thus whether they should adjust their behavior to prevent onward spread. Testing policies have long contributed to public health, including in the control of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. During the COVID-19 pandemic, various test-based policies were successful, including pre-event screening (e.g., testing before entering a sporting event), traveler screening (e.g., testing before boarding a flight), and regular screening (e.g., weekly testing at universities). Such policies could also help control the spread of other existing and novel respiratory pathogens. However, we currently lack a robust, data-driven framework to estimate the potential impact of testing-based infection control strategies in general. To fill this gap, this project will develop a flexible modeling framework to simulate how different testing policies might perform for various pathogens, tests, and human behavioral scenarios. This project will also develop the statistical tools needed to infer how diagnostic test results, infectiousness, and behavior relate to one another, informed by data on SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens. To maximize the impact of these findings, this project will build mature, open-source software products to compare testing-based policies, accompanied by tutorials for policymakers and a new open-source data hub to consolidate information relevant to testing-based policies. The successful completion of this project will improve our ability to control existing respiratory pathogens and enhance our preparedness for future pandemics. <br/><br/>Fundamental to this project is the characterization of how infectiousness, detectability, symptoms, and behaviors change over the course of a respiratory infection ? a collection of features called an infection trajectory. While the details of an infection trajectory can be omitted for some types of policy assessments, testing-based policies depend critically on an accurate and statistical understanding of infection trajectories. Infection trajectory-based models allow for the separation of individual-level features of disease transmission from the between-host dynamics, permitting a ?plug-and-play? approach to policy design, without compromising the ability to tailor solutions to local needs and populations. This project?s policy modeling framework will develop a stochastic description of infection trajectories, represented by a joint distribution of an infection?s measurable variables. This will allow the researchers to assess variability in policy outcomes and to identify cross-policy interactions. This project will develop a framework to infer infection trajectory distributions from multimodal data and will deploy that framework to guide the design of studies for collecting new infection trajectory data. Finally, this project will create a suite of software, educational, and data tools for informing infection trajectories and associated policies. For the public health policy community, successful completion of this project will produce new, high-quality policy design models and assessment tools, complemented by educational and interactive exploration webpages. For the scientific community, this project will provide statistical tools and data sharing standards for infection trajectory data, supporting advances in virology and modeling.
