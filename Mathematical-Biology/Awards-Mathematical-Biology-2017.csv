The primary cause of colony losses is the parasitic Varroa mites (Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman). The study to unfold the mystery of the dramatic decline in honeybee populations and for developing control strategies for Varroa that reduce colony losses presents both challenges and opportunities for research and education. This research lives at the intersection of epidemiology, life sciences and applied mathematics, which enables the investigators to develop a template integrating interdisciplinary learning for students through shared research projects at the undergraduate and/or graduate level. The modeling framework provides not only a powerful system for examining multifactorial impacts on the honeybee colony system but also a great opportunity to explore how behavior, epidemiology and nutritional ecology coevolve within complex systems in general. This research can provide a basis for new strategies for controlling Varroa and reducing colony losses for beekeepers, and benefit land managers. The methods and results will be disseminated through online video lectures and in-person workshops that can be made available to the scientific community. Summer research projects will be provided to undergraduate students, especially underrepresented minority students, with a first-hand research experience.<br/><br/>This collaborative research between Arizona State University and Carl Hayden Bee Research Center fosters a culture of theory-experiment collaboration with aims to develop realistic and mathematically tractable models that will be validated and parameterized via using field data. The interdisciplinary collaboration will enable the investigators to study the integrated effects of disease, parasitism, nutrition and behavior in changing environments and the effects on honeybee colony mortality across multiscale in time and space. Rigorous mathematics will be integrated with extensive field and lab data to investigate: 1. How parasite migration into colonies via foragers from other hives located at different landscape structures could affect the honeybee-parasite population dynamics with stage structures. 2. How the honeybee-parasite-virus interactions with the honeybee foraging behavior in seasonal environments cause colony losses. 3. How the crucial feedback mechanisms linking disease, parasitism, nutrient and honeybee foraging behavior might be responsible for the colony growth dynamics and survival in a dynamical environment with multilevel spatial components. Nonlinear nonautonomous differential equations within metapopulation frameworks and individual based models will be used to model the honeybee population with spatial scales ranging from the individual, the colony, to the regional level and timescale spanning from seconds, days, to months."

This project studies how movement of organisms in the environment affects ecosystem survival or epidemic outbreak/extinction. Examples of such movement include dispersal of marine larvae between different reefs under water flow, spreading of infectious diseases via holiday travel or environmental pathogen movement, and infection through movement of insects that carry disease. Several user-friendly quantitative indices and their computation will be introduced to biologists and other scientists as tools for detecting and preventing ecological extinction or epidemic outbreaks. The research will model and optimize the effect of vaccination, medical treatment, and quarantine in epidemic events, and harvesting and harvesting restrictions for agricultural/fishery/forestry systems, to provide answers to important questions about sustaining high quality living environments and preventing epidemic outbreaks. Sample applications of the proposed research include (a) preventing cholera epidemics spreading through a common water source and (b) restoring Chesapeake Bay oyster populations. The outcomes from application projects will provide actionable strategies for government agencies, and the results will improve economic productivity of fisheries.<br/> <br/>The impact of spatial heterogeneity and dispersal on key ecological indices and properties will be quantitatively defined and calculated, and a unified mathematical framework will be developed to study the persistence, stability and control of both single and interacting species in heterogeneous environment or networks. The focus is the impact of asymmetric movement on the dynamical behavior of the biological systems, and infusing graph theory, matrix theory and their continuous counterparts into the study of corresponding dynamical systems is a key to the new theory. Several classical concepts in dynamical systems and mathematical biology such as Lyapunov stability theory, basic reproduction number, maximum sustainable yield and a new concept of target reproduction number will be defined in a broader context and analyzed with the additional network structure and spatial heterogeneity. The project will train graduate students and undergraduate students, and the modeling skills and new mathematical techniques that students acquire from the project will make them part of a future workforce with strong quantitative and analytical ability."

PAD is caused by a blockage (often due to atherosclerosis) of a major systemic artery such as the femoral artery that supplies blood to the leg.  Due to reduced blood and oxygen delivery to their calf and foot, PAD patients often develop pain when walking that progresses to pain at rest and eventual tissue loss, requiring surgical grafts or, in severe cases, amputation.  In addition to lost productivity and reduced quality of life for patients, the annual health care costs for PAD are estimated to be 160-300 billion dollars.  Currently, only two medications have been approved by the FDA for treating PAD-associated walking impairment, and both treatments are minimally effective.  The lack of sufficient data and understanding of the impact of different blood vessel adaptations on restoring normal blood flow following an occlusion motivates this research work.  A combined theoretical and experimental model will be used to design more optimal experiments, provide a mechanism for understanding the significance of adaptations to arterial occlusion within distinct vascular segments, and assist in designing more successful PAD therapies.<br/><br/>After a major arterial occlusion there is an immediate drop in flow, followed by a short (minutes), steep flow increase and then a gradual (hours to days) flow increase. However, the ability of the vasculature to regulate flow is significantly altered following a major occlusion, preventing full restoration of normal perfusion.  Vascular adaptations such as new vessel formation (angiogenesis) and existing vessel growth (arteriogenesis) have been observed to occur in response to a major arterial occlusion, but the relative roles and timing of each adaptation are unclear, making it difficult to extrapolate an optimal strategy for blood flow compensation.  In this project, a mathematical model will be developed to predict how short- (acute) and long-term (chronic) vascular adaptations impact flow after a major arterial occlusion.  The work will use a multi-scale differential equation model to couple the dynamics of the acute and chronic time scales and to assess the effects of hemodynamic and metabolic stimuli on the collateral and distal microvasculature following an occlusion.  Experimental data from the mouse hindlimb will be used to optimize model parameters.  To date, no theoretical model has been able to capture both the short and long term dynamics of flow following a major arterial occlusion based on mechanical factors affecting vessel diameter and number.  Such work will truly transform the current understanding of peripheral arterial disease by pinpointing the correct targets and timing for therapeutic agents that will help to restore normal perfusion in PAD patients.  The project also provides direct exposure of this interdisciplinary research work to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, thereby promoting the study of STEM disciplines among future generations and enhancing the scientific culture of our nation."

These methods are needed to help tumor biologists gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of the processes (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and migration) involved in tumor development, at the scales which influence their behavior. Because of this complexity, it has been challenging to functionally link cell and tissue scale processes, the knowledge of which is key to development of predictive multiscale tumor models. However, current models typically use ad-hoc rules to bridge between scales, which limits their predictive capability. This project will address this challenge by developing a new multiscale method where directly measurable quantities at the cell-scale inform the model parameters at the continuum tissue scale through rigorous, mathematical upscaling techniques. The multiscale model will be tested and validated by comparing simulation results against experimentally obtained information about the overall growth rates and spatiotemporal behaviors of the different cells and tumors. The new multiscale method will be used to study pancreatic tumors to elucidate the transition of pancreatic lesions into invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By integrating patient data analysis with quantitative tumor modeling, the project will develop reliable methods that can predict the likelihood of pancreatic cyst progression to PDAC using relatively non-invasive approaches. <br/><br/>The project team will develop a new class of multiscale models that bridge these scales non-phenomenologically through application of rigorous upscaling techniques in order to close the continuum equations at the tissue scale and provide an accurate description of the processes across both cell and tissue scales. Specifically, stochastic agent-based models at the cell-scale and continuum partial differential equation models at the tissue-scale will be developed. Consistent functional relationships between the variables at the tissue-scale and measurements at the cell-scale will be found by upscaling the discrete models by using and extending the framework of dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) to obtain multi-cell scale continuum equations that account for correlations among cells as well as biological processes such cell birth and death. Further upscaling to the tissue scale will be done by identifying and deriving equations for slowly varying variables. The consistency of the different models in domains where the scales overlap will be tested and validated. The new multiscale method will be applied to model the progression of pancreatic neoplasms into invasive carcinomas in order to estimate the probability of this progression. Large-scale human patient datasets of pancreatic lesions, provided by our consultants through a separately funded project, will be used to validate and refine the models. The project will enhance the cross disciplinary training of students."

These are the blood clots responsible for most heart attacks and many strokes, and understanding how they can form under the extreme physical conditions in a stenotic artery may lead to new ideas for how to prevent them. The very fast blood flow in severely stenosed arteries means that many of the well-studied processes responsible for blood clotting in more physiologically typical situations can play at most a minor role in these arteries. Recent experiments, including ones from the laboratory of one of the current investigators, suggest the importance of a specific flow-sensitive protein in the blood in allowing blood platelets to clump together to form a clot in stenotic arteries. This project involves incorporating the hypothesized role of this protein into a novel and sophisticated computational model of arterial blood clot formation, developed by this project's other investigators, and to use the expanded model to characterize the conditions under which that protein's known properties could explain clot formation in stenotic arteries.  Through comparisons of the new model's predictions with further laboratory experiments, the model will be refined and its predictive capabilities improved, and our understanding of how blood clots form under the extreme physical conditions in stenotic arteries will be increased.  Because the challenges of forming a blood clot under the conditions in a stenotic artery are similar to those of stanching hemorrhage from a major artery, understanding of how such clots form may also aid in development of interventions to limit bleeding following trauma.<br/><br/>Most arterial blood clots are formed by the adhesion of blood cells known as platelets to an injured blood vessel wall and by platelets? cohesion to one another. Platelet adhesion and cohesion are both accomplished through the formation of molecular bonds that involve specific proteins on the platelets? surfaces binding to other specific proteins on the vascular wall or in the blood plasma. To hold the platelets together, the bonds must collectively be able to withstand the forces imposed on the platelet clump by the blood flow.   For many types of platelet-platelet bonds, a platelet can form that type of bond only if the platelet has already become activated in response to appropriate chemical or physical stimuli. The platelet activation process takes time.   For a platelet moving through a highly constricted artery, there is not enough time to respond to activation stimuli and the forces that the fluid exerts on it if it tries to attach to the vessel wall are enormous.   How clots form in this situation is poorly understood, but recent experiments lead to the hypothesis that bonds mediated by a uniquely flow-sensitive protein (von Willebrand factor) in the blood are critical. This project will explore that hypothesis through a combination of mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and laboratory experimentation. A novel multiphase model will be developed of the mechanical interactions between a viscous fluid representing the blood and a permeable, viscoelastic, fracturable material representing a growing platelet clot. Development of robust and efficient numerical methods will allow exploration of the model?s behavior. Model results will be compared with results from an in vitro physical model of a stenotic artery.   The comparison will lead to model refinements and to the design and interpretation of the physical experiments. Such interplay between modeling and experiments provides a powerful engine for driving scientific discovery."

Cessation of ART is typically followed by rapid viral rebound (VR) to the high, pre-ART viral loads. However, recent observations give nuance to this pattern. In 2013, reports of the ""Mississippi baby"" emerged, a child born with HIV and treated with ART shortly after birth. Taken off ART at 18 months of age, she appeared to be cured, only for HIV to reappear and rebound after 27 months. The following year, a study revealed 14 HIV+ individuals - ""the VISCONTI cohort"" - who continued to control their HIV infection in spite of having stopped ART 4-10 years before study publication. These and other examples show that in some HIV-infected individuals, there can be significant delays between the suspension of ART and VR. Delayed VR and the potential for post-treatment control (PTC) are poorly understood but suggest exciting possibilities for treatment of HIV without ART, thereby avoiding side effects and high drug costs. Further, people who control HIV to undetectable levels are unlikely to infect others, thus reducing the possibility of HIV transmission in the population as a whole.  The goal of this project is to better understand delayed VR and PTC by analyzing the following three questions: Under what circumstances will ART suspension lead to delayed VR or PTC? If ART suspension leads to VR, when will it occur? Can one predict when a patient can control infection off ART, permanently?<br/><br/>Central to this project is the development of mathematical viral dynamics models to investigate VR in HIV+ individuals following cessation of ART. The models will make use of stochastic multi-type branching processes, since viral populations in treated patients are small. While stochastic methods have been used to model viral dynamics, the standard approach is extensive simulation; in this project, the Principal Investigator will emphasize the derivation of analytic results instead, thereby introducing novel tools from applied probability to viral dynamics problems. The objectives will be addressed by stochastic models that will increase in complexity and realism through projects focusing on different biological aspects of HIV control such as immune responses. These models will be validated using data on HIV dynamics and VR from experimental collaborators and published data. The aim of this modeling is to better characterize VR dynamics, make testable predictions on times to VR, and gain insights into post-treatment control of HIV. In medical settings, the models developed may inform clinical guidelines with regards to ART suspension, lead to optimizing testing frequency during the ART interruption to detect VR and predicting PTC or ""HIV remission"" where VR will be unlikely."

In some cases, such as cilia-driven transport in the lung, these structures operate in a multi-fluid environment. Despite decades of work explicit challenges remain with developing suitable computational tools for the modeling of the complex fluid-structure interactions. The goal of this project is to develop and analyze accurate computational methods for these simulations, and to establish high-performance open-source implementations of these tools to be used by other researchers.  The new computational tools together with experimental measurements will be used to generate new insight into the mechanical behavior of mucus. Mucus provides a protective barrier for every human organ, and many diseases and disorders are associated with mucus pathology (e.g., in the lung (COPD, cystic fibrosis, asthma), stomach (ulcers),reproductive tract (infertility)). Moreover, tools developed as part of these projects have applications beyond mucus: to the food industry, for personal care products, as well as pharmaceutical applications, including drugs and drug delivery systems. The project will also provide broad interdisciplinary training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>The specific research objectives of this project are 1) to develop and analyze efficient higher-order accurate numerical methods for fluid-structure interaction and fluid-fluid interaction problems involving complex fluids, 2) to validate these methods by comparison to experimental data of project collaborators, and 3) to develop mathematical models of industrial and biological systems, including microbead rheology, ciliar synchronization and transport, and phase separation of suspensions. Previous research on numerical methods for viscoelastic fluids has been driven by engineering applications, while biological applications pose new challenges: large deformations of active soft structures and complex rheology. Despite past efforts to understand the dynamics of active structures in complex fluids, a significant bottleneck persists: the lack of accurate, efficient, adaptive numerical methods and software for viscoelasstic fluid-structure interaction and fluid-fluid interfaces. The research team aims to build, validate, and apply this technology, guided by applications and experimental data from biology and engineering."

A better understanding of circadian timekeeping is particularly important for the millions of Americans who travel overseas or work on irregular schedules. Recent research on circadian rhythms has discovered the complex biological mechanisms that generate timekeeping in each of the thousands of cells within the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the region of the brain that acts as the central circadian clock in mammals. Here, detailed mathematical models of neurons within the SCN are developed based on data from many experimental groups. These models are mathematically analyzed and simplified to determine the key properties that govern timekeeping. New mathematical and numerical methods are developed to allow for the study of complex neuronal networks and determine how timekeeping emerges from the collective behavior of coupled oscillators. These results should be applicable to many biological systems. <br/><br/>Circadian clocks are studied as a model system in cellular biology and electrophysiology to determine design principles that can be applied to other physiological systems, particularly those consisting of coupled oscillators. Mathematical models of electrophysiology will follow the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism. Mathematical models of cellular biology will follow the mass action formalism. Recent experimental research on the mechanisms of circadian timekeeping in individual cells will be incorporated into these mathematical models. Understanding the dynamics controlling circadian timekeeping will be extremely helpful for the field of circadian rhythms, which seeks to determine how a large number of proteins, ion channels and neurons work together to form the body's central clock. The general mathematical work in this proposal includes studying the attractors of biochemical feedback loops through iterative maps, a population density method for efficiently simulating large dimensional neuronal oscillators, and a new ansatz that can reduce a model of a large number of coupled oscillators to a two dimensional model. These mathematical approaches will be tested using our models of circadian timekeeping."

For instance, a neuron may fire only when all of its input neurons fire synchronously, or the electrical grid may crash only when demands of multiple users become synchronized, producing total-usage spikes. Ecosystems can show this type of dependency on synchrony. Ecosystems include multiple trophic levels, with population signals from lower levels often being spatially aggregated to affect higher levels and human concerns such as fisheries. For instance, a predator is only harmed if its prey are scarce over its whole hunting area. And human fish exploitation is only reduced if fish decline synchronously everywhere. For systems of this type, it is primarily the synchronous components of signals that matter in the average signal that affects the next hierarchical level - non-synchronous components tend to cancel in the spatial average. Thus, spatial synchrony of population dynamics is very important to ecosystem dynamics generally. Spatial synchrony of population dynamics has been widely observed in organisms as diverse as mammals and protists, at distances up to thousands of kilometers. Synchrony is closely related to large-scale outbreaks and shortages. Synchrony has conservation implications because populations are at greater risk of simultaneous extinction if they are simultaneously rare. But in spite of the importance of synchrony in ecology, possible impacts of climate change on synchrony are very little studied. In this context, climate change constitutes not just warming, but also changes in other statistical aspects of environmental signals. It is also unknown the extent to which synchrony, and climate-change-induced changes therein, can be transmitted through predator-prey interacts and hence throughout entire food webs in complex patterns. The goals of this research are: (1) to develop mathematical models and statistics to build understanding of how potential changes in synchrony induced by climate change will ramify through complex ecosystems; (2) and to develop mathematical models and use them to understand the consequences of changes in synchrony for a widely observed empirical pattern called Taylor's law, a phenomenon fundamental to spatial ecology and applied in a variety of areas including fisheries management, conservation, and agriculture. Researchers will also strive, as time allows, to understand the consequences of changes in synchrony for species extinction risk.<br/><br/>To meet goal (1) above, the researchers will perform stochastic-process modeling in a network context, to understand how changes in synchrony should theoretically cascade through complex species interaction networks; and will develop statistical methods combining wavelets and statistical path analysis, to be used to help infer how synchrony cascades through empirical interaction networks. A vector autoregressive moving average modelling framework will be constructed consisting of multiple habitat patches, with several species interacting within patches, migrating between patches, and being affected by a stochastic environment in each patch. For each species independently, dispersal and/or environmental synchronizing effects can be independently set to act directly on the species as synchronizing influences, or not. A given species may also be synchronized through its interactions with other synchronized species. The primary utility of the models is to make it possible to derive analytically, for each species, the relative importance of these direct and trophically-mediated synchronizing effects, thereby understanding the nature of trophic transmission of synchrony through the network. To meet goal (2) above, researchers will use the theory of ergodic stationary stochastic processes to represent population levels at different locations. If time allows, consequences of synchrony for extinction risk will be assessed through mathematical analysis within a classic stochastic matrix modelling framework, expanded to represent multiple populations across space."

In some cases, such as cilia-driven transport in the lung, these structures operate in a multi-fluid environment. Despite decades of work explicit challenges remain with developing suitable computational tools for the modeling of the complex fluid-structure interactions. The goal of this project is to develop and analyze accurate computational methods for these simulations, and to establish high-performance open-source implementations of these tools to be used by other researchers.  The new computational tools together with experimental measurements will be used to generate new insight into the mechanical behavior of mucus. Mucus provides a protective barrier for every human organ, and many diseases and disorders are associated with mucus pathology (e.g., in the lung (COPD, cystic fibrosis, asthma), stomach (ulcers), reproductive tract (infertility)). Moreover, tools developed as part of these projects have applications beyond mucus: to the food industry, for personal care products, as well as pharmaceutical applications, including drugs and drug delivery systems. The project will also provide broad interdisciplinary training for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>The specific research objectives of this project are 1) to develop and analyze efficient higher-order accurate numerical methods for fluid-structure interaction and fluid-fluid interaction problems involving complex fluids, 2) to validate these methods by comparison to experimental data of project collaborators, and 3) to develop mathematical models of industrial and biological systems, including microbead rheology, ciliar synchronization and transport, and phase separation of suspensions. Previous research on numerical methods for viscoelastic fluids has been driven by engineering applications, while biological applications pose new challenges: large deformations of active soft structures and complex rheology. Despite past efforts to understand the dynamics of active structures in complex fluids, a significant bottleneck persists: the lack of accurate, efficient, adaptive numerical methods and software for viscoelasstic fluid-structure interaction and fluid-fluid interfaces. The research team aims to build, validate, and apply this technology, guided by applications and experimental data from biology and engineering."

These include receptors and other large protein molecules that enable the cell to sense its environment. For example, cells that function as part of the immune system can sense extra-cellular molecular signals of infection. The cell surface is also a highly dynamic environment, and the movement and interactions of surface molecules play a crucial role in the response to extra-cellular signals. Mathematical modeling enables researchers to study these complex, dynamic, molecular processes in more detail than is currently afforded by experiments. The investigators will develop new mathematical approaches and computer simulation methods tailored to the study of how molecular motion on crowded cell surfaces influences cellular processes. The developed tools will enable researchers to predict the sequence of molecular events that initiate cell-cell interface formation and signaling processes. By enabling computational testing of novel strategies for biomolecular/cellular engineering, these tools will open up new means of discovery in areas such as immunotherapeutics. The investigators will contribute to broadening science participation by training undergraduate researchers in mathematical biology and scientific computing, and will carry out pedagogical activities with middle school students from groups underrepresented in science. <br/><br/>The specific focus of this research will be on modeling stochastic rare events in molecular diffusion. In many circumstances where molecular crowding occurs, un-crowding may also be critical. For example, in T cells, many large surface molecules must evacuate from a local region of the cell surface to allow for the T cell to interact with its target. This collective evacuation is a rare event relative to the timescale of individual molecular diffusion. The goal of this project is to develop a framework to study stochastic evacuation, including in rare event limits, and apply this framework to the T cell surface. Specific aims of this project are to: (1) Develop a combined asymptotic and computational rare event framework to solve diffusional evacuation in simple scenarios. (2) Develop enhanced spatially-distributed rare event methods capable of simulating complex scenarios. (3) Use the developed tools to understand how T cell surface molecules overcome or exploit rare evacuation. The mathematical novelty of this project is: the extension of asymptotic methods to effectively high-dimensional problems; the extension of computational rare event sampling methods, not only handling space but harnessing it; and the creation of synergies between asymptotic and computational approaches in a novel combined framework."

It will be a time to establish new collaborations and to refresh established collaborations.  <br/><br/>The broad theme of the conference is the analysis of mathematical models for the temporal dynamics of biological populations. A special emphasis will be placed on the effects of environmental/climate change. Specific topics include: population and ecological dynamics; adaptation and evolutionary dynamics; dynamics of infectious diseases and epidemics; dispersal and distribution of populations; invasions and endangered species; management of natural resources. Mathematical models play a central role in population biology where the contribute towards an understanding of the consequences of climate change and of actions that can be taken to mitigate deleterious effects, such as species extinction and loss of biological diversity, habitat disruption and species dispersal, threatened managed systems of renewable natural resources, spread of infectious diseases, evolution of pathogen drug immunity. For this effort to be effective, modelers and biologists need to work in close collaborations. A major contribution of the conference will be to provide a venue for such interdisciplinary collaboration. The PI will invite participants whose research involves model derivation, the mathematical analysis of models, the use of model simulations, and interfacing models with data and observations.

Such disturbances can have profound impacts on the structure of ecological communities (e.g. species diversity and abundance) and on the ecosystem services that those communities provide. Given the potential significance of such changes for human well-being, it is essential that we develop effective tools to predict these ecological and ecosystem impacts. Traditionally, the study of the resilience of ecological communities to severe environmental perturbations (e.g. hurricanes, floods) has focused on ecological processes. However, there is mounting evidence that feedbacks between the ecological and evolutionary processes (eco-evolutionary feedbacks) occur over commensurate time scales. This raises the possibility that evolutionary processes may play an important role in community resilience and species persistence. This project tackles the challenges posed by this possibility by developing a mathematical framework for analyzing models of disturbance which account for eco-evolutionary feedbacks and applying this framework to two real world systems whose properties have not been synthetically treated. In addition, this project will also support multiple outreach activities to K-12 education. <br/><br/>The investigators will develop new analytical methods models accounting for environmental stochasticity, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, and demographic stochasticity. Stochastic difference equations (SDEs) will be used to model eco-evolutionary feedbacks in disturbed habitats. For these SDEs, new methods will be developed for verifying persistence of species and exponential rates of convergence to positive stationary distributions (which provides a measure of resilience). For models also accounting for finite population sizes, large deviation methods will be used to prove that stochastic persistence for the mean field SDE implies that the mean time to extinction of any species or genotype increases exponentially with habitat size, and the meta-stable behavior of the system dynamics are characterized by the positive stationary distributions of the mean field SDE. These mathematical methods will be applied to a nested set of common models associated with two prominent empirical systems: Anolis lizards on Bahamian Islands recovering from hurricanes, and stickleback fish in streams on Vancouver Island recovering from catastrophic floods. Using such different model systems provides the unique opportunity to more readily find generalities and plays to the two systems' complementary experimental strengths. Field experiments and observations as well as existing data will be used to parameterize the individual-based eco-evolutionary models. These models will be used to examine the impact of an environmental disturbance on (1) local adaptation of a focal predator (Anolis or stickleback), (2) community resilience, (3) long-term species persistence, and (4) projections about the rate and nature of ecological and evolutionary recovery under present and future climatic conditions. For outreach, the investigators will run and develop material for the modelling in the life sciences cluster of the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science, will develop short educational videos about field research, ecology, and evolution for K-12 students in Austin, and create additional educational opportunities for local Bahamian school children in collaboration with Friends of the Environment (a Bahamian conservation organization)."

These methods are needed to help tumor biologists gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of the processes (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and migration) involved in tumor development, at the scales which influence their behavior. Because of this complexity, it has been challenging to functionally link cell and tissue scale processes, the knowledge of which is key to development of predictive multiscale tumor models. However, current models typically use ad-hoc rules to bridge between scales, which limits their predictive capability. This project will address this challenge by developing a new multiscale method where directly measurable quantities at the cell-scale inform the model parameters at the continuum tissue scale through rigorous, mathematical upscaling techniques. The multiscale model will be tested and validated by comparing simulation results against experimentally obtained information about the overall growth rates and spatiotemporal behaviors of the different cells and tumors. The new multiscale method will be used to study pancreatic tumors to elucidate the transition of pancreatic lesions into invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By integrating patient data analysis with quantitative tumor modeling, the project will develop reliable methods that can predict the likelihood of pancreatic cyst progression to PDAC using relatively non-invasive approaches. <br/><br/>The project team will develop a new class of multiscale models that bridge these scales non-phenomenologically through application of rigorous upscaling techniques in order to close the continuum equations at the tissue scale and provide an accurate description of the processes across both cell and tissue scales. Specifically, stochastic agent-based models at the cell-scale and continuum partial differential equation models at the tissue-scale will be developed. Consistent functional relationships between the variables at the tissue-scale and measurements at the cell-scale will be found by upscaling the discrete models by using and extending the framework of dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) to obtain multi-cell scale continuum equations that account for correlations among cells as well as biological processes such cell birth and death. Further upscaling to the tissue scale will be done by identifying and deriving equations for slowly varying variables. The consistency of the different models in domains where the scales overlap will be tested and validated. The new multiscale method will be applied to model the progression of pancreatic neoplasms into invasive carcinomas in order to estimate the probability of this progression. Large-scale human patient datasets of pancreatic lesions, provided by our consultants through a separately funded project, will be used to validate and refine the models. The project will enhance the cross disciplinary training of students."

This is the eleventh in a very successful conference series on emerging statistical and computational issues in genetics and genomics. The impetus for this year's theme comes from the increasing amount of data that provide information on the nuclear organization of the human genome and its applications. A series of ""chromatin confirmation capture"" techniques, such as Hi-C, have been developed for identifying three-dimensional interactions between all pairs of genomic loci at once. Profiling such three-dimensional interactions is critical for a full understanding of gene regulation.  With increasingly refined technology and decreasing sequencing costs, it is now possible to generate high-resolution datasets with close to a billion sequencing reads, on the same order as human whole-genome sequencing.  The scientific community is on the verge of generating massive amounts of Hi-C and related types of data. The conference will deal with key aspects in analyzing and interpreting these large and complex datasets. The conference is open to the whole research community and particularly encourages participation of junior faculty and researchers, postdoctoral fellows, students, and women and minorities. The participants will discuss and critique existing quantitative methods, discuss in-depth emerging statistical and quantitative issues, and identify priorities for future research in the analysis of higher order chromatin interaction data. The research presented will be broadly disseminated in publications in scientific journals and websites.  <br/><br/>The conference will focus on the following three topics of critical importance in quantitative analysis of higher order chromatin interaction data: (1) emerging technologies; (2) computational challenges in high order chromatin data; and (3) applications to basic biology and disease mechanisms.

The activities that this project is based upon recognize the fundamental importance of the interplay between modeling and simulation for most real-life applications. Modeling involves identifying the fundamental components of a problem and posing them in mathematical terms. Simulation solves the mathematical problems thus posed using computers to make quantitative predictions. <br/>Both modeling and simulation will be used to investigate a wide variety of phenomena in physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology, such as how microorganisms swim, how blood flows in the heart, the unusual properties of suspensions of bacteria or active particles, and how to efficiently design new materials. A unique element of the project is an experimental laboratory (Applied Mathematics Laboratory at the Courant Institute) that will provide raw data and motivation for mathematical models and simulations as well as measurements for quantitative validation. The Courant Institute is particularly well-positioned for this enterprise. Since early on, the Institute had a strong emphasis in applied mathematics, with modeling and simulation at its core. This research and training project will increase the number of U.S. citizens, nationals, and permanent residents who are well prepared to undertake careers that require a thorough understanding of applied and computational mathematics, not only in academics, as is the case with many educational mathematics programs, but also in business, industry, and government.<br/> <br/>This RTG program will emphasize the connections among modeling, simulation and experimental observation. The project, coordinated by five Co-PIs, will provide academic-year and summer funding for a growing number of Ph.D. students, starting from three and increasing to six by the end of the project, two postdoctoral scholars per year, as well as a number of undergraduate summer internships, for a duration of five years. The project will support the formation of a vertically-integrated activity which integrates a new research course, a seminar on oral and written presentation, a collaborative research seminar, visitor seminars and undergraduate summer research activities. A unifying theme of the study of passive and active particle suspensions will be used to build collaborations among computational scientists at Courant, the Applied Mathematics Laboratory, and the Soft Condensed Matter physics group at NYU's Physics Department. This research theme and the associated collaborations will serve as a framework for investigating other themes. For all themes, the research activities in this project will train students and postdocs to work in a multidisciplinary environment in which they have access to world leading experts in several disciplines. Furthermore, this research is expected to have substantial scientific impacts and to lead to new discoveries and potential applications.

These are the blood clots responsible for most heart attacks and many strokes, and understanding how they can form under the extreme physical conditions in a stenotic artery may lead to new ideas for how to prevent them. The very fast blood flow in severely stenosed arteries means that many of the well-studied processes responsible for blood clotting in more physiologically typical situations can play at most a minor role in these arteries. Recent experiments, including ones from the laboratory of one of the current investigators, suggest the importance of a specific flow-sensitive protein in the blood in allowing blood platelets to clump together to form a clot in stenotic arteries. This project involves incorporating the hypothesized role of this protein into a novel and sophisticated computational model of arterial blood clot formation, developed by this project's other investigators, and to use the expanded model to characterize the conditions under which that protein's known properties could explain clot formation in stenotic arteries.  Through comparisons of the new model's predictions with further laboratory experiments, the model will be refined and its predictive capabilities improved, and our understanding of how blood clots form under the extreme physical conditions in stenotic arteries will be increased.  Because the challenges of forming a blood clot under the conditions in a stenotic artery are similar to those of stanching hemorrhage from a major artery, understanding of how such clots form may also aid in development of interventions to limit bleeding following trauma.<br/><br/>Most arterial blood clots are formed by the adhesion of blood cells known as platelets to an injured blood vessel wall and by platelets? cohesion to one another. Platelet adhesion and cohesion are both accomplished through the formation of molecular bonds that involve specific proteins on the platelets? surfaces binding to other specific proteins on the vascular wall or in the blood plasma. To hold the platelets together, the bonds must collectively be able to withstand the forces imposed on the platelet clump by the blood flow.   For many types of platelet-platelet bonds, a platelet can form that type of bond only if the platelet has already become activated in response to appropriate chemical or physical stimuli. The platelet activation process takes time.   For a platelet moving through a highly constricted artery, there is not enough time to respond to activation stimuli and the forces that the fluid exerts on it if it tries to attach to the vessel wall are enormous.   How clots form in this situation is poorly understood, but recent experiments lead to the hypothesis that bonds mediated by a uniquely flow-sensitive protein (von Willebrand factor) in the blood are critical. This project will explore that hypothesis through a combination of mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and laboratory experimentation. A novel multiphase model will be developed of the mechanical interactions between a viscous fluid representing the blood and a permeable, viscoelastic, fracturable material representing a growing platelet clot. Development of robust and efficient numerical methods will allow exploration of the model?s behavior. Model results will be compared with results from an in vitro physical model of a stenotic artery.   The comparison will lead to model refinements and to the design and interpretation of the physical experiments. Such interplay between modeling and experiments provides a powerful engine for driving scientific discovery."

Through this award the principal investigator will provide a solid modeling platform and develop and analyze the computational tools that are needed for better understanding the behavior of biofilm formation and interaction with the microenvironment. For example,  biofilms can be present in water systems affecting pipes and filters, and they can also be found in chronic wounds and infected prosthetic joints and heart valves, causing resistance to antibiotic use and then requiring further surgical interventions and prosthesis replacement. The  computational methods developed in this research will provide an additional inexpensive and powerful method that compliments the work done by experimentalists. The computational algorithms and software tools are sufficiently general that they may be applied to other problems in science and engineering that present similar challenges. An interesting example is to better understand how bacteriophage adhere to mucus as a way to provide a nonhost-derived immunity. Improved insights provided through computational modeling have the potential to lead to the creation of new kinds of antibiotics. <br/><br/>The principal investigator (PI) aims to develop numerical techniques for the solutions of equations that model heterogeneous soft living materials arising in biology. The focus is on biofilms and mucosal surfaces, and their interactions with surrounding fluid and biological agents, e.g. bacteria and viruses.  Multiphase living materials are characterized by adhesive forces, they have viscoelastic properties and can diffuse, grow, deform or shear. The PI plans to focus on computational tools for solving the energy driven Cahn-Hilliard type equations describing phase separation and sharp diffusive interfaces, coupled with fluid flow equations. Interacting biological agents introduce heterogeneities and discontinuities into multiphase systems, highlighting the need for the design of a robust computational framework that couples continuous and discrete models. The PI aims to develop integrated methods for addressing challenges particular to heterogeneous biomaterials. He aims to combine high order discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretizations, in conjunction with time and spatial adaptivity, for analyzing the solution of the underlying systems while accounting for discontinuities, nonlinearities and moving sharp interior interfaces.  Unconditionally energy stable and locally mass conservative schemes will be used to model long time dynamics. The resulting ill-conditioned nonlinear algebraic systems will be solved using efficient solvers based on multigrid techniques that exploit the specific local structure stemming from the choice of discretization. The development of computational tools that resolve these issues can lead to a better understanding of the factors that impact the evolution of soft biological systems. The efficient nonlinear and spatiotemporally adaptive solvers proposed will apply to even more general equations and will therefore advance the field of numerical nonlinear partial differential equations."

For instance, a neuron may fire only when all of its input neurons fire synchronously, or the electrical grid may crash only when demands of multiple users become synchronized, producing total-usage spikes. Ecosystems can show this type of dependency on synchrony. Ecosystems include multiple trophic levels, with population signals from lower levels often being spatially aggregated to affect higher levels and human concerns such as fisheries. For instance, a predator is only harmed if its prey are scarce over its whole hunting area. And human fish exploitation is only reduced if fish decline synchronously everywhere. For systems of this type, it is primarily the synchronous components of signals that matter in the average signal that affects the next hierarchical level - non-synchronous components tend to cancel in the spatial average. Thus, spatial synchrony of population dynamics is very important to ecosystem dynamics generally. Spatial synchrony of population dynamics has been widely observed in organisms as diverse as mammals and protists, at distances up to thousands of kilometers. Synchrony is closely related to large-scale outbreaks and shortages. Synchrony has conservation implications because populations are at greater risk of simultaneous extinction if they are simultaneously rare. But in spite of the importance of synchrony in ecology, possible impacts of climate change on synchrony are very little studied. In this context, climate change constitutes not just warming, but also changes in other statistical aspects of environmental signals. It is also unknown the extent to which synchrony, and climate-change-induced changes therein, can be transmitted through predator-prey interacts and hence throughout entire food webs in complex patterns. The goals of this research are: (1) to develop mathematical models and statistics to build understanding of how potential changes in synchrony induced by climate change will ramify through complex ecosystems; (2) and to develop mathematical models and use them to understand the consequences of changes in synchrony for a widely observed empirical pattern called Taylor's law, a phenomenon fundamental to spatial ecology and applied in a variety of areas including fisheries management, conservation, and agriculture. Researchers will also strive, as time allows, to understand the consequences of changes in synchrony for species extinction risk.<br/><br/>To meet goal (1) above, the researchers will perform stochastic-process modeling in a network context, to understand how changes in synchrony should theoretically cascade through complex species interaction networks; and will develop statistical methods combining wavelets and statistical path analysis, to be used to help infer how synchrony cascades through empirical interaction networks. A vector autoregressive moving average modelling framework will be constructed consisting of multiple habitat patches, with several species interacting within patches, migrating between patches, and being affected by a stochastic environment in each patch. For each species independently, dispersal and/or environmental synchronizing effects can be independently set to act directly on the species as synchronizing influences, or not. A given species may also be synchronized through its interactions with other synchronized species. The primary utility of the models is to make it possible to derive analytically, for each species, the relative importance of these direct and trophically-mediated synchronizing effects, thereby understanding the nature of trophic transmission of synchrony through the network. To meet goal (2) above, researchers will use the theory of ergodic stationary stochastic processes to represent population levels at different locations. If time allows, consequences of synchrony for extinction risk will be assessed through mathematical analysis within a classic stochastic matrix modelling framework, expanded to represent multiple populations across space."

Since 2009, the conference has showcased the wide array of undergraduate research in mathematical biology, has provided students a chance to practice their scientific presentation skills in front of a supportive audience of peers, and has given students a venue to network with others having similar interests. In addition, two invited lectures by inspiring leaders in research at the interface of mathematics and biology will teach students about current research in this area. About 100 participants will attend the conference, many from traditionally under-represented groups in mathematics and biology. Since the conference emphasizes networking and reaching as many students as possible,  the conference format allows the possibility of all student participants to have the valuable experience of presenting their choice of a research talk or poster to peers. The event strengthens exchanges between the mathematical sciences and life science disciplines, as many of the projects are presented by student teams of math and life science majors. It is not uncommon to hear from life science students attending the conference that their eyes have been further opened to the usefulness of mathematics for making exciting progress in biological questions, and for mathematics students to be inspired by encountering new applications for their mathematical tools of which they were previously unaware.<br/><br/>The NIMBioS URC's primary objective is to provide opportunities for undergraduates from across the country to share their research at the interface of biology and mathematics to peers and faculty mentors. Between 50 and 70 contributed student talks and posters will be featured. Student abstracts will be gathered into a program book and published on the NIMBioS conference website. Students present their own work that uses mathematical, statistical and computational approaches to address challenging questions in the life sciences in areas of molecular biology, biochemistry, epidemiology, immunology, ecology, and more. Participants' work comes from summer or academic year research experiences supported by agencies such as the NSF, the National Institutes of Health, the National Security Administration or through their home institutions, allowing for excellent cross-pollination of ideas from different programs. These young researchers will receive helpful feedback and have their eyes opened to the variety of applications for mathematical tools in biology as well as the opportunities biological problems provide for exciting advances in mathematics. Sharing information about recent research and forming new connections may result in significant progress in undergraduate mathematical biology research programs, enriching the research programs of faculty mentors. The conference's secondary goals are to provide students with career and graduate school information and opportunities to network. Each conference hosts a panel discussion on career opportunities, a graduate school showcase, and ample networking opportunities through shared meals, frequent breaks, and an organized networking game. The conference provides a valuable opportunity for students to develop their identities as researchers, and the interest in this conference has continued as there are many more qualified applicants applying for travel support each year than there are funds available."

This activity as well as the natural wiring of the nervous system shapes the spontaneous behavior of our brains and this spontaneous activity strongly modulates the sensory inputs.  In this project, computational and mathematical models of neurons (the cells that make up the brain) are used to understand what kinds of spontaneous behavior are possible, how this depends on the wiring and how this activity interacts with sensory inputs. The ongoing and evoked behavior is carefully controlled by a balance of positive (excitatory) and negative (inhibitory) influences. The loss of this balance can disrupt normal behavior and lead to diseases such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. Mathematical models of the nervous system provide a way to test hypotheses put forth by experimenalists and to also suggest new experiments based on the predictions of these models.  <br/><br/>Ongoing activity in the nervous system and how it impacts sensory and other inputs is the subject of much recent experimental activity. In particular, it is clear that the intrinsic interactions between neuronal circuits in absence of inputs can have a strong impact on how the system responds to incoming stimuli even at the large scale cognitive level. Thus, nonlinear dynamics methods will be applied to problems in theoretical neuroscience dealing with this question. Various forms of spatiotemporal activity are observed in experiments which include spatially localized activity, oscillations, and propagating waves. Perturbation and numerical methods will be used to analyze the dynamics of these patterns when subjected to various stimuli such as flickering light, localized or moving stimuli, and spatially periodic patterns. Uniform flickering stimuli lead to the perception of moving geometric patterns and these can be explained by the analysis of mean field models of visual cortex. In collaboration with an experimental group we will use the modeling to make predictions about how this percept is altered as parameters of the flicker vary. Related to this is the appearance of flicker when presented with high contrast spatially periodic patterns. Stability of the steady periodic state will be studied in order to see if the appearance of oscillations is the result of a Hopf bifurcation. This effect may also offer an explanation for why some images (such as op art) can induce visual discomfort.  The existence an properties of traveling waves in nonlocally connected networks will also be studied in this project."

These include receptors and other large protein molecules that enable the cell to sense its environment. For example, cells that function as part of the immune system can sense extra-cellular molecular signals of infection. The cell surface is also a highly dynamic environment, and the movement and interactions of surface molecules play a crucial role in the response to extra-cellular signals. Mathematical modeling enables researchers to study these complex, dynamic, molecular processes in more detail than is currently afforded by experiments. The investigators will develop new mathematical approaches and computer simulation methods tailored to the study of how molecular motion on crowded cell surfaces influences cellular processes. The developed tools will enable researchers to predict the sequence of molecular events that initiate cell-cell interface formation and signaling processes. By enabling computational testing of novel strategies for biomolecular/cellular engineering, these tools will open up new means of discovery in areas such as immunotherapeutics. The investigators will contribute to broadening science participation by training undergraduate researchers in mathematical biology and scientific computing, and will carry out pedagogical activities with middle school students from groups underrepresented in science. <br/><br/>The specific focus of this research will be on modeling stochastic rare events in molecular diffusion. In many circumstances where molecular crowding occurs, un-crowding may also be critical. For example, in T cells, many large surface molecules must evacuate from a local region of the cell surface to allow for the T cell to interact with its target. This collective evacuation is a rare event relative to the timescale of individual molecular diffusion. The goal of this project is to develop a framework to study stochastic evacuation, including in rare event limits, and apply this framework to the T cell surface. Specific aims of this project are to: (1) Develop a combined asymptotic and computational rare event framework to solve diffusional evacuation in simple scenarios. (2) Develop enhanced spatially-distributed rare event methods capable of simulating complex scenarios. (3) Use the developed tools to understand how T cell surface molecules overcome or exploit rare evacuation. The mathematical novelty of this project is: the extension of asymptotic methods to effectively high-dimensional problems; the extension of computational rare event sampling methods, not only handling space but harnessing it; and the creation of synergies between asymptotic and computational approaches in a novel combined framework."

Experimental data show striking similarities between the pathways of topology simplification in newly replicated circular DNA plasmids by recombination and those in interlinked fluid vortices thus pointing to a universal process of unlinking by local reconnection. A drive toward topological simplification is ubiquitous in nature and this work will develop a mathematical understanding of the laws underlying it. Enzymes such as topoisomerases and recombinases are DNA-binding proteins able simplify the topology of circular DNA. They act by local crossing changes and local reconnection. The main objective of this project is to characterize the topological mechanism of DNA topology simplification using knot theory, low-dimensional topology and computer simulations. In pursuit of this research objective, the central hypothesis is that under normal conditions topoisomerases and recombinases follow optimal topological pathways of DNA unknotting and unlinking. The principal investigator will test this hypothesis through two specific aims.  (1) Use techniques from low-dimensional topology, to find possible topological pathways of DNA unknotting and unlinking by type II topoisomerases and by recombinases. (2) Conduct computer simulations of DNA topology simplification by signed crossing changes and by local reconnection and explore connections to genome architecture. The PI and her group will be involved in a variety of dissemination and outreach activities, and are committed to increasing diversity in the Mathematical Sciences. <br/><br/>The research will produce rigorous mathematical models for DNA unknotting and unlinking by local reconnection and signed crossing change, which will contribute to our understanding of the unknotting and unlinking mechanisms by topoisomerases and by recombinases. The enzymatic action can be modeled as local crossing changes, and as coherent or non-coherent band surgery, respectively. Assuming a chiral enzymatic action, this project will study signed crossing changes and characterize knots that can be unknotted with a single type of crossing change. Different minimal multi-step reconnection pathways will be identified between given pairs of knots or links. The research will extend results related to the nugatory crossing conjecture and analogous open questions in knot theory, which concerns the characterization of crossing changes and non-coherent band surgeries, which preserve the topological knot type. The proposed project will develop a computer model (a multiple Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm) where DNA recombination at inversely repeated sites is modeled as non-coherent band surgery. The principal investigator will compute minimal recombination pathways and assess the efficiency of this form of topology simplification under different geometric and topological filters. Via simulations, the research will determine the transition probability networks for each method and choice of parameters for the models developed for signed crossing change and recombination of DNA. This will provide a ranking of the nodes and identify topology types with high-connectivity. An important focus is placed on the interplay of strand-passage and reconnection events."

Such disturbances can have profound impacts on the structure of ecological communities (e.g. species diversity and abundance) and on the ecosystem services that those communities provide. Given the potential significance of such changes for human well-being, it is essential that we develop effective tools to predict these ecological and ecosystem impacts. Traditionally, the study of the resilience of ecological communities to severe environmental perturbations (e.g. hurricanes, floods) has focused on ecological processes. However, there is mounting evidence that feedbacks between the ecological and evolutionary processes (eco-evolutionary feedbacks) occur over commensurate time scales. This raises the possibility that evolutionary processes may play an important role in community resilience and species persistence. This project tackles the challenges posed by this possibility by developing a mathematical framework for analyzing models of disturbance which account for eco-evolutionary feedbacks and applying this framework to two real world systems whose properties have not been synthetically treated. In addition, this project will also support multiple outreach activities to K-12 education. <br/><br/>The investigators will develop new analytical methods models accounting for environmental stochasticity, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, and demographic stochasticity. Stochastic difference equations (SDEs) will be used to model eco-evolutionary feedbacks in disturbed habitats. For these SDEs, new methods will be developed for verifying persistence of species and exponential rates of convergence to positive stationary distributions (which provides a measure of resilience). For models also accounting for finite population sizes, large deviation methods will be used to prove that stochastic persistence for the mean field SDE implies that the mean time to extinction of any species or genotype increases exponentially with habitat size, and the meta-stable behavior of the system dynamics are characterized by the positive stationary distributions of the mean field SDE. These mathematical methods will be applied to a nested set of common models associated with two prominent empirical systems: Anolis lizards on Bahamian Islands recovering from hurricanes, and stickleback fish in streams on Vancouver Island recovering from catastrophic floods. Using such different model systems provides the unique opportunity to more readily find generalities and plays to the two systems' complementary experimental strengths. Field experiments and observations as well as existing data will be used to parameterize the individual-based eco-evolutionary models. These models will be used to examine the impact of an environmental disturbance on (1) local adaptation of a focal predator (Anolis or stickleback), (2) community resilience, (3) long-term species persistence, and (4) projections about the rate and nature of ecological and evolutionary recovery under present and future climatic conditions. For outreach, the investigators will run and develop material for the modelling in the life sciences cluster of the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science, will develop short educational videos about field research, ecology, and evolution for K-12 students in Austin, and create additional educational opportunities for local Bahamian school children in collaboration with Friends of the Environment (a Bahamian conservation organization)."

These channels are formed by specialized proteins synthesized by each cell and embedded in their membranes. The activity that one can record from these cells (such as rhythmic oscillations) is expected to vary if the number of these channel-proteins varies. Yet, neurons of the same type have been observed to express extremely variable numbers of each channel-protein type, and thus extremely variable electrical currents flowing across their membranes, with relatively minimal effects on their activity (e.g., their oscillation frequency). Whether their existence ensures that the activity of these cells will be similar, and what the consequences for network function are, remains largely unclear. The general goal of this project is to examine what features of neuronal activity are regulated by electrical current correlations, whether these features of activity are propagated to the networks they form part of, and what universal principles or mechanisms these relationships obey. The results of this project are expected to have impact in various areas of mathematical biology, and the project will promote interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students through involvement in the research.<br/><br/>High variability in the levels of ionic conductance expressed by identical neurons have been observed in a number of preparations. In some of the same preparations, a tendency of some of the ionic conductances to co-vary has been identified. This co-variation appears as correlations of these currents in populations of neurons, which are thought to lead to the generation of very similar types of activity despite the variability of individual currents, in a sort of homeostatic scaling of these currents. This project will test the hypothesis that the existence of correlations among subsets of ionic currents determines a stable and robust neuronal activity, and that this effect propagates to the level of the networks. The features of activity affected by these correlations are expected to lie close to so-called level sets of activity for the oscillation attributes (e.g., frequency, amplitude, duty cycle). The mathematical concept of level sets has been applied to dynamical neuronal systems to a limited degree and only at the level of single neurons. The project team will investigate the mechanisms of generation of level sets, particularly related to the existence of ionic current correlations, in single neurons of a well-known neuronal network (the crustacean pyloric network). This project will (i) extend this to determine the consequences of their existence for network dynamics, (ii) determine if there are universal mechanisms, understandable in terms of classes of ionic current properties rather than individual current properties, that determine the emergence of level sets, and (iii) investigate what other factors determine the existence of level sets besides the amplitude of the conductances. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in a multidisciplinary investigation of the properties of neuronal systems, including computations, dynamical systems theory, and experiments."

The speed of evolution depends on such factors as the severity of natural selection, the rate of mutation, and the size of the population. This project focuses on the effects of spatial structure: the way a population is spread out within its habitat.  Previous research has shown that some structures speed up evolution while others slow it down. The investigators will use mathematical modeling to gain a deeper understanding of why, and under what conditions, spatial structure can change the rate of evolution. Undergraduate students, including those from groups typically underrepresented in STEM, will be trained in mathematical modeling and engaged in all aspects of the research process. Results of this investigation may inform the estimation of important events in our evolutionary past, such as when humans split from our closest primate relatives. This work may also aid our understanding of cancer, which can be seen as unwanted evolution occurring inside the body. <br/><br/>Mathematically, the rate of evolution in spatially structured populations can be studied using evolutionary graph theory. Spatial structure is represented as a graph (or network), in which individuals occupy vertices and edges indicate spatial relationships. Evolution is modeled as a stochastic process driven by birth and death events, leading to the fixation or extinction of new genetic mutations. A decade of research has shown that graph topology can affect both the rate at which mutations accrue and the balance of selection versus drift. However, exact results are known only for very simple graphs, and few general theorems have been proven.  Additionally, evolutionary graph theory is so far limited to haploid, asexual populations.  This project will apply new analytical techniques to evolutionary graph theory, and extend the theory to include sexually reproducing diploid populations."

Climate, weather, and aquatic ecosystems such as streams and lakes are intimately connected to each other.  This is especially true in mountain regions where glaciers as well as permanent and seasonal snowpack have major effects on physical (temperature), chemical (nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus), and biological (microbes, algae, fish) features of streams and lakes.  However, mountain environments are experiencing very rapid changes in climate, even more pronounced than global averages. Since mountain regions are like humanity's ""water towers"", we need a better understanding of what these changing environmental conditions mean for the quantity and quality of our water supply.  To best advance this understanding, scientists in different regions need to compare their findings and share their best practices of analysis and discovery. This project will support an intensive interdisciplinary workshop in which scientists, mathematicians, and engineers from the USA and China will meet to share data, develop collaborations, and make plans for further work to advance our understanding of how a changing alpine environment might affect lakes and streams and thus our water resources.<br/><br/>Ongoing climate variation is having major physical, chemical, and biological impacts on global ecosystems. Aquatic ecosystems in mountain regions are especially impacted due to amplified temperature increases observed at high elevation and due to the sensitivity of key cryospheric components (glaciers, snowpack) to changes in temperature and precipitation. The ongoing changes in the cryosphere are widespread, complex, and affect a variety of key parameters for alpine lakes and streams such as temperature, transparency, discharge, and nutrient supply. The roles of natural variability versus external forcing in driving observed changes in snow and glacier distributions, as well as high elevation energy, water, weather, and biogeochemical cycles, need to be investigated. Documenting, understanding, and forecasting these impacts is challenging and requires broad interdisciplinary collaborations. To address these global challenges, this workshop will bring together experts in limnology, meteorology, atmospheric science, and hydrology as well as data science and mathematical modeling from both the USA and China to coordinate research, share key findings, identify major unanswered questions, and establish a network for future collaboration.

A major milestone in the understanding of protein behavior emerged with the advent of the ""new view"" of protein folding. This perspective conceives of protein structure, stability, and dynamics as governed by a molecular-level landscape not unlike a relief map describing the surface of the Earth. Each point on the landscape - analogous to latitude and longitude - corresponds to a particular spatial arrangement of protein atoms. The altitude of each point on the map defines protein stability - unstable conformations lie on mountaintops and stable conformations within valley floors. Determining these landscapes is a key goal of protein biology since they are useful in the understanding of natural proteins and design of synthetic proteins as drugs, enzymes, and molecular machines. It is relatively straightforward to calculate these landscapes for small proteins using computer simulations, but it has not been possible to do so from experimental measurements. It is the primary objective of this research to combine mathematical tools from the modeling of dynamical systems with machine learning approaches to analyze high-dimensional datasets to determine approximate protein folding landscapes directly from experimental data. The approach will first be validated in computer simulations of small proteins where the folding landscape is known. Theoretical analyses will place bounds on how close the approximate landscapes are to the true landscapes, and place conditions on the experimental data required for their determination. Ultimately the approach will be applied to experimental measurements of a tuberculosis protein. The computational analysis tool will be released as user-friendly software for free public download. Positive research experiences have great benefits for undergraduate success and retention, and this award will support summer and academic year research opportunities. New educational outreach materials will be developed for the University of Illinois ""Engineering Open House"" to promote awareness of materials science and engineering among middle- and high-school students.<br/><br/>The aim of this work is to integrate nonlinear manifold learning with dynamical systems theory to reconstruct protein folding landscapes from experimental time series measuring a single system observable. The ""new view"" of protein folding revolutionized understanding of folding as a conformational search over rugged and funneled free energy landscapes parameterized by a small number of emergent collective variables, with transformative implications for the understanding and design of proteins as drugs, enzymes, and molecular machines. It is now relatively routine to determine multidimensional folding landscapes from computer simulations in which all atomic coordinates are known, but it has not been possible to do so from experimental measurements of protein dynamics that are restricted to small numbers of coarse-grained observables. This research project integrates Takens' delay embeddings with nonlinear manifold learning using diffusion maps to first project univariate time series in an experimentally measurable observable into a high-dimensional space in which the dynamics are C1-equivalent to those in real space, and then extract from this space a topologically and geometrically equivalent reconstruction of the folding funnel to that which would have been determined from knowledge of all atomic coordinates. The reconstructed landscape preserves the topology of the true funnel - the metastable configurations and folding pathways - but the topography may be perturbed, i.e., the heights and depths of the free energy peaks and valleys. The three primary objectives of this work are to (i) validate the approach in molecular dynamics simulations of small proteins for which the true landscape is known, (ii) place conditions on the sampling resolution and signal-to-noise ratio in experimental measurements for robust landscape recovery, and theoretical bounds on the induced topographical perturbations, and (iii) apply the approach to experimental single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements on the lid-opening and closing dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase (Mtb-PtpB)."

These are the blood clots responsible for most heart attacks and many strokes, and understanding how they can form under the extreme physical conditions in a stenotic artery may lead to new ideas for how to prevent them. The very fast blood flow in severely stenosed arteries means that many of the well-studied processes responsible for blood clotting in more physiologically typical situations can play at most a minor role in these arteries. Recent experiments, including ones from the laboratory of one of the current investigators, suggest the importance of a specific flow-sensitive protein in the blood in allowing blood platelets to clump together to form a clot in stenotic arteries. This project involves incorporating the hypothesized role of this protein into a novel and sophisticated computational model of arterial blood clot formation, developed by this project's other investigators, and to use the expanded model to characterize the conditions under which that protein's known properties could explain clot formation in stenotic arteries.  Through comparisons of the new model's predictions with further laboratory experiments, the model will be refined and its predictive capabilities improved, and our understanding of how blood clots form under the extreme physical conditions in stenotic arteries will be increased.  Because the challenges of forming a blood clot under the conditions in a stenotic artery are similar to those of stanching hemorrhage from a major artery, understanding of how such clots form may also aid in development of interventions to limit bleeding following trauma.<br/><br/>Most arterial blood clots are formed by the adhesion of blood cells known as platelets to an injured blood vessel wall and by platelets? cohesion to one another. Platelet adhesion and cohesion are both accomplished through the formation of molecular bonds that involve specific proteins on the platelets? surfaces binding to other specific proteins on the vascular wall or in the blood plasma. To hold the platelets together, the bonds must collectively be able to withstand the forces imposed on the platelet clump by the blood flow.   For many types of platelet-platelet bonds, a platelet can form that type of bond only if the platelet has already become activated in response to appropriate chemical or physical stimuli. The platelet activation process takes time.   For a platelet moving through a highly constricted artery, there is not enough time to respond to activation stimuli and the forces that the fluid exerts on it if it tries to attach to the vessel wall are enormous.   How clots form in this situation is poorly understood, but recent experiments lead to the hypothesis that bonds mediated by a uniquely flow-sensitive protein (von Willebrand factor) in the blood are critical. This project will explore that hypothesis through a combination of mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and laboratory experimentation. A novel multiphase model will be developed of the mechanical interactions between a viscous fluid representing the blood and a permeable, viscoelastic, fracturable material representing a growing platelet clot. Development of robust and efficient numerical methods will allow exploration of the model?s behavior. Model results will be compared with results from an in vitro physical model of a stenotic artery.   The comparison will lead to model refinements and to the design and interpretation of the physical experiments. Such interplay between modeling and experiments provides a powerful engine for driving scientific discovery."

Mathematical models, validated and informed by experimental data, have made important contributions to the understanding of interactions between virus, cells, and immune responses. However, new data emerge and update our understanding of the biology underlying these processes. Sometimes the analysis of new data generates conflicting results. This project will develop and analyze new models, compare them with experimental data, explain potential discrepancies generated by new data, and address the implications to therapy and vaccine development. The first part of this project develops multi-scale models to study hepatitis C virus (HCV) dynamics in patients treated with new antiviral drugs. These models include both intracellular viral replication and extracellular cell infection. The second part of the project develops comprehensive immune models to elucidate the mechanisms in controlling HIV, a virus that causes AIDS in humans. The modeling predictions will be compared with experimental data to determine the relative roles of target cell availability and specific immune mechanisms in viral control.<br/> <br/>This project will generate modeling, computational, and data analysis methods in quantitative studies of virus infection and immune responses. The multi-scale virus models will establish a theoretical framework for studying viral dynamics in patients treated with new drugs and will investigate the emergence of drug resistance. This can help to develop more effective combination therapy and improve cure rates. Such combination strategies have achieved a great success in the management of HIV infection. The comprehensive immune models developed in this project will address fundamental questions in immunology, e.g.,  how the immune system controls viral load and why some monkeys can live with an HIV-like virus without progressing to AIDS. The results may suggest effective strategies for the development of future virus vaccines and immune-based therapies. This interdisciplinary research will provide extensive training opportunities to students from diverse backgrounds at levels from high school to graduate school.  This project includes extensive collaborations with experimentalists which will provide mathematics students with a broad range of training opportunities in the biomedical field. The interdisciplinary collaboration will also help to improve the dissemination of the project's results to a broad scientific audience.<br/>"
