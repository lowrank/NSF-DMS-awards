Given the complexities involved, there is no doubt that mathematical modeling will play an increasingly important role in meeting this challenge. The assembled team of investigators has recently developed a whole-cell modeling framework in which cellular biochemical dynamics and changes in cell morphology are inter-dependent, and have used it to construct a simple self-replicating cell model in which an established mechanism of eukaryotic cell cycle regulation is incorporated. The resulting system can produce stable self-replicating behavior, with cytoplasm volume and membrane surface area doubling in synchrony with the periodicity in component concentrations. Because the biochemical dynamics of processes that affect changes in cell morphology in vivo can be modeled, exploring in vivo mechanisms by which growing and dividing cells ""pinch"" during the division process (cytokinesis) is possible. Towards this end, the objective of the proposed project is to model cytokinesis as it occurs in animal cells and to compare such models to the known cytokinetic behavior of real cells. Cytokinesis occurs near the end of mitosis, and involves the rapid assembly and contraction of a membrane-associated actomyosin ring located at the cell equator. Cytokinesis is exquisitely choreographed with other mitotic events, such that the ring assembles as anaphase begins and daughter chromatids begin to separate. The ring contracts as the chromatids separate, and the ring completes contraction soon after separation is complete. The choreography of these terminal events of mitosis will be modeled. Biochemical reactions and kinetic parameters will be assumed based on what is known experimentally. Once developed, cytokinesis models will be installed into the existing whole-cell model in which cell cycle regulation is treated explicitly. In this way, cytokinesis can be modeled within an in vivo setting. Cell morphology changes involved in cell growth and division will also be estimated by minimizing membrane bending energies. In real cells, membrane composition is altered at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, and this aspect will be modeled and analyzed for its ability to promote cell division. These aspects will be integrated into a self-replicating whole-cell model to observe ""pinching"" behavior about its equator as the cell divides. All of this will be driven by an explicit biochemical mechanism and synchronized with other cell cycle events. The complexity of the models will be scaled in proportion to what is known experimentally, such that they will be closely connected to reality, possess predictive ability, and thus be useful to experimentalists. Models will be analyzed to assess the importance of a cytoskeletal contractile ring vs. local changes in membrane composition in effecting cytokinesis. This integrative approach results in a mathematical model which couples a system of ordinary and partial differential equations with a constrained minimization problem (associated with the determination of cell shape). The primary mathematical challenges stem from the need to determine system parameters within physically realistic ranges so that the solution to the mathematical model exhibits physically reasonable, stable self-replicating behavior. The project is significant because of the novelty of modeling animal-cell cytokinetics on the biochemical/mechanistic level and under both in vitro and in vivo settings. In the broadest sense, the project will assess the feasibility of building a comprehensive cell model piecemeal by designing individual cellular ""modules"" in vitro and installing them into a whole-cell frame once appropriate in vitro behavior is observed. Ultimately a comprehensive molecular-level cell model will be required to explore the pathogenesis of many human diseases, especially cancer, and to test the intended and unintended metabolic effects of new pharmaceuticals.<br/><br/>Living cells can be simplistically viewed as tiny sacs filled with water, salts and molecules such as DNA and proteins. One of the most fundamental aspects of such cells is their ability to self-replicate. To do this, a cell must grow to twice its original size, make a second copy of its DNA, move each copy of the DNA to different ends of the cell, and finally divide around its middle to form two cells. During the last part of this process (technically called ""cytokinesis""), the cell constructs a little belt around its middle, but on the inside of itself such that the belt cannot be seen from the outside of the cell. This internal belt is constructed of many protein units of the same type, linked end-to-end like a stacked set of sticky blocks. Also, the belt is tied to the surface (called a membrane) of the cell. When the cell sends a signal to this belt, the belt starts to tighten around the belly of the cell (by removing blocks, one at a time) and it pulls the membrane in with it. This squeezing doesn't stop until the belt has constricted to a very small circumference, the membrane has pinched completely and two cells are made. The investigators have recently developed a new mathematical approach to modeling cell growth and division at the level of molecules reacting. In this project, this approach will be used to investigate the fine details (at the molecular level) of how this belt is assembled and how it squeezes. Another factor that appears to help this pinching process occur has to do with the types of molecules in the membrane right at the region where the belt is attached. Experiments have shown that the molecules in this region are different from those in the rest of the membrane, but no one understands why they are different. A second aspect of this project will be to investigate this question. Membranes are generally most stable when they are flat rather then bent. This pinching process during cell division requires that they bend a lot, which suggests that pinching might require a lot of energy.  It is suspected that the different molecules found in this region help the membrane bend without requiring so much energy. Again, using a mathematical modeling approach, the researchers will investigate whether this might explain why different types of molecules are found in this region. These processes are not only significant from the perspective of basic cell biology, they are also involved in understanding diseases such as cancer. Cancerous cells grow and divide uncontrollably--something has gone awry with the cell division process described above. Modeling these processes using mathematics and computers is important because these processes are so complicated that it is literally impossible for any person to keep track of all the factors and understand how they interact as time changes. However, using mathematics and computers, these factors and interactions can be tracked, which permits the careful testing of what had previously been simply word-based explanations. By such careful testing, it might be possible to understand better how cells grow and divide, and how to reestablish control of uncontrolled cancerous cell growth."

The final objective is to explore the roles that parasite virulence, reproduction, and drug resistance play in shaping parasite and host populations, and to obtain useful insights into the effects of host life-history and parasite heterogeneity on parasite invasion and persistence. These models are developed to reflect the biological complexity of host-parasite systems and will be analyzed using tools in nonlinear dynamical systems theory. In addition, complementary empirical studies that are designed to test theoretical predictions and provide biologically relevant parameters for the models will be initiated.  These studies will provide unique insights into how various factors impact the establishment and spread of disease in natural systems. To achieve the project objectives, mathematicians and biologists will combine their expertise to generate more relevant and applicable models.<br/><br/>Theoretical models are essential to the scientific growth of disciplines such as disease ecology, co-evolution of pathogens and their hosts, and parasite transmission dynamics.  Unfortunately, theoretical advances in these disciplines are complicated by the complex interactions of parasites with their hosts.  Advances in these areas are further slowed by the limited availability of relevant data.  Yet these challenges must be met if we are to develop models that provide insights for public health policy.  The goal of this project is to combine mathematics and empirical data to understand complex host-parasite interactions by developing realistic models that more accurately describe population dynamics and evaluate disease control measures. By explicitly linking the models with appropriate experimental work, this research will significantly advance our knowledge and understanding of host-parasite co-evolution and disease epidemiology. The focus on the integration of analytical and empirical studies is to identify the potential for model-based tools to inform field workers and policymakers of the likely ecological and epidemiological consequences of public health decisions."

Mucus transport by cilia in the respiratory tract, sperm penetration of the oocyte in fertilization, and peristaltic contractions of the oviduct are examples of such interactions. Many biological fluids are actually complex; that is they are not liquids or mixtures of a simple molecular structure that yields Newtonian responses, but instead have complicated non-Newtonian mechanical responses that arise, usually, because they have suspended microstructure.  While much progress has been made in the development of mathematical models and numerical methods for fluid-structure interactions in a Newtonian fluid, much work needs to be done in the case of complex fluids. This focused research group will use a combination of analytical, computational and experimental tools to investigate the dynamics of elastic structures coupled to a complex fluid. Accurate and robust numerical methods for viscoelastic fluids coupled to moving and flexible  boundaries will be developed that build upon classical immersed boundary methods and particle methods previously designed for Newtonian fluids. Continuum descriptions of the viscoelastic fluid will be implemented, as well as models that track discrete viscoelastic microstructure of the fluid. While the methods developed will be widely applicable, the team will focus upon the biofluidmechanics of reproduction, nematode motility in microfluidic chambers, as well as mucus-ciliary transport. Computational models will be coordinated with physical and biological experiments performed at the Applied Mathematics Lab at the Courant Institute.<br/><br/>Mathematics has had a huge impact on engineering and the physical sciences through its development of theoretical analyses and numerical methods for Newtonian fluid flows.  The dynamics of complex fluids is emerging as another such opportunity, and is one which draws some of its richest problems from new areas in biophysics and engineering, medicine and reproductive health, and from core biology. The integration of mathematical and computational analysis into biological science presents educational challenges and great opportunities. This research project embraces these challenges, and is based upon collaborations of investigators at four institutions - Tulane University, New York University, Washington State University and the University of California, Los Angeles.  A central component of this project is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  This FRG project will sponsor two summer programs, where the postdoctoral researchers and graduate students will spend six weeks at the Applied Mathematics Lab at Courant Institute. This will provide opportunities for all the students and postdocs involved in the project to work together side by side, develop a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of the research, and experience and participate in the life of a working fluids lab.<br/>"

While molecular inventories of these modules are becoming available, understanding of the motile cell at the systems biology level is lacking. This understanding has to be achieved first for the simple shaped cells, such as fish epithelial keratocytes. The objective of this research is to use a novel combination of mathematical analysis, computer simulations and model-driven experiments to integrate the subcellular motility modules into a multi-scale computational model of the motile keratocyte cell. These tools will be used to find out whether there is a significant cytoplasmic flow in the cell affecting diffusive transport of molecules, what is the role of molecular motors and membrane in stability of stationary and motile cells, and what is the precise way of integrating subcellular motility modules determining motile cell shape.<br/><br/>There has been enormous interest in cell motility--ubiquitous phenomenon underlying wound healing, embryogenesis and cancer metastasis.

While molecular mechanisms of these three steps are becoming clear, understanding of the motile cell as a system is lacking. This project will provide systems-level understanding of the cell motility dynamics and result in predictive model of the crawling cell. The model will help to design experiments that will elucidate cell motile behavior in important physiological and medical systems.

The developed statistical methods will provide powerful alternatives to tests of enrichment <br/>or overrepresentation that have become popular tools for interpreting microarray experiments.  The proposed methods gain advantages over existing methods by (1) recognizing, accounting for, and utilizing dependence among genes; (2) maintaining continuous information about the degree of difference between gene set expression distributions; (3) identifying interesting gene sets by comparison of gene sets across treatments rather than comparing gene sets to one another; and (4) capturing information about differential expression contained in the joint expression distributions rather than using only marginal distributions.  <br/>In addition to their use for identifying differentially expressed gene sets in traditional microarray experiments, the proposed methods offer a new and powerful approach for identifying genetic loci that control the expression of gene networks.  The integrated research team of statisticians and biologists will identify the best of the proposed methods by theoretical study of their asymptotic properties, by comparisons of their performance on simulated data sets designed to mimic structures found in real data sets, and by weighing the value of biological insights provided by their application to actual data from a variety of microarray experiments.  The asymptotic framework used in this research considers the statistical properties of the testing procedures as both the dimension of the data vectors (number of genes in a set)and the sample size (number of experimental units) grow large.  Such a framework permits evaluation of methods for use on data of very high dimension and produces results that are intrinsically interesting from the statistical point of view.  <br/><br/>The developed methods will be used to investigate genetic control of food intake and energy regulation in pigs and to discover genetic regions that control the expression of gene networks in a population of mice that serve as a model for human obesity.  The insights provided by these studies may be used to develop treatment strategies for human obesity.  In addition, the proposed methods have much broader application to nearly any microarray-based investigation of differential gene expression.  Applications range from the identification of sets of genes that play a role in distinguishing cancerous tissue from non-cancerous tissue to the identification of sets of genes important for developing high-quality plant material suitable for conversion to biofuel.

Despite a body of structural and functional experiments, there are a number of unresolved questions regarding the force-generating transition that drives kinesin motility.  Kinesin processivity, defined as the ability to walk many steps along its filament before detaching, is achieved through chemical and mechanical coordination between the two motor domains.  However, the coordination mechanisms are difficult to probe experimentally, and there is a great need for quantitative theoretical models that realistically describe the interactions between the two heads and incorporate both concerted conformational changes and diffusion-based search mechanisms. In the proposed work, stochastic models of kinesin stepping will be developed to understand the underlying molecular mechanism.  Predictions from these models will be tested experimentally using single-molecule fluorescence assays and optical tweezer experiments.  These predictions will then be verified using modern statistical techniques including hidden Markov models and maximum likelihood methods.  The underlying hypothesis is that a significant fraction of the 16-nm that the tethered kinesin head moves during each mechanical step can be modeled as free diffusion constrained by a spring-like tether with the constraints determined by conformational changes. <br/> <br/>By modeling the interconversion of chemical energy and mechanical work, this investigation will illuminate the principles underlying other mechanical processes in the cell such as mechanotransduction and cell crawling.  Secondly, because members of the kinesin family play vital roles in cell division, developing a deeper understanding of kinesin mechanochemistry will help in the design of antitumor drugs that target these motors.  Third, the integrated approach of using models to drive experiments and applying modern statistical methods to verify experimental data sets a standard for similar integration and verification across a variety of future biomathematical research projects. Using this integrated approach, students will be better prepared to tackle a variety of cutting edge problems in their research careers.<br/>"

However, inflammatory cascades and relationship with neurogenesis are complicated and consequence of central nervous system injury including spinal cord injury is poorly understood.

Towards this end, the objective of the proposed project is to model cytokinesis as it occurs in animal cells and to compare such models to the known cytokinetic behavior of real cells. Cytokinesis occurs near the end of mitosis, and involves the rapid assembly and contraction of a membrane-associated actomyosin ring located at the cell equator. Cytokinesis is exquisitely choreographed with other mitotic events, such that the ring assembles as anaphase begins and daughter chromatids begin to separate. The ring contracts as the chromatids separate, and the ring completes contraction soon after separation is complete. The choreography of these terminal events of mitosis will be modeled.

Once developed, cytokinesis models will be installed into the existing whole-cell model in which cell cycle regulation is treated explicitly. In this way, cytokinesis can be modeled within an in vivo setting. Cell morphology changes involved in cell growth and division will also be estimated by minimizing membrane bending energies. In real cells, membrane composition is altered at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, and this aspect will be modeled and analyzed for its ability to promote cell division. These aspects will be integrated into a self-replicating whole-cell model to observe ""pinching"" behavior about its equator as the cell divides. All of this will be driven by an explicit biochemical mechanism and synchronized with other cell cycle events. The complexity of the models will be scaled in proportion to what is known experimentally, such that they will be closely connected to reality, possess predictive ability, and thus be useful to experimentalists. Models will be analyzed to assess the importance of a cytoskeletal contractile ring vs. local changes in membrane composition in effecting cytokinesis. This integrative approach results in a mathematical model which couples a system of ordinary and partial differential equations with a constrained minimization problem (associated with the determination of cell shape). The primary mathematical challenges stem from the need to determine system parameters within physically realistic ranges so that the solution to the mathematical model exhibits physically reasonable, stable self-replicating behavior. The project is significant because of the novelty of modeling animal-cell cytokinetics on the biochemical/mechanistic level and under both in vitro and in vivo settings. In the broadest sense, the project will assess the feasibility of building a comprehensive cell model piecemeal by designing individual cellular ""modules"" in vitro and installing them into a whole-cell frame once appropriate in vitro behavior is observed. Ultimately a comprehensive molecular-level cell model will be required to explore the pathogenesis of many human diseases, especially cancer, and to test the intended and unintended metabolic effects of new pharmaceuticals.<br/><br/>Living cells can be simplistically viewed as tiny sacs filled with water, salts and molecules such as DNA and proteins. One of the most fundamental aspects of such cells is their ability to self-replicate. To do this, a cell must grow to twice its original size, make a second copy of its DNA, move each copy of the DNA to different ends of the cell, and finally divide around its middle to form two cells. During the last part of this process (technically called ""cytokinesis""), the cell constructs a little belt around its middle, but on the inside of itself such that the belt cannot be seen from the outside of the cell. This internal belt is constructed of many protein units of the same type, linked end-to-end like a stacked set of sticky blocks. Also, the belt is tied to the surface (called a membrane) of the cell. When the cell sends a signal to this belt, the belt starts to tighten around the belly of the cell (by removing blocks, one at a time) and it pulls the membrane in with it. This squeezing doesn't stop until the belt has constricted to a very small circumference, the membrane has pinched completely and two cells are made. The investigators have recently developed a new mathematical approach to modeling cell growth and division at the level of molecules reacting. In this project, this approach will be used to investigate the fine details (at the molecular level) of how this belt is assembled and how it squeezes. Another factor that appears to help this pinching process occur has to do with the types of molecules in the membrane right at the region where the belt is attached. Experiments have shown that the molecules in this region are different from those in the rest of the membrane, but no one understands why they are different. A second aspect of this project will be to investigate this question. Membranes are generally most stable when they are flat rather then bent. This pinching process during cell division requires that they bend a lot, which suggests that pinching might require a lot of energy.  It is suspected that the different molecules found in this region help the membrane bend without requiring so much energy. Again, using a mathematical modeling approach, the researchers will investigate whether this might explain why different types of molecules are found in this region. These processes are not only significant from the perspective of basic cell biology, they are also involved in understanding diseases such as cancer. Cancerous cells grow and divide uncontrollably--something has gone awry with the cell division process described above. Modeling these processes using mathematics and computers is important because these processes are so complicated that it is literally impossible for any person to keep track of all the factors and understand how they interact as time changes. However, using mathematics and computers, these factors and interactions can be tracked, which permits the careful testing of what had previously been simply word-based explanations. By such careful testing, it might be possible to understand better how cells grow and divide, and how to reestablish control of uncontrolled cancerous cell growth."

The fact that not only humans and their food sources (domestic animals and agronomic plants), but also natural animal and plant populations are afflicted (amphibian decline), has directed attention to the important and fascinating role of parasites in ecosystems. With their rapid turn-over, parasitic populations are ideal objects to study the principles of evolution; in turn, it is important to understand these principles to control infectious diseases effectively.  Mathematical models and their analysis are very much needed for a deeper understanding and as a theoretical laboratory to devise control and management strategies.<br/><br/>While the health aspects of parasite-host interactions are of immediate concern, their impact on biological diversity, in interaction with population structures, may be as important. The role of fungal and viral pathogens in the decline or even disappearance of amphibians is only one example of concern for the negative role parasites can play in species diversity, another would be parasite-mediated competitive exclusion.  The following projects in mathematical modeling and model analysis are the focus of the project: (i) Stability and periodic oscillations in disease models with horizontal and vertical transmission; (ii) Parasites in stage-structured host populations; (iii) Mediated coexistence and extinction in prey-predator-parasite systems; (iv) Size-structured models for in-host prion proliferation.<br/><br/>Studying these mathematical host-parasite models will greatly contribute to the understanding of the role of parasites and population structure as well as their interaction in the maintenance of biological diversity. It will enhance our insight in the interplay of the possible multitude of factors which cause species decline and disappearance. These models will help to design environmental management strategies that foster or at least are compatible with species preservation.  They can be used as educational tools in graduate and undergraduate instruction and for effective communication with the scientific community, public health officers, and an educated public audience."

It is accessible, well documented, and studied by researchers spanning the clinical, experimental, and theoretical sciences. Image processing in the retina begins in the outer plexiform layer, where bipolar, horizontal, and photoreceptor cells interact.  The goal of this research is to mathematically model, in detail, the subcircuits of the outer plexiform layer, capturing spatio-temporal dynamics on two spatial scales: the scale of an individual synapse and the scale of the receptive field. The availability of electrophysiological, anatomical, and molecular biological data provides a rare opportunity to develop a complex multiscale model for the system.  Mathematical modeling will be used to discover the functional impact of various circuitry elements, much the way an experimentalist does with selective pharmacological agents, except that not all the agents that are needed actually exist. A primary objective is to explore two competing hypotheses for explaining synaptic feedback effects that are observed experimentally in the outer plexiform layer of the retina.  Specifically, the project will investigate if feedback effects in the cone photoreceptor's synapse are driven by electrical or chemical mechanisms, or both.  New insights into the understanding of retinal circuitry from this project will impact research in health and medicine, including biomedical engineering, image processing, visual psychophysics, and pharmacology. The modeling and computational techniques resulting from this project will provide efficient and innovative approaches for other problem areas in applied mathematics and engineering."

Despite years of experiments the main problem of swarm dynamics is wide open: how is this optimal cell arrangement produced by individual cells with only local knowledge of their surroundings?  The research group will use a large amount of available reliable experimental data on cell behavior and interactions between cells as building blocks for developing comprehensive mathematical and computational multi-dimensional hybrid models of bacterial swarming based on short and long range interactions. Better understanding of the collective motion of bacteria will shed light on how bacteria infect human tissues in disease.

Proteus, another pathogen, also infects by swarming.<br/><br/>The proposed modeling approach will be demonstrated by studying swarming of Myxococcus xanthus; which swarms rapidly, has been studied for decades, and whose numerous swarming mutants have been identified and characterized.

However, evolutionary trees for different genes may lead to different results.  An alternative approach is to study the evolutionary history of whole genomes rather than individual genes, based on comparison of the order of homologous genes (or segments) between genomes.  This approach is known as genome rearrangements.  Genome rearrangements may be used to study the evolutionary process that led from unknown ancestral genomes to present day genomes, and to study the possible architectures of the ancestral genomes.  This project will use combinatorial techniques to study genome rearrangements.  The ""breakpoint graph"" is a combinatorial graph developed to compare gene orders in two different genomes.  There are well-developed techniques for studying genome rearrangements between two genomes based on the cycle structure of the breakpoint graph.  Although a generalization of the definition of breakpoint graphs to multiple genomes is straightforward, methods to analyze this graph do not so easily generalize.  Most studies of multiple genomes that use breakpoint graphs do two genomes at a time with ordinary breakpoint graphs, and combine the pairwise results.  This project will develop ways to use the multiple genome breakpoint graph more effectively.  There are several related applications: the construction of phylogenetic trees based on genome rearrangements; the study of potential ancestral gene orders; and the study of ""breakpoint reuse,"" which is the apparent or actual multiple use of a breakpoint region in a series of genome rearrangements.  Another mathematical construct used to represent different gene orders is permutations.  This project will also generalize classical work on permutation enumeration to the context of genome rearrangements with multiple genomes and multiple chromosomes.<br/><br/>Chromosomal evolution has long been of interest to biologists, and has recently caught the interest of mathematicians and computer scientists.  This interest has been greatly accelerated by the Human Genome Project and similar projects to sequence the genomes of other species.  These projects are national priorities, largely funded in the U.S. by the National Human Genome Research Institute and the Department of Energy.  Sequences or maps of different genomes are compared to find the corresponding genes and other features.  Many studies are focused on variations of the sequences within corresponding genes.  However, it is also of interest that the corresponding genes have usually moved to different chromosomes, moved into a different order within the same chromosome, or have been duplicated or deleted.  Additionally, chromosomes may be broken into two or fused together into one.  These phenomena are known as genome rearrangements, and the mathematical techniques and computer algorithms for studying complicated genome rearrangements have largely been developed only since the 1990s.  This project is focused on the use of particular mathematical techniques to study genome rearrangements and evolutionary trees."

General information-theoretic considerations as well as experiments indicate that the main task of the olfactory bulb is to decorrelate odor stimuli.  Its ability to do so depends sensitively on a match between the connectivity of the neural network and the odor environment.  The project will focus on the ability of the bulbar neural network to adapt its connectivity to changing olfactory environments of the animal, while retaining the ability to discriminate and recognize significant previous odors.  To model the plasticity of the network Hebbian long-term potentiation of the synapses will be included as well as the substantial neurogenesis that is an almost unique feature of the olfactory bulb.  First the research will aim to establish biophysically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that enable the resulting network to decorrelate its odor inputs effectively.  Then networks resulting from neurogenesis and cell death alone will be studied and their ability to decorrelate inputs will be assessed. Finally, synaptic and neurogenetic plasticity will be combined.  It is expected that in the full model synaptic plasticity will provide fast fine-tuning of the adaptation within the connectivity framework set by neurogenesis, which in turn will retain significant information about past environments.  Mathematically, the model will consist of a co-evolving bipartite network of weighted nodes and links.  Computational and asymptotic solution methods will be developed to deal efficiently with the combination of discrete, stochastic evolution of the network structure and continuous deterministic evolution of its weights, involving three different time scales associated with neural activity, synaptic plasticity, and network connectivity, respectively.<br/><br/>A central function of the brain is to extract relevant features from the information it receives from the sensory organs and to make decisions based on new and previously stored information.  The brain areas that perform the first information processing play an essential role by providing an internal representation of the environment that facilitates the extraction of relevant information.  An important goal in neuroscience is to understand these internal representations and how they depend on the task at hand. In contrast to vision, where great progress has been made in understanding the neural encoding of the visual scenes that an animal is seeing in its natural environment, the processing of odor information in the olfactory system is much less understood.  Unlike the visual world the olfactory world is high-dimensional and its characteristic features change significantly over time (seasons, migration, etc.).  As the animal adapts to these changes the internal representation of a given odor is likely to change, as well.  If this were the case the same rose would be perceived as smelling like one flower in spring and like another flower in fall, say, and the animal would have difficulties to identify odors.  The goal of this project is to elucidate how the olfactory system copes with the conflicting tasks of adapting to changing environments and recognizing significant odors reliably in different environments.  A central component of the model will be the substantial birth of new neurons (`neurogenesis') that is observed in the olfactory system throughout the life of the animal.  The insights gained in this project are likely to be useful for the design of `artificial noses'.  The project will also shed light on the role of neurogenesis in the hippocampus, where altered neurogenesis has been associated with mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases."

The main issues are bridging the gap between relevant biological time scales, in this case the opening and closing of ion channels, and time scales accessible to direct molecular dynamics simulations which are much shorter. A step in this direction will be the creation of a new time and space adaptive scheme (AVI and HiGrid) which accelerates the sampling of the different protein conformations accessible at a given temperature. In addition, techniques (the string method and the ABF algorithm) to explore transition pathways between stable conformations of the system will be developed. The novelty of this approach is that the pathways are computed in terms of many collective variables instead of the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms as is usually done. This leads to greater robustness and physically more relevant pathways.<br/><br/>The ability to sense touch depends on nanometer sized ion channels located in the membrane of sensory neurons. When force is exerted in the skin these channels open to let a flow of ions go in or out of the cell, a phenomenon called gating. These nano-machines are part of a complex apparatus which converts mechanical force into electric signals and transports information from the skin to neurons. By bringing together expertise in biology, high performance computing and mathematics, the investigators will produce atomically accurate models of the gating mechanism in the only metazoan mechanotransduction channel known to date."

While probabilistic and combinatorial methods have been applied successfully in this field of biology, the tools of algebraic geometry yield new insight and help researchers to gain a better understanding of many of the underlying mathematical issues.  The goals of this project are to develop new algorithms for the search of tree space, develop a new statistical measure of support for local features in a phylogenetic tree, and to develop, formalize, and study new mathematical models of sequence evolution.  Improving phylogenetic methods by speeding up heuristic searches of tree space will have significant value in practical phylogenetics, allowing the investigation of phylogenetic relationships for larger data sets and for increased thoroughness in the search of tree space.  The work will be carried out at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and involves researchers with connections to the Institute of Arctic Biology.<br/><br/>Phylogenetic inference from sequence data is used widely throughout the biological sciences, and improvements in methods and theoretical understanding will have a far-reaching impact.  As phylogenetic data sets become larger and biological explanations of the evolutionary process at the sequence level improve, understanding the more complicated models describing the processes at work is necessary for developing valid and effective methods of statistical inference.  This work develops emerging connections between the areas of algebraic geometry and mathematical biology and brings about significant broader impacts ranging from the interdisciplinary training of students and software dissemination to collaborations with researchers outside of Alaska."

The rapid growth of computer capability in the past few decades not withstanding, our ability to model three-dimensional wave propagation and scattering involving geometrically complicated dielectric interfaces is severely limited. Mathematically, the wave solutions are usually non-smooth or even discontinuous across the material interfaces, so that our effort in designing efficient algorithms is easily foiled, unless the complex interfaces are properly treated. The complex interfaces and geometries are commonly tackled by using body-fitted grids in the literature. Even though considerable progress has been made in grid generation, the formation of a good quality body-fitted grid system in geometrically complex domain remains a difficult and time-consuming task. Alternatively, in this project, the investigator will explore how to accommodate dielectric interfaces with complex geometries by using Cartesian grids including the staggered Yee grids. The resulting Cartesian grid methods, which in some sense fit the numerical differentiation operators to the complicated geometries, are less well studied in the literature, in contrast to the body-fitted grid methods. The development of high order Cartesian grid methods with complex interfaces being accurately treated, is of imminent practical importance to efficient wave simulations, but remains unsolved. In this project, innovative fourth order Cartesian grid approaches will be constructed based on the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method newly developed by the investigator and his collaborators for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving material interfaces or inhomogeneous media. To address a widespread variety of electromagnetic applications, a complete set of fourth order MIB methods will be developed for different electromagnetic formulations including the Helmholtz equation, the wave equation, and Maxwell's equations, and for different scenarios including the transverse magnetic mode, the transverse electric mode, and fully three-dimensional mode. <br/><br/>Computational electromagnetics (CEM), an interdisciplinary field where one witnesses mutual contributions from mathematicians and engineers is of paramount importance for a wide range of applications, including analysis and synthesis of antenna, calculation of radar cross section (RCS), simulation of ground or surface penetrating radar, to name only a few. The proposed numerical approaches aim to address challenging CEM applications involving large-scale and irregularly shaped structures, for which currently existing methods encounter great difficulties. By delivering more accurate and efficient wave simulations, the proposed methods will lead to breakthroughs in resolving long-standing problems in the real CEM applications. Moreover, the proposed methods will have considerable impact on other challenging interface problems in scientific computing, such as the immersed interface and moving interface problems in fluid dynamics, electrostatic interface problems for structural prediction of large biomolecules in computational biology.<br/><br/><br/>"

The principal goal of AAMB is to advance the field of mathematical biology on various fronts, in part, via the gathering of a number of highly-respected mathematical biologists and applied mathematicians, who have agreed to present keynote lectures. The lecture topics represent a number of exciting and important fields in mathematical biology, including mathematical cardiology, renal physiology, neurobiology, developmental biology, periodic and dynamical diseases, cancer, and calcium dynamics. By providing travel support, AAMB will facilitate the exposure of graduate and undergraduate students to state-of-the-art current research in mathematical biology.<br/><br/>As noted by M. C. Reed in an article published in the Notices of the AMS: ""Although there is a long history of the applications of mathematics to biology, only recently has mathematical biology become an accepted branch of applied mathematics."" To advance the field of mathematical biology, the conference will bring together pioneers in both applied mathematics and biology. Also, recognizing that a commitment to nurturing young scientists is essential to the continued growth and success of a field, AAMB will attract junior participants (graduate students and junior faculty) by providing travel support, by offering free food, by making sure that keynote lectures are accessible, and, last but not the least, by including in the list of keynote lecturers role models for women and underrepresented minorities."

Using the immersed boundary approach, mathematical models will be built to represent the fluid dynamics around the proximal tubule brush border microvilli, and to represent the tubular flow in a papillary collecting duct undergoing peristaltic contractions.  The resulting models will be used to study the effects of the two-way fluid-structure interactions on solute and water transport along the proximal tubule and along the collecting duct. Additionally, nonlinear optimization techniques will be used to further the physiological investigation of cellular homeostasis, by assessing the effectiveness of various regulatory mechanisms in homeostatic recovery.<br/><br/>If one is stranded in the ocean for days, should one drink the sea water to quench one's thirst? The answer depends on whether the subject is a person (don't!) or a rat (no problem, drink away!). The reason is that the osmolality (i.e., total solute concentration) of sea water is higher than the maximum urine osmolality that can be produced by a human. In contrast, a little rat can produce a urine twice as concentrated as sea water. It may be hard to believe, but the mechanism by which some mammals produce highly concentrated urine is not well understood. This project will use mathematical analysis and computational techniques to answer a number of basic and important questions in renal physiology: How do the peristaltic contractions of the renal papilla impact the concentrating mechanism of the kidney? How do the brush border microvilli, which are found along portions of the nephrons (little tubules in the kidney), affect solute transport in the kidney? What are the most effective ways for kidney cells to change aspects of its transport properties in order to survive in its ever-changing surroundings? The answers to those questions are crucial in an overall understanding of renal physiology, renal pathophysiology, and other autoregulatory mechanisms."

This project will focus on central issues relating to the neural control of respiration, providing an analysis of the mechanisms that confer pacemaker capabilities on particular respiratory neurons and the way in which different groups of neurons interact, within the full mammalian respiratory network, to produce respiratory rhythms. The proposed research will lead to new results and experimental predictions about how specific network features, including intrinsic properties of neurons and characteristics of the interactions between them, contribute to the generation, and the modulation, of the rhythms that arise. In particular, results will suggest key network elements that may be targeted by internal feedback systems to modulate respiration in response to changing conditions and that may be compromised in pathological states.<br/><br/>These advances will be achieved through the development and mathematical analysis of neuronal network models featuring varying levels of biological detail, constrained by experimental data.

Playas are shallow recharge wetlands with each individual playa existing within its own watershed. Amphibians on the SHP depend on the playas for breeding.<br/>Playas must contain water during the breeding period in order for eggs and larvae to mature. The timing and length of the playa hydroperiod (the period of time during which the playa contains water) are critical parameters in amphibian survival. The patchy occurrence of playa wetlands on the SHP, and on the Great Plains as a whole, suggest that wetland inhabitants live in multiple local populations sustained by occasional interaction among metapopulations. The mechanisms of how these wetland mosaics maintain their metapopulations are poorly understood.  Yet clearly, mounting destruction (through sedimentation and chemical runoff) results in reduced wetland hydroperiod and wetland density, and increased isolation among wetlands. Indeed, sedimentation in playa wetlands decreases hydroperiod, increases the rate of water loss, and eventually fills the playa to such an extent that it is rendered non-functional as a wetland. Demographic and environmental variability, as well as global climate change, will have a significant impact on the reproduction and survival of amphibian populations over the long term. Current metapopulation theory is primarily based on deterministic mathematical models, i.e, systems of ordinary differential equations. The objectives of this project are (1) to extend standard deterministic metapopulation models to new stochastic differential equation models, (2) to develop new stochastic metapopulation models for populations that depend on a dynamic landscape,  (3) to collect data on amphibian community composition in the playas, and (4) to apply these new stochastic metapopulation models to amphibian populations on the SHP based on the data collected in this project.<br/><br/>Stochastic differential equation modeling in ecology is a relatively new area but is an important and rapidly expanding area of interest in the mathematical and biological sciences. There have been no comprehensive mathematical models for the dynamics of species inhabiting the Southern High Plains (SHP).

Graduate students will be trained and programs strengthened at Texas Tech University and Oklahoma State University in biological modeling, stochastic mathematics, wildlife management, and ecology. In addition, the results of this project will lead to recommendations for conservation of amphibian populations and for maintenance of playa integrity that will have a broad impact on future research on the SHP, the Great Plains as a whole, and on other similar semiarid environments."

These patterns emerge in a sequential process, with simple patterns providing inputs to molecular networks, which, in turn, transform these inputs into more complex outputs.  Due to the recent advances in the molecular studies of development, these networks can now be modeled at mechanistic level.  Exploring complex mechanistic models is critically dependent on the use of computational techniques; at the same time, the behavior of large-scale models can often be understood through analysis of simplified models, providing a ""bridge"" between computational and real experiments. Rigorous mathematical techniques for analyzing the dynamics of signal processing in developmental patterning are yet to be developed.  To this end, the PIs propose to pursue a number of analytical approaches for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics in patterning networks.  These approaches, which rely heavily on the techniques from the calculus of variations, will be applied in the context of epithelial pattern formation in the Drosophila egg, an established experimental model for studying how simple inputs establish complex spatial patterns in development.  The proposed analytical and computational work will build on the modeling and experimental results obtained by the PIs during the previous funding period.  Within the framework of this application, the PIs will focus on signal processing by two-dimensional patterning networks with positive feedback loops.<br/><br/>The proposed research is closely linked to the experimental work on pattern formation mediated by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a key regulator of epithelial tissues across species.  Given the highly conserved nature of EGFR signaling and the generality of inductive patterning events, the work of the PIs will provide insights into a large class of development problems.  In addition, the mathematical techniques developed in this proposal will be applicable to a wide range of problems modeled by nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations.  This research is strongly aligned with the educational effort of the PIs that involves further development of undergraduate and graduate courses on mathematical biology of cell communication systems and interdisciplinary training of mathematics and engineering graduate and undergraduate students at NJIT and Princeton."

However, inflammatory cascades and relationship with neurogenesis are complicated and consequence of central nervous system injury including spinal cord injury is poorly understood. Invading macrophages and resident microglia cells, the two major cell types that are from monocytic lineage play major role in the inflammatory process.

These emerging problems will be confronted via developing new statistical methods to address the challenges associated with high-dimensionality. At the same time, the investigators  also intend to provide fundamental understanding, via asymptotic analysis and simulation studies, to these problems and their associated methodologies.  A distinguished feature of the proposal is the combination the strengths of our expertise in statistics and molecular biology to gain better understanding of molecular<br/>disturbances in spinal cord and central nervous system injury.<br/><br/>The proposal investigates molecular disturbances in spinal cord and central nervous system injury. Our aims include identifying genes that reveal the distinct functional profiles of resident microglia and invading macrophages in spinal cord injury, and selecting the genes that are uniquely altered during specific facets of the neuronal response to inflammation. These approaches can not only help us understand the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory responses in spinal cord injury, but also potentially identify genes to be targeted for therapeutic intervention following spinal core injury. In addition, our developed cutting-edging statistical techniques and bioinformatic tools can be applied to other biological and statistical researches.

This project seeks to extract motor potentials, making full use of the time series of motor positions.  Once successful, new information about motor mechanism will be revealed by examining the spatial structure of motor potential and by examining the dependence of motor potential on various environmental parameters, such as, the loading force on the motor and chemical concentrations.

Recovering bond potentials will extend the capability of the AFM technologies and provide a novel way of probing sub-nanometer scale conformational changes.<br/><br/>Protein motors play a central role in many cell functions.  Understanding the operating principles of protein motors is crucial to comprehending intracellular protein transport and cell motility.  The potential profile of a protein motor describes the spatial pattern of motor force.  For example, for a four-stroke single cylinder motorcycle, the engine provides a positive driving force only during the expansion stroke.  While one can observe directly the operation of a motorcycle engine, one does not have such a luxury for a nanometer scale protein motor. Fortunately, because of the negligible inertia, the potential profile of a protein motor is contained (hidden) in the time path of the motor.  This project seeks to uncover motor potentials from measured time paths in single molecule experiments.  Once successful, it will provide a new way of peeking into nanometer scale protein motors.  This project also seeks to uncover potential profiles of molecular bonds, through modeling and inference, from indirect and low-resolution AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) experimental data.  This new way of indirectly probing is extremely important for studying molecular bonds since bond breaking involves only sub-nanometer scale conformational changes.  The resolution of direct measurements is unlikely to go far below the sub-nanometer scale to resolve bond breaking directly.

Because of the tremendous effects of virus related diseases, as in the case of HIV or of the flu virus, it is extremely desirable to have a clear picture of  the avenues along which viral infections proceed and thrive, so that  novel therapies can be devised. The goal of this project is to develop  mathematical models to understand some of the cardinal steps of viral  infection, in synergy with experimentally known facts or unresolved issues. By using both numerical and analytical tools, this research aims to: (a) Study viral adsorption into healthy cells by considering reaction diffusion equations to describe binding of the virus to diffusing  receptors and coreceptors at the cell surface. These models will allow the investigator to probe the effects of different receptor-coreceptor combinations, which is experimentally unresolved and which will be a useful tool for bench experimentalists and the advancement of fusion inhibitor drugs. (b)  Formulate stochastic models to study the unknown mechanisms of viral  uncoating and by considering several hypothetical pathways.  A comparison between the results obtained and existing data will help determine the most viable  disassembly mechanism. (c) Model the emergence of resistant viral strains  by means of a hybrid stochastic-deterministic model where the abundant species are treated as deterministic variables and the mutant strains as  stochastic ones.  The conditions under which a large drug resistant population is favored will be determined. <br/><br/>Mathematical modeling has often lead to significant progress in  developing new paradigms and testing new hypothesis.  In this research project, new models aimed at understanding viral dynamics will be formulated.  These models will be biophysically based and developed in close collaboration with bench experimentalists to fully utilize recent advances at the nanoscale level and also to offer suggestions and non-expensive testing for working  hypothesis.  Several numerical and analytical subprojects will be shaped to strongly encourage the participation, education, and training of graduate and undergraduate students at different levels of their careers."

The first objective is to develop models for assessing the impact of infection and co-infection of multiple strains/species of parasites in multiple host types. The second objective is to analyze the impact of drug treatment (including the age-structure of hosts) on parasite evolution. The final objective is to explore the roles that parasite virulence, reproduction, and drug resistance play in shaping parasite and host populations, and to obtain useful insights into the effects of host life-history and parasite heterogeneity on parasite invasion and persistence. These models are developed to reflect the biological complexity of host-parasite systems and will be analyzed using tools in nonlinear dynamical systems theory. In addition, complementary empirical studies that are designed to test theoretical predictions and provide biologically relevant parameters for the models will be initiated.  These studies will provide unique insights into how various factors impact the establishment and spread of disease in natural systems. To achieve the project objectives, mathematicians and biologists will combine their expertise to generate more relevant and applicable models.<br/><br/>Theoretical models are essential to the scientific growth of disciplines such as disease ecology, co-evolution of pathogens and their hosts, and parasite transmission dynamics.  Unfortunately, theoretical advances in these disciplines are complicated by the complex interactions of parasites with their hosts.  Advances in these areas are further slowed by the limited availability of relevant data.  Yet these challenges must be met if we are to develop models that provide insights for public health policy.  The goal of this project is to combine mathematics and empirical data to understand complex host-parasite interactions by developing realistic models that more accurately describe population dynamics and evaluate disease control measures. By explicitly linking the models with appropriate experimental work, this research will significantly advance our knowledge and understanding of host-parasite co-evolution and disease epidemiology. The focus on the integration of analytical and empirical studies is to identify the potential for model-based tools to inform field workers and policymakers of the likely ecological and epidemiological consequences of public health decisions."

Such fluctuations cause a wide range of human disorders, and many cellular control circuits are best understood in terms of how they tolerate, exploit, or eliminate the threat of randomization. However, studies of noise have been difficult to interpret due to a lack of comprehensive conceptual frameworks. We will extend the existing frameworks in several ways, by: 1) Determining the applicability of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) to genetic networks with nonlinear rate functions. 2) Extending the FDT to higher moments and better approximations, systematically rewriting mathematical theorems in terms of biological observables. 3) Analyzing how the gradual aging of molecules affect random fluctuations between cells. 4) Evaluating and extending a common approximation where dilution of components in growing cells is modeled by degradation. In all cases, we compare the results with experimental findings for single cells. <br/><br/>Fluctuations in concentrations arise spontaneously in cells due to 'molecular chaos' where individual molecules randomly collide before reacting. This randomness is particularly pronounced at the extremely low levels of many crucial cellular components, where individual chemical events have large relative effects. Many experimental studies have measured the resulting variation, but the results are difficult to interpret because the conventional mathematical frameworks are poorly suited to cells. Using concepts from statistical physics, we will extend previous methods to create a more effective framework to analyze and interpret fluctuations. This will help explore the physical conditions in the cell, and better understand the basis of physiological disorders that result from an incapacity to correct perturbations."

This project focuses on the mathematical issues that have been raised by previous large-scale simulations, and seeks to get a deeper understanding of how the qualitative properties of intrinsic and ionic currents in single cells shape the complex behaviour that has been seen in a variety of simulations of large and small networks.  The work focuses on two specific situations which present many of the general issues.  The first is the interaction of the gamma (40-90 Hz) and theta (4-12 Hz) rhythms in the hippocampus.  As shown in previous numerical and experimental work, the gamma and theta rhythms appear to be produced in vitro by different sub-networks of hippocampal neurons, with some components in common; simulations have shown that changes in parameters can switch control of the common elements and change the power in the different frequency bands.  The project considers the global bifurcations involved in switches of control.  The second situation concerns changes of brain rhythms in the presence of the anesthetic propofol which, at the biophysical level, acts mainly by increasing the decay time and amplitude of GABA_A mediated inhibition.  A central question of the previous modeling work is the origin of the so-call ""beta buzz"", in which a low dose of propofol excites, rather than sedates, the patient, with an increase in the power in the beta frequency bands (13-30 Hz) and a decrease in lower and higher frequency bands.  Simulations have shown this un-intuitive behaviour in model networks having multiple components, notably by the creation of ""clustering"" of inhibitory cells into subgroups firing in antiphase, transforming low frequencies into higher ones.  Kopell mentors many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows; this project ties mathematical analysis to other work focusing on function, and thus allows trainees to see how mathematics can be used to bridge from biophysics to function.<br/><br/>The nervous system produces electrical activity in all cognitive states, and this activity generally displays significant power at any given time in multiple frequency bands.

The work addresses the general issues of how the brain produces its multiple frequencies, and how changes in biophysics can change the mixture of dynamic components.  In the first sub-project, this is linked with the central question of how networks react to inputs with spatial and temporal structure reflecting the coding of information.  In the second, the work helps to bridge the knowledge of biophysical effects of an anesthetic to its functional properties (inducing loss of consciousness) by tying the biophysical changes to changes in dynamics known to be related to cognitive state.  The analytical tools proposed have been used in much simpler contexts.  The work will require the development of extensions to allow application to larger and more complex networks.  The extensions should be applicable to a wide range of neural applications.

Specifically, the question asked is how much information a cell can obtain about chemical gradients and other signals released from the cells around it.  The theoretical framework for this study is the mathematical theory of communication, known as information theory.  Information theory, pioneered in the 1940's by Claude Shannon, provides the technical foundation for modern communications devices ranging from computers to cell phones.  In this project, the investigators take the mathematical concepts developed in communications engineering and apply them to understanding a fundamental biological process known as signal transduction.   <br/><br/>The human body is composed of trillions of individual cells.  Different cells perform different functions, many of which depend on exchanging chemical signals with other cells. Some examples of communication between cells in the human body include communication between nerve cells in the brain, response of immune cells to chemical markers released by injured or infected tissue, and metastasis (uncontrolled growth and spread) of cancer cells.  As with cellular telephones, communication between biological cells is limited by fundamental physical constraints that can be described by quantitative mathematical models.  By improving our understanding of cell-to-cell communication and the physical constraints on its efficiency, the proposed project has the potential to improve our ability to understand a wide range of diseases involving breakdowns in cellular communications, such as cancer, chronic inflammation, and certain developmental defects."

Based on capture-mark-recapture field data, statistical techniques will be employed to approximate weekly frog population sizes.  These approximate population sizes will then be compared with the output of the structured population models via the least-squares approach to provide estimates for the model parameters.  Furthermore, stochastic population models based on the deterministic ones will be developed and numerically analyzed.

This is true in natural populations (such as herbs living under a forest canopy) as well as human-dominated systems (for example, crop pests in agricultural landscapes).  Focusing on the development of spatial population models, the project seeks to better understand how and why spatially autocorrelated disturbances affect the dynamics of populations with mixtures of short- and long-distance dispersal.  A variety of disturbances are considered, including (1) static disturbance, representing habitat heterogeneity across a landscape; (2) short-term disturbance whereby populations are removed from sites which may then be recolonized, e.g. representing short-term control of agricultural crop pests, and (3) landscapes with specified spatial and temporal autocorrelation, whereby blocks of sites become unsuitable and cannot be recolonized until some time has elapsed.  The primary objectives of the computational side of the project are to improve the simulation methodology used for these types of spatial models, to enable more rapid/complete exploration of the parameter space and the use of simulation models in Monte Carlo parameter estimation techniques.<br/><br/>Spatial disturbances and heterogeneities play a fundamental role in any ecological system.  This project develops mathematical models and computational tools to be used in the study of various types of disturbances.  Possible applications include the modeling of understory plant species in a forest where gap formation renders a group of sites unsuitable until the canopy regenerates, or the application of pesticides over a region which leaves those sites unsuitable for recolonization by pests for some time.  The project will include collaboration with entomologists and other biologists to study the effects of different strategies for controlling pests across agricultural landscapes, such as maggot flies in commercial blueberry fields.  The effects of changing habitat distributions on populations, due to factors such as changing land-use patterns and global climate change, will also be considered.  Significant undergraduate research training will be included in the project, including participation in a summer research program primarily aimed at underrepresented minority groups."

The first part of the project focuses on the existence, uniqueness and stability of traveling wave solutions of reaction-diffusion equations with nonlocal delay. The results can be applied to study traveling wave solutions in various models arising in biology, ecology, epidemiology, medicine, etc.  The second part of the project seeks to develop a generalized Ross-Macdonald vector-host disease model, modeled by diffusive integro-differential equations with spatio-temporal delay, which describe nonlocal interactions and latent periods. An investigation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the model, including the existence of epidemic waves, is proposed.  The effects of spatial heterogeneity and time delay on the establishment and transmission of diseases will also be considered. The model can be applied to study how immigration affects local epidemic and extinction of the parasite. The results on the delayed Ross-Macdonald malaria model are useful in understanding and controlling the malaria transmission in some regions such as in costal Kenya. The third part of the project is a study of epidemic models of antibiotic-resistant bacteria infection in hospitals focusing on infection age, host heterogeneity and multi-drug resistant bacterial strains. By studying the asymptotic behavior of these models an attempt is made to identify factors responsible for observed patterns of infection, and to provide theoretical guidance for designing efficient control measures.<br/><br/>In modern society, global change has resulted in more human activities and environmental changes, which in turn have affected human health.  For example, global warming has affected the transmission of malaria.  Throughout recorded history, non-indigenous vectors that arrive, establish, and spread in new areas have fomented epidemics of human diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, typhus, plague, and the West Nile virus. The spatial spread of newly introduced species or diseases is a subject of continuing interest to both theoreticians and empiricists. This project proposes to study the spatial transmission of certain vector-host diseases such as malaria and hopes that the study can help understand the establishment and spread of other vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus and bird flu. Epidemics caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB), such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE), in hospitals are increasing throughout the world. Approximately 5-10% of patients admitted to a hospital will develop an infection directly related to their hospitalization. These infections contribute to over 90,000 deaths per year in the US. It is estimated that 70% of the causative pathogens are resistant to one or more antimicrobials. The project also studies nosocomial epidemics with antibiotic resistance which will help to provide some control measures to combat such epidemics inside hospitals.<br/>"

These patterns emerge in a sequential process, with simple patterns providing inputs to molecular networks, which, in turn, transform these inputs into more complex outputs.  Due to the recent advances in the molecular studies of development, these networks can now be modeled at mechanistic level.  Exploring complex mechanistic models is critically dependent on the use of computational techniques; at the same time, the behavior of large-scale models can often be understood through analysis of simplified models, providing a ""bridge"" between computational and real experiments. Rigorous mathematical techniques for analyzing the dynamics of signal processing in developmental patterning are yet to be developed.  To this end, the PIs propose to pursue a number of analytical approaches for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics in patterning networks.  These approaches, which rely heavily on the techniques from the calculus of variations, will be applied in the context of epithelial pattern formation in the Drosophila egg, an established experimental model for studying how simple inputs establish complex spatial patterns in development.  The proposed analytical and computational work will build on the modeling and experimental results obtained by the PIs during the previous funding period.  Within the framework of this application, the PIs will focus on signal processing by two-dimensional patterning networks with positive feedback loops.<br/><br/>The proposed research is closely linked to the experimental work on pattern formation mediated by the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a key regulator of epithelial tissues across species.  Given the highly conserved nature of EGFR signaling and the generality of inductive patterning events, the work of the PIs will provide insights into a large class of development problems.  In addition, the mathematical techniques developed in this proposal will be applicable to a wide range of problems modeled by nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations.  This research is strongly aligned with the educational effort of the PIs that involves further development of undergraduate and graduate courses on mathematical biology of cell communication systems and interdisciplinary training of mathematics and engineering graduate and undergraduate students at NJIT and Princeton."

Mucus transport by cilia in the respiratory tract, sperm penetration of the oocyte in fertilization, and peristaltic contractions of the oviduct are examples of such interactions. Many biological fluids are actually complex; that is they are not liquids or mixtures of a simple molecular structure that yields Newtonian responses, but instead have complicated non-Newtonian mechanical responses that arise, usually, because they have suspended microstructure. While much progress has been made in the development of mathematical models and numerical methods for fluid-structure interactions in a Newtonian fluid, much work needs to be done in the case of complex fluids. This focused research group will use a combination of analytical, computational and experimental tools to investigate the dynamics of elastic structures coupled to a complex fluid. Accurate and robust numerical methods for viscoelastic fluids coupled to moving and flexible boundaries will be developed that build upon classical immersed boundary methods and particle methods previously designed for Newtonian fluids. Continuum descriptions of the viscoelastic fluid will be implemented, as well as models that track discrete viscoelastic microstructure of the fluid. While the methods developed will be widely applicable, the team will focus upon the biofluidmechanics of reproduction, nematode motility in microfluidic chambers, as well as mucus-ciliary transport. Computational models will be coordinated with physical and biological experiments performed at the Applied Mathematics Lab at the Courant Institute.<br/><br/>Mathematics has had a huge impact on engineering and the physical sciences through its development of theoretical analyses and numerical methods for Newtonian fluid flows. The dynamics of complex fluids is emerging as another such opportunity, and is one which draws some of its richest problems from new areas in biophysics and engineering, medicine and reproductive health, and from core biology. The integration of mathematical and computational analysis into biological science presents educational challenges and great opportunities. This research project embraces these challenges, and is based upon collaborations of investigators at four institutions - Tulane University, New York University, Washington State University and the University of California, Los Angeles. A central component of this project is the training of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. This FRG project will sponsor two summer programs, where the postdoctoral researchers and graduate students will spend six weeks at the Applied Mathematics Lab at Courant Institute. This will provide opportunities for all the students and postdocs involved in the project to work together side by side, develop a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of the research, and experience and participate in the life of a working fluids lab."
