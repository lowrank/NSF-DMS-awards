Additionally, this proposal aims to impact both the students and the faculty members at HBCUs. By engaging the HBCU faculty members as partners in the project, the goal is to create pipelines for the HBCU students to graduate schools and to establish and enhance working relationships and networking between HBCU faculty members and faculty members at large research institutions. If these two innovative ideas are successful, they will have a broad impact. This research project emphasizes mathematical biology, but the same ideas should work in other branches of pure and applied mathematics, and in other scientific disciplines as well. In making the virtual colloquia as interactive as a classroom, the project will have created a template for faculty at other research universities to participate in and enhance the training of undergraduates at HBCUs, and that, in and of itself, will create pipelines from the HBCUs to the research institutions, both for students and for faculty. The methods and the template could then be used by other groups of mathematicians or scientists to enhance the training of students at the other HBCUs at low cost.<br/><br/>The project has three goals: to encourage undergraduate students at the HBCUs to go to graduate school in the STEM disciplines; to connect faculty in analysis and mathematical biology at the HBCUs to faculty and research programs at The Ohio State University (OSU) and other large research institutions; to experiment with virtual colloquia and virtual teaching techniques in mathematics. Faculty members at six HBCUs will each recruit 2-3 students to participate in the year-long program that includes a meet-and-greet workshop at Howard University, where they will meet the PIs and some of the speakers and hear mathematical biology lectures. Through the academic year, the students receive 7 introductory colloquia in which the speakers sit in their home office and the broadband facilities of the Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) are used to broadcast the colloquium simultaneously to the six HBCUs. The MBI facilities permit questions and answers and discussions in real time during the talk. Materials prepared by the speakers provide follow-up activities that will be mentored by the local faculty members. The year concludes with a 10-day workshop at OSU that will be both a research experience for the students and collaboration events for the faculty. For the students, there will be panel discussions on academic and non-academic jobs and graduate school. For faculty research engagement, ten mathematical biology faculty members at OSU, in addition to some speakers, have agreed to include an HBCU faculty member in their current research program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This remarkably robust behavior results from the activity of networks of neurons deep in the brain that interact to produce coordinated, rhythmic outputs that drive breathing.  Although certain aspects of this process are well understood, experiments have revealed features that go beyond existing theories, and this project will apply new modeling and analysis approaches to investigate these effects. A first set of issues that will be studied relates to the ways that specific patterns of respiratory neuron outputs emerge, change across development, and are affected by feedback signals. A second direction of investigation will focus on how activity spreads and becomes coordinated across a population of respiratory neurons, as needed to effectively drive the muscles that initiate each breathing cycle.  Additional avenues for research will involve the mechanisms of system-wide coordination across multiple populations of neurons that interact to produce the full breathing cycle over a range of conditions. The work will be completed in collaboration with experimentalists, and results of the project will lead to improved models to explain results of respiratory experiments and will generate new predictions. In addition to enhancing understanding of respiratory function and dysfunction, this project will have broad implications: theoretical methods developed to study the spread of coordinated activity will be relevant to other neural networks and to the spread of disease, opinion and information, while approaches for analyzing processes that evolve at very different rates will apply to other settings as well.  Trainees contributing to this research will gain experience in using computational methods to address data-driven questions in neuroscience. Methods and findings developed will contribute to the training of students via local group meetings and courses and will be disseminated more broadly via publications, presentations, and model sharing.<br/><br/>Rhythmic activity of networks of neurons underlies a wide range of repetitive behaviors such as walking, scratching, and breathing. This project will address rhythm generation, coordination, and control via a focus on neuronal networks in the mammalian brainstem associated with respiration. In the rhythms that these networks produce, multiple populations of neurons take turns activating at specific relative times and with specific activity patterns within each breathing cycle, and the activity within each population rapidly synchronizes when it arises.  This work will analyze how activity with complex dynamic features, called bursting, arises in specific neurons and subsequently spreads across the population in a particular brainstem region during the inspiratory phase of breathing. Analysis of the bursting patterns, which will be done across multiple stages of development, will involve novel mathematical analysis of the dynamics of systems with components that evolve on several distinct timescales.  The resulting theoretical advances will have implications for the study of other biological and physical systems with multiple timescale dynamics. New results will also be attained, using mathematical and computational methods, about how the coordination of bursting across the network depends on the pattern of connections across the neurons involved and the properties of the synapses through which these neurons communicate.  These advances will also have broader applicability to other processes involving the spread of activity in a network from a small set of local initiation sites. Finally, this project will include investigation of coordination of activity across multiple neuronal populations to produce functional respiratory outputs, including issues of flexibility and robustness under changes in feedback signals due to environmental or metabolic demands. These steps will be guided by novel experimental data, will involve collaboration with experimentalists, and will result in advances in basic understanding as well as predictions about alterations underlying certain respiratory dysfunctions. The project will include diverse graduate students and undergraduates who will gain valuable research training, will impact educational efforts, and will lead to dissemination of results and model sharing.<br/><br/>This award is funded jointly by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and BIO/IOS through the Neural Systems Cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mammals, hairs have evolved for thermoregulation, camouflage, display, and mechanical protection. Importantly, hair follicle has emerged as a leading model system for studying general mechanisms of stem cell control, tissue patterning during morphogenesis, regeneration and aging. Though powerful, traditional reductionist research approaches are limited by technological barriers and high experiment costs. This project aims to develop an interdisciplinary approach between computational modeling and experimentations to understand crucial questions that arise from the growth control of the follicle and stem cell lineage dynamics. It is anticipated that the new mathematical model can be generalized to study multiple aspects of skin biology, beyond hair growth. The new theory on the role of cellular response to dynamic growth regulation will have wide applications to other biological growth systems. This project will also provide students with the opportunities to get exposed to state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research and will greatly promote diversity in mathematics and biological sciences by recruiting students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project will study the control mechanisms of hair follicle growth dynamics both at spatial and temporal levels by adopting an interdisciplinary research approach between computational multiscale modeling and single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments. On the modeling side, a coupled stochastic partial differential equation sub-model for signaling dynamics and a discrete off-lattice sub-model using Voronoi tessellation technique for inter-cellular interactions will be developed. Several numerical coupling algorithms between the continuum and discrete sub-models will be evaluated, which will greatly benefit broader multiscale modeling research in biological developmental systems. On the experiment side, new single-cell RNA-sequencing data will be collected to calibrate the model and validate model predictions. Using this interdisciplinary approach, a novel growth control mechanism will be verified, which states that cells? heterogeneous responses to signals play a critical regulatory role in the follicle growth dynamics. This project will provide significant insight into the biological problems, including spatially defining the maximum length of a follicle, temporally regulating the periodic follicle growth dynamics and mechano-chemical coupling in biological growth. Finally, by merging multiscale modeling with single-cell RNA-sequencing results, this project will also demonstrate a new path for synthesizing modeling and biological data in broader interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The human brain, accounting for only 2% of total body weight, consumes about 20% of the oxygen supply to produce energy needed to support its functions. Brain functions depend in a crucial way on the vascular system delivering oxygen and metabolites where needed and removing waste products in a timely fashion. Several questions related to the coordination of blood flow and brain activity level are still waiting for a definite answer, for example why an oversupply of oxygenated blood is delivered to activated brain regions. Understanding the coupling between brain electrophysiological activity and cerebral blood flow is crucial in many brain studies, and a model explaining the mechanism connecting cerebral electrophysiology and hemodynamics will be the key to interpret experimental data. The metabolic processes guaranteeing brain functions require a coordination between different types of brain cells, neurons and astrocytes, and are the crucial link between electrophysiology and hemodynamics. Multiscale, multi-physiology mathematical models are necessary to evaluate the feasibility of proposed interaction mechanisms, test novel oxygen transport paradigms, and understand the interplay between local and global brain phenomena. This project will open a mathematical window on the interactions and feedback of different human brain functions, with potential to uncover metabolic or vascular causes behind some brain disease states. Students will be trained through involvement in the research project. <br/><br/>The integrated spatially distributed mathematical models developed as part of the project will be used to understand the signaling mechanisms linking neural activation to changes in the cerebral metabolism and hemodynamics, with a particular interest in the role of oxygen in normal brain activity and in the presence of cortical spreading depolarization waves related to migraine and traumatic brain injury. The new predictive computational models for the electric, metabolic, and blood flow dynamics of brain activation under normal and abnormal conditions will be based on ordinary and partial differential equations and will account for multiple spatial and temporal time scales. Modeling challenges arise from the need to interface brain functions at widely different spatial and temporal scales, involving quantities as different as electric charges and biochemical species concentrations. The design of a model capable of relating phenomena occurring in the gap junctions to changes at the organ level, e.g., in the concentrations of biochemical species or hemodynamic response, will be a great asset for the mathematical modeling community and may serve as a template for a variety of spatial and temporal multiscale paradigms. The models will depend on a multitude of parameters, whose estimation will be carried out within a Bayesian framework utilizing the tools developed for computational inverse problems. An important contribution of the project will be the quantification of uncertainty in the model predictions, which will indicate how much variability can be expected.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interdisciplinary research program will be used to discover new roles of morphogens as regulators of cell mechanics and how cell mechanics provide indirect potential feedback into morphogen signaling during development of the fruit fly Drosophila wing imaginal disc, one of the main biological models for studying basic mechanisms of animal and human development. The study of perturbations to normal development will also provide general biological insights into the mechanistic basis for diseases from birth defects to cancers related to uncontrolled tissue growth.

As with any emerging disease, many uncertainties remain about significant disease characteristics such as transmission and immunity. Predicting disease spread and the impacts of interventions is a challenge with imperfect and incomplete information about the disease itself. Moreover, an accurate accounting of the outbreak requires knowledge about the number of cases, which necessitates fast and accurate testing. However, the current use and speed of testing varies significantly across different locations. While testing alone will not stop transmission, widespread testing gives richer information on how an outbreak is progressing, particularly with a disease such as COVID-19 with hidden transmission. Furthermore, knowledge of person?s disease status leads to better adherence to the strict isolation and social distancing measures used to curb transmission. While many models consider the role of interventions in flattening the curve, this project will address a key gap in modeling of COVID-19: the impact of testing strategies on the ability to assess and intervene against the ongoing outbreak.  This project will develop new mathematical models of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19 along with intervention strategies using testing. Two graduate students will be involved in the research.<br/><br/>This project will develop compartmental models of the COVID-19 outbreak incorporating the use of testing in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing. Testing capacity, accuracy, and delays will be built into these models to closely resemble real-world challenges in implementation, which will differ by location. The PI will analyze and simulate these deterministic models to expand understanding of the requirements of testing for successful slowing of the outbreak. The results from the novel models will be validated with simulations from similarly structured stochastic models and actual data. Results will be presented through a publicly accessible dashboard where information on local testing procedures can be entered and examined to determine locally appropriate strategies. This publicly accessible dashboard will help policy- and decision-makers develop policies in the context of local testing capacity to best slow the spread of COVID-19. In addition, this work will provide a framework for developing priorities for testing and evaluation of intervention in future emerging epidemics.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) program of MPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, sequences that occur in hippocampus while the animal is at rest or asleep are believed to be critical for memory processing and consolidation. These sequences are examples of internally generated activity: that is, neural activity that is shaped primarily by the structure of recurrent connections between neurons. The goal of this research is to advance the mathematical theory of sequence generation. A fundamental question is what types of network architectures underlie emergent sequences. This work will investigate the mechanisms for sequence generation in recurrently connected networks with complex patterns of connectivity and inhibition-dominated dynamics. The theory will then be used to understand and model neural sequences, with a focus on hippocampal sequences.  Although this work is motivated by neuroscience, the phenomenon of sequential activity emerging from competition between units is sufficiently common that the mathematical results derived here are likely to be useful in a variety of broader contexts in the biological and social sciences.<br/><br/>The main goal of this research is to understand, and be able to predict, the set of neural activity sequences in a recurrent network from the underlying structure of connectivity. In addition to providing new insights about sequence generation in the brain, this study will elucidate structure-function relationships in recurrent networks and provide tools for analyzing networks to identify dynamically relevant motifs.  This research will be carried out in the context of a special family of inhibition-dominated threshold-linear networks, which are a commonly used firing rate model of recurrent network dynamics.  These networks naturally give rise to an abundance of sequences, and the dynamics are tightly connected to the underlying connectivity graph.  Moreover, they are mathematically tractable and thus amenable to a mathematical theory of sequence generation.  Project 1 focuses on network architectures built from directional graphs, a new type of graph exhibiting directional dynamics without necessarily having a feedforward architecture, thus providing an important generalization of synfire chains. Project 2 addresses the anatomy of a sequence and its decomposition into ?core? and ?peripheral? components, with the core being a network motif that supports a sequential attractor, and the periphery consisting of additional neurons that are recruited by the attractor.  Finally, Project 3 uses the theory developed in earlier projects to analyze and model various phenomena observed in hippocampal sequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The genomes of any two humans are 99.9% identical, with differences in the remaining 0.1% determining the diversity of human traits. For example, DNA sequence differences account for 80% of the variability in human height. Current technology allows the identification of these sequence polymorphisms between individuals, which can then be correlated to differences in a given trait. When done on a genome wide level with a large population of individuals, such genome wide association studies (GWASes) can be a useful tool for the identification of key genes controlling specific traits. However, a requirement for this approach is the availability of powerful and accurate statistical and computational methods to search through a massive amount of sequencing data to correctly identify DNA differences associated with the phenotypic trait of interest. The outcome of the project will (1) provide statistical methods to understand relationships between DNA sequence differences and the full range of diversity observed in a population, and (2) provide corresponding computational tools suitable for use by biologists and biomedical specialists for their specific population studies. This research project will produce intermediate methodological and theoretical results that lay the foundation for the final output. This project will also apply the developed methods to real, experimental data to demonstrate their utility. In addition to these research outcomes, the project will support the training of students in the field, including women and underrepresented minorities.<br/> <br/>GWAS estimates the correlation between phenotypic traits and sequence polymorphisms to identify genetic variants highly associated with specific traits. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of genetic variant, and sequencing technologies allow for large-scale collection of SNP information. The project team will develop new GWAS models and methods to find trait-affecting variants with more power and accuracy. Specifically, the new methods developed in this research project will improve existing approaches by allowing modeling of observed traits from any probabilistic distribution in the exponential family. This extension ensures statistical models are biologically meaningful and interpretable. Second, the new methods will exploit different Bayesian priors, especially contemporary Bayesian priors for ultra-high dimensional model selection, that will share information across the entire genome for stable statistical inferences. Theoretical results of Bayesian priors in these new methods will also be developed. Third, a stochastic search algorithm will be developed to efficiently search through the massively large model space for model selection. This ensures that new methods are practical and useful since analysis can be done within a reasonably short time frame. Meanwhile, this also eliminates the use of subjective thresholds of significance that are now commonly used but an embarrassing practice in GWAS, having no theoretical support. Methods will be implemented into software tools and will be freely available for statisticians, biologists, and biomedical researchers.

These ?cell surface receptors? function like a car ignition switch: they accept a specific chemical signal (the key) and then communicate the presence of this chemical key to the interior of the cell.  Because receptors have a profound influence on cell behavior, it is crucial to understand the details of how they function.   The most important types of receptors are made up of several component parts that work together as complex molecular machines.  Because of this complexity, mathematical models of cell surface receptors are integral to understanding both natural signaling mechanisms of cells and the mode of action of man-made therapeutic drugs.  Mathematical and biophysical theory being developed by the PI is revealing how receptor function may be understood in terms of the properties of their parts (protein subunits) and the energetic interactions between these parts (conformational coupling).   This fundamental scientific knowledge is the launching point for numerous applied endeavors that directly impact human wellbeing, such as scientifically informed drug development. <br/><br/>In more technical terms, the PI?s recent mathematical work on cycle bases of product graphs provides a formalism for the efficient enumeration the possible modes of conformational coupling in a receptor dimer or high-order oligomer, beginning with arbitrary hypothesized monomeric state-transition diagram.

The PI is developing a general mathematical formalism, based on product graphs, for analysis of receptor complexes, with specific focus on dimeric G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases.  The formalism will be extended to accommodate non-equilibrium phenomena mediated by nucleotide exchange.

In the absence of a vaccine, the most effective strategy for preventing HIV transmission is to implement the ?treatment as prevention? approach, that is, antiretroviral medication to achieve undetectable viral load in patients, thereby preventing sexual transmission. For treatment and cure of HIV infection, one of the viable options is to begin therapy early in infection before the establishment of virus reservoirs such as latent infected CD4+ T cells and infected brain cells. This project develops and uses mathematical models of cell-virus interactions and computational methods to study the effectiveness of early antiretroviral therapy (ART), including a recently developed nanoparticle-based preventive therapy (NBPT), for treatment of HIV. The study will focus on HIV infections in three critical sites: vaginal mucosa, circulation, and brain.

The project will utilize experimental data from HIV infected humans and SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) infected macaques, as well as data from experiments on effectiveness of ARTs and NBPTs, for the model validation and the parameter estimation. The developed models will be extensively analyzed using dynamical systems theory as well as statistical, numerical, and machine learning methods. Mathematical and computational challenges anticipated in this research will offer opportunities to develop innovative techniques that advance the field of applied non-autonomous complex differential equations as well as optimal control theory. This project will also broaden the application of differential equation modeling to a machine learning framework.

Both undergraduate and graduate students will be trained to use tools from mathematics and physics within the broad field of systems biology, thereby contributing mathematicians with interdisciplinary skills towards the national goal of STEM workforce development.<br/> <br/>A new continuum model will have the flexibility to describe three biopolymerization processes: transcription of ribosomal RNA, transcription of mRNA of ribosomal proteins and the translation of ribosomal proteins. The model for each process is referred to as an individual compartment within the full assembly model.  The prototypical compartment is a generalization of vehicular motion models, and it provides a mechanism for including inflow and outflow phenomena as well as torque-assisted transcription when appropriate.  The full ribosome assembly model is described by a system of ordinary differential equations whose variables are related to the outputs of the individual compartments. The full model also includes a set of feedbacks that regulate initiation and translocation rates governing the dynamics occurring within each compartment. Ribosome production rate is the key determinant of bacterial growth rate, and it depends on several fundamental quantities including the response time after a nutritional up-shift or down-shift, the combined time of transcription and translation, and the time to produce a ribosome. Several system parameters exhibit inherent uncertainties due to the stochastic nature of availability of various enzymes. The project includes a sensitivity analysis effort to quantify effects of the most crucial system parameters on each fundamental quantity. Examining these effects and their variability  allows one to determine the average community response of bacteria to its environment. The variability in microbial community response to antibiotic application is often an important determinant of antibiotic effectiveness.<br/><br/>This award is funded jointly by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and BIO/MCB through the Program of Genetic Mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the last few decades, the explosion in the amount of available data for phylogenetic inference has offered great opportunities to further our understanding of various biological processes. At the same time, they also move phylogenetics to a new learning regime, where traditional theories can no longer guide developments and interpretations of phylogenetic algorithms. The main goals of this research are to improve our understanding of the central concepts of phylogenetics through the viewpoints of statistical learning and information theory and to provide essential tools for phylogenetic analyses in this new learning setting. By providing a framework to design, analyze and improve phylogenetic estimators, the research will greatly extend the set of problems for which reliable analyses can be obtained. Most notably, our research in the setting when the number of species increases is especially amenable to the biology of small evolving units, including studies of viruses and antibody-making B-cells. The education component of this study involves mentoring undergraduate and graduate students with independent research in phylogenetics and will produce various demonstrations, tutorials and statistical packages for phylogenetic inference.<br/><br/>The proposed research lays out the foundation for explicit quantification of phylogenetic information and uncertainty, with a focus on the setting where sequence data are continually being generated and analyzed. This approach enables the use of local phylogenetic methods as a means to analyze likelihood-based methods and helps investigate systematic ways to stabilize uncertainty while retaining essential information. Two analytical tools to construct and analyze phylogenetic methods in non-asymptotic settings will be developed: a new class of concentration inequalities for evolutionary-related random variables and a Taylor-like local-to-global expansion of phylogenetic likelihood on the space of phylogenetic trees. These newly derived tools will be used to study several important inference problems, including species tree/supertree reconstruction and parameter estimation in viral phylogenetics and trait evolution. The research activities will provide important insights into the influences of phylogenetic information and uncertainty on the stability of a phylogenetic estimate.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Statistics program and the Life Science Venture Fund in DMS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neuroanatomical anatomical differences between people affected by these conditions and ?typically developing? individuals have been identified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the biological mechanisms leading to such differences, and their link to the disease processes, are incompletely understood. It is safe to perform MRI on pregnant women, and recent developments in the ability to account for fetal motion during image acquisition, have enabled high-resolution 3D imaging of the fetal brain. In order to better understand the developmental mechanisms that underlie the trajectory of anatomical changes observed by MRI in humans, longitudinal measurements are also collected in nonhuman primates. Human and nonhuman primates share many similarities in both brain structure and function that allow findings in one to be translated to the other. Advantages of nonhuman primate studies are that many factors that may vary between human pregnancies can be experimentally controlled, and much more detailed longitudinal imaging is possible. This research will develop computational approaches to more precisely link fetal growth between human and nonhuman brains. The work leverages unique human and nonhuman primate imaging datasets with new methods for systematically labeling the brain into corresponding sub-regions and establish closer links between developmental events. This increased precision will enhance knowledge gained from ongoing human observational studies and enable new clinical approaches to address neurodevelopmental diseases. <br/><br/>The ability to non-invasively monitor fetal brain growth in both human and nonhuman primates using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a new opportunity to characterize brain development with longitudinal experimental designs. However, given the increased frequency with which data can be acquired, and quality of high-resolution images, an important new limitation is the inability to translate developmental time points between species at the level of precision of the acquired data. Conventional approaches for studying postnatal brain images utilize processing steps such as spatial normalization to a common anatomical coordinate frame, segmentation into tissue classes, and parcellation into known neuroanatomical regions. Adaptation of these techniques to study the developing fetal brain requires age and species-specific definitions for quantities such as transient developmental zones, or emergence of cortical gyri and sulci. This project makes use of increasingly powerful machine learning techniques and leverages the increasingly rich fetal imaging data now being collected, to extract consistent cross-species measures of brain development. An additional objective is to develop fine scale anatomically and temporally consistent definitions across species. These neuroanatomically localized definitions will then be used to quantify regional morphometric growth during fetal brain development in both species. This work contributes to the computational science and the neuroscience that supports neuroimaging studies of fetal brain development. These developments will provide a new translational resource to link anatomically and temporally specific information about brain development, both in normal growth and in clinical and animal model experiments focused on neurodevelopmental disorders.<br/><br/>This award is being co-funded by the CISE Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) through the CRCNA and BRAIN Programs, and the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Primary cilia are solitary (one per cell), immotile, antenna-like microtubule-based organelles extending from the surface of nearly every mammalian cell. Mechanical stimuli (such as blood flow) cause deflection of the primary cilium, initiating downstream signaling cascades to the rest of the cell. Defects in primary cilia have been associated with atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and cancer. Yet the biochemical signaling pathways from primary cilia bending to cellular responses remain a complex and unsolved problem that will be addressed by the three PIs. Results from the proposed research will further our understanding of subcellular mechanosensing of primary cilia, and will lay the foundation for designing therapeutic strategies to treat various human diseases due to defected primary cilia. The PIs will engage both undergraduate and graduate students to conduct interdisciplinary research, and results from the proposed research can provide new approaches in mathematical biology, biophysics, biomedical engineering and medicine. The methods and techniques to be developed in this project will go beyond the context of primary cilia and extend to other problems featuring mechanically induced cellular functions, for example, in the regulation of vascular tone. <br/><br/>Long speculated to trigger intracellular calcium release as a second messenger for subsequent cellular biochemical signaling and responses (such as change in patterns of cytoskeleton or altered ion and solvent transport), recent experiments using genetically-coded calcium indicators refuted the calcium-responsiveness of primary cilia for a range of cells. Thus it is imperative to establish fundamental understanding of the role of primary cilia in subcellular mechanosensing. One main challenge to identify the pathway(s) from cilium bending to subsequent bio-chemical signaling is to isolate primary cilium contribution from the rest of the cell responding directly to the same mechanical stimuli. By using an optical trap, PI Resnick is able to bend a single primary cilium without exerting force on the rest of the cell, thus providing a great opportunity for insight to the missing pathways. Combining this experimental technique with mathematical modeling (PI Young) and numerical simulations (PI Peng), the team aims to (1) characterize the mechanical properties of the primary cilium, (2) qualify the coupling between cilium and cytoskeleton, and (3) identify the time scales and characteristics of signaling activation to quantify ciliary-mediated flow sensing. Results from these three aims will advance the mathematical modeling of the primary cilium and how it couples to the intracellular signaling pathways. <br/><br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Life Science Venture Fund in DMS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Closely related viruses, however, can have very dissimilar genomes, complicating integration of knowledge acquired from the study of independent viruses, and limiting prediction of the characteristics and potential threats of emerging viruses. Viruses, however, conserve a few structural properties that could help circumvent this problem. Most viruses store their infective genetic material in a protein shell called a capsid. The capsid self-assembles from multiple copies of the same (or similar) proteins, and most capsids display icosahedral symmetry. This architecture optimizes the interaction of proteins and the volume available to store the viral genetic information. This research project hypothesizes that viruses have evolved a limited set of replication strategies to specialize and exploit the reduced number of geometrical templates capable of forming icosahedral capsids. This, in turn, may have constrained the number of three-dimensional configurations adopted by capsid proteins, providing a mechanistic rationale for the existence of viral structural lineages. This hypothesis will be tested by analyzing and comparing hundreds of viruses from multiple different viral families using novel mathematical methods. Confirming this hypothesis will offer a quantitative framework to study viral evolution and open the door to design of generic antiviral strategies targeting viruses in the same structural lineage.<br/><br/>Only ten protein folds have been identified among major capsid proteins of viruses that form icosahedral capsids. These folds define viral lineages that group viruses that can be genetically unrelated and infect hosts from different domains of life. This limited number of folds contrasts with the vast genetic diversity of viruses. The existence of these folds across the virosphere, however, remains unknown. Here, it is hypothesized that there is a direct relationship between the viral replication strategy of each viral lineage, the icosahedral lattice of the capsid, and the fold of capsid proteins. The hypothesis will be tested by developing a database that will include the viral replication, protein fold, and capsid lattice of five hundred viruses that have been reconstructed at high or medium molecular resolution. Voronoi tessellations and protein-protein interaction lattices will be obtained to identify computationally the icosahedral lattice associated to each virus. Additionally, molecular measurements of the reconstructed capsids will be obtained to establish allometric relationships for at least one viral lineage, facilitating the prediction of icosahedral capsid properties from genomic information. The new icosahedral framework will be also extended to obtain new sets of elongated capsids, which represent the second most abundant type of capsid. The methods will be disseminated online for use by viral structure researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in biological systems, rarely does an undulating flagellum beat freely, but may beat in close proximity to (or through) passive elastic structures such as mucosal strands embedded in the fluid environment or walls of tubular ducts. This project will investigate the motility of microorganisms through fluids with suspended polymeric networks where the gaps between polymer filaments are comparable to the size of the organism. The study is relevant to mammalian sperm-egg penetration and spirochete motility through mucosal tissues. The project will also investigate the journey of insect sperm through narrow sperm storage organs in the female reproductive tract. These systems require the development of novel mathematical models and computational methods that move beyond simple representations of sperm flagella, that allow remodeling of discrete viscoelastic networks, and that capture the geometry of confining structures.

By choosing a discrete network rather than a continuum description of a non-Newtonian fluid, a heterogeneous environment is easily represented. For instance, the power required for an organism to first penetrate the viscoelastic network (as in mammalian fertilization) and how its form evolves as it moves through these regions can be studied. In particular, the energetics of the Lyme disease spirochete as it migrates through such a viscoelastic network will be investigated. In addition, the dynamics of insect sperm motility in the female reproductive tract will be modeled.

In mammals, hairs have evolved for thermoregulation, camouflage, display, and mechanical protection. Importantly, hair follicle has emerged as a leading model system for studying general mechanisms of stem cell control, tissue patterning during morphogenesis, regeneration and aging. Though powerful, traditional reductionist research approaches are limited by technological barriers and high experiment costs. This project aims to develop an interdisciplinary approach between computational modeling and experimentations to understand crucial questions that arise from the growth control of the follicle and stem cell lineage dynamics. It is anticipated that the new mathematical model can be generalized to study multiple aspects of skin biology, beyond hair growth. The new theory on the role of cellular response to dynamic growth regulation will have wide applications to other biological growth systems.

Several numerical coupling algorithms between the continuum and discrete sub-models will be evaluated, which will greatly benefit broader multiscale modeling research in biological developmental systems. On the experiment side, new single-cell RNA-sequencing data will be collected to calibrate the model and validate model predictions. Using this interdisciplinary approach, a novel growth control mechanism will be verified, which states that cells? heterogeneous responses to signals play a critical regulatory role in the follicle growth dynamics.

While activity changes in the basal ganglia are well defined, little is known about parkinsonism-associated changes in the primate basal ganglia-connected motor thalamus and cortex. To understand these changes in humans it is important to study the circuit dysfunction in primates, as these neuronal regions differ in both connections and composition from other species such as rodents. This project aims to enhance understanding of these network dynamics in ways that cannot be accomplished with conventional modeling approaches that often use an unwieldy number of coupled equations. Once the dynamics are described, new treatment approaches directed at normalizing thalamic activity in parkinsonian subjects may be developed and optimized for safety and effectiveness.<br/><br/>Mathematical models of brain circuits are helpful to understand these abnormalities within the basal ganglia-thalamocortical network of connections. This project will generate a new multiscale model of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathways that will reflect the nonlinear nature of individual neurons while taking advantage of the inherent features of each nucleus. The first objective will be to create a fully functional thalamocortical loop model that can locate and examine the bifurcations between healthy and diseased brain activity states. Of particular interest are the trajectories in parameter space that could allow a parkinsonian subject to return back to the stable healthy state, allowing possibilities for researchers to identify new therapeutic opportunities. Next, since the primate-specific thalamic interneurons cannot currently be targeted with certainty in vivo, the model will be used to examine the roles that these interneurons have on the system. Finally, the model will be validated using an extensive dataset of neuronal recordings from healthy and parkinsonian nonhuman primates. Comparison to the recorded data will restrict the analysis of the mathematical model to a physiologically plausible region of the parameter space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how to improve such scenarios requires increased understanding of bone components including osteocytes, important bone cells that, when sensing force or stress, send out signals that make other cells create or destroy bone.  Despite experimental evidence that osteocytes do significantly affect bone regulation, early observations revealed that the stress on the osteocyte needed to initiate bone regulating activities was much greater than the stress bones experience during daily activities.  For osteocytes? bone regulating abilities to be triggered, it appears force must somehow be amplified as it is transferred through the bone down into the microscale regions in and near the osteocytes.  While various reasonable explanations for how such force amplification can arise have been suggested, a consensus has not been reached primarily because the complexity of bone has made it difficult to consider all possible factors in any single existing study.  Addressing this issue, this study will develop an integrative model to combine multiple components of the osteocyte and its surrounding environment across multiple scales to better understand how everyday forces can be amplified as they travel to the osteocyte.  The model will be used to identify which components of the cell are most likely responsible for sensing force.  The model can also be used in future studies to consider how to improve force sensing and resulting bone regulation in individuals with osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, leukemia, broken bones, and other bone-related conditions. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to better understand how osteocytes sense forces in vivo (mechanosensation) and how the osteocyte and its microenvironment amplifies stress and strain to levels detectable by osteocytes in vivo by computational modeling and laboratory experiments. This goal will be achieved by introducing a multiscale 3D computational model for the osteocyte-fluid lacuna-canaliculi system and the encasing bone matrix under mechanical loading. The integrative model comprises three parts: a cross-linked viscoelastic fiber-network based ?cytosolid model? for force-bearing components in the cell; a lattice-Boltzmann-equation based ?fluid model? (intracellular and extracellular) for the remaining cellular and interstitial substances; and a continuum ?poroelastic model? for the bone matrix. These three submodels will be integrated through the mutual fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) using the immersed boundary (IB) framework. Model parameters will be obtained from both existing data in literature and collaborators? in vitro experiments. The three submodels will be verified prior to assembly by separate experimental data and the integrated model will be validated using the ex-vivo experiments. Predictions of the integrated computational model on large-scale CPU-GPU computer clusters will be used to characterize the stress and strain fields, and investigate the stress and strain magnification mechanism, generate new insights into osteocyte mechanosensation and stress/strain amplification, and introduce novel experimental designs to study how disease-related changes may regulate osteocyte mechanotransduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Primary cilia are solitary (one per cell), immotile, antenna-like microtubule-based organelles extending from the surface of nearly every mammalian cell. Mechanical stimuli (such as blood flow) cause deflection of the primary cilium, initiating downstream signaling cascades to the rest of the cell. Defects in primary cilia have been associated with atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and cancer. Yet the biochemical signaling pathways from primary cilia bending to cellular responses remain a complex and unsolved problem that will be addressed by the three PIs. Results from the proposed research will further our understanding of subcellular mechanosensing of primary cilia, and will lay the foundation for designing therapeutic strategies to treat various human diseases due to defected primary cilia. The PIs will engage both undergraduate and graduate students to conduct interdisciplinary research, and results from the proposed research can provide new approaches in mathematical biology, biophysics, biomedical engineering and medicine. The methods and techniques to be developed in this project will go beyond the context of primary cilia and extend to other problems featuring mechanically induced cellular functions, for example, in the regulation of vascular tone. <br/><br/>Long speculated to trigger intracellular calcium release as a second messenger for subsequent cellular biochemical signaling and responses (such as change in patterns of cytoskeleton or altered ion and solvent transport), recent experiments using genetically-coded calcium indicators refuted the calcium-responsiveness of primary cilia for a range of cells. Thus it is imperative to establish fundamental understanding of the role of primary cilia in subcellular mechanosensing. One main challenge to identify the pathway(s) from cilium bending to subsequent bio-chemical signaling is to isolate primary cilium contribution from the rest of the cell responding directly to the same mechanical stimuli. By using an optical trap, PI Resnick is able to bend a single primary cilium without exerting force on the rest of the cell, thus providing a great opportunity for insight to the missing pathways. Combining this experimental technique with mathematical modeling (PI Young) and numerical simulations (PI Peng), the team aims to (1) characterize the mechanical properties of the primary cilium, (2) qualify the coupling between cilium and cytoskeleton, and (3) identify the time scales and characteristics of signaling activation to quantify ciliary-mediated flow sensing. Results from these three aims will advance the mathematical modeling of the primary cilium and how it couples to the intracellular signaling pathways. <br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Life Science Venture Fund in DMS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Where there is a source of free energy and essential elements for life, there is likely a microbial community to be found, regardless of any environmental stresses that might be present. Such environmental communities are essential to all geochemical cycles and hence to all life on earth. They are also directly essential to function of multicellular life due to their ability to effectively recycle almost all natural polymers and other products from multicellular organisms. This project will focus on the development of methods for modeling microbial communities within the context of air-exposed stone environments. The goal is to characterize the form and function of such communities and their metabolic activity based on knowledge of their stark physical and chemical environments, and of their metabolic capability through genomic techniques. We will gather data from microbial communities growing on marble surfaces at Arlington National Cemetery and Cimitero Monumentale (Milan, Italy), and incorporate the resulting data into physics-based mathematical models.<br/><br/>Subaerial stone surfaces are generally hostile platforms for life with the consequence that any microbial community metabolism is likely relatively simple (as compared, for example, to a gut microbial metabolism), and is likely fairly isolated, as it is difficult for other organisms to survive. On the other hand, this very tenuousness likely means that the community is tightly tuned to its physical environment, so that understanding their interactions with each other and with their environment is necessary for understanding community function. Within the community, consortial associations are probably important for survival. All of these things make them likely candidates for modeling study. The project team will combine 24 hour study of a field site (the Arlington National Cemetery amphitheater) with a physical biofilm model to qualitatively characterize such a system. Detailed modeling and characterization of a chronic, multispecies environmental microbial community, and its interaction with its surroundings, has not been carried out. This is a significant task because of its non-trivial and strongly coupled physical, chemical, and biological aspects. The core of this project is to address these issues in an example natural community. The PI's aim is to combine and integrate comprehensive data gathering into a multiscale model that provides a quantitative characterization of an environmental microbial community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But the details of this process and its regulation have yet to emerge. For example, in the sea squirt -- a simpler system than the human embryo but one that shares a lot of commonalities -- a pair of cells is the starting point of the heart of this organism. These cells must move from their origin to the future location of the heart guided by cues from inside the embryo. As the paired cells move, they must push other cells out of their path to reach their destination, all while not losing contact with each other. Although observational studies of the coordinated movement of groups of cells involved in organ formation advance knowledge of embryonic development and associated congenital conditions, this project will deepen understanding by employing mathematical modeling and computer simulations to tease out the many facets of this process. The project will involve developing new computer simulation schemes for the mechanical interactions between cell boundary and interior dynamics, new models for the biochemistry needed to initiate collective migration, new methods for efficiently solving equations in deforming, moving geometries, and extensions to full three-dimensional domains. The investigators will use the interdisciplinary nature of the project to recruit and train undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The study of collective locomotion of organisms has led to important mathematical models that have guided biological discovery. A distinguishing feature of this project is that the multi-body interaction is achieved through mechanochemical bonds that interact with the cell's biochemistry and biomechanics in an unknown way. We focus on the collective migration of two cells in the early stages of heart development of the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis, an important model organism. Initially, these two cells are indistinguishable, yet at some point they establish leader and follower roles and move with distinct morphologies, squeezing through deformable tissues. Experiments show there is an advantage to move as a cohesive pair rather than a single cell, however, it is unclear why two cells do not slow each other down. These observations lead to the following questions: How are intracellular mechanics integrated to give rise to motility as a cohesive group? Why can two cells move faster together than alone? Is the two-cell system better at polarization and initiating migration than an individual cell? Mathematical modeling can aid experiments in answering these questions, but numerical solutions of the model equations will require development of novel computational methods that will be able to simulate coupled mechanical, transport, and chemical reaction equations in complex evolving geometries. Collaboration with an experimental lab will result in the discovery of a set of minimal yet sufficient interactions underlying the mechanical and biochemical organization of a cohesive cell group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neuroanatomical anatomical differences between people affected by these conditions and ?typically developing? individuals have been identified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the biological mechanisms leading to such differences, and their link to the disease processes, are incompletely understood. It is safe to perform MRI on pregnant women, and recent developments in the ability to account for fetal motion during image acquisition, have enabled high-resolution 3D imaging of the fetal brain. In order to better understand the developmental mechanisms that underlie the trajectory of anatomical changes observed by MRI in humans, longitudinal measurements are also collected in nonhuman primates. Human and nonhuman primates share many similarities in both brain structure and function that allow findings in one to be translated to the other. Advantages of nonhuman primate studies are that many factors that may vary between human pregnancies can be experimentally controlled, and much more detailed longitudinal imaging is possible. This research will develop computational approaches to more precisely link fetal growth between human and nonhuman brains. The work leverages unique human and nonhuman primate imaging datasets with new methods for systematically labeling the brain into corresponding sub-regions and establish closer links between developmental events. This increased precision will enhance knowledge gained from ongoing human observational studies and enable new clinical approaches to address neurodevelopmental diseases.<br/><br/>The ability to non-invasively monitor fetal brain growth in both human and nonhuman primates using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a new opportunity to characterize brain development with longitudinal experimental designs. However, given the increased frequency with which data can be acquired, and quality of high-resolution images, an important new limitation is the inability to translate developmental time points between species at the level of precision of the acquired data. Conventional approaches for studying postnatal brain images utilize processing steps such as spatial normalization to a common anatomical coordinate frame, segmentation into tissue classes, and parcellation into known neuroanatomical regions. Adaptation of these techniques to study the developing fetal brain requires age and species-specific definitions for quantities such as transient developmental zones, or emergence of cortical gyri and sulci. This project makes use of increasingly powerful machine learning techniques and leverages the increasingly rich fetal imaging data now being collected, to extract consistent cross-species measures of brain development. An additional objective is to develop fine scale anatomically and temporally consistent definitions across species. These neuroanatomically localized definitions will then be used to quantify regional morphometric growth during fetal brain development in both species. This work contributes to the computational science and the neuroscience that supports neuroimaging studies of fetal brain development. These developments will provide a new translational resource to link anatomically and temporally specific information about brain development, both in normal growth and in clinical and animal model experiments focused on neurodevelopmental disorders.<br/><br/>This award is being co-funded by the CISE Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) through the CRCNA and BRAIN Programs, and the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Application of mathematical models and methods have shed light on problems in various subfields of biology, and in turn, new mathematical methods and theories have been developed in response to the complex problems in biology. A growing arsenal of mathematical and computational methods and techniques are needed to study the current problems in biology that are critical to understanding the changing, heterogeneous world. While biological systems are complex compositions of multiple dynamical factors, many mathematical models are simplifications that may lack sufficient heterogeneity to address questions of current importance. As ecosystems continue to change, personal medicine advances, global temperatures shift, and organisms gain anti-microbial resistance, we need realistic models to account for individual, population and ecosystem heterogeneities, now more than ever. The minisymposum Modeling in a Heterogeneous World will enable researchers from different career stages working at the interface of mathematics and biology to meet and to discuss new and exciting methods and techniques for incorporating heterogeneity into realistic biological systems.

Viral and immune response kinetics upon infection impact transmission to other hosts and feedback into population-wide immunity, all of which influence the overall disease burden and trajectory of an outbreak. For example, dengue virus (DENV) burden and host immunity are intricately linked; certain levels of pre-existent antibodies in a host may actually enhance severity of secondary infection with a distinct serotype.  A better understanding of the coupled immunological and epidemiological dynamics is critical for control strategies against DENV, highlighted by recent debate over whether vaccination may increase severe dengue infection.  This project develops novel multi-scale modeling frameworks with dynamical analysis, computational methods, and data fitting for deciphering disease outcomes across scales.  Three case studies are considered: (i) the role of pre-existent antibodies on DENV severity and vaccination; (ii) feedbacks in pathogen persistence and host immunity in Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV); and (iii) effect of in-vector viral kinetics and inoculum (infection dose) on vector-borne disease epidemics and control.  By combining these studies, across-scale feedbacks will be assessed for their influence on disease burden and host immunity, and to provide insights on disease control and dynamics.  This work will provide undergraduate and graduate students with advanced training in this emerging interdisciplinary scientific field.<br/><br/>The interconnection of infection scales, vital for describing complex viruses, poses important mathematical/computational challenges.

Ion channels play critical roles in almost all biological systems including heart and nerves. About 13% of known drugs have their primary therapeutic actions targeted at ion channels. The methods developed in this project will advance the field of ion channel research, which will have an impact on research on enzyme catalysis, protein engineering, rational drug design, drug delivery, and new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. <br/><br/>In this proposal, the PIs will develop multiscale mathematical theories and numerical methods to study the multi-physics problems related to the ion channel dynamics involving a disparity of scales.

Moreover, sequences that occur in hippocampus while the animal is at rest or asleep are believed to be critical for memory processing and consolidation. These sequences are examples of internally generated activity: that is, neural activity that is shaped primarily by the structure of recurrent connections between neurons. The goal of this research is to advance the mathematical theory of sequence generation. A fundamental question is what types of network architectures underlie emergent sequences. This work will investigate the mechanisms for sequence generation in recurrently connected networks with complex patterns of connectivity and inhibition-dominated dynamics. The theory will then be used to understand and model neural sequences, with a focus on hippocampal sequences.  Although this work is motivated by neuroscience, the phenomenon of sequential activity emerging from competition between units is sufficiently common that the mathematical results derived here are likely to be useful in a variety of broader contexts in the biological and social sciences.<br/><br/>The main goal of this research is to understand, and be able to predict, the set of neural activity sequences in a recurrent network from the underlying structure of connectivity. In addition to providing new insights about sequence generation in the brain, this study will elucidate structure-function relationships in recurrent networks and provide tools for analyzing networks to identify dynamically relevant motifs.  This research will be carried out in the context of a special family of inhibition-dominated threshold-linear networks, which are a commonly used firing rate model of recurrent network dynamics.  These networks naturally give rise to an abundance of sequences, and the dynamics are tightly connected to the underlying connectivity graph.  Moreover, they are mathematically tractable and thus amenable to a mathematical theory of sequence generation.  Project 1 focuses on network architectures built from directional graphs, a new type of graph exhibiting directional dynamics without necessarily having a feedforward architecture, thus providing an important generalization of synfire chains. Project 2 addresses the anatomy of a sequence and its decomposition into ?core? and ?peripheral? components, with the core being a network motif that supports a sequential attractor, and the periphery consisting of additional neurons that are recruited by the attractor.  Finally, Project 3 uses the theory developed in earlier projects to analyze and model various phenomena observed in hippocampal sequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, taking into account phylogenetic diversity in the restoration of natural vegetation can lead to restorations that establish quicker and are heartier, while understanding the phylogenetics of pathogens can aid in back-tracing the spread of a disease and guiding epidemiological interventions.  While trees are a natural choice for representing evolution combinatorially, by restricting to the class of trees, it is possible to miss more complicated events such as hybridization and horizontal gene transfer. For more complete descriptions, phylogenetic networks, directed acyclic graphs, are increasingly becoming more common in evolutionary biology. This project focuses on phylogenetic networks and their parent models, phylogenetic mixture models, and will use applied algebraic geometry, in particular, algebraic statistics, to develop novel techniques for their inference. The project also has research training of graduate students and educational activities that introduce algebraic statistics and algebraic biology to undergraduate and K-12 students. In addition to hosting and running a series of one-week long graduate student research workshops in algebraic biology with follow-up small group collaborations, the PI will design a data-centered undergraduate mathematical biology course and organize annual collaborative and problem-based mathematical events for 6th graders with island-focused challenges.<br/><br/>Since network-based Markov models and their mixtures are specified with a polynomial parameterization, they are amenable to analysis using algebraic and geometric methods. This project will utilize their algebraic properties to establish identifiability, a property necessary for meaningful statistical inference, and then utilize their geometric properties to develop a procedure for network inference. Since the corresponding model varieties are toric varieties, secant varieties, and determinental varieties, this project will not only develop new inference methods for biologists, but will also lay the foundation and motivation for a new class of problems for those working algebraic geometry and non-linear algebra.

HIV latent infection of CD4+ T cells might be a major obstacle to viral eradication and has been extensively investigated. However, some other factors may also contribute to HIV persistence. The goal of this project is to develop new approaches in mathematical modeling and experimental data analysis to address questions of HIV persistence. Although HIV preferentially infects CD4+ T cells, it also infects other cells, such as macrophages. Macrophages are white blood cells that engulf and digest cellular debris and pathogens. During the engulfment of HIV-infected CD4+ T cells, macrophages can also get infected, contributing to viral production and persistence. In addition to the viral infection of CD4+ T cells, HIV can also be transferred directly from infected to uninfected CD4+ T cells. Such cell-to-cell transmission can take place within the same cell types and also in different cell populations such as macrophages. The relative contributions to HIV persistence from these sources remain largely unknown, but such information is crucial for finding a cure or control of HIV infection. Graduate students will be trained in this project.<br/><br/>In this project, mechanism-based mathematical models will be developed, analyzed, and compared with experimental data to study the relative contributions of various sources to HIV persistence during highly active antiretroviral therapy. In the first part, models with macrophages will be developed to analyze the data of macrophage infection with/without CD4+ T cell infection in different mouse models. The relative contributions from CD4+ T cell infection, macrophage infection, and CD4-to-macrophage transmission to HIV persistence will be evaluated. The second part studies whether cell-to-cell transmission can explain viral persistence during antiretroviral therapy and whether it also contributes to multiple HIV infection. The PI shall develop a new cell-to-cell transmission model including infected cells structured continuously according to their activation status. This provides a new cell-to-cell modeling framework to study HIV latency, low viral load persistence, and emergence of viral blips during suppressive therapy. The results obtained from this project will provide quantitative information on the sources contributing to HIV persistence, which can help develop treatment strategies targeting HIV eradication or control.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Uncertainty in transmission rates and the outcomes of social distancing, ""shelter-at-home"" executive orders, and other interventions have created unprecedented challenges to the United States health care system. This project will address these issues directly using advanced mathematical modeling from dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and networks. The mathematical models, which are formulated with the specific features of COVID-19 in mind, will provide insights that are critical to people on the front lines who need to make recommendations for intervention strategies and human-behavior patterns to best mitigate the spread of this disease in a timely manner. The project will train a postdoctoral scholar, a PhD student, and two undergraduate students in the research needed to solve these complex problems. <br/><br/>The standard approach for epidemic modeling, at the community scale and larger, is compartmental models in which individuals are in one of a small number of states (for example, susceptible, infected, recovered, exposed, latent), with individuals moving between states. The COVID-19 epidemic can be modeled in this way, with resistance as part of the dynamics. The simplest examples of such models for large populations are coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the fraction of a population in each of the states. To model the stochasticity of infection and latency, models with self-exciting point processes can be fit to real-world data. This project compares the dynamical systems and stochastic models of relevance to COVID-19 transmission. The models also incorporate network structure for the transmission pathways. The project extends prior research on contagions on multilayer networks by incorporating multiple transmission methods and coupling between the spread of the contagion itself and human behavior patterns. The project leverages high-resolution societal mixing patterns in epidemics, as they influence both (1) observations and demographics of who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and (2) who transits the disease, sometimes without being diagnosed.<br/><br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Applied Mathematics program and the Computational Mathematics program (Division of Mathematical Sciences), and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

During this fundamental process, specific proteins randomly search for the proper DNA segment and then aggregate around it to form a molecular machinery that processes the genetic information. The accuracy and efficiency of DNA search is quite remarkable given the fact that the size of these proteins is about a thousand times smaller than the typical length of a gene. Currently, there is no rigorous theory explaining how proteins identify and bind to specific targets on DNA. Such a theory will not only lead to a quantitative understanding of fundamental functions of DNA, it will also help scientists investigate the cause of diseases, such as cancer and diabetes, and ultimately advance drug discovery. This project will introduce a novel hypothesis according to which the search process is partially facilitated and directed by the DNA molecule itself. New mathematical models will be developed to study specific mechanical changes of the double strand that have the potential to assist proteins in finding their way towards the desired DNA segments. Results will be validated by direct comparison with experimental data. This project will train both graduate and undergraduate students in the broad field of mathematical biology, with special effort to recruit students from underrepresented groups and minorities.<br/><br/>DNA allostery, i.e., the process by which proteins binding at one location of the double strand affect the properties of other proteins at a distant location, has been increasingly recognized as a key-factor in DNA functions. It has been traditionally believed that allosteric interactions are mediated through specific DNA deformations, such as twisting, bending, and stretching.  The proposed research will introduce and explain the physical mechanism of a new type of allostery through protein-induced DNA bubbles. Such a conformational change can spontaneously create protein filaments capable of regulating DNA packaging. To study this effect, this project will develop a novel mathematical framework that describes the stability of a polymer in the presence of time-dependent rigidity. The resulting protein-DNA structures are highly adaptive in external stimuli and can provide special biomechanical pathways that help proteins find specific gene segments (e.g., promoters) in a more efficient way. The efficiency of the search process will be studied as a mean-first-passage-time problem of a specially designed reaction diffusion model.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry and the Genetic Mechanisms and the Molecular Biophysics programs in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, we have very limited understanding of how variability is maintained when populations spread across landscapes, why populations are often patchily distributed in space, and how phenology (the timing of biological events) influences these processes and patterns. The Allee threshold or critical size for population growth plays a particular role in spread of many populations. This project develops and analyzes mathematical models to investigate how a combination of an Allee effect and over-compensatory growth can produce oscillations in spreading speeds and robust non-spreading solutions across regions of parameter space, and to determine biologically when these outcomes should be expected. The project aims to extend these results to address important questions such as how ""invasion models"" can yield growth and persistence of a species in multiple, spatially separated patches within an unbounded habitat, and how phenology, stage-structure, and barrier zones affect spatially spreading systems. The findings of this research are expected to have direct, critical implications for controlling the spread of invasive species or promoting the reintroduction of native species into areas of extirpation. Graduate students will be trained through involvement in research at the interface of mathematics and biology.<br/> <br/>This project will advance our understanding of spatial population dynamics through rigorous efforts in four mathematical areas. These are: (i) analysis of integro-difference equations to characterize oscillations in spreading speeds and existence of non-spreading solutions; (ii) development and analysis of spatial models where Allee effects and over-compensation are generated by phenology and where dispersal is critical to population persistence; (iii) construction and examination of stage-structured models with an Allee effect; and (iv) creation and exploration of spatial models with an Allee effect and a stationary or moving barrier zone. For the models, the existence and stability of traveling wave solutions with constant and oscillating speeds will be established, and the links between the Allee effect and population dispersal will be explored. The minimal width of a barrier zone needed to stop, slow, or reverse a population invasion will be determined. Methods from differential equations, integral equations, and dynamical systems will be employed to identify conditions under which solutions spread into open space or stop invading.

Understanding and quantifying the number and orientation of these membrane proteins on dynamically deforming membranes is essential for developing medications and therapeutic strategies to facilitate or suppress membrane transport. By integrating mathematical modeling and computational simulations, this research will examine (1) how the rotation and translation of proteins leads to the deformation of bilayer membranes; (2) how deformation leads proteins to stay at specific positions and orientations; and (3) how these interactions are related to protein structure and membrane composition.

One prong of the research contributes to the advancement of public health by considering how pathological changes in neuron structure may degrade temporal processing in individuals with hearing loss. An essential component of the project is the mathematical and scientific training of undergraduate students. Students will engage in unique summer research experiences, gain knowledge working at the interface of mathematics and neuroscience, and contribute to a vibrant research environment at an undergraduate-only institution.<br/><br/>The project develops new mathematical approaches to modeling of neural coincidence detection. The first objective is to develop multi-compartment models of soma-to-axon coupling to quantify how coincidence detection sensitivity may be enhanced in neural structures with multiple sites of spike generation along the axon. The focus will be on creating low-dimensional models (with few spatial compartments) that preserve essential dynamical properties of these neurons and that elucidate how the site of spike initiation enhances coincidence detection sensitivity. The second objective is to dissect the dynamical mechanisms by which neurons process temporal information in high-frequency signals. The focus here will be on coincidence detector neurons in the brainstems of birds. These neurons respond to inputs that generate small amplitude voltage oscillations at kilohertz-scale frequencies. The goal of this work is to develop novel mathematical theory to account for how neurons extract temporal information from oscillations at speeds similar to, or faster than, intrinsic neuronal time-scales. The third objective is to assess (with simulations) how pathological changes to axon structure during hearing loss may degrade coincidence detection sensitivity in the case of ""electric hearing"" with cochlear implants. By investigating neural coincidence detection in a variety of contexts, the project will contribute to the general understanding of nonlinear neural dynamics and temporal processing in neural circuits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ?critical transitions?  are possible outcomes of environmental shifts in a wide variety of systems, including the savanna and forest transitions that this project will address, in which changes in frequency of fires can be especially important in changing the nature of these key ecosystem types. Building on previous work by the project leaders, this research will develop and apply state-of-the-art mathematical models, in concert with empirical studies, to predict how changing environmental conditions will mediate shifts in the savanna-forest boundary.  This project will also enhance education and training at multiple levels, including the training of a postdoctoral fellow; development of graduate and undergraduate research projects; and data visualization through collaboration with artist and educator Neil Goldberg.<br/><br/>The potential for multiple stable states, respectively forest and savanna, in vegetation systems has been previously demonstrated, combining empirical work with dynamical systems models.  The introduction of spatial effects leads to systems of partial-differential or partial differential-integral equations, including stochastic influences, which of course are more complicated to analyze, but are crucial for predicting the shifts of boundaries.  This project will develop and apply new methodologies drawn from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and will generate novel mathematical results, in particular in terms of fluctuations around the mean-field limit, developing new approaches to these stochastic systems, and applying a  novel landscape-flux approach. A key element will involve the training of a truly interdisciplinary postdoctoral fellow to be fluent both in the mathematical dimensions of the project and the ecological data analysis.<br/><br/>This award is funded jointly by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program and BIO/DEB through the Cluster of Population and Community Ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ongoing activity is formed by the interaction of the millions of cells that comprise the brain and that sit in a delicately balanced state in order to respond quickly and sensitively to the rapidly changing world. These cells do not form random patterns, but rather produce patterned activity such as waves and rhythms that can form the precursors to complex behaviors such as speaking and walking.  This ongoing and evoked behavior is carefully controlled by a balance of positive (excitatory) and negative (inhibitory) influences. The loss of this balance can disrupt normal behavior and lead to diseases such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. This research project uses mathematical models of the nervous system to provide a way to test hypotheses about brain activity put forth by experimentalists and to suggest new experiments based on the predictions of these models. In addition the project will also provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>Ongoing activity in the nervous system and how it impacts sensory and other inputs is the subject of much recent experimental activity. In particular, it is clear that the intrinsic interactions between neuronal circuits in absence of inputs can have a strong impact on how the system responds to incoming stimuli even at the large-scale cognitive level. This project will apply nonlinear dynamics methods to problems in theoretical neuroscience dealing with this question. Various forms of spatiotemporal activity, including spatially localized activity, oscillations, and propagating waves, are observed experimentally. There is now a good deal of evidence that the oscillatory activity that is ubiquitously found in the brain is not synchronized, but, rather, takes the forms of propagating waves and other types of spatiotemporal dynamics. The research will use mathematical models to study neurons that are connected to each other through nonlocal, spatially extended connections. The models of these networks involve nonlocal interactions leading to integro-differential equations. The project aims to develop new techniques for the analysis of such nonlocal equations, including novel perturbation methods, dimension reduction methods, and techniques for localizing the operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These genes produce proteins. Molecular and cell biologists have identified and analyzed these proteins in great detail: structural biologists now know the position of individual atoms of more than a hundred thousand proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis is done in thousands of laboratories every day to change biological function. A central challenge in biology is to understand how the atoms control biological function when biological structures are some 10 million times larger than atoms and move at a ten thousand billionth of their speed. Ion channels, the subject of this research, are good examples of such systems. They facilitate the transport of ions through cell membranes and control many biological processes, including cell-cell communication, signaling, muscle contraction etc. During ion transport, electrostatic interactions and ion correlation and size effects are all important factors to understand the channel selectivity, conductance, and other critical behaviors. Ion channels play critical roles in almost all biological systems including heart and nerves. About 13% of known drugs have their primary therapeutic actions targeted at ion channels. The methods developed in this project will advance the field of ion channel research, which will have an impact on research on enzyme catalysis, protein engineering, rational drug design, drug delivery, and new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. <br/><br/>In this proposal, the PIs will develop multiscale mathematical theories and numerical methods to study the multi-physics problems related to the ion channel dynamics involving a disparity of scales. The tasks to be focused on include a) developing a reaction field based hybrid solvation model for electrostatic interactions, and multi-step accelerated dynamics integration methods for all-atom MD simulations of ion channels, accounting for layered membrane and solvent environments; b) developing new improved PNP continuum models and new numerical methods to address crowded ions effects and relative drags between ion species in ion channels; c) pursuing mathematical analysis and physical understanding of the new PNP models; d) simulations based on the multi-scale electrostatic solvation MD and the PNP models. Educational efforts at high school, undergraduate, and graduate level will be an integrated part of this project, and research results from this project will be incorporated into the applied/computational mathematics curriculum at the two participating institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Primary cilia are solitary (one per cell), immotile, antenna-like microtubule-based organelles extending from the surface of nearly every mammalian cell. Mechanical stimuli (such as blood flow) cause deflection of the primary cilium, initiating downstream signaling cascades to the rest of the cell. Defects in primary cilia have been associated with atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and cancer. Yet the biochemical signaling pathways from primary cilia bending to cellular responses remain a complex and unsolved problem that will be addressed by the three PIs. Results from the proposed research will further our understanding of subcellular mechanosensing of primary cilia, and will lay the foundation for designing therapeutic strategies to treat various human diseases due to defected primary cilia. The PIs will engage both undergraduate and graduate students to conduct interdisciplinary research, and results from the proposed research can provide new approaches in mathematical biology, biophysics, biomedical engineering and medicine. The methods and techniques to be developed in this project will go beyond the context of primary cilia and extend to other problems featuring mechanically induced cellular functions, for example, in the regulation of vascular tone. <br/><br/>Long speculated to trigger intracellular calcium release as a second messenger for subsequent cellular biochemical signaling and responses (such as change in patterns of cytoskeleton or altered ion and solvent transport), recent experiments using genetically-coded calcium indicators refuted the calcium-responsiveness of primary cilia for a range of cells. Thus it is imperative to establish fundamental understanding of the role of primary cilia in subcellular mechanosensing. One main challenge to identify the pathway(s) from cilium bending to subsequent bio-chemical signaling is to isolate primary cilium contribution from the rest of the cell responding directly to the same mechanical stimuli. By using an optical trap, PI Resnick is able to bend a single primary cilium without exerting force on the rest of the cell, thus providing a great opportunity for insight to the missing pathways. Combining this experimental technique with mathematical modeling (PI Young) and numerical simulations (PI Peng), the team aims to (1) characterize the mechanical properties of the primary cilium, (2) qualify the coupling between cilium and cytoskeleton, and (3) identify the time scales and characteristics of signaling activation to quantify ciliary-mediated flow sensing. Results from these three aims will advance the mathematical modeling of the primary cilium and how it couples to the intracellular signaling pathways.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded with the Cellular Dynamics and Function program in Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, and the Life Science Venture Fund in DMS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work can be limited by lack of knowledge in tissue morphogenesis, the process by which living tissues develop their size-and-shape characteristics. Though live-imaging techniques have enabled the observation of morphogenetic processes, progress in fundamental understanding has been slow. This project aims to improve tools for modeling a wide range of living tissues that are relatively planar and have been extensively studied experimentally. The project will develop methods for numerical simulation of morphogenesis processes and attempt to reproduce the observed large-scale morphogenesis structures in planar tissues. The project provides graduate student training through involvement in the research.<br/><br/>This project concerns numerical simulation of large-scale continuum models for tissue morphogenesis that involve free boundaries, bulk-interface coupling, and highly nonlinear interactions. The work centers on a new mathematical model in which the field variables are nonlinearly coupled via reaction-convection equations and non-standard spatial partial differential equations. The project will develop semi-implicit and fully implicit time-stepping methods to avoid a potential time-step restriction for explicit time-stepping methods. Due to the high nonlinearity of the system, the boundary configuration must be updated together with the velocity field as well as other field variables. For this purpose, a novel interface-tracking method based on reference-map techniques will be investigated. Linear analysis close to trivial solutions will be conducted to assist the design of fast-converging iterative methods for solving the nonlinear system derived from the implicit time-stepping discretization of the original model. Simulations to understand in vitro micro-tissue and in vivo epithelial-tissue morphogenesis from live-imaging data will be carried out.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
