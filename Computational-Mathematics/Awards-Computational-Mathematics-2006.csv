Current<br/>postprocessing techniques are somewhat successful in one dimension.<br/>However, the most powerful methods require that the exact location<br/>of the discontinuities (edges) be pinpointed and that function<br/>dependent parameters be specified in each piecewise smooth region.<br/>One focus of the work is in developing Edge Detection free (EDF)<br/>postprocessing methods. The EDF methods are easily extended to<br/>multiple dimensions and in some case to irregularly shaped domains.<br/>The ultimate goal is a ""black box"" postprocessing algorithm.  A<br/>second focus of the work is in software development. A Matlab<br/>toolbox which implements both classical and modern postprocessing<br/>methods will be developed. The software will include a user friendly<br/>graphical user interface facilitating use by the wider community.<br/>The software will be used on benchmark problems to provide<br/>illustration of the methods for both the specialist and<br/>nonspecialist and to stimulate further research.  The software is<br/>designed to make it relatively easy for students to learn about the<br/>methods and for researchers to apply them.<br/><br/>For the most accurate methods available to numerically approximate<br/>the equations that govern natural phenomena, postprocessing methods<br/>are vital. This is because many phenomena in nature are inherently<br/>discontinuous, and numerical methods do not perform well when the<br/>solution to the governing equations are discontinuous. The<br/>discontinuities result in the methods producing solutions with<br/>nonphysical oscillations that do not truly represent the phenomena<br/>being modeled. Areas for which postprocessing methods are important<br/>include: gas dynamics, weather forecasting, earthquake and tsunami<br/>prediction, astrophysical modeling, multiphase fluid flow, the flow<br/>of glaciers, the propagation of waves in elastic solids, the<br/>separation of chemical species, aerodynamics, detonation waves,<br/>acoustics, etc."

In addition to the supersonic scramjet<br/>engine example, one interesting application is the modeling of water propagation in a<br/>fuel cell unit.

Even in the latter case, <br/>there is structure in the sense that one needs to work out which subsets of <br/>nodes should be connected into local triangles, tetrahedra, etc. Aspects <br/>associated with such grid generations can at times consume as much or even <br/>more computer resources than do the subsequent computations on the grid. <br/>Furthermore, it has been all but impossible to achieve high (spectral) <br/>computational accuracy on such grids without resorting to extensive use of <br/>domain decompositions. Numerous mesh-free methods have been proposed <br/>recently. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) approach stands out in several <br/>respects, most notably in that it generalizes traditional spectral methods <br/>to entirely mesh-free settings. Furthermore, implementations are usually <br/>remarkably simple. For example, 20-30 lines of Matlab typically suffices <br/>for solving an elliptic PDE on an irregular 3-D domain, to spectral <br/>accuracy. Both pseudospectral (PS) methods and RBFs were first proposed in <br/>the early 1970's. The superior performance of PS methods for solving many <br/>PDEs was demonstrated early on. A NSF proposal by the present investigator <br/>about 5 years ago was the first time RBFs were presented  in terms of being <br/>a direct replacement for the traditional basis functions in PS methods. <br/>Recently, significant progress has been made both on overcoming the high <br/>computer cost and the numerical ill-conditioning that earlier were thought <br/>to severely limit the RBF approach. Recent NSF-DMS supported work by the <br/>present investigator has opened up numerous further opportunities in this <br/>area, which will now be pursued. These include combining spectral accuracy <br/>with local node clustering in a fully stable way, a new stable algorithm in <br/>the extremely high accuracy flat basis function limit, developments towards <br/>faster algorithms, and the application of RBFs to PDEs in the geometries <br/>that are most relevant in astro/geophysics, etc.<br/><br/>In the last several decades, computational methods have become an <br/>increasingly essential part of how science and engineering are conducted, <br/>partly because of a rapid evolution of computer hardware, but equally much <br/>thanks to improvements in computational algorithms. Very often, the task to <br/>be solved, when formulated in mathematical terms, require the solution of <br/>partial differential equations (PDEs), often in irregularly shaped regions <br/>in several space dimensions. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) methodology, <br/>which is the subject of the present grant, opens entirely new opportunities <br/>in this regard, combining very high accuracy with unsurpassed geometric <br/>flexibility. One of several application areas of particular interest <br/>(pursued in collaboration with scientists at NCAR and NOAA) concerns <br/>geophysical and astrophysical modeling in spherical geometries, which are <br/>critical issues for effective climate modeling and for studies of solar <br/>dynamics.<br/><br/>"

At the interface between mathematics and materials science, we will focus on fundamental studies of nanoscale, crystalline thin films, where we will investigate the dynamics and coarsening of nanometer-scale structures in strongly anisotropic systems.  Our study is important not only for gaining a fundamental understanding of thin-film evolution, but also for elucidating mechanisms that can be used to promote spatially ordered nanostructures, and thus has the potential to impact the design of novel electronic devices such as high-efficiency lasers, and quantum cellular automata architectures.

More information is available on the web at http://www.pims.math.ca/science/2006/06seqcodes<br/><br/>This conference will contribute to the development of a core of mathematical scientists armed with powerful computational and analytical tools who are excited about applying mathematics in an interdisciplinary context. One example of applications impact is the value of algebraic and combinatorial structures such as Clifford algebras to cross layer design of multiple antenna wireless communication systems. The value of engaging the mathematical sciences community is to realize the promise of multiple antenna systems without exceeding the signal processing complexity of single antenna systems. Another example comes from the emerging area of multiple antenna radar, where the<br/>design of the waveform and the subsequent processing of the return determine the ability of the radar to discriminate targets from clutter, to discriminate closely spaced targets, and to detect small targets in complex scenes. All these are critical operational issues.<br/><br/>The conference will increase the pool of early career mathematicians who appreciate the power of mathematics and the important role that it plays in engineering disciplines. It will promote interdisciplinary exploration and breadth, and help early career mathematicians flourish in the different cultures associated with the different academic disciplines. This ability to bridge different worlds is a quality that is increasingly important to success in both academic and non-academic careers.The emphasis is on the synergy between theory and application, since information theory and coding are subjects that advance by discovering new applications. The conference will feature recent examples where this synergy is present, specifically space-time codes for wireless communication and Clifford algebras, quantum information theory and quantum error correcting codes, radar and sequence design. The evolving applications context helps to define new areas of theory and provides measures for what is considered interesting. The development of a fundamental theory grounded in specific examples often illuminates the right abstraction,  one that becomes a new primitive as theory and practice evolve together. When this synergy is not present there is always a risk that the theory will become detached from its original applications context and lose relevance.<br/>"

The synthesis of cellular proteins is a multi-step process inside living cells.  The genetic information stored in DNA directs the production of proteins through a bio-chemical process called gene expression.  When a specific gene is expressed, its DNA is first transcribed into a single stranded sequence of mRNA.  The mRNA sequence is then translated into a sequence of amino acids as the protein is formed.  These steps form the three levels of gene expression: transcription, translation, and post-translational modification.  Genetic Regulatory Networks (GRNs), consisting of genes, proteins, small molecules within cells in relatively low concentrations, and their interactions, function to regulate gene expression process for the production of proteins in response to certain physical, chemical, and biological stimuli.  GRNs can only be effectively modeled as stochastic systems with random molecular fluctuations instead of deterministic systems.  Very often GRNs are multi-scale in terms of multiple steady states, reaction rates, and molecular concentrations, making standard simulation algorithms inefficient.  Simplifying and reducing complex chemical and biological models enables easier conceptualization and interpretation and efficient simulations of inherently stochastic systems.<br/>     The main objective of the proposed research project is to provide simplified dynamics and to design efficient numerical schemes for complex stochastic chemical kinetic systems exhibiting multiple steady states and multiple time and concentration scales.  Applications will be emphasized on Genetic Regulatory Networks, for which only stochastic modeling incorporating random molecular fluctuations has proved to be successful.  On the mathematical side, using asymptotic analysis and probability theory, the transition rates and transition pathways of chemical kinetic systems with multiple steady states will be investigated, and the effective dynamics for stochastic chemical kinetic systems with multiple well-separated time and concentration scales will be studied.  On the numerical side, computational methods will be developed to simulate the reduced dynamics obtained from the mathematical work.  Computer-based optimization methods will be adopted to find the transition rates and pathways of multi-stable systems.  Convergence and error estimates for the proposed numerical schemes will be proved mathematically.  Issues like efficiency, robustness, adaptivity, and parallelism of the computing schemes will also be studied.<br/>     The proposed research will advance the frontiers of Applied Mathematics through significant generalizations and developments of the modeling, analytical, and computational techniques for stochastic and multi-scale systems.  It will help to understand functional issues of chemically reacting networks at the system level, which is becoming the new focus of genomic research.  The ideas from the stochastic and multi-scale analysis can be applied to a spectrum of biological, chemical, physical, and other scientific problems involving multi-scale modeling and can broaden the scope of research topics in the related fields.

Despite extensive effort in the past three decades, the generation and analysis of molecular surfaces remain a bottleneck in the structure prediction of biomolecules.  To overcome this difficulty, investigators introduce a partial differential equation (PDE) based approach of molecular surface modeling.  A set of curvature-controlled PDEs is designed for molecular surface generation.  Two new concepts, molecular multiresolution surfaces and minimal molecular surfaces, which naturally arise in the proposed PDE modeling, are introduced to the field of molecular biology.  The proposed molecular multiresolution surfaces provide a unified description of the van der Waals surface, solvent accessible surface, and solvent excluded surface.  The proposed minimal molecular surface is also consistent with surface free energy minimization.  Numerical techniques, including PDE solution algorithms and isosurface extraction schemes will be investigated.  Numerical tests will be carried out to validate the proposed ideas.<br/><br/>This project will lead to reliable methods in the structure prediction of biomolecules.

The rapid growth of computer capability in the past few decades not withstanding, our ability to model three-dimensional wave propagation and scattering involving geometrically complicated dielectric interfaces is severely limited. Mathematically, the wave solutions are usually non-smooth or even discontinuous across the material interfaces, so that our effort in designing efficient algorithms is easily foiled, unless the complex interfaces are properly treated. The complex interfaces and geometries are commonly tackled by using body-fitted grids in the literature. Even though considerable progress has been made in grid generation, the formation of a good quality body-fitted grid system in geometrically complex domain remains a difficult and time-consuming task. Alternatively, in this project, the investigator will explore how to accommodate dielectric interfaces with complex geometries by using Cartesian grids including the staggered Yee grids. The resulting Cartesian grid methods, which in some sense fit the numerical differentiation operators to the complicated geometries, are less well studied in the literature, in contrast to the body-fitted grid methods. The development of high order Cartesian grid methods with complex interfaces being accurately treated, is of imminent practical importance to efficient wave simulations, but remains unsolved. In this project, innovative fourth order Cartesian grid approaches will be constructed based on the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method newly developed by the investigator and his collaborators for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving material interfaces or inhomogeneous media. To address a widespread variety of electromagnetic applications, a complete set of fourth order MIB methods will be developed for different electromagnetic formulations including the Helmholtz equation, the wave equation, and Maxwell's equations, and for different scenarios including the transverse magnetic mode, the transverse electric mode, and fully three-dimensional mode. <br/><br/>Computational electromagnetics (CEM), an interdisciplinary field where one witnesses mutual contributions from mathematicians and engineers is of paramount importance for a wide range of applications, including analysis and synthesis of antenna, calculation of radar cross section (RCS), simulation of ground or surface penetrating radar, to name only a few. The proposed numerical approaches aim to address challenging CEM applications involving large-scale and irregularly shaped structures, for which currently existing methods encounter great difficulties. By delivering more accurate and efficient wave simulations, the proposed methods will lead to breakthroughs in resolving long-standing problems in the real CEM applications. Moreover, the proposed methods will have considerable impact on other challenging interface problems in scientific computing, such as the immersed interface and moving interface problems in fluid dynamics, electrostatic interface problems for structural prediction of large biomolecules in computational biology.<br/><br/><br/>"

Such equations are ubiquitous in engineering and science, and the task of finding approximate solutions to them is frequently the most expensive component of numerical simulations.<br/><br/>There currently exists a multitude of computational techniques for solving linear boundary-value problems, including some that are both highly accurate and very fast.  The emergence of such methods over the last two decades has vastly increased our ability to simulate complex phenomena in science, engineering, medicine, and many other fields.  However, existing high-performance computational techniques tend to be limited in their applicability, and somewhat fickle, in the sense that software needs problem-specific tuning to perform well.  The principal goal of the proposed research is to eliminate these drawbacks for a particular class of high-performance techniques, thus making such algorithms accessible to a wide range of important computational problems.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the proposed research is concerned with a class of computational techniques based on formulating the problem as an equation on the boundary of the computational domain.  It is known that the resulting equations can in some environments be solved extraordinarily rapidly.  Existing techniques for this task are based on so-called ""iterative solvers"", which construct a sequence of approximate solutions that gradually approach the exact solution.  The proposed research seeks to develop ""direct solvers"" for solving the boundary equations.  Loosely speaking, a ""direct solver"" manipulates the mathematical equation to produce an algorithm that determines the unknown variables from the given data in one shot.  Direct solvers are generally preferred to iterative ones, but they have in many environments appeared to be prohibitively expensive.  However, recent developments indicate that it is possible to construct direct methods that are as fast as, and sometimes even faster than, existing iterative ones.<br/><br/>Many benefits would accrue from the development of direct methods for solving the boundary equations associated with linear boundary-value problems; these include:  (1) The ability to solve certain problems that are beyond the reach of existing fast algorithms.  An example is the accurate solution of electromagnetic and acoustic scattering problems involving large objects at wave frequencies close to resonant frequencies of the scatterer.  (2) An increase in computational speed in environments where the same equation needs to be solved multiple times for different data.  Preliminary experiments involving the modeling of biochemical processes and large scattering problems indicate that a speed-up of one or two orders of magnitude is to be expected.  (3) The availability of high-performance computational techniques that are sufficiently robust to be incorporated into general purpose software packages."

Research on the mechanisms of multi-phase fluid transport has directly or indirectly motivated the creation of many advanced techniques in the fields of asymptotic analysis, homogenization, and scientific computing. This project introduces two fluid transport models and an efficient numerical algorithm to study multi-phase fluid dynamics that can be observed in human lung pathways or in pores and throats of a porous medium.  The multi-phase flows under consideration in this project are the two-phase gas-liquid pipe flow and the fluid-solid interactions. For the two-phase pipe flow, a multi-phase fluid model is investigated, for which the air is turbulent and the thin liquid film is either a viscous or viscoelastic fluid. Evolution equations for the liquid interfaces is obtained through matched asymptotic expansions while turbulence models are applied to the gas flow. The motivation for studying this kind of flow comes from a need to understand the hydrodynamic feedback mechanisms that govern mucus-air flow coupling in the human respiratory system. Accordingly, the principle investigator (PI) has developed an implicit Immersed Interface Method (IIM) for this two-phase pipe flow in three dimensions. The IIM takes advantage of jumps  of normal stresses across the interface, avoiding smearing of the singular surface tension force, and thus preserves volume-conservation and provides sharp resolution of the numerical solution across the interface. In addition to studying dynamics of the two-phase pipe flow,  the PI probes the major mechanism for mucus removal in lung pathways by developing a novel fluid transport model that portrays the three-dimensional fluid-solid interaction occurring in the muco-ciliary system. Inspired by fluid-solid homogenization problems, this novel model targets an understanding of multi-ciliary dynamics in the mucus layer. This model is not only capable of describing the essence of mucus-ciliary interaction, but also bears great fundamental interest in the development of homogenization theory. <br/><br/>To study multi-phase fluid transport, model equations for the transport are usually derived from the fundamental systems. The model equations are mathematically simpler than the fundamental ones.  They are derived by isolating a certain physical mechanism that is thought to play the dominant role in the fluid transport phenomenon.  Although model equations are approximate to the more complicated systems, <br/>the mathematical simplicity of these equations is advantageous to the analysis and efficient numerics that can enhance the predictive power of theories. While this project spans fundamental theories and practical  applications in biology or petroleum engineering, the overall goal is, nonetheless, simple and clear. That is, to provide well-understood models as well as the most efficient and accurate numerical algorithms for studying multi-phase fluid transport. Multi-phase fluid transport occurs in fluid dynamics  in myriad ways. One example is mucus transport in human respiratory systems. In lung pathways, there is air flow, a mucus layer, and a carpet of cilium  layer. The three phases interact with each other and create a unique transport  pattern for mucus clearance. The realization of the transport mechanism in lung pathways has been of immense importance for drug delivery inside the lung airways of cystic fibrosis patients. The Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) process is another example of multi-phase fluid transport. In the process,  compressed carbon dioxide is injected into old oil wells, which  induces a rearrangement of the oil layer in porous rocks.  Such a multi-phase transport increases the oil production for wells that are in production for years.  This EOR technique has been recently introduced to the oil industry in several states, including the state of Wyoming. The mathematical theory and analysis for understanding the transport mechanism behind this technique is crucial to the success of such a practice.<br/>"

In a computer simulation one follows the motion of the atoms, which obeys Newton's second law.  For crystalline solids, molecular dynamics offers a microscopic description of the crystal and defect structure, which is ultimately responsible for the overall material properties.  It offers more insight on why the material behaves the way it does, and it has become an extremely important tool in material modeling and simulations.  However due to the computational complexity, such a simulation can only be conducted for a small system.  Typically it is focused around material defects where the deformation is quite large, and the atoms in the far field are eliminated.  Such a truncation procedure creates artificial boundaries, where boundary conditions have to be imposed in order to take into account the missing atoms.  The boundary condition provides, for example, the position of the atoms at the boundary, which will be needed in the force calculation for the atoms inside the system, and therefore required to allow the simulation to proceed.  Straightforward approaches often lead to wave reflection at the boundary and therefore severely deteriorate the simulation results.  This project aims to develop systematic boundary conditions that serve the following purposes: (a) prevent wave reflection at the boundary; (b) maintain the external loading; (c) control the system temperature.  These boundary conditions will greatly improve the accuracy and reliability of molecular dynamics simulations and will help to study the dynamics of material defects under various kinds of loading, and in different temperature regimes.  The project also involves numerical analysis aspects and applications of these methods.  The proposed research will expose the students to physical modeling, large-scale simulations, mathematical analysis, and interdisciplinary research."

The software will be developed and used in the context of models developed and parameterized with cancer biologists at Vanderbilt University, with the expectation that they will have a significant and near-term impact on understanding the mechanisms of tumor invasion. This collaboration is also vital to ensure the relevance and usefulness of the methods and software; methods developed in an application vacuum tend to lack utility.<br/><br/>The investigator and his student propose the development of computer software and algorithms -- the mathematical rules that determine how the software works -- to study how cancer tumors, in middle and later stages of their development, invade nearby tissue.   In particular, the software will handle the complicated situation where the different genetic profiles of the multitudes of individual cells within a tumor, and the different stages in the cell-division cycle of each of these cells, are linked to the physically larger complete tumor.  This is important, for example, in studying the overall effects of chemotherapy when using drugs that affect cells differently depending on their genetic type or what part of the cell-division cycle they are in.  The mathematics behind the algorithms in this proposal are significantly more advanced than what came before, resulting in software that can be used effectively with the computers of today and the near future.  An important part of this research proposal is the collaboration between the investigators and colleagues in mathematics and cancer biology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN, and at the University of Dundee in Scotland.<br/>"

In the <br/>last 15--20 years we have witnessed a substantial development <br/>of computers.

The physical parameters controlling the planetary climate dynamics range from solar radiation, to volcanic activity, greenhouse gas, ozone, polar ice melting, and many others, which are normally modeled via direct numerical simulation for an appropriate climate model, which is typically a complex nonlinear partial differential equation or a system of such equations.  In the context of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, the main idea is to model the statistical behavior of planetary climate dynamics under the tacit assumption that the dynamics is close to its statistical equilibrium, and then to apply the fluctuation-response formula, which is the key part of the Theorem, to predict the average climate response (the response of various statistical quantities of the climate state) to small changes of the physical parameters of the climate dynamics.  Unlike a straightforward numerical simulation, this approach does not require one to actually simulate each appropriate scenario of climate development for various changes of parameters (which usually poses a computational problem of substantial complexity), instead providing the whole variety of possible responses to a wide range of small parameter changes for just a single numerical simulation with a climate model.  Obviously, this latter property will facilitate climate response modeling to a great extent.  However, the classical Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem as formulated in statistical physics is not directly applicable to climate modeling due to the fundamental mathematical incompatibility of the statistical states of virtually all nontrivial climate models with the classical version of the Theorem.  Here we propose a novel mathematical framework to perform climate response modeling with a suitably amended version of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, which is designed to circumvent these difficulties.  However, this framework requires extensive further development of mathematical and computational approaches to become practically usable for climate response modeling.  The detailed strategy for this development is set forth in the current proposal."

While these multiscale <br/>geometries are partly implicit (and classical) in differential geometry, <br/>in partial differential equations, as well as in many branches in graph <br/>theory (with applications to problems in computer science), only <br/>recently a very general, yet efficient, coherent and unifying <br/>construction has been introduced by the investigator and his <br/>collaborators. Multiscale function space decompositions that mirror <br/>these multiscale diffusion geometries are also constructed, through the <br/>introduction of special wavelet functions.

Their comprehensive treatment requires<br/>accurate mathematical modeling of processes at the fine scales and a mathematical framework for<br/>flow of information across scales.  This proposal addresses this problem in the context of heterogeneous<br/>explosives.  These have a complex microstructure with fragments of the energetic material, voids and<br/>pores existing within the granular aggregate.  When subjected to a sufficiently strong shock, a detonation<br/>is initiated.  Although the crystalline homogeneous explosive has a high ignition threshold, relatively<br/>weaker stimuli are sufficient to initiate the heterogeneous aggregate.  This is caused by the appearance<br/>of discrete sites, or hot spots, where burning commences and then spreads to consume the entire bulk.<br/>The multi-scale nature of the system is a daunting obstacle in the way of any attempt at ab-initio modeling<br/>of the detonation phenomena, at least at the present time.  Two major approaches to mathematical<br/>modeling have been proposed.  Both generate continuum equations at the macro scale, wherein a certain<br/>degree of homogenization is implicit and fine-scale processes have been included as subgrid models.<br/>The first approach, typified by the ignition-and-growth model, treats the explosive as a homogeneous<br/>mixture of two distinct constituents, the unreacted explosive and the products of reaction, at pressure and<br/>temperature equilibrium.  To each constituent is assigned an equation of state, and a single reaction-rate<br/>law is postulated for the conversion of the explosive to products.  The second approach explicitly<br/>recognizes the two-phase character of the explosive mixture.  The resulting model has separate<br/>balance laws of mass, momentum and energy for each phase, plus a rule that allows compaction of<br/>the solid phase driven by pressure difference between the phases.  Terms representing interfacial<br/>exchange of mass, momentum and energy appear, corresponding to the nonequilibrium processes of<br/>reaction, drag and heat transfer. These models are systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations<br/>that can be considered as generalizations of the Euler equations of gasdynamics.  This proposal is aimed<br/>at studies of existing continuum models as well as the investigation of fine-scale phenomena.  The primary<br/>objective will be to study how the strength and distribution of hot spots depend, in a quantitative way,<br/>upon the constitutive properties of the explosive and the size of the igniting stimulus, thus providing<br/>important information that can be used in attempts at multi-scale descriptions.<br/><br/><br/>Many areas in science and engineering, including weather, combustion, pollution, and biological systems,<br/>among others, involve behavior at the scale of observation that is determined by the events occurring at<br/>micro scales.  A thorough treatment of such systems requires, on the one hand, a fundamental<br/>understanding and accurate mathematical modeling of processes at the micro scales, and on the other, development of a theoretical and computational framework that would facilitate flow of information<br/>across scales, so that behavior at the scale of observation can be predicted reliably and accurately.<br/>Attention to such systems is particularly timely and apt in the context of science-based stewardship of<br/>explosive devices, and it is problems from this arena that form the core of this proposal.<br/>"

Motivating applications are in intracellular gene regulatory models which involve small numbers of large molecules and are essentially discrete and stochastic in nature.  Applications from other fields include financial market models as well as internet traffic of data.<br/><br/>The leaping methods work in the same spirit as time-stepping methods for differential equations which describe the time evolution of deterministic and continuous dynamical systems such as a spacecraft.  However, the state-of-the-art time-stepping methods for differential equations are far more sophisticated than any of the leaping methods which apply to stochastic and discrete systems.  This project aims to improve the existing leaping methods further as well as to design new leaping methods so that they could be an effective simulation tool.

The retraction algorithm preserves symmetry and the band structure of a matrix and requires in the worst case 2/3 the space of Gaussian elimination for banded unsymmetric matrices and theoretically about 1/2 the operation count. The algorithm uses a sequence of 1 x 1 and 2 x 2 pivots to transform the matrix to block diagonal form, and the elements of the transformed matrix are bounded. One aim of this research is to extend the algorithm to other structured systems. . The symmetric banded factorization may be used within a shift-and- invert Lanczos algorithm for determining eigenvalues, and in fact the fiber optics design problem involved finding several eigenvalues of a Sturm-Liouville problem and was the impetus for searching for an indefinite band symmetric factorization algorithm. In fiber optics design one wishes to solve an inverse problem of determining parameters in Maxwell's equation, a partial differential equation-eigenvalue problem, so that functions of the eigensystem meet certain criteria. One such criterion that needs to be computed is the dispersion, a function of the second derivative of the positive eigenvalues with respect to frequency and its gradient with respect to the design parameters which determine the refractive index profile of the various layers of the fiber. This project involves determining the best method for calculating these quantities for an extended model that takes into consideration fibers that are wrapped around a spool.<br/><br/>The properties of an optical fiber are determined by the chemical composition of the layers that compose the fiber. One fiber is not suitable for all situations. For example, one would not use the same fiber for underwater transmission and for a local area network. Until 2000 mathematical models were used only to determine the optical properties of a proposed design. In 2000 the Principal Investigator was part of a team at Bell Labs which decided to invert the process and to predict the chemical composition of the fiber to meet certain optical specifications. The modeling tool required the solution of thousands of systems of linear equations with symmetric and banded matrices. Traditionally one would ignore the symmetry, but taking symmetry into consideration, as in the algorithm recently devised by the PI, decreases the computational requirements for each individual system and provides information (the inertia) that could decrease the number of systems that need to be solved. Solving structured symmetric linear systems is also necessary when modeling the cavity of a linear collider or when modeling buildings, oil platforms and bridges to help prevent serious post-construction events, such as the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. An important element of this project will include application-oriented subprojects for undergraduate students to give them the real world design and modeling experiences they would not normally receive in the classroom and which they will then be able to use when they undertake careers as secondary or middle school teachers (math majors) or in local industry (computer majors).<br/>"

The role of software as standard-bearer for the mathematical sciences is especially important for industry, where mathematical discoveries tend to be applied only if they have been transformed into software.  <br/>     Successful production of high-quality, timely mathematical software brings an array of complex intellectual challenges requiring training not only in mathematics, but also in software development and the needs of application areas.

However, as the resolution of the desired numerical approximation increases, so does the computational complexity in solving the resulting system of equations.  A multilevel solution technique is needed to achieve a (nearly) scalable process.  A number of factors influence the efficiency of a multilevel method, most prominently the grid structure and underlying discretization scheme.  Preconditioned Schwarz-based methods have previously shown to handle a wide range of problems.  Most notably, high-order methods for positive definite problems, unstructured and non-nested grids, and indefinite operators.  The proposed research will study Schwarz-based preconditioning for hp adaptive discontinuous spectral element discretizations of the indefinite time-harmonic Maxwell's equation. The research will focus on the discontinuous Galerkin method, which enables straightforward adaptivity, and will utilize the previous success of domain decomposition methods to extend recent results for the indefinite Helmholtz equation on similar grids.<br/><br/>Electromagnetic principles find application in a broad range of industries.  Consumer products such as cell phones, antenna development in the military, and many energy applications at the national laboratories rely on the fundamentals of electromagnetics.  Computational simulation of this physical behavior is increasingly popular from an environmental, financial, and practical standpoint.  Still, due to the underlying nature of these physical laws, the simulation process on large supercomputers is not yet efficient in a number of cases.  The goal of this project is to further develop the solution techniques in the simulation process in an effort to improve efficiency.  More efficient numerical algorithms lead to the ability to solve larger problems with higher accuracy, offering scientists a better view of the physical model.  Specifically, the proposed research attacks the problem in a divide-and-conquer approach in a number of different respects.  First, the mathematical laws of electromagnetics (Maxwell's equations) are approximated in a way that reduces unnecessary computational cost, called adaptive spectral elements.  The challenge is that often this approach leads to an increasingly difficult second step by forming a large matrix of dependencies.  This second step is the focus of the proposed work whereby the problem is decoupled by a process called domain decomposition.  The research concentrates on improving the robustness and computational scalability.<br/>"

The challenge in the computational analysis of waves is that almost all problems of interest exhibit widely varying spatial scales. This is a consequence of the fundamental fact that waves propagate long distances relative to their characteristic dimension, the wavelength. We thus will work to develop methods which allow us to avoid the direct computation of the wave field everywhere along its path, concentrating computational resources only where they are needed. In addition to our work on basic techniques with broad applications, we plan focused studies on problems related to the generation of sound by jets and its propagation into the environment.

To begin  with the problem of a posteriori error estimation that can accurately predict the error on a single element using a class of averaging operators will be considered.  These methods do not seem to work well for problems on polygonal domains for which the pollution error dominates.  Accurate local estimators and indicators will be sought to correct this not only for quasi-uniform meshes but also for refined grids.  In order to carry out the above programs, it is necessary to develop fundamental technical tools such a sharp a priori estimates, both local and global, both for smooth and nonsmooth problems where both quasi-uniform and highly refined grids are present.  These problems are an integral part of this proposal.   The socalled superapproximation property of many finite elements has proved to be a powerful tool in the analysis of the finite element method.  Applications will be sought for a new form of this property that does away with mesh restrictions for some problems.<br/><br/>There are a very large number of important physical problems that arise in science and industry.  For many of these problems it is cost effective to make a mathematical model and to solve the problem on a computer.  For example consider the problem of designing an aircraft (or an automobile) so that is as fuel efficient and fast as possible.  Suppose that in order to achieve this we wish to minimize the drag and still give the aircraft enough lift to do its job. Instead of making a physical model that may be difficult and costly to change in order to arrive at an optimal design, many aircraft companies now almost completely design airplanes inside and out on computers.  The mathematical equations that must be solved are complicated but at the heart of many solution methods there is required the solution of a socalled elliptic differential equation.  This type of equation arises in a very large number of applications.  This project is concerned with obtaining more cost effective and efficient solutions of elliptic problems in order to obtain  more accurate and efficient numerical schemes.  In order to do so, we have to confront some fundamental mathematical problems which will be done in this proposal."

To<br/>understand the power of quantum computation for continuous problems one<br/>must know the computational complexity of these problems on a classical<br/>computer in various settings.  This is exactly what has been studied in<br/>IBC.  Recently the investigators introduced a new quantum setting in which<br/>randomized queries are permitted.  They have shown that for path<br/>integration there is an exponential improvement for the qubit complexity<br/>compared to the standard quantum setting.  This is important since the<br/>number of qubits is a critical resource for the foreseeable future. Among<br/>the questions the investigators and their colleagues stydying are:<br/>What are the query and qubit complexities for other continuous problems?<br/>Are there trade-offs between query and qubit complexities?<br/><br/>For some forty years, computing has been driven by Moore's Law which is<br/>the empirical observation that computing power doubles about every 18<br/>months.  Powerful computers have been crucial for our economic strength<br/>and our national security.  They have made the internet possible.  For a<br/>number of reasons the consensus among experts is that Moore's Law using<br/>current silicon technology will end in some 10 to 15 years.  These reasons<br/>include the shrinkage of logic gates and wires to atomic size, the tre-<br/>mendous heat generated as chips get smaller and faster, and the cost of<br/>fabrication facilities.  Since it is so important to maintain the<br/>Moore's Law trajectory, new ways to compute are being considered.  One<br/>of the most promising ideas is to use the principles of quantum mechanics<br/>to do quantum computing.  The investigators and their colleagues are<br/>studying the following question:  If physicists and chemists succeed in<br/>building quantum computers, which continuous problems arising in science<br/>and engineering can be solved much faster on a quantum computer than on a<br/>classical computer?<br/>"

The basic idea of order reduction is to<br/>replace the original large-scale system with a system of similar type, but of<br/>much smaller dimension.  In recent years, a lot of Krylov machinery for order<br/>reduction has been put in place.  Still, the existing algorithms are not at the<br/>same level as Krylov subspace methods for eigenvalue problems or systems of<br/>linear equations.  For example, Krylov subspace methods combined with powerful<br/>preconditioning techniques are routinely used to solve linear systems with<br/>millions of unknowns.  However, the application of Krylov techniques for order<br/>reduction to such truly large-scale systems remains prohibitive for a number of<br/>reasons.  First, most existing algorithms generate reduced-order models via<br/>explicit projection after a suitable basis for the underlying Krylov subspace<br/>has been generated, and thus they require the storage of all these basis <br/>vectors.  In the truly large-scale case, the resulting storage requirements<br/>become excessive.  Second, Lanczos-type algorithms generate reduced-order<br/>models on the fly, and thus avoid the issue of keeping all basis vectors.<br/>However, in general, the resulting reduced-order models do not preserve crucial<br/>properties of the original large-scale system, such as stability or passivity.<br/>Third, all existing Krylov techniques involve the solution of large sparse<br/>linear systems of equations at each Krylov iteration.  It is usually assumed<br/>that these systems can be solved via sparse direct methods.  However, this is<br/>not the case in all applications.  The goal of the proposed work is to develop<br/>new and effective Krylov subspace-based methods for order reduction that<br/>overcome the above issues and are thus applicable to truly large-scale systems.<br/>In particular, the focus will be on techniques that allow the use of<br/>preconditioned iterative methods for the solution of the inner linear systems,<br/>instead of sparse direct methods, and on methods that allow flexible<br/>shift-and-invert preconditioners for the outer Krylov iteration itself.  The<br/>use of nonlinear semidefinite programming to remedy the loss of stability or<br/>passivity of reduced-order models generated by Lanczos-type algorithms will<br/>also be explored.  The proposed research is expected to lead to a more complete<br/>understanding of Krylov subspace-based order reduction and to result in<br/>original algorithms that are on par with their state-of-the-art counterparts<br/>for large eigenvalue problems and large linear systems.<br/><br/>The use of computational techniques and numerical simulation is ubiquitous in<br/>the design and verification of today's complex engineering systems.  For<br/>example, a state-of-the-art computer computer chip contains about one billion<br/>transistors.  Despite this enormous complexity, the design and verification of<br/>such chips is done almost exclusively with simulation, and first-time-correct<br/>fabrication in silicon is the norm.  However, even with today's computing<br/>power, simulation of a complete system is often not feasible due to the<br/>extremely high dimension of the mathematical model describing the system.<br/>Order reduction is a key technology to make such simulation tasks possible by<br/>first replacing the original model by a suitable approximation of much smaller<br/>dimension.  The proposed research is expected to lead to new order-reduction<br/>techniques that will have applications in many important areas, including the<br/>design of computer chips, microelectromechanical systems, nanotechnology, and<br/>structural dynamics.<br/>"

The design of scalable parallel algorithms for solving large linear systems of equations is one of the most important problems in scientific computing. Among the most effective parallel iterative methods are parallel multigrid methods, multilevel matrix preconditioners, and domain decomposition methods. Domain decomposition methods are ideal for parallel implementation. But none of the current multilevel domain decomposition algorithms has shown convincing parallel scalable experimental results, and in practice the convergence rates often deteriorate with the increase of the number of levels. On the other hand, a uniform convergence rate has been proved, both theoretically and experimentally, for the multigrid V-cycles for solving certain symmetric positive definite problems. But the parallel performance of multigrid V-cycles is much less satisfactory. The main goals in this project are the design and analysis of scalable parallel multilevel domain decomposition methods, and the study of connections between the related parallel multilevel iterative methods. A solid theoretical foundation should be valid for these inherently related multilevel preconditioners. Such a theory will provide a practical guide for the design of scalable parallel multilevel iterative methods.<br/><br/>Applications of the proposed algorithms to important scientific and engineering computational problems, e.g., elasticity problems, Stokes/Navier-Stokes problems, elastic structure vibration problems, and acoustic scattering problems, will be studied in this project.

Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art simulation technology is limited by the competing demands of accuracy (which requires an increasing number of degrees of freedom to resolve the fields on the scale of the wavelength) and efficiency (which favors coarse discretizations).  The PI proposes to develop and rigorously analyze new integral equation methods that overcome these limitations by avoiding the need to discretize the fields on the scale of the wavelength, while retaining error-controllability. The PI proposes to develop such methods for acoustic scattering by impenetrable bodies in two and three dimensions, with the longer-term goal of developing methods for full electromagnetic scattering in three dimensions. The methods the PI proposes to develop will combine existing, high-order discretizations techniques based on smooth partitions of unity and FFTs with new, asymptotically-derived integral equations that can be solved numerically with a prescribed error tolerance for arbitrarily high frequencies, within a fixed computational time. The development of these methods calls for a number of intellectual innovations. The PI proposes to (i) further advance his work on high-order high-frequency integral equation solvers for surface scattering by smooth, convex obstacles. Here the effort will concentrate on an extension of the convergent, localized singular integrators developed in the two-dimensional setting to three dimensions; (ii) develop methods suitable for non-convex obstacles, using the infinite frequency limit of the problem (i.e., geometrical optics) to approximate the phase of<br/>the highly oscillatory unknowns; and (iii) introduce new high-order accurate integration schemes in small regions near geometrical singularities of the scatterers, in order to deal with complex obstacles with sharp features such as corners and edges.<br/><br/>The proposed research has the potential to impact numerous scientific and engineering disciplines dealing with acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation phenomena, which arise in a wide range of applications. Examples include antenna design (from consumer electronics devices like cell phones to satellites and space<br/>exploration probes), non-destructive testing, medical and biological applications (using ultrasound, tomography), electromagnetic compatibility testing and certification, evaluation of propagation<br/>effects on communication systems, design of low observable military hardware, automatic target recognition, etc. The ever increasing frequencies involved in these problems places many of them beyond the capabilities of currently available computational methods, thus requiring new and innovative mathematical approaches. This proposal is focused on the development of such an approach, leading to solvers whose computational cost is virtually independent of frequency, and which are thus able to accurately solve such problems for a tremendously larger range of frequencies than current techniques.<br/>"

The situation is far less satisfactory in higher dimensions.<br/>As a matter of fact, the  current approaches for the construction of high-D<br/>wavelet representations scale poorly with the dimension. On the one hand,<br/>intrinsic constructions become hopelessly complicated already at relatively<br/>low dimensions. On the other hand, the simple approach of lifting<br/>univariate systems to higher dimensions becomes eventually immensely<br/>non-local. As a result, the construction of effective, efficient, wavelet<br/>representations in high dimensions remains a major challenge and an elusive<br/>target.  The premise of this proposal is that the only way to meet this<br/>challenge is to fundamentally change the principles of wavelet<br/>constructions. The ambitious goal of this project is to develop<br/>representations that scale correctly with the spatial dimension: constants<br/>in the complexity estimates of the algorithms that are independent of the<br/>dimension; linear functionals that have limited, controlled, overlapping in<br/>their supports; and performance grade that does not degrade with the growth<br/>of the dimension. The project is expected to contribute in tangible ways to<br/>NSF's broad criteria. This is first and foremost due to the intrinsic<br/>importance of the research area, and the fact that the problem attacked in<br/>this project is a major hurdle in the relevant research area. In addition,<br/>the initiative offers a highly valuable training and education  opportunity<br/>to mathematical science students,  education in  areas that  are at the<br/>interface between mathematics on the one hand and science and technology on<br/>the other hand.<br/><br/><br/>Our era is marked by breathtaking improvement in sensor acquisition<br/>capabilities and an explosive increase in communication over wired and<br/>wireless channels. As a result of these and similar trends, the correct<br/>handling of massive datasets is, these days, at the core of almost every<br/>technology that deals with scientific data.  The most fundamental issue in<br/>this regard is the fact that the size of the dataset is merely an artifact<br/>of the acquisition technology; it is not related to pertinent information<br/>that the data encode, nor to the actual applications that are sought for.<br/>Data representation is the scientific discipline that deals with challenges<br/>like the above.  It resolves the above problem by transforming the data into<br/>a new format which allows an efficient and effective extraction of<br/>information, storage, transmission, and the like.  There is probably no way<br/>to overstate the importance of research on data representation: Development<br/>of novel data representations is ranked among the top scientific priorities<br/>of our nation. Indeed, the innovators in this field are richly recognized<br/>for their contributions: even after restricting attention only to research<br/>on the mathematical  and statistical aspects of data representation, one<br/>finds, in the last eight years alone, two Medal of Science awards,  as well<br/>as five or more elections to the National Academy of Science.  The wavelet<br/>representation is among the most important contributions of the data<br/>representation community to science. It was introduced in order to provide<br/>an answer to the main shortcoming of the Fourier representation, i.e., the<br/>fact that the latter never provides a sparse representation to transient<br/>events.  The research community succeeded in constructing very good wavelet<br/>representations in 1D.  Those systems are computed and inverted by fast<br/>algorithms and strike as good balance as can be between performance and<br/>localness. The same it not true in high spatial dimensions.  Armed with<br/>that observation, the intent of this ambitious project is to develop novel<br/>classes of wavelet representations that are efficient and effective in high<br/>dimensions.<br/>"

The investigator will implement the new numerical<br/>methods for the computer simulations of highly elastic fluid<br/>flows, namely, models with high Weissenberg number to simulate and<br/>understand another newly observed intriguing physical phenomenon,<br/>the elastic turbulence.<br/><br/>Fluids comprised of large macromolecules, known as non-Newtonian<br/>fluids or complex fluids, can generate many new physical<br/>phenomenon. Examples of non-Newtonian fluids can be found<br/>throughout our daily lives,  including molten plastics,<br/>engine oils with polymeric additives, paints, and many biological<br/>fluids such as egg white and blood. The design, implementation,<br/>and the use of numerical methods for the computer simulation of<br/>such physical phenomena requires full grasp of non-Newtonian<br/>fluids and the results of the investigator's  research are<br/>expected to have significant applications, for example in industry.<br/>Namely, a polymer engineer could perform elaborate<br/>Computer Aided Design (CAD) studies in which the link between the<br/>molecular architecture of the raw material and the final<br/>properties of the product would be established, at least<br/>qualitatively. Production problems would be predicted and<br/>partially overcome through improved design. One could also think<br/>of using an on-line computational rheology model in concert with<br/>appropriate control algorithms to provide for intelligent,<br/>physics-based process control techniques. There are many more<br/>opportunities that the investigator's  research results<br/>could generate.<br/>"

The global realization of<br/>conformal structures which are local in nature is known classically as<br/>uniformization. Circle packing methods have led to notions of discrete<br/>uniformization which both mimic and approximate the classical notion.<br/>However, the geometric nature of the discretization raises<br/>computational issues outside traditional numerical mathematics. In<br/>particular, uniformization is a self-assembly process which is<br/>extremely challenging in practice --- for instance, with circle<br/>packings containing millions of circles. In the central computational<br/>work, the investigator implements a recursive framework for managing<br/>this self-assembly which avoids global distortions while accommodating<br/>efficient parallel implementation. The computational issues are not<br/>considered in isolation, but rather in relation to ongoing<br/>applications by the investigator and his collaborators to topics<br/>including brain imaging, conformal tiling, dessins d'enfants, and<br/>conformal welding. Of the many theoretical issues raised in<br/>applications and experiments, the investigator pays special attention<br/>to the notion of ``flow uniformization'' and to its potential use in<br/>discrete conformal welding and shape analysis.<br/><br/>Surfaces --- a smooth soap film, the convoluted gray matter of the<br/>brain, a faceted crystal lattice --- are ubiquitous in the natural and<br/>physical sciences, engineering, computer visualization, and scores of<br/>other areas. The tools for studying and describing surfaces<br/>mathematically came out of work in the nineteenth century, with a<br/>particularly rich geometric vein associated with angular measure going<br/>by the name ""conformal structure"". Among the most celebrated results in<br/>mathematics is the Riemann mapping theorem of 1851 which proved that<br/>every surface with a conformal structure, no matter how complicated,<br/>can be identified with one of three very simple familiar surfaces<br/>--- a ball, a plane, or a disc --- in a way that preserves conformal<br/>structure, that is, that preserves angles. Wonderful as this theory<br/>is, and despite the availability of huge computational resources, it<br/>has been only in the last decade that new mathematics in the form of<br/>circle packing has provided a practical means for actually realizing<br/>Riemann's theorem. The investigator develops the mathematical and<br/>computational aspects of circle packing in the context of several<br/>applications. Among these are the flattening of human brain cortical<br/>surfaces to aid analysis by neuroscientists, the study of plane<br/>shapes through a process known as conformal welding for use in<br/>computer vision, and the construction of mathematical Riemann surfaces<br/>in various topics which are now amenable to experimentation<br/>for the first time.<br/><br/>"
