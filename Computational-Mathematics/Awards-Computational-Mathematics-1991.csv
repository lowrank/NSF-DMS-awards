The theory of non-homogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations developed                here provides a unified framework for extending the complex                     variable theory to solving large classes of problems involving                  non-analytic functions.  The effect of non-homogeneous terms is                 shown to alter the analytic solution by an additive non-analytic                term which is a double integral.  The fast and accurate method of               evaluating this integral provides a firm ground to successful                   application of the theory to computing the solution at a superior               computational complexity.  The robust code to be developed on                   these ideas will be used to solve large classes of applied                      problems including (i) rising bubbles in a compressible fluid;                  and (ii) cavitating compressible flows past curved obstacles.

Current software in the EISPACK and                  LAPACK subroutine libraries rely on variations of the shifted QR                algorithm.                                                                                                                                                      The primary objective is to obtain an understanding                             of the global convergence properties of these algorithms                        and determine whether they succeed for a set of problems of                     full measure.                                                                                                                                                   Computation of eigenvalues is required in the study of vibrations               and other problems involving differential equations.                            For many years the EISPACK subroutine library has been an                       effective resource for approximation of eigenvalues.                            While experience has shown the algorithms to be both reliable and               fast, there is no theoretical basis for their success.  This                    project involves the application of techniques from dynamical                   systems and complexity to analyze the established numerical                     software.

Steven Hurder will work on rigidity of Anosov                  actions of ""large"" groups; on the ""topology-at-infinity"" of open                manifolds, based on K-theory invariants of differential                         operators; on the classifications of low-dimensional Anosov                     diffeomorphisms, using secondary classes and moduli spaces for                  quasi-symmetric maps; and on the spectrum of elliptic operators                 on leaves of foliations, using the dynamics of the geodesic flow                of the foliation.

The                        properties dealt with are such things as symmetry of these                      objects and flows defined on them, all to be investigated by a                  variety of techniques from algebra and analysis."

These stochastic dynamical systems               include perturbations by both Gaussian and Poisson white noise.                 The computational treatment of the optimal feedback control of                  general, nonlinear, stochastic differential equations with Markov               noise in continuous time, including Poisson noise, is a                         particularly unique feature of this project.  The algorithms are                being tested on multi-state resource models, but are applicable                 to a wide variety of applications.  The numerical approach                      directly treats the partial differential equation of stochastic                 dynamic programming.  New data structures and algorithms, such as               finite element and multigrid methods, will be developed to                      alleviate both memory and computation intensive demands from the                ""curse of dimensionality"".  Purely parallel methods are being                   developed for scalable, massively parallel processors and massive               memory supercomputers.  Results give the optimal feedback control               variables and the expected optimal performance index in terms of                state variables and time.

Walker, he hopes to study gauge-                theoretic generalizations of the Casson invariant.                                   The connections between geometry and physics involved in                   this work are striking.  They work both ways.  While much of the                motivation for studying four-dimensional manifolds, Lie groups,                 and group representations may once have come from the hope of                   calculating things of interest to physicists, in recent years                   notions inspired by quantum physics have given rise repeatedly to               constructions of new topological invariants that answered                       questions the topologists could not answer before."

The turbulent                 flows arise as solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.  The                   permanent regime for a turbulent flow is related to an attractor                in the phase space of the flow.

The technique is based on                   solid mathematical foundation.  Each grid point in an existing                  grid is to be moved according to a decoupled system of n ordinary               differential equations (n is the number of space dimensions).                   The technique will provide a one-to-one correspondence of the old               and new grid points and thus folding of the grid will definitely                be eliminated.  Moreover, it will provide direct and precise                    control of the cell size.  Thus, it will be adaptive.  Finally,                 the deformation method will be computationally efficient.  In                   particular it will be suitable for parallel computing.

In biology, the               order of components in the human nervous system is a trillion.

Even simple models of these problems                          typically require months of manpower to generate grids before                   computers can perform the computation.

The domain                         decomposition methods to be examined are explicit/implicit                      Galerkin and mixed finite element, and finite difference                        procedures.  In these approaches, the computational domain is                   divided into nonoverlapping subdomains, and boundary data at                    subdomain interfaces are calculated explicitly from the solution                at the previous time step.  A priori error estimates for                        these schemes have been derived for model problems.                             Furthermore, preliminary numerical results indicate that the                    approaches are viable, and that a speed-up factor equal to the                  number of subdomains can be achieved.  The principal investigator               will investigate the extension of these algorithms to more                      general linear and nonlinear problems in multiple space                         dimensions, and their implementation on parallel processing                     machines.                                                                            Of particular interest will be the application of                          these procedures to flow in porous media problems, such as                      enhanced oil recovery and subsurface contaminant transport.  In                 these problems, the physical and chemical processes to be                       modeled generally occur over long time periods, and accurate                    simulation requires fine-scale temporal and spatial resolution.                 Current supercomputers have been extremely useful in                            increasing the amount of resolution obtainable.  However, it is                 possible that with the emerging parallel computers, we may be                   able to increase resolution by at least another order of                        magnitude. To achieve this goal will require modifications to                   current algorithms and the development of new algorithms.  In the               methods proposed here, domain decomposition is used to                          effectively divide large problems into smaller subproblems that                 can be solved in parallel.  By employing this type of approach,                 fine-scale, multidimensional simulations that are currently too                 memory -intensive or time-consuming for conventional machines may               become tractable."

This work involves (i) further study,                           implementation and software production of reliable algorithms for               integrating differential Riccati equations, (ii) using the                      differential Riccati equation to perform mesh-selection for stiff               systems of two-point boundary value problems, (iii)                             software production of a code for nonlinear two-point boundary                  value problems based on the Riccati method.  He will further                    study the so-called superstability phenomenon arising during                    adaptive integration of stiff differential equations, seeking                   efficient techniques that avoid the practical superstability                    occurrences and that can be incorporated into general purpose                   ordinary differential equation solvers.  Finally, he will                       continue working on numerical approximation of invariant                        manifolds, in fact on the numerical solution of the associated                  systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations.  This                     involves (i) approximation analysis for the nonlinear case, (ii)                efficient solution techniques (multigrid approaches) for the                    resulting linear systems, (iii) exploitation of the link with the               Riccati transformation.                                                              Most realistic physical phenomena are modelled by                          complicated nonlinear systems of differential equations.                        Exact solution of these systems is hopeless, and numerical                      simulation is a necessity.  This work aims at producing reliable,               and rigorously justified, algorithms to solve some of these                     systems.  The intent is to produce software tools for the                       working scientist.  In particular, work on the Riccati equation                 will be of value to people working in Games' Theory, Optimal                    Control and connected Engineering fields.  The work on so-called                stiff differential equations is useful in solving  systems                      having different time-scales, such as in chemical kinetics and                  aerodynamics applications.  Finally, the work on approximation of               invariant manifolds is useful in understanding the long-term                    behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems.  This has applications                 in many areas of applied science."

These                   include both the development of improved methods as well as                     applications drawn from fluid dynamics, dynamical systems,                      reaction-diffusion systems and combustion.  Problems in                         methodology to be considered include the construction of accurate               and stable boundary conditions at artificial boundaries for                     computations in unbounded domains, emphasizing error estimation                 and the equations of fluid dynamics, and bifurcation theory                     for points in the essential spectrum, with applications to                      the existence theory of traveling waves in cylindrical domains.                 The study of these problems makes use of the asymptotic analysis                of long range wave propagation, the stability theory                            of initial-boundary value problems, multiple scales expansions                  and extensive numerical experimentation. Applications of these                  methods include the simulation of unsteady compressible flows in                exterior and wall-bounded domains, the construction and stability               analysis of waves modeling the propagation of curved flame fronts               for both thermo-diffusive models and models that include                        hydrodynamic effects, and a numerical investigation of the                      existence of neutrally stable helical waves in pipe flow, as                    predicted by critical layer theory.                                                  Wave motion in fluids and other media is a fundamental                     feature of a variety of disciplines in the sciences                             and engineering, ranging from meteorology to aeronautics to                     oil exploration.  Despite the diversity of the physics, the                     science of waves possesses an underlying mathematical unity, and                has been the subject of intense and fruitful research.                          Modern computing technology has provided a new tool for studying                these phenomena, allowing a deeper investigation of nonlinear                   and multidimensional dynamics.  The research centers on the                     development and application of new computational and analytic                   techniques.  It emphasizes the complementary use of computer                    simulations with other forms of analysis.  The particular                       problems chosen for study arise in fluid dynamics and combustion,               but the universal importance of wave propagation makes the work                 applicable in many other settings."

It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for                computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics."

If the domain enjoys any symmetry, the computational                effort involved in numerically solving these systems can be                     significantly reduced via the effective use of techniques based                 upon group representation theory which have recently been given                 by the investigators.  This algebraic approach yields a                         decomposition of the original large problem into a number of                    smaller subproblems, each corresponding to an irreducible                       representation of the symmetry group of the domain.  The size of                each reduced problem is that of the large problem divided by a                  factor equal to the order of the group divided by the dimension                 of the representation.  Previous work on exploiting symmetry has                involved reducing partial differential equations to subdomains                  and adapting boundary conditions over the symmetry axes.  Such                  techniques do not apply to boundary integral methods.  It is                    proposed in this project to develop flexible codes which                        systematically implement reductions for a variety of symmetry                   structures.  Constructions of symmetry-respecting                               discretizations and theoretical investigations relating to                      sparseness and parallel implementations will be carried out.                         Many problems in science and engineering have as their                     natural domain a surface or body which is symmetric in some way.                For example, circles, circular disks, spheres, intervals,                       squares, and cubes, of any dimension, all have obvious symmetry.                In addition to the symmetry of the domain of the problem,                       often the equations themselves reflect a symmetry in the physics                of the problem.  For example, the differential equations                        governing heat flow are symmetric, in the sense that heat will                  flow in all directions without any preferences in the absence of                any outside stimulus.  When both the equations and the domain of                the problem enjoy some symmetry, algebraic techniques may be used               to reduce the computational effort involved in numerically                      solving the given problem on the given domain.  This project will               focus on making the necessary theoretical investigations and                    developing algorithms for exploiting symmetry in the field                      of numerical analysis."

The topics of investigation                     include absorbing boundary conditions for dispersive waves, open                boundary conditions for the shallow water equations in a rotating               reference frame, and absorbing boundary conditions for the                      velocity-stress formulation of the elastic wave equation.  This                 work is motivated by the fact that many physical problems are                   defined on spatial domains that either are unbounded or are so                  large that it is not feasible to compute numerical solutions over               the entire region.  In such situations, it is necessary to                      truncate the domain.  One then encounters the problem of                        finding boundary conditions to impose at the artificial                         computational boundary.                                                              The development of such boundary conditions is the subject                 of this research.  This work is expected to have applications to                computer modeling of several kinds of physical phenomena,                       including large scale motions of the atmosphere and oceans,                     seismic waves within the earth, and waves on the surface of                     water.  For example, suppose that an oceanographer wants to model               the circulation in an ocean.  One possibility is to compute the                 relevant physical quantities on an array of grid points                         distributed over the entire ocean.  If the circulation is needed                for the entire ocean, this is what must be done.  On the other                  hand, if the circulation is needed only on a relatively small                   portion, such as the continental shelf, then the above procedure                is far too costly.  Instead, one would prefer to compute the                    circulation only on the region of real interest. In such a                      computation, the region is bounded partly or entirely by a                      boundary that is ""open"" instead of physical.  Telling the                       solution what to do at such a boundary is rather tricky, and an                 incorrect choice of boundary conditions can seriously corrupt the               solution that is computed. The goal of the present research is to               develop effective open boundary conditions for the physical                     situations mentioned above.  Open boundary conditions for seismic               waves would be useful to geophysicists who use seismic methods to               search for geologic structures that could contain petroleum, and                open boundary conditions for water waves would be useful to                     engineers who study the effects of wave actions on coastal and                  offshore structures."

The method combines finite                       difference approximations to solve the field equations with                     Lagrangian fluid markers to track the positions of the solid                    particles in the fluid.  The suspended material is replaced with                an appropriate force-density term in the equations of fluid                     motion.  This method is capable of handling a large number of                   particles since there is no need to specify boundary conditions                 on the surface of each particle and since one set of                            equations obtains in the whole flow field.

A feature of this work is to implement certain                        coordinate changes that will greatly extend the applicability of                the algorithms.  In most applications, the dynamical systems                    depend on one or more parameters; then the determination of                     suitable coordinates will be combined with the idea of path                     following.  As long as the manifolds deform smoothly when system                parameters change, the proposed methods will permit following the               manifolds computationally.  A longer-term goal is to study                      bifurcations of invariant manifolds numerically, in particular                  the breakdown of tori.  It is expected that the region of                       breakdown will be characterized numerically by several turning                  points of the discrete solution branch, and that the number of                  turning points increases as the meshsize is refined.  The                       proposed research will point the way towards the development of                 efficient algorithms for the computations of invariant manifolds,               and will provide a valuable tool for the study of dynamical                     systems.                                                                             Nonlinear dynamical systems play an important role in many                 areas of the applied sciences and of engineering and technology.                For example, they are used to model flows around airplanes and                  submarines, vibrations of engines, currents in electrical                       networks, and blood flow in the heart.  All these systems                       depend on parameters, which can partially be controlled or                      monitored.  A practical problem of main importance is to predict                the critical values of parameters, for which qualitative changes                of the dynamical systems occur.  These changes are called                       bifurcations.  For example, a long-outstanding problem is                       to predict the transition from laminar to turbulent flow.                       Similarly, a vibrating structure can bifurcate from quasiperiodic               to chaotic motion; the latter is unpredictable and might lead to                the breakdown of the structure.  The behavior of a dynamical                    system is often characterized by its properties on an                           invariant manifold.  This project will develop numerical software               to compute invariant manifolds and to follow them computationally               as system parameters change. Important cases are given by                       invariant tori, which correspond to quasiperiodic (predictable)                 motion;  breakdown of the tori corresponds to the transition                    to chaotic (unpredictable) motion.  With algorithms developed in                this work, one will be able to compute values for bifurcation                   parameters, i.e., one can predict parameter values for which                    major qualitative changes of the dynamical system will occur.                   The algorithms will be tested on systems of coupled                             oscillators and vibrating mechanical structures, but they will                  apply to other areas of the applied sciences where dynamical                    systems are used for modelling."

However,                 in order to be able to apply these methods, which give results of               guaranteed accuracy, one needs to find ways to improve the                      efficiency of the computations.  For ill-conditioned problems                   variable precision interval computation is often effective.  The                two main approaches investigated in this project involve                        improving the efficiency of variable precision computing                        and parallelizing the interval algorithms for speed-up using                    distributed networks of computers.

A combination of analytical and numerical techniques will be                    employed to follow the motion of a highly convoluted interface                  for late times when traditional numerical methods have difficulty               because of resolution problems.  The method relies on actually                  following the motion of singularities in the unphysical domain                  that on their approach to the physical domain correspond to                     interfacial features such as spikes.  By subtracting such                       singularities from a basis representation in the physical domain,               it is proposed to calculate a continually distorting                            Rayleigh-Taylor interface numerically.                                               Interest in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability stems                          from its disruptive presence in inertial confinement devices                    where attempt is made to confine a hot plasma through                           a magnetic field and achieve controlled nuclear fusion for                      energy needs.  Because an accelerating field and a gravitational                field are equivalent, the radial acceleration of a plasma as it                 turns around makes it susceptible to this instability.  It is                   clear that for plasma confinement to succeed, one should be able                to control this instability.  A first step is to understand the                 detailed nature of a Rayleigh-Taylor flow.  The method of attack                is novel and is an attempt to overcome the shortcomings of some                 other traditional numerical methods."

The model includes the dynamic deposition and                         entrainment of sediments in an arbitrary three-dimensional                      region.  The governing equations are the full three-dimensional                 Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a parabolic transport                      equation for each species of sediment.  The computational domain                is composed of two free surfaces, an air-water interface and a                  water bed interface, as well as artificially imposed boundaries                 that limit computation to the region of interest.  Among the                    computation difficults are handling of the free surfaces, the                   very large geologic time scales, and the treatment of turbulence.               The complexity of the system necessitates development of parallel               algorithms for the solution of the model equations.

Families of resolutions will be investigated including resolutions of objects such as algebras in the linkage class of a complete intersection, algebras defined by residual intersections and powers of perfect ideals, canonical classes and other class group elements, and modules of finite length over rings of a fixed dimension. Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations. This is one of the oldest and currently one of the most active branches of mathematics. It has widespread applications in mathematics, computer science and physics."
