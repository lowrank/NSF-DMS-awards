The research supported concerns the representation of                      finite groups over fields. The structure of the groups is                       realized through the action of the groups as transformations on                 spaces.

Dr. Pomerance's research will center on integer                        factoring algorithms and studies of the distribution in                         arithmetic progressions of integers with no large prime factor as               well as properties of the sequence of divisors of an integer.

A candidate for such a region is a resonance,               defined as a volume in the neighborhood of an elliptic point; its               boundary will be obtained from limits of librational periodic                   orbits.

Drs. Pinkham and Bayer intend to mount a                   computational and theoretical attack on one of the most resistant               problems of modern mathematics, the Jacobian Conjecture.

In its origin, it treated figures that                could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely                 polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only                   from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is                 finding application in those fields as well as in physics,                      theoretical computer science, and robotics."

Many algorithms in numerical analysis use polynomials                      orthogonal on (a subset of) a real interval.  These algorithms                  include schemes for polynomial least squares approximation,                     Gaussian quadrature, and the Lanczos and conjugate gradient                     methods.  It is planned to develop analogous algorithms that use                polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, also known as Szego                  polynomials.  Szego polynomials are related to approximation by                 trigonometric polynomials, similarly as polynomials orthogonal                  on an interval are related to approximation by (algebraic)                      polynomials.  Szego polynomials satisfy a recurrence relation                   with few terms.  This makes them attractive to use in                           computations.  They have already been applied successfully in                   algorithms for computing eigenvalues of unitary matrices, a                     problem that arises in certain frequency estimation methods in                  signal processing."

A recent construction                 due to Gabai shows that a 3-manifold supports many interesting                  dynamical systems, namely pseudo-Anosov flows.                                       The first two parts of this project aim towards showing that               dynamical systems on a 3-manifold can be used to give complete                  information about an important topological invariant, the                       Thurston norm on homology.  The main work of the first part will                be to show that Gabai's flows are well-behaved enough to                        determine completely the Thurston norm.  The second part will                   focus on explicitly constructing these flows, so as to have an                  efficient algorithm for computing the norm.  A bonus will be a                  method for efficient computation of complete homeomorphism                      invariants of 3-manifolds which fiber over the circle.                               The third and final part of this project addresses a long                  range goal, to investigate the conjecture that every 3-manifold                 which is irreducible and contains a non-separating surface has a                finite cover which fibers over the circle.  Dynamical systems are               potentially useful for this investigation, due to work of Fried.                Mosher will attempt to prove the conjecture for some simple                     examples which are ""as close as possible"" to fibering without                   actually fibering.  If successful, this may yield suggestions for               an attack on the conjecture in general."

The particular work to be                      undertaken by Professors Lind and Tuncel is in the area of                      ""symbolic dynamics"".  A symbolic dynamical system is a collection               of two-way infinite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet.                  These strings satisfy a formation rule which specifies which                    symbols are allowed to follow which as one moves along the                      string.

In the case of continuously                distributed random variables a multivariate numerical integral                  approximation technique, will be used.

The Center involves collaboration among eighteen mathematicians                 from thirteen institutions throughout the U.S. and Europe.  In                  addition to faculty from the University of Minnesota, the Center                will involve participants from Brigham Young, Cornell, Courant                  Institute, Harvard, Princeton, Rutgers, SUNY Stony Brook,                       University of California, San Diego, as well as Ecole Normale                   Superieur, Paris, the University of Warwick, and AT&T Bell                      Laboratories.  Under the aegis of the Geometry Supercomputer                    Project at Minnesota, these researchers have been collaborating for             the past three years.  Through this collaboration they have                     demonstrated their ability to make such a distributed Center                    function.                                                                                                                                                       The subject of mathematics, an extremely rich and varied territory,             has had a tendency to fragment into many subdisciplines, with                   little communication between them, or their closely related fields,             such as computer science.  The goal of the Center is to tie these               differently perceived fields together under the unifying topic of               geometry and geometric representation on the computer.  The                     Center's scientific program is based on a core of scientific                    investigations whose origins are in ""pure"" mathematics as well as               models of physical phenomenon.  It is organized into five groups:               topology; geometry and symmetry dynamics; geometric optimization;               computation, geometry and graphics; and fractal geometry.  The                  proposed research includes a range of high-level mathematics                    centered on geometry utilizing high-level computer science centered             on geometry, in the environment of a high-quality laboratory for                computation, graphics, and visualization.  Through the common                   thread of visualization, the research forms a coherent body.                                                                                                    The Center will provide leadership in typing diverse fields of                  mathematics and computer science together and will facilitate                   knowledge transfer between fields.  In addition, the solutions of               some of the proposed problems will require the development of                   software tools that could reach beyond the basic mathematical areas             involved and have important applications to research in other                   scientific fields, such as molecular biology, where visualization               modeling are essential.                                                                                                                                         This Center will stimulate enhanced activity in precollege                      education and in the development of human resource.//"

The work continues efforts to                  improve compression of acoustical and video data, to pattern and                structure detection and in the design of numerical algorithms for               the solution of differential and integral equations.                            Applications to the study of turbulent phenomena as well as                     forward and inverse scattering problems are also expected.                           The primary tool of this work is the fast wavelet and wave                 packet transformations.  Wavelet analysis has opened the way to                 the design of classes of fast numerical algorithms similar in                   usage to the Fast Fourier Transform, but more versatile.  Its                   strength lies in its applicability to problems which do not have                translational invariance and for certain classes of nonlinear                   computations.  Recent progress in these areas has pointed to the                need for designing special purpose orthonormal bases.  In                       particular, it has become clear that the analysis of locally                    modulated signals, as well as the study of oscillatory integral                 operators requires the introduction of bases capable of more                    precise frequency analysis and good space localization.                              Various classes of bases have been designed to achieve both                numerical efficacy and specific features.  Present plans include                development of large-scale calculations which can be implemented                in two-dimensional structures (such as modeling radar scattering                by a whole aircraft including the multizone dielectrics and                     layered surface effects).  Work will also be done developing new                computational tools for the analysis of turbulence data in which                multiscale, multifrequencey and localization analysis will be                   provided by wavelet and wavepacket correlations aimed at                        identifying turbulence mechanisms.  Further work will also be                   carried out in developing modulated wave form libraries of                      orthonormal waveforms which permit high compression rates for                   voice transmission and analysis."

Dr. Teitelbaum will pursue his studies of                  the geometry and arithmetic of the p-adic upper half plane,                     guided by the Exceptional Zero Conjecture, which relates the                    values of certain functions, namely p-adic L-functions, to the                  analytic geometry of certain curves.

Arithmetic algebraic geometry is a subject that combines                   the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its                  original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that                   could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely                 polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such              questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two             subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other            from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual             influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic              geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is             having corresponding influence beyond its own borders."

Of particular interest is the                         approximation of a set called the global attractor, which is a                  finite-dimensional, fractal set that lies inside of an infinite-                dimensional phase space.  In order to describe the global                       attractor the principal investigators plan to construct an                      algebraic approximation method that uses smooth finite-                         dimensional manifolds to approximate the fractal set and then to                implement this method on a computer.                                                 From an abstract point of view one can regard the solutions                of a partial differential equation as generating a space of                     trajectories or curves that is infinite-dimensional.  This is one               reason why the study of such equations is difficult.                            Fortunately, though, within this infinite-dimensional space                     reside sets of finite dimension that characterize how solutions                 behave for very large times.  And since these sets are finite-                  dimensional, it is possible to describe them approximately using                numerical and analytical techniques.  With this award the                       researchers will study finite-dimensional objects called global                 attractors that arise in the solution sets of equations from                    fluid dynamics."

The motivating application is from semiconductor process and                    device design.  In this application there are computer programs                 that simulate the physics of the fabrication and the operation                  of semiconductor devices.  The result is that electrical                        properties of semiconductors can be computed as a function of the               process specifications in their fabrication.  A combination of                  long running times for the programs and a large number of                       variables that describe the process make it necessary to use                    statistical techniques to find optimal settings of the input                    variables.  One can run the simulators at a set of points and fit               the model to the computed values, for interpolation and                         extrapolation to other possible settings of those values.  By                   choosing the points in a structured manner that incorporates some               randomness, one can estimate the uncertainty in the model.                           This project is in the area of statistics and probability                  and offers a number of statistical applications to the                          semiconductor industry.   The research is to explore an approach                that reflects some standard settings in computer experiments:                   many dimensions, comparatively few data points, and a need to fit               a complex function."

This is very important and timely research, and it is of               sufficient complexity that the PI will employ analytical methods                from geometry and bifurcation theory, in addition to                            computational techniques.  The goals of the research are twofold.               The first goal is to discover different types of wave patterns                  that result from the complex interactions of shocks and fluid                   structures, while the second goal is to develop numerical methods               that allow one to follow the evolution in time of the waves                     generated by the interactions.                                                       Many phenomena in fluid dynamics arise out of the                          interactions of different types of waves with each other and with               internal fluid structures such as interfaces.  What makes these                 interactions difficult to study mathematically is that they are                 described by systems of nonlinear differential equations, and so                one must use computers in order to generate solutions.  But this                is tricky also, because computers can often generate meaningless                information, unless the numerical methods used are reliable.  The               PI will study such problems with ""intelligent"" numerical methods.               These are methods that have sufficient analytical and physical                  theory built into them that they produce sharp approximations to                the correct physical solutions."

By                 exploiting the linearity of the transformations involved with                   these chains, one can encode any digital image, and for a broad                 class of images this affords substantial data compression.  It is               planned to analyze and test various encoding schemes, and to                    develop algorithms to implement them on vector and parallel                     machines.                                                                            It is potentially of great value to deal with large-scale                  image and encoding problems, particularly involving real time                   applications of image transmission and communication, image                     construction and processing and image restoration.  Potential                   applications include 3-D mechanical imaging, visual (e.g.,                      flight) simulators, voice and pattern recognition, optical                      character and object scanners, image understanding, fingerprint                 and passport encoding, animation encoding, high resolution                      graphics and high definition TV."

In its original formulation,                        algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                 plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                     theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                     divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,                seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                 the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                  influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                        algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                       mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own               borders."

The group                is involved in the formulation and solution of analytical                       problems in molecular biology and genetics.  In particular, the                 group will emphasize the development and application of                         mathematical, statistical and computational methods for the                     analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences.  The research is                    organized into four main areas.  (1)  In the development of                     mathematical tools for molecular biology, the investigators will                study protein sequence analysis, physical mapping, and                          statistical tests for pattern analysis.  (2) Computational                      algorithms will be developed for database searches, sequence                    alignment, and sequence assembly.  (3)  Ongoing work in                         mathematical population genetics includes studies of genealogical               trees, the finite sites models and genealogy and selection.  The                group will also analyze some statistical problems in molecular                  evolution.  (4)  The group will continue to study the stochastic                properties of optimal sequence comparisons.  This work is closely               related to the Chen-Stein method of Poisson approximation, which                has application to many probabilistic problems.  Other work                     focusses on random permutations an change point problems.                            This Mathematical Sciences Research Group will investigate                 problems at the interface of molecular biology and genetics,                    statistics and probability, and computation.  The investigators                 on this grant interact with each other and with many biologists.                The problems investigated by this group are directly motivated by               biological considerations, and mathematical and computational                   solutions of these problems will impact all the fields involved."

The work has applications to seismic exploration, nondestructive                testing, sonar interpretation, and other fields.  The immediate                 aim is to enhance numerical methods for the so-called forward                   problem, in which initial-boundary data and material properties                 are assumed known.  However, the research has the ultimate                      objective of using accurate forward solvers in an iterative                     fashion to attack the inverse problem, in which one seeks                       estimates of material properties (wave velocities) given observed               responses of the medium to seismic waves.

The project addresses several numerical approaches.  Among                 these are the representation of interfaces between strata having                different wave velocities, the construction of spatial grids that               will yield accurate discretizations in highly heterogeneous                     media, the design of efficient time-stepping schemes and                        associated numerical linear algebra, and the adaptation of                      numerical procedures to parallel- and vector architecture                       machines.  Another important element of the project is the                      continued development of object-oriented graphics software to aid               in the visualization of large-scale model results."

In mathematics, symmetry has many different                but related manifestations.  A finite group G of symmetries of a                space X induces symmetries on algebraic invariants of X.  In this               way, transformation groups and representation theory become                     intimately related.  In this project, the investigator will look                systematically at the interaction between the geometry of the                   symmetry (e.g., fixed points, stability subgroups, etc.) and the                algebraic invariants of such representations.  In particular,                   symmetries of Moore spaces (the Steenrod Problem posed in early                 1960's) and algebraic curves and surfaces arising in algebraic                  geometry and number theory (besides topology) provide concrete                  problems to which the following general theory will apply.  A                   significant feature of this project is its interdisciplinary                    nature, which requires tools and ideas from several branches of                 mathematics.  This provides a natural setting for interaction of                these areas, including new applications of algebraic geometry to                transformation groups and modular representation theory.  Other                 applications include (algorithmic and inductive) construction of                important classes of modular representations, number theoretic                  properties of algebraic function fields, and a deeper                           understanding of symmetries of algebraic surfaces versus 4-                     dimensional manifolds.  A long term objective is solution of the                long-standing Steenrod Problem and its application to the problem               of existence of symmetry for manifolds."

Rather than tackle a problem as large as               the earth's atmosphere some scientists, like the principal                      investigator, study simpler mathematical models for the                         transmission of waves through inhomogeneous media like the                      atmosphere.

The classical treatment of                    these phenomena regards the thin layer as an idealized vortex                   sheet and only includes the dissipative effects of viscosity                    (internal friction) in an ad hoc fashion that never comes to                    grips with the true nature of viscous forces.  In contrast the                  research in this award centers around analytical and                            computational methods for approximating solutions of the actual                 viscous equations in the limit of vanishing viscosity.  Specific                problems for study include the description of how viscous effects               influence the tendency for vortex sheets to develop curvature                   singularities.                                                                       Many fluid dynamical phenomena in nature are operative in                  the idealized limit of zero viscosity or zero surface tension.                  For example, the motion of bodies in air at speeds well below the               speed of sound can be studied under the approximation that the                  air is inviscid.  Of course, this is a fiction since air does                   have a small, nonzero viscosity, but the neglect of viscous                     effects is justified when calculating a host of aerodynamical                   coefficients, since the small effect of viscosity is not nearly                 as important as a larger effect, such as a pressure drop.                       However there are many fluid dynamical phenomena whose very                     existence depends upon the presence of a formally small force                   like viscosity, and it is just such phenomena that are the                      objects of study in this proposal.  In particular, this                         research will study how viscous effects influence the roll-up of                vortices inside of thin layers of fluids."
