In the study of wavelets,                beyond the mathematical analysis a major focus is on applications               to real-time (or on-line) time-frequency analysis.  Hence the                   investigators study the analysis and algorithmic and                            computational aspects of spline-wavelets and non-orthogonal                     wavelet packets.  In particular, they will design a                             predictor-corrector algorithm along the line of the Kalman filter               to implement the spline-wavelet decomposition without truncation                and to take care of noise processes such as white noise.  The                   research on multivariate splines also extends to the construction               of multivariate wavelets using box splines.  One of the most                    difficult problems is the study of minimum supports that give                   rise to reconstruction sequences with minimum length.  Again a                  predictor-corrector algorithm will be implemented to avoid                      truncation of the decomposition sequences. ""Radial basis                        functions"" is a tool that allows fiting both regular and                        scattered data by continuously differentiable functions. Certain                matrices associated with interpolation and approximation                        processes arise in connection with the data fitting.  The                       investigators will study the ""stability"" of these matrices.  They               also consider various aspects of the question of how rapidly the                approximating surfaces approach the underlying surface from which               the scattered data are sampled as the number of data points                     increases.                                                                           The wavelet transform is a tool that cuts up data or                       functions as well as their spectra into different frequency                     components and then studies each component with a resolution                    matched to the appropriate scale.  For example, given a signal,                 one is interested in ""cutting"" up its frequency content with                    local time-information.  This is similar to music notation, which               tells the player which notes to play at any given moment.                       Wavelets, wavelet transforms, and wavelet packets help in                       analyzing signals and data.  Wavelet analysis is useful in data                 reduction, which already has been applied to high-definition T.V.               Using wavelets, the investigators aim at decomposing and                        reconstructing signals as simply and accurately as possible.                    Another aim is to represent the underlying processes generating                 scattered data by means of ""simple"" radial functions.  This                     allows one to analyze and extrapolate data, which is important                  for artificial learning devices."

The information to be used for the                          reconstruction is the amplitude of the reflection coefficient                   corresponding to a wave incoming from the left, defined in the                  usual quantum mechanical sense.  Because the reflection                         coefficient is in general complex valued, the missing phase                     information is the central difficulty, and in fact this problem                 is closely related to the well known phase retrieval problem in                 optics.  However, even if the full complex reflection amplitude                 were known, the problem still presents some new aspects, in                     comparison with standard formulations of inverse scattering for                 the Schrodinger equation, because of the fact that the potential                does not decay to zero.  The investigator will also consider some               cases in which the phase data are partially known.  In the                      neutron scattering application, one may usually assume that the                 potential does not have any bound states, and this hypothesis is                essential for the main line of approach.  Nevertheless the case                 when bound states are present is of some interest also, so an                   alternative procedure allowing for this possibility will be                     investigated.                                                                        A newly emerging technology for the detailed analysis of                   chemical and magnetic properties of layered materials is the use                of neutron reflectivity data.  For example, there are many                      applications to the study of surface and interface structure at                 the molecular level for polymer blends.  This in turn is a                      valuable tool in the development of new high performance                        materials.  In a typical experimental set up, a beam of neutrons                is incident from a vacuum region onto a reflecting material,                    whose material properties vary only in the direction                            perpendicular to the material surface.  An instrument called the                neutron reflectometer measures the reflected neutron intensity                  with high precision as a function of the particle's momentum in                 the direction perpendicular to the surface.  These data are thus                dependent in some manner on the so-called neutron interaction                   potential, which is a function of location within the material.                 If this potential can be determined, then other physical                        properties of the material can be directly inferred.  The                       proposed research addresses directly the problem of interpreting                reflectivity data in order to determine the interaction                         potential.  Specifically, the investigator seeks to understand                  the mathematical structure of the problem, and to develop                       accurate and reliable computational procedures."

Yet, minimizing                    distraction by details is the goal.  Translating natural and                    effective renderings of unembellished important structures to                   computer presentation is conceptually and practically a very                    difficult problem.  Two basic ideas underlie the approach here:                 First, depicting several views and then drawing the links to                    identify the same object in the several views gives a sense of                  the position of the object vis a vis others even in many                        dimensions.                                                                          Second, taking natural groupings of objects and examining                  their interrelationships allows focusing on the finer structure                 of the group.  From these two basic principles, a conceptually                  coherent approach to viewing multidimensional data can be                       derived.  Then actual methodology based on focusing and linking                 can be developed; user interface architectures to make efficient                use of these techniques can be tried and prototypes can be                      implemented."

Computer simulation of fluid flow is critical in                           understanding and modeling a wide variety of important processes                in science and technology. As just one example, modeling the flow               of air around an aircraft in flight is required in order to                     determine how well it flies and to design safe and fuel-efficient               vehicles. Computer methods produce approximations to the velocity               and pressure of the air at a finite set of grid points around the               aircraft, by approximately solving a complicated set of                         differential equations. Millions of grid points are required to                 obtain a good approximation to the flow around a complicated                    object, stretching even the most powerful computers to their                    limits. The goal of this work is to develop more efficient and                  accurate methods to solve such problems, with particular emphasis               on better ways to handle objects with complicated shapes (such as               aircraft) and to model flows with complicated behavior."

Conservation                 form of the system is widely held as imperative for consistent                  numerical capturing of shocks.  In practice, while this may be                  true for flows dominated by strong shocks, other flow phenomena                 may be better modelled by different, not necessarily conservative               flow descriptions. In such cases, one may be prepared to                        sacrifice strict conservation in favor of a nonstrictly                         conservative model that describes better the dominant flow                      features. To be reliable, the model should generate acceptably                  small conservation errors. The investigator shows that                          propagating fronts is one such phenomenon. Capturing propagating                fronts by conservative models gives rise to oscillations and                    other inaccuracies near material fronts, and is in general                      unsatisfactory. These are not the common oscillations associated                with high order schemes, but rather a result of the simple wave                 model (i.e. eigenstructure) of the conservative systems. A remedy               is to use a nonconservative flow description, which offers a                    different eigenstructure.  It becomes exact near contact surfaces               and produces clean oscillation-free interfaces. Near shocks, the                model is not exact and conservation errors are committed. A                     technique recently developed by the investigator offers a cure to               this problem. It uses viscous perturbations that render the                     algorithm conservative to the order of numerical approximation                  and generate acceptably small conservation errors. The technique                has been successfully applied to computing propagating fronts in                1D.  The investigator will study several theoretical aspects of                 this nonstrictly conservative algorithm and its application to                  the computation of bubble dynamics in several space dimensions.                      The work of the project involves theoretical analysis and                  computer simulation of flows. These arise in physical phenomena                 involving mixing of fluids, the initiation and evolution of                     vortices, the ignition and evolution of chemical reactions in                   fluids, and the propagation of flames. The aim of the project is                to develop analytical and computational tools to enhance the                    understanding of the complicated physical phenomena involved.                   Insight gained this way will supplement experimental data, which                are often expensive, difficult or even dangerous to obtain. For                 example, wind tunnel simulations of space conditions in the upper               stratosphere are difficult and expensive to perform and may give                unreliable results; studying gun ballistics requires                            experimenting with strong explosions, which are both expensive                  and dangerous.  Potential impact of this project extends to a                   variety of industries including the space and aircraft industries               (design of space vehicles and of aicraft wings), marine industry                (design of boats with improved hydrodynamic properties, the                     effect of bubbles on submarine hydrodynamics, etc.) and the                     weapon industries (e.g., internal ballistics of guns)."

Invariants to be studied include the homology of the              universal abelian cover, the higher homotopy groups, the homology               of the Milnor fiber, and the cohomology ring.  These will be                    described in terms of the underlying matroid, the oriented matroid              and its generalization to non-real arrangements, and the bounded                complex.  The results will be applied to unsolved problems                      concerning the matroid stratification of the Grassmannian, the                  homology classification of hyperplane complements in terms of                   combinatorial invariants, the combinatorial structure of free                   arrangements, and the factorization properties of the Orlik-Solomon             algebra.  The initial focus of this research will be on                         complexified arrangements in dimension three.  The main topological             tool is the 2-complex model T of the universal cover constructed by             the investigator.  The structure of T is determined in a simple way             by the complex of bounded faces of the real part of the                         arrangement.  On the one hand, this facilitates a geometric                     analysis of the second homotopy group.  At the same time, this                  universal cover complex yields an algebraic description of the                  homology of abelian covers in terms of modules over polynomial                  rings.  The study of free arrangements will center on the various               notions of formality introduced by the investigator and his co-                 workers.                                                                             The complement of an arrangement of hyperplanes in n-space is              just the collection of chunks into which n-space falls when cleaved             by a number of (n-1)-spaces.  This seemingly innocuous structure                has called forth a surprising amount of heavy machinery from                    various parts of algebra and topology and led to some gratifyingly              attractive analysis and general combinatorial principles.  Although             the work is theoretical and leads to rigorous proofs, at                        intermediate stages it is useful to experiment and test examples.               Some machine computation is indispensable at this point,                        particularly using such symbolic manipulators as Cayley, for which              a Sun SPARCstation is available to the investigator."

The investigator proposes to develop new numerical and analytical               tools to further investigate the bifurcations of these forced                   oscillator systems.  Current numerical ""continuation"" routines                  are able to trace out one-parameter curves of local bifurcations                of fixed and periodic points for orbits of low period, typically                less than four or five.  Proposed work will include development                 of new routines that are expected to trace out bifurcations                     curves for higher period orbits.  These new ""high period""                       routines will then be used for locating ""global bifurcations,""                  where invariant manifolds, typically a stable one and an unstable               one, become tangent before crossing.  Once developed, these                     routines will enable a much more automatic and detailed                         bifurcation study, not only of maps generated by forced                         oscillators, but also of any two-parameter family of maps.                           Many processes in science and engineering can be                           mathematically categorized as ""forced oscillator systems.""  One                 example of an oscillator is a pendulum, because it swings back                  and forth, or oscillates.  We usually think of a pendulum as                    having a fixed support (the nail in the wall to which the string                with a weight is tied), but if we keep moving the location of the               support, we say the pendulum is being ""forced;""  if we move the                 support in a repeating pattern, such as back and forth, then we                 have a ""periodically forced oscillator.""  It turns out that the                 resulting motion depends critically on how fast the support is                  moved back and forth (the forcing frequency) and how far it is                  moved back and forth (the forcing amplitude).  Fairly simple                    mathematical models also exhibit this same behavior, including                  the sensitivity to changes in ""parameters"" analogous to forcing                 frequency and amplitude.  Changes in the qualitative behavior of                the system (how the pendulum bob moves) that occur as the                       parameters are varied are called ""bifurcations.""  Much is known                 about these bifurcations, but much is still unknown.  The                       investigator proposes to fill in some of the missing gaps in this               area.  Results will help explain observed behavior in any process               that can be classified mathematically as a forced oscillator                    system."

This means capturing the scientific essence of the               problem, which is not always what it at first appears to be.                    Then, with careful selection of mathematical and computational                  methods, simulation and other procedures can yield good working                 solutions or even exact ones."

As such it needs               the following:  Commonality.  There needs to be a rich protocol                 that allows programs to communicate with one another and to share               resources.  Heterogeneity.  Programs needn't be structurally                    similar to one another in order to be capable of communicating.                 Law and Order.  Programs should be protected from one another:                  if one acts irrationally the rest should be protected from it.                  Portability.  The environment should be independent of the                      underlying hardware, which could be a single computer or a                      network of such.  Flexibility.  People using one program or set                 of programs should not be hindered by the existense of other                    people with other goals.  Seeds.

In this project the investigator                 extends the above results in several directions: 1) developing                  higher order approximation of the unstable and stable manifolds,                which is especially useful in the case when during the                          continuation process the exponential rate of decay is lost, i.e.                a center manifold appears; 2) considering several problems with                 bifurcations of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, including the               case of center manifolds, 3) developing a posteriori error                      estimates and the adaptive procedure.  The goal is to lay the                   foundation for adaptive techniques that are essential in the                    development of robust and reliable software for the global                      analysis of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits.

There are some unavoidable errors in numerical calculations.               For example, whenever calculations are done by computer there is                the possibility that small roundoff errors will be incurred --                  for example, 1/3 = 0.333333... may approximated by 0.3333.                      Another source of errors is that the input data may be the result               of measurements that are not exact.  It is possible that these                  small errors can cause a large error in the final answer -- so                  large that it is useless.  The investigator studies the effects                 of small errors in numerical linear algebraic calculations.

A major goal of Wilkerson's research is to complete the                classification of finite loop spaces as a generalization of compact             Lie group theory.  The tools are function complexes and                         calculations with the Steenrod algebra going back to work of Adams-             Wilkerson, Miller, Carlsson, and Lannes.  Part of the work                      generalizes known facts about group actions and fixed points to                 homotopy fixed points.  Smith seeks an explicit construction of the             Morava K-theories.  These homology theories play a vital role in                the Devinatz-Hopkins-Smith nilpotence theorem.  Previous                        constructions rely on geometric techniques which are hard to                    interpret homotopically.  The resulting classifying spaces can                  really be constructed only ""up to homotopy,"" leaving many questions             about their nature open.  Finally, in joint work with S. Jackowski              and R. Oliver, McClure intends to try to find a simplified proof of             the immersion conjecture.  His other three problems all involve                 some aspect of the theory of topological Hochschild homology.                        The details of these three parts vary, but all are concerned               either with reducing geometric information to a subject for                     calculation or to perfecting one of the principal algebraic tools               used for this purpose.  The nature of the geometric information                 involved is the crux of the difficulty.  While questions about                  lengths, areas, angles, volumes, and so forth virtually cry out to              be reduced to calculations, it is far different with what are known             as topological properties of geometric objects.  These are                      properties such as connectedness (being all in one piece),                      knottedness, having no holes, and so forth.  All systematic study               of such properties, for example, how to tell whether two geometric              objects really differ in respect to one of these properties or are              only superficially different, or how to classify the variety of                 differences that can occur, all these have only truly been                      comprehended and mastered when they have been reduced to matters of             calculation."

Two classes of equations will be studied: those                possessing an absorbing set, where the long-time dynamics may be                extremely complex (chaotic) but remain in a bounded set; and with               those a gradient structure, so that solutions approach the set of               (typically multiple) steady states for large time.  For fixed                   time-stepping strategies, the proposed area of research is a                    generalisation of the classical theories of A, B and G stability.               These classical theories apply to classes of problems with simple               dynamics and it is of interest to determine how the theories can                be used and modified to cope with more complicated dynamical                    problems.  For variable time-stepping strategies some existing                  work on linear problems will be generalised to nonlinear                        problems. Work will also be directed towards the approximation of               homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, which play an important role                in the long-time dynamics of the two classes of equation under                  consideration.                                                                       Many phenomena of interest in the physical sciences and                    engineering require the understanding of dynamical phenomena that               evolve over very long time scales.  Examples include turbulence                 in fluids, phase separation in solids, and planetary motions.                   Often these phenomena are modelled by differential equations and                it is necessary to approximate these equations by computational                 techniques to obtain information about the underlying problem                   being modelled.  A question of fundamental importance is to                     ascertain the validity of the computer-generated output and, in                 particular, it is important to understand fully the relationship                between the computer-generated approximations of the model and                  the behavior of the model itself.  The study of this problem is                 well understood in many simple situations but these do not                      include situations where long time scales are present.  The                     object of the research is to study this problem, using the                      underlying theory of the differential equation models to guide                  the study of the computer-generated approximations."

Both the mathematical theory and the practical implementation                   will be undertaken as part of this project."

Specific projects are developed                     around the theme of computer-intensive statistical inference.                   Special topics include bootstrap, jackknife and related                         resampling methods, permutation tests and group theoretic testing               procedures, Gibbs sampling and Markov chains.  All these topics                 concern data mappings of special interest to statisticians.                     Historically, permutations were the first such mappings studied.                Methods like the bootstrap generalize permutations to wider                     classes of statistical problems, at the expense of less                         mathematical neatness and greater computational expense.  This                  project addresses ways to overcome these obstacles.                                  Statistical inference is the science of generalization from                observed data, often just a small amount, to the larger                         population from which the data were drawn.  The basic principles                of statistical inference were laid down before World War II.  The               basic theory was built around classical mathematics and the bell-               shaped curve.  Computer-intensive methods, developed in the last                15 years, aim to extend the range, ease, and plausibility of                    statistical arguments.  They substitute specially-developed                     computer algorithms of classical mathematical approximations                    relating to the bell-shaped curve.  Our research aims to justify                these algorithms.  Mathematical and computational arguments are                 used to show that the algorithms automatically produce the                      classical answers when such answers exist, and still give good                  answers in the much more common circumstance of problems having                 no classical solution."

They continue work begun by Lin on spatially                      patterned solutions of reaction-diffusion wquations near                        spatially homogeneous solutions, represented by homoclinic orbits               on heteroclinic cycles of the reaction equation.  They                          investigate a new approach, based on earlier work, to the                       stability of stationary solutions of reaction-diffusion equations               with small diffusion that consist of regular and transition                     layers, in which the stability would be checked layer by layer.                 They continue work begun by Schecter using heteroclinic                         bifurcation theory to study the solutions of systems of                         conservation laws.  They also continue work on the stability and                convergence of numerical methods for finding homoclinic and                     heteroclinic orbits to nonhyperbolic equilibria.                                     It can happen that if one starts a dynamic process near one                of its steady states, the resulting orbit of the process goes far               from that state, then returns to the same or a different steady                 state.  Such an orbit is called homoclinic or heteroclinic                      respectively.  These orbits turn out to be key to understanding                 numerous phenomena in the sciences.  The investigators continue                 their studies of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, and of                     mathematical aspects of them that are important in applications.                One subject they investigate is how two interacting dispersed                   populations can spontaneously become organized into spatial                     patterns of varying population densities that fluctuate over                    time, because of homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits in the                       underlying dynamics.  The second subject is an idea of Lin for                  understanding the stability of propagating fronts, in chemical                  reactions, for example, by viewing the fronts as heteroclinic                   orbits.  The third subject is complicated waves that arise in                   solutions of equations such as those that model the recovery of                 oil from an underground reservoir when water is pumped in to                    force it out.  These waves can be viewed as heteroclinic orbits.                The fourth subject is the robustness and accuracy of numerical                  methods used to compute homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits."

Shock waves, turbulent mixing zones, flame fronts,                      solidification fronts, and fluid and material interfaces provide                examples of the types of waves considered here.  The                            investigators analyze first the regular case, in which a small                  number of waves meet at a point and propagate in a self-similar                 fashion, as a traveling wave with definite velocity and with                    definite relativeangles.  This problem is related to, but more                  difficult than, the one-dimensional Riemann problem, with which                 the investigators and coworkers have prior experience.  Secondly,               they consider the case of chaotic higher dimensional wave                       interactions, characterized by unstable interfaces, mixing                      regions, and sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  In this               chaotic case, they identify elementary modes, which interact to                 form an effective statistical ensemble.  The study of the chaotic               case depends upon the renormalization group, and methods to                     reduce the number of effective degrees of freedom.  Fixed points                of the renormalization group found by the investigators and                     coworkers to characterize chaotic mixing regimes suggest                        directions for research.                                                        One of the most difficult aspects of the study of wave                          propagation is the computation of nonlinear wave interactions.                  This project is to study the mathematical structure of such                     interactions and to use this analysis to improve computer                       programs that model flows where wave interactions are important.                Flows of this type occur in a wide variety of industrial,                       military, and scientific applications, including supersonic                     flight, sheet metal forming and die pressing, weather prediction,               fluid turbulence, projectile penetration of armor, blast waves,                 and astrophysics.  All of these areas are characterized by                      sensitive dependence on the detailed structures produced by the                 nonlinear interaction of waves, and thus share many common                      mathematical aspects.  Knowledge gained in studying the abstract                properties of wave interactions can be applied to all of these                  areas, and will lead to improved computer simulations and a                     better understanding of the processes occurring during strong                   wave interactions."

However, there are many geophysical occurrences of granular                     materials, and the rich supply of constitutive information on                   sound propagatioyn to be gathered from this project will be                     relevant for these.  Moreover, the simulation of shear banding                  has implications far beyond this project - mathematically because               shear banding involves PDE which change type and scientifically                 because shear banding is a widespread mechanism leading to                      failure in many materials."

Tools are developed to solve physical             problems and then turn out to have much greater generality and                  become widely used in mathematics.  The story of the new quantum                invariants of 3-manifolds is similar.  Mathematicians interesting               themselves in problems of quantum field theory were led to a                    certain geometric construction.  The construction led in turn to an             invariant that depended only on the topological character and not               the full geometric character of the underlying manifold.  There are             now variations on the original construction and numerous resulting              quantum invariants.  Their origin is sufficiently different from                that of other previously known invariants that they can be expected             to detect things the traditional invariants cannot.  It now                     behooves topologists to demonstrate this as well as to sort out the             different quantum invariants and their relationships to more                    traditional invariants."

It was originally                stated for three-dimensional manifolds around the turn of the                   century and subsequently generalized to all higher dimensions.                  Curiously, all these generalizations have now been settled (in the              affirmative), but the original case for three-dimensional spheres               still resists all assaults.  The foregoing remarks apply to                     topological manifolds.  The situation is slightly different for                 smooth manifolds.  Here both the three- and the four-dimensional                versions of the Poincare conjecture remain open.  What Quinn is                 hoping to do is to settle the four-dimensional case, using methods              inspired by a mathematical formulation of quantum field theory."

The research focuses on               three principal application areas: Monte Carlo simulation of                    lattice spain models and field theories; solution of large linear               systems of equations with disordered coefficients; and Monte                    Carlo simulation of self-avoiding random walk.  The principal                   algorithmic strategy is to employ ""collective-mode"" updates, such               as multi-grid, auxiliary-variable, embedding and generalizations                thereof.  Some of these algorithms are motivated by techniques                  used in the numerical solution of elliptic partial differential                 equations, but novel adaptations are required.  The methodology                 involves a combination of heuristic physical reasoning, rigorous                mathematical analysis, and systematic numerical testing.  One                   principal project is to continue the development of the multi-                  grid Monte Carlo method, with emphasis on lattice gauge theories.               A second project is to develop multi-grid algorithms for large                  linear systems with disordered coefficients; examples are the                   lattice fermion and Faddeev-Popov propagators in a background                   gauge field.

In a large class of iterative methods, each                iteration consists of a solution of another system of equations.                If that system is in turn solved by an iterative method, it is                  called a two-stage iterative method.  Among the questions to be                 investigated are criteria to determine the optimal or                           near-optimal number of inner iterations to guarantee overall                    convergence of the two-stage method.  When a matrix is                          appropriately partitioned by blocks, and its diagonal blocks are                nonsingular, many of the classical iterative methods can be                     generalized to treat each submatrix as a component.  On a MIMD                  parallel computer (a computer that executes multiple streams of                 instructions on multiple streams of data), each diagonal block                  can be solved by a different processor, using components of                     previous iterations as soon as they are available.  These are                   chaotic or asynchronous parallel block iterative methods.  Their                convergence properties as well as implementation details will be                studied.  Iterative methods for the solution of the general                     eigenvalue problem will also be studied.  Experiments with these                methods will be performed on different parallel architectures.                       A large class of problems in science and enginering is                     described by linear systems of equations.  These are equations in               which the unknown quantities appear in a simple way.  An example                of a linear system is the description of the forces on a building               structure.  These forces need to be calculated to design the                    building materials.  The quantities to be calculated, called the                variables or unknowns, are the forces on particular points of the               structure.  To describe a big structure, such as a high-rise                    building or a bridge, many hundreds or thousands of equations are               needed, but because the forces on each point come only from a few               neighboring points, the equations are relatively simple.  A                     simple iterative method to solve such equations, that is, to find               the values of the unknowns, consists in giving an initial                       approximation for the values of some unknowns, and then computing               the values of the resulting forces on the other points of the                   structure.  Parallel computers are simply a collection of                       computers or processors that communicate with each other.  In the               method just described, different processors can compute the value               of the forces on different points simultaneously, using the                     information already computed by the other processors.  This is                  repeated until all values satisfy all equations.  This situation,               if attained, is called convergence. Not all iterative methods                   attain convergence.  In this project, the iterative methods for                 which convergence can be guaranteed will be studied.  Experiments               will be carried out to test them."

This project continues mathematical research                 on the representation of solutions to scaling equations (scaling                functions) in terms of infinite matrix product expansions.  At                  the present time, the convergence of the product is dependent on                a contractivity assumption.  The terms of the infinite product                  are chosen from a finite set of matrices and combined in a                      certain deterministic manner.  That all possible finite products                appear lead to investigations into bounded semi-groups of                       matrices.

In combining the underlying                   principles with that of iterated function systems, this work                    leads naturally to important techniques for compression and                     reconstruction of television and other communication signals."

Many problems are most naturally initially modeled as a                 DAE.  They arise, for example, in a variety of control problems                 in flight control, robotics, chemical process control, and                      contact or constrained problems in mechanics.  In addition,                     differential algebraic equations occur in the solution of partial               differential equations by the method of lines and in many circuit               models.  DAEs are sometimes also called singular or descriptor                  systems.                                                                             The long range goal of the proposed research is for                        scientists and engineers to be able to work directly with the                   original implicit model thus reducing design and simulation time                as well as facilitating the consideration of more complex                       problems.  Existing numerical codes, while very useful, require                 special problem structure and do not handle many problems of                    interest.  This project will develop a general numerical method                 for nonlinear differential algebraic equations.  These results                  will also be of interest when explicit models exist, but the                    sparsity, nonlinearity, or dependence on parameters of the                      equations, make the original implicit system preferable to a                    lower order, but non-sparse, (or difficult to compute local)                    explicit system."

Major emphasis will be on the solution of non-self-adjoint,                     indefinite problems, e.g., the exterior Helmholtz problem.  Both                preconditioning strategies and computational strategies on                      parallel machines will be investigated.

In this way, transformation group theory (the                study of the symmetries of continuous objects, such as spaces) and              representation theory (the study of symmetries of discrete or                   algebraic objects) become intimately related.  The goal of this                 project is to investigate systematically the interactions between               the geometry of symmetries (such as fixed points) and their                     algebraic manifestations.  In particular, the problem of existence              of symmetries of Moore spaces with prescribed algebraic                         representations (the Steenrod Problem, posed in the early 1960's),              algebraic surfaces, and certain 4-dimensional spaces all provide                concrete problems to which a general theory should apply.                       Techniques from topology, algebraic geometry, and representation                theory should interact fruitfully in this endeavor.                                  Symmetry plays an absolutely fundamental role in science (in               fact, in art and music as well), and we attempt to understand this              role through qualitative and certain quantitative measurements and              comparisons.  In mathematics, symmetry plays a fundamental role                 also, and it has many different but related manifestations.  To                 have a precise and logical understanding of symmetries of a                     mathematical structure, such as a space, we need to discover and                quantify its so-called invariants and other important features.  A              wide variety of sophisticated tools of this trade, chiefly                      algebraic ones, have been developed over the years in different                 research projects, and this investigator is adept at and plans to               draw upon a surprising number of them in his current work."

The basic approach is first to select a problem-specific transformation to precondition the integrands, and then to use an adaptive integration method. The primary objective now is to investigate how best to choose transformations which will allow adaptive numerical integration algorithms to be used effectively. So far, transformations based on a modal approximation transformation have been shown to reduce computation time significantly for some problems. These approximations need to be refined and tested on practical statistical problems and made to interface with standard statistical software packages. Integrals play a very important role in a wide variety of practical statistical calculations; but often these integrals are defined over regions in multiple dimension and do not have values that can be obtained from formulas or tables. In this case, the integrals must be estimated numerically, often with time intensive computation. New methods and refinements to be developed here will take account of special features of these statistical problems to give efficient adaptive integration algorithms."

Building on their past work on allowable sequences and order types of configurations, as well as on ideas coming out of their recent proof of the Grunbaum conjecture on the extendibility of finite arrangements of topological lines to continuous spreads, Goodman and Pollack plan to continue their work on configurations, arrangements of topological flats, and geometric transversal theory, examining (among other problems) (1) the problem of generalizing the proof of the Grunbaum conjecture to intermediate- dimensional flats, (2) the problem of finding a compact representation for configurations and polytopes, as well as a classification of arrangements of intermediate-dimensional flats which reflects their geometric properties, and (3) the problem of determining the relative frequency of order types (the classical Sylvester problem, generalized) via the identification of the set of simple n-point configurations in real d-dimensional space with an open dense subset of a suitable Grassmann manifold. The advent of high-speed computing has brought new life to many of these questions over the past few decades, since it has become possible to investigate non-trivial examples relatively painlessly. The size of interesting finite geometric sets tends to increase exponentially with the dimension. Consider, for the simplest example, the number of vertices of, in turn, a line segment, a square, a cube, a tesseract (4-dimensional), and so forth. The corresponding numbers are 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., and the regularity here is so pronounced that the numbers are computable and the properties of n-dimensional cubes, as they are called, remain manageable even for large n. However, less regular sets with rapidly increasing size become much more difficult to handle without a machine's assistance for computation. This is one aspect of the relation of this kind of mathematics to computing, but there is another reciprocal relation. Just as computing facilitates plausible conjecture and hence proof, so too do some of the proofs lead to improved algorithms for computing. We have here a very useful symbiosis that is bound to flourish even more in the years to come."
