A primary focus of the work is to extend current<br/>network models of orientation tuning to incorporate the fact that<br/>V1 cells are also selective for spatial frequency.  This is<br/>motivated by the considerable physiological and psychophysical<br/>evidence suggesting that cortical circuits carry out a localized<br/>two-dimensional Fourier decomposition of a stimulus rather than<br/>simply performing local edge detection.  Optical imaging of the<br/>surface of cortex has revealed an intricate relationship between<br/>the distribution of orientation and spatial frequency preferences<br/>across cortex.  How correlations between these two feature<br/>preference maps is manifested by the local and long-range<br/>circuitry of V1, and the consequences for the large-scale<br/>dynamics of V1 is also investigated.<br/>     The primary visual cortex (V1) located at the back of the<br/>brain is the first cortical area to process visual information<br/>received from the eyes.  One of the classical results regarding<br/>the function of neurons (brain cells) in V1 is that they analyze<br/>very local features of a visual image, that is, they carry out<br/>image decomposition. (For example, V1 cells are sensitive to the<br/>orientation of an edge representing the boundary between a light<br/>and dark region of the image.  This discovery by Hubel and Wiesel<br/>led to the Nobel prize in medicine).  A very important question<br/>that follows from this is how our coherent perception of the<br/>world is reconstructed.  Until recently, it was thought that the<br/>local information from cells in V1 was passed through higher<br/>order processing stages in the brain where cognition occurs.<br/>However, it is becoming clear that long-range circuitry within V1<br/>could itself contribute to the process of reconstruction.  The<br/>basic aim of the proposal is to investigate this process by<br/>developing a large-scale mathematical model of primary visual<br/>cortex that incorporates the latest anatomical data regarding its<br/>internal circuitry.  Understanding how early stages in the visual<br/>brain encode images has important applications to information<br/>technology (such as the development of artificial vision systems)<br/>and biotechnology (such as the development of an artificial<br/>prosthesis for the visually impaired).  In the latter case it<br/>might be possible one day to artificially stimulate primary<br/>visual cortex to induce a visual sensation, rather like a<br/>controlled visual hallucination.<br/><br/>"

Another goal is to extend the PI's multigrid method for singular solutions and stress intensity factors to more complicated problems and to three dimensions.  This new multigrid approach can recover the optimal convergence rates of simple  finite elements on simple grids, even in the presence of strong singularities caused by nonsmooth geometries, abrupt changes in boundary conditions, or jumps in the coefficients of partial differential equations.  It can also take full advantage of<br/>superconvergence phenomena, extrapolation techniques, and parallel implementations.<br/><br/>Multigrid methods can produce fast solutions to large systems of equations.  The errors of multigrid solutions are comparable  to the smallest possible errors and at the same time the  computational cost of multigrid methods is proportional to the number of unknowns.  Therefore multigrid methods have optimal complexity, and they (either on their own or combined with  other methods) are powerful engines for large scale scientific computations.  The results of this project can provide answers to the important question of the reliability of multigrid methods and provide guidelines for the development of new algorithms.

Only in the last few years have the two topics begun to merge, in the area of high-accuracy solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). Superior performance of PS methods was demonstrated early on in applications such as accurate long term integrations of wave- type equations in very simple geometries. In contrast to usual spectral basis functions, different RBFs are not distinguished by how rapidly they oscillate, but instead by being different translates of one single function. Although certain orthogonalities are lost, spectral accuracy not only remains, but can now also be reached on complex domains with arbitrary node distributions. A new (and counterintuitive) result tells that, in the limit of RBFs becoming increasingly flat, the classical PS methods are recovered. Recently great progress has been made in overcoming the high computer cost and numerical ill-conditioning that earlier were thought to severely limit this approach. The observations above point towards extensions and generalizations of almost all numerical methods which, by tradition, have been polynomial-based. The challenge has changed from exploring the potential of RBFs for arbitrary-geometry spectral methods for PDEs, into exploiting it.<br/><br/>Most phenomena in science, engineering, sciences, and society can be approximated by some kinds of mathematical models. These often involve a construct known as partial differential equations (PDEs). Equations of this kind can only rarely be solved without resorting to computational methods. During the last century, a few main classes of such solution methods have evolved. A quite new class - pseudospectral (PS) methods - emerged some 30 years ago. Around the same time, radial basis functions (RBFs) were invented in a quite different context. The latter have still seen only exploratory use for PDEs. However, during the last three-year period, the PI demonstrated that PS methods can be seen as a special case of RBFs, with the latter approach greatly extending the PS methods' scope and generality. Continuing research will expand on this fundamental result, with the long-term goal of producing practical algorithms which are capable of becoming routine tools for high-precision solutions of PDEs in irregular  multidimensional domains.<br/>"

Cell systems are<br/>used as models in a variety of applications such as neuronal<br/>networks, speciation, arrays of Josephson junctions, and gene<br/>dynamics.  In this Focused Research Group (FRG) project, the<br/>investigators develop a mathematical theory for coupled cell<br/>systems and with colleagues explore implications of that theory<br/>in applications.  The network architecture is a graph that shows<br/>the couplings between cells and which cells and couplings are<br/>identical.  Symmetries in the network architecture have been used<br/>previously to explore certain properties of solutions to cell<br/>systems, such as synchrony or traveling waves.  Symmetry, however,<br/>applies directly only to the most regular of networks.  For a<br/>larger class of coupled cell networks, local symmetries defined<br/>on part of the network can replace symmetries as a predictor of<br/>interesting and important dynamics.  These local symmetries form<br/>a groupoid and it is this groupoid structure that is used to<br/>analyze properties of solutions and transitions between solutions<br/>in coupled cell systems.  The investigators and students develop<br/>a theory of robust synchrony and investigate synchrony-breaking<br/>bifurcations in coupled cell systems (for example, network<br/>architecture often forces Takens-Bogdanov singularities to occur<br/>in codimension one at such bifurcations).

The crucial feature of this<br/>approach is that it is model-independent in the sense that in<br/>appropriate situations symmetry permits the development of a menu<br/>of possible outcomes and the physics or chemistry or biology<br/>chooses from this menu.  Indeed, the theory of coupled cell<br/>systems with symmetry has been applied succesfully to the<br/>analysis of different gaits in animals, pattern formation in the<br/>visual cortex, and speciation.  Relaxing the requirement that the<br/>network under consideration has symmetries extends the<br/>applicability of this approach to a wider range of problems, in<br/>particular to models of gene networks, as well as other network<br/>models from neuroscience.  In these applications it is rare that<br/>the exact model equations are known.  It is therefore important<br/>to develop mathematical tools that study model-independent<br/>features of solutions, tools that focus on solution properties<br/>that are determined by the general structure of the equations<br/>(such as network architecture) rather than by the details of the<br/>equations.  This approach will benefit researchers outside of<br/>mathematics by describing a menu of possible dynamics that a<br/>network can be expected to exhibit.<br/><br/>"

Scanned probe oxidation is a lithographic technique for producing nanoscale patterns on a substrate.  These patterns have been employed successfully as an etch mask for wet and dry processes, and as chemical and biological templates.  The increased demand for such high quality nanodevices requires better understanding of the growth processes involved in their fabrication.   Although data on nanodeposition techniques have been collected over the past decade, investigators are only beginning to develop a qualitative picture of these processes, and are far from a complete quantitative understanding.  The proposed research addresses both of these timely needs.  Because of the varied and coupled physical phenomena involved (electromagnetic, chemical, thermal, etc.), the development of mathematical models for nanodeposition requires a team of individuals with complementary areas of expertise, and must proceed hand-in-hand with experimental validations. Such a team, consisting of interdisciplinary applied mathematicians, scientists and engineers is already active at The University of Akron and working in the area of nanomechanics and nanostructures.  This team proposes to develop models for scanned probe oxidation that will, 1) explain experimental observations that are not well understood, and 2) suggest the range of parameters that is optimal for nanoscale growth.  The team intends to develop appropriate solution and analysis procedures for these complex models, and test the validity of the models through comparison with experiments.  The models will focus attention on the need to develop efficient solution strategies to solve complicated systems in the presence of noise.  Further, the models developed in this work will lead to a significant number of problems in analysis.  Questions on well-posedness, the use of similarity solutions, and bounds on solutions for the class of problems represented by the models will arise from the proposed efforts.<br/><br/>This project proposes to develop mathematical models for the electrochemical nanocell that forms during scanned probe oxidation.  Scanned probe oxidation is a critical technology for writing nanometer-size oxide patterns on the surface of a substrate.  These oxide patterns can be used to prototype nanoscale masks, templates and devices.  The proposed combination of modeling and experimental efforts will help to address the fundamental unanswered questions concerning the physics and chemistry of nanoscale structure formation and properties.  In particular this project will provide the understanding necessary to control the height and width of oxide lines to produce precise nanoscale patterns.  In addition to its impact on scientific research, this project will enhance graduate and undergraduate studies in the disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering.  Students participating in the program will, 1) be exposed tointerdisciplinary research involving sophisticated mathematical modeling and experiments, and 2) be trained to work within a multi-disciplinary environment.  The educational training at both the graduate and undergraduate level will have a long-term impact on the mathematical sciences, providing students with exposure to a unique interdisciplinary environment and inspiring them to pursue careers in this cutting-edge area of national interest.<br/><br/>"

These materials spontaneously undergo a martensitic (diffusionless, structural) phase transformation with a change of shape.  In the ferromagnetic shape memory materials, the shape change can be triggered by a remotely applied magnetic field.  Because of their exceptionally high work output per unit volume, and the unusually large shape changes that are predicted to be possible in single crystal thin films, these materials are good candidates for nanoscale motors.  The investigators will develop theoretical models and computational predictions for nanoscale motors that move, place, orient, actuate, and propel.  A program of molecular beam epitaxial growth of NiTi films will be initiated, and the predicted designs will be put into practice on single crystal thin films of NiTi and Ni2MnGa.  The research includes a fundamental theoretical/ computational/ experimental study of the behavior of phase transformation and the shape memory effect at small scales, resting on the study of the martensitic phase transformation in a sequence of specimens of smaller and smaller size.  Emerging multiscale mathematical methods, expanded to atomic scale, will play a key role in guiding nanoactuator design.<br/><br/>The production of well defined movements of objects at the nanoscale is a critical component of the emerging field of nanotechnology.  This underlies the development of nanorobots, plays a crucial role in optical devices and the placement and orientation of sensors, and is an enabling component of devices that foster the interaction between the physical world and the fundamental processes of biology.  The production of well defined motions and forces at small scales is particularly hampered by the dominance of interfacial and viscous forces at these scales and the destabilizing effects of random Brownian motions.  The shape memory materials proposed by the investigators for use at these scales promise to overcome these impediments to well defined small-scale motion.  As an underlying technology for several emerging fields, the research directly supports US strategic goals in materials science, nanotechnology, and national security.<br/>"

In 1992, Sorensen developed the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi (IRA) method. This resulted in the FORTRAN software package called ARPACK (1996). In 1997, we created a block-version, the Implicitly Restarted Block Lanczos (IRBL) method for solving symmetric eigenvalue problems. When there are multiple or very close eigenvalues our method outperforms ARPACK. In 2002, we developed a MATLAB code irbleigs.m that implements the IRBL method. A block code has many advantages, in particular, it allows the use of Level 3 BLAS matrix-matrix products to increase performance and can locate multiple or clustered eigenvalues without the need of any deflation techniques. Although, Lehoucq and Maschhoff created a block Arnoldi method in 1997 which is a straightforward generalization of the (IRA) method there are implementation issues involved that warrant further investigation before a viable computer code can be created. We propose to develop the implicitly restarted block Arnoldi (IRBA) method to solve the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem and create a public domain computer code. Our method will use Householder transformations instead of the Gram-Schimdt process to maintain strong orthogonality and will be based on the equivalent Wu and Simon's (2001) approach. <br/><br/>Solving eigenvalue problems are a common part of our life whether we realize it or not.

What is<br/>learned about cell and tissue movement is applicable to<br/>Dictyostelium; it can be used in several other contexts,<br/>including embryonic development, wound healing, angiogenesis, and<br/>the immune system.  Macroscopic descriptions based on microscopic<br/>models of cell behavior will significantly improve large-scale<br/>tissue simulations and expand the scope of feasible,<br/>microscopically-accurate simulations.<br/>     In this project the investigators develop mathematical<br/>models to help understand how signal transduction, direction<br/>sensing, and movement in individual, non-interacting cells of<br/>Dictyostelium discoideum, a cellular slime mold, contribute to<br/>the collective behavior of large aggregates of cells.  Directed<br/>cell migration plays an essential role in the early development<br/>and ongoing maintenance of most organisms.  Single-cell organisms<br/>such as bacteria find food and avoid repellents by chemotaxis,<br/>leukocytes must detect sites of infection and move toward them in<br/>order to ingest bacteria and cellular debris, and directed cell<br/>migration is essential for embryonic development and wound<br/>healing.  Cell migration also occurs in many diseases; in cancer,<br/>for instance, it leads to invasion and metastasis, and cell<br/>adhesion and motility also have important roles there.  Metastasis<br/>is probably the major cause of death in cancer patients.  The<br/>potential impact of a better understanding of cell motion is<br/>enormous.  Not only is control of motility an important<br/>therapeutic target for cancer treatment, but cell and tissue<br/>engineering holds the promise to provide new tissues and organs<br/>by in vivo tissue regeneration.  The success of this hinges on<br/>understanding the ways that cells attach to natural and<br/>artificial extracellular matrix, as well as the characteristics<br/>of the cell-cell interactions that eventually dictate how cells<br/>move, proliferate and remodel into new capillaries or other types<br/>of functional tissues.<br/><br/>"

Among the <br/>methods based on asymptotic expansions, the PI proposes to: (i) further <br/>advance his work on high-order geometric perturbation methods.

A <br/>combination of the developments in (i) and (ii) will also be sought in the <br/>design of a ""multi-scale"" algorithm. The program on direct methods, on the <br/>other hand, shall be concerned with the development of algorithms for the <br/>treatment of penetrable bodies.

A large genome can consist<br/>of billions of bases.  Chemical techniques allow scientists to<br/>read only a few hundred bases at a time.  The whole genome shotgun<br/>(WGS) assembly technique creates a draft of the sequence of a<br/>whole genome by selecting such short fragments at random from the<br/>genome, determining the sequence of the fragments, and then<br/>computationally re-assembling millions of these fragments.  Two<br/>fragments are said to ""overlap"" if it is plausible that they come<br/>from the same part of the genome, based on a comparison of their<br/>sequences.  The goal of this project is to focus efforts on<br/>producing an extremely robust set of overlaps, using a<br/>combination of sophisticated error-correction techniques, as well<br/>as ""localizing"" fragments to validate overlaps by ensuring that<br/>both fragments come from the same vicinity of the genome.<br/>Several issues complicate the determination of which pairs of<br/>fragments overlap.  First, most genomes contain many ""repeat<br/>regions,"" i.e., two or more almost identical copies of long<br/>stretches of sequence.  Thus, two fragments that do not actually<br/>overlap may look like they do.  Second, the random sampling<br/>technique results in many base errors --- bases can be mis-read<br/>or missed entirely.  These errors, combined with the fact that<br/>repeat regions usually differ slightly, make it very difficult to<br/>distinguish a spurious overlap from a true overlap in which one<br/>or both fragments contain read errors.  Thus, if extreme care is<br/>not taken, it is easy to use a spurious overlap and thereby<br/>mistakenly connect distant parts of the genome.  Preliminary<br/>results in collaboration with Celera Genomics, the Baylor College<br/>of Medicine, and The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) have<br/>demonstrated that the investigator's current techniques can<br/>already produce more sequence at higher quality.  The goal is<br/>improve these techniques and make them widely available.<br/>     The determination and interpretation of genetic information<br/>is one of the great challenges of the twenty-first century.  The<br/>genome, i.e., all the DNA in a cell, is the molecular basis of<br/>diversity and the cornerstone of genetic information.  Draft<br/>genomes have been obtained for human, mouse, and some insects,<br/>fish, plants, and bacteria.  This is a start, but a full<br/>understanding of biological processes cannot be had by studying<br/>the genomes of only a handful of species.  The federal government<br/>is spending about 100 million dollars per year generating<br/>sequence data.  Millions of small pieces of a genome are sampled<br/>from the genome.  The second stage is called ""assembly,"" when<br/>these pieces are re-assembled on a computer like a giant jigsaw<br/>puzzle.  The puzzle is complicated by two facts: first, many of<br/>the puzzle pieces have small errors that make them mis-fit<br/>against pieces that they SHOULD fit with; and second, many pieces<br/>that should NOT go together actually fit together quite well.<br/>This makes it extremely difficult to correctly assemble a genome.<br/>There are two ways to decrease the ambiguities: first, one could<br/>generate more pieces.  However, each new piece costs about $2,<br/>and one would need to generate millions of new pieces to have a<br/>significant effect on assembly quality.  The investigators use a<br/>second route.  They attempt to squeeze as much information out of<br/>the existing pieces as possible.  The latter route is<br/>substantially cheaper, and there is still much room for<br/>improvement here over existing techniques.  The investigators are<br/>using sophisticated mathematics to help discern with extreme<br/>precision those pairs of pieces that do, and those that do not,<br/>fit together.  Preliminary results of the investigators -- in<br/>collaboration with several large sequencing centers -- have<br/>demonstrated that using their techniques to ""pre-process"" the<br/>pieces can produce more of the genome, with fewer errors.  This<br/>project aims at extending these ideas further and making them<br/>freely accessible to all investigators.

Applications such as thin film coating, composite media and nano-scale materials require mathematical models capable of capturing behavior at several different scales. The traditional approach with user-designed meshes/methods is no longer acceptable in terms of cost and understanding of process behavior. The problems are too complex and users can be fooled. In some situations, the problems cannot be solved when using over-designed meshes. Adaptive methods and the accompanying data structures have become necessary for resolving different scales present in such applications.

The striking fact is that estimating the best solution in an appropriate norm to such problems is very closely related to the solution of difficult problems in irreversible statistical mechanics, a connection that can be expressed through a formalism of statistical projection, sometimes knows as the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. The use of this formalism brings in connections with renormalization, Langevin equations, and scaling procedures, which had to be made more rigorous, and which have now led to new approximation procedures and new formulations of optimal procedures. The first applications were in modeling problems, which could validate the new algorithms, and now the focus is evolving to applications in fluid mechanics, including viscoelastic flows, in plasma physics and in biology.

There is potential application for coated nanofibers, and the nanotubes that result after dissolution of the nanofiber cores, in the areas of filtration, composites, biomedicine, and electronics.  The ever increasing demand for these high quality nanomaterials applications drives the need for models that describe the coating process as well as models that describe the material and electromagnetic properties of manufactured nanofibers and nanotubes.  The coating of nanofibers by physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods is a process that is only partially understood.  While data on nanodeposition techniques have been collected for over a decade, a comprehensive quantitative model of the coating process has not yet been developed.  The proposed research addresses this timely need by outlining a plan to develop truly multiscale models and simulations of coating growth at the continuum length scale while proceeding hand-in-hand with experimental validation.  The PVD method allows for control over the experimental conditions so that comparisons between the experimental results and the<br/>model predictions will be straightforward.  The plan to link asymptotic analysis, numerical simulation, quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics constitutes a major step in the study of nanoscale phenomena.  The models and simulations will connect global continuum models in a PVD plasma reactor, local nanoscale models around a coated fiber, and quantummechanical and molecular dynamics models at the atomistic scale.  These models will provide inputs to a macroscopic scale model of the coating growth so that the morphology of the coating can be tracked via a level set method.  The overall goals of the multiscale modeling, simulation, and experimental efforts are to provide an understanding of how PVD process parameters affect the coating growth, to identify an optimal range of parameters for controlling the growth, to explain experimental observations of coating growth that are not well understood, and to determine the effective electromagnetic properties of the completed product.<br/><br/>This project proposes to develop multiscale mathematical models and algorithms for simulating the growth of a coating on a nanofiber.  The coating of nanofibers with specific materials is a relatively new process for producing coated nanofibers and nanotubes (that result after removing the nanofiber cores).  These nanostructures have many potential applications in filtration, composites, biomedicine, and electronics.  The proposed combination of modeling and experimental efforts will help to address the fundamental unanswered questions concerning the physics and chemistry of nanofiber coating and the properties of the coating.  In particular, this project will provide the understanding necessary to control the coating thickness and uniformity to produce nanotubes with desired dimensional features.  In addition to its impact on scientific research, this project will enhance the training of graduate students in nanoscale modeling.   This is essential for the development of a strong industrial base in nanotechnology.  This research project will allow The University of Akron to develop the expertise necessary to augment existing programs to include a specialization in nanotechnology modeling, at the graduate and the undergraduate level.  Further, it is anticipated that the enhanced understanding of nanoscale manufacturing processes gained during this research effort will allow manufacturers to improve existing products and to develop new products.<br/>"

First of all it enables the user to compute the projective<br/>indecomposable representations of a given group or alternatively<br/>access them via a data base that is provided by the package.<br/>These representations are of fundamental importance when one is<br/>interested in getting an overview of all representations of the<br/>group.  From the projective indecomposable representations one can<br/>derive an algebra called the basic algebra that has the same<br/>representation theory as the group.  This algebra is much smaller<br/>than the group algebra itself and hence also has important<br/>applications in computing with representations.  The share package<br/>therefore also contains functions to compute the basic algebra.<br/>Even though the basic algebra is a very important invariant,<br/>barely anything is known about it even for specific groups.  The<br/>share package increases the knowledge about specific groups<br/>tremendously.  Moreover, there is an explicit algorithmic<br/>connection between representations of a group and that of its<br/>basic algebra.  The share package incorporates functions that<br/>allow the user to analyze and construct representations using<br/>this connection.  This is of particular importance in computations<br/>of the cohomology ring or the Ext-algebra of a group.<br/>     A group is a mathematical object that captures notions of<br/>arrangement and symmetry -- for example, the different<br/>orientations of a square when turned ninety degrees at a time<br/>comprise a group.  Groups arise in mathematics and natural<br/>sciences such as physics, chemistry, and biology.  Exploiting the<br/>group structure often leads to deep insights into problems in<br/>these areas.  The investigator develops ways to represent and<br/>computationally study finite groups.  He implements these methods<br/>in computer software, building on the freely available software<br/>system GAP.  The package he develops contains data bases of<br/>computed results.  These are accessible to the public via the GAP<br/>system and alternatively on the world wide web.  GAP itself is<br/>used in the educational environment and as part of GAP one<br/>possible application of the software package is in the class<br/>room.  It gives students hands-on experience with representation<br/>theory free of charge.<br/><br/>"

The systems<br/>have inherent switching properties, leading to their interpretation as free<br/>boundary problems. What defines them as new is their characterization as<br/>systems rather than scalar equations, underscoring interlocking, complex<br/>dependencies. This work, part of which is joint with Siegfried Carl,<br/>extends the work of many mathematicians who have worked on free boundary<br/>problems for scalar equations during the last four decades. Systems of <br/>free boundary problems are associated with such diverse models as<br/>change of phase, semi-classical band gap theories, threshold switching, <br/>and combustion. Using significant models for illustration, we employ<br/>a multi-tiered analysis, permitting the development of an infrastructure<br/>for analysis and computation. The principal investigator and Michael Rose<br/>introduced the initial comprehensive finite element study of the two-phase <br/>Stefan problem in 1982. In this proposal, iteration and discretization <br/>are studied as companion entities. A particularly significant aspect is <br/>the identification of the system map and its efficient approximation <br/>via smoothing and linearization. The cooperation of Monica Torres has been<br/>secured to study the interface of these systems with homogenization<br/>theory and the theory of fully nonlinear partial differential equations.<br/><br/>Mathematical models of free boundary problems build upon a rich tradition.<br/>Free boundary problems were studied intensively during the 1970s and<br/>1980s. A major impetus in the U.S. was the construction of the trans-Alaska<br/>pipeline, which required knowledge of the complex process of melting<br/>of permafrost. The free boundary refers to the so-called mushy region<br/>between solid and liquid phases. A mathematical model of temperature,<br/>called the two-phase Stefan problem, was employed for this purpose. One of<br/>the principal contributors to this effort was John Wheeler of the Exxon <br/>Corporation. Progress was slow in coming in the modeling of systems,<br/>where several effects may be present. Associated free boundary problems may<br/>arise in many application areas, due to discontinuous switching induced by<br/>sources or sinks within the system. An environmental example is the<br/>discharge of a contaminant species into a river, the regulation of the<br/>discharge, and the ensuing response of control mechanisms to ameliorate the<br/>discharge. Sophisticated systems of partial differential equations,<br/>incorporating physical principles describing the contaminant density and<br/>the river temperature, are utilized, and include the switching phenomena.   <br/>The incorporation of quantum principles into models of nanostructures also<br/>induces switching and free boundary problems, as does the study of certain<br/>processes of combustion. Another application of these ideas, which <br/>is not pursued in this proposal, is the pricing of certain financial<br/>instruments. An area of broader impact of the proposal has been identified <br/>in relation to the international community sponsoring the Workshops on<br/>Computational Electronics.

Faraday waves, excited on the free surface of a fluid, form in a wide variety of patterns depending on the fluid properties and the form of the periodic forcing function. The investigator's research program focuses on a bifurcation analysis of three- and four-wave interactions when a periodic sequence of delta-function impulses is applied to the fluid container. This idealized forcing function admits unprecedented analytic progress to be made in the linear and weakly nonlinear regimes that apply at or near onset of instability.  This project probes how the periodic forcing function may be designed to favor particular patterns. In the second research project spatio-temporal feedback is used to probe the nonlinear pattern formation process, as well as to actively control it. The control of spatio-temporal patterns by local time-delayed and spatially-transformed feedback will be investigated through linear stability analysis, equivariant bifurcation theory, and numerical simulation. In the third project, models of inner ear hair cells, responsible for translating sound-induced motion into electrical signals, are analysed.  The initial focus is on amphibian hair cells, for which two separate mechanisms that contribute to the cells' frequency selectivity have been identified - one due to active mechanical motions of the hair bundle and the other captured by an electrochemical model of ion channels in the hair cell body.  In each model proximity to a Hopf bifurcation contributes to the amplification properties of the hair cells.  The investigator's research project uses dynamical systems methods to derive a reliable reduced model, from existing detailed physiological models of the two Hopf bifurcation mechanisms, with attention to the effects of this two-stage amplification on gain and frequency selectivity.  This project lays the foundation for further investigation of the effects of coupling the hair cell bundles.<br/><br/>Many spatially extended nonlinear systems, including hydrodynamic and laser systems, exhibit spatio-temporal chaotic behavior when subjected to external forcing.  The investigator's research program will lead to a deeper understanding of how to eliminate irregular behavior in favor of spatio-temporally regular patterns.  This is done through appropriate design of the temporal forcing function in the case of hydrodynamic waves, or through spatio-temporal feedback in the case of nonlinear optical and chemical systems. Careful comparison between theoretical results and results of experimental investigations will be made, providing valuable feedback to this research effort.  The investigator's analysis of biophysical models of inner ear hair cells contributes to a greater understanding of how the nonlinearities in two proposed mechanisms of frequency selectivity and amplification might work together to achieve greater gain.  The training of applied mathematics graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary research activities is an integral part of the research effort.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Schaeffer<br/>Institution: Duke University<br/>Title: FRG: Collaborative Research: Physical, Mathematical and Engineering Problems in Slow Granular Flows<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This proposal addresses a spectrum of fundamental and applied problems in the slow flow of granular materials. It includes coordinated efforts in experiment, mathematical analysis, modeling, and numerical simulation, supported by a long-standing industrial collaboration.  Continuum models of granular materials are desirable from several points of view, but the associated partial differential equations are typically ill-posed, a mathematical difficulty that has severely hampered progress, especially for multidimensional flow.  This ill-posedness reflects a real instability, the tendency of the deformation in granular flow to localize into shear bands.  Fundamental issues surrounding the continuum description will be addressed through inter-related projects that investigate: (i) the role of discreteness and nonlinearity in regularizing the ill-posed continuum description, (ii) the formulation from micromechanical considerations, based on experiments and MD simulations, of a continuum model that accounts for microscopic velocity fluctuations, (iii) mathematical predictions and experimental tests of multidimensional steady-state hopper flows, and (iv) the settling of powders, an industrially significant prototype two-phase flow problem.<br/><br/>The research program attacks different aspects of a basic question:  What behavior of slowly flowing granular material can be understood by modeling the material as a continuum?  This is particularly an issue for industrial settings such as the flow of agricultural grains in a converging hopper:  When a silo is discharged, the granular material flows somewhat like a continuous fluid, but the forces on the hopper walls are unlike those exerted by a fluid due to the solid-like properties of the material and its discreteness.  Scientifically, we wish to understand these properties, especially the role that the discreteness of the material plays in the models.  Among other contributions, this research is expected to improve predictive capabilities in the materials- handling industry and thereby increase efficiency in manufacturing.  The group will create a research environment that integrates research with the training of students and post-docs, through weekly group meetings, participation in conferences and a new course on granular materials.  Collaboration across fields will be facilitated by the proximity of the mathematics and physics departments at Duke University, and by the existing collaborations between PIs at NC State and Duke Universities.<br/><br/>"

The arithmetic version of this integral takes values in a ring of virtual Chow motives.  Many objects that occur naturally in the representation theory of p-adic groups, including characters of representations, orbital integrals, Shalika germs, and Fourier transforms of orbits have conjectural descriptions in terms of points on varieties over finite fields, or more generally as the trace of Frobenius operators on motives.  The research of this proposal will make use motivic integration to affirm that many of these objects have geometric descriptions of the conjectured type.<br/>For many years, mathematicians have dreamed that some ofthe fundamental objects of study in algebra should have a uniform description.  Until recently, it was not possible to carry out this dream, or even to give precise meaning tothe words.  However, by combining three different branches of mathematics -- algebra, geometry, and logic --  it now seems possible to bring this dream to fruition.  This field of research relies on methods of mathematical logic to give a geometric interpretation of what was previously considered through pure analysis.  Specifically, mathematical logic gives a geometric interpretation (called motivic integration) of integral calculus and measure.   The research supported by this grant will use this new tool to give a uniform description of some of the fundamental objects in modern algebra, including symmetry through the mathematics of group representations and their characters.<br/>"

Of primary interest are condensed-phase energetic materials, typified by a heterogeneous microstructure consisting of solid grains of the explosive component held together by an inert binder.  Such materials are morphologically, thermomechanically, and chemically complex.  There is a vast disparity between the microscales at which energy is released during combustion, and the scale of a typical explosive device.  Accordingly, existing mathematical models are approximate, describe averaged behavior, and incorporate either implicitly or explicitly a certain degree of homogenization.  The proposed work focuses on two available continuum descriptions.  The first, called ignition and growth, treats the explosive as a homogeneous mixture of reacting and product species.  The second employs a multiphase approach and considers the reactants and products as two distinct phases.  At a fundamental level both mathematical models are systems of hyperbolic PDEs, consisting of the balance laws of mass, momentum and energy, supplemented by prescriptions for the reaction rates and the equations of state.  Application of appropriate mechanical and/or thermal stimulus leads to the formation of detonation waves.  The objective of the proposed research is the elucidation, via a mathematical and computational study, of the mechanisms that underlie the evolutionary behavior of these waves.  We shall focus on their birth, propagation, interaction with disturbances, and response to changes in the configuration of the confining boundary.<br/> <br/>Traditionally, the major emphasis in explosives science has been to initiate a detonation reliably and predictably.  That, in turn, has required a precise knowledge of the kind and strength of stimulus usually a mechanical impulse), and the associated time and distance, needed for the initial shock to transition into a self-sustained detonation.  Mathematical models have indeed been employed with that end in mind.  This study, however, proposes that these models be investigated systematically in a broader context.  Such an exercise is absolutely essential if one is to rationally assess the safety of devices that employ high-energy explosives.  This is because in case of an accident, the stimulus is unlikely to be in the form of a strong, planar shock applied with precision.  For such a case, one must discover how the explosive will respond when subjected to a weak compressive pulse or thermal gradient.  We intend to do so by posing and investigating suitable problems for the two classes of mathematical models.  Such a detailed understanding should pave the way for the rational derivation of further reductions or approximations that are better suited for engineering computations and design.<br/>"

However, this is not the case in the setting of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws, e.g., for compressible, inviscid flows and many other applications. The goal of the first project is to develop stable, efficient, and accurate finite element methodologies for this setting. It involves the use of hierarchical finite element bases (HFEBs). The principles used are similar to those that serve to define spectral viscosity methods. The goal is to maintain, at least away from discontinuities, the full accuracy of the finite element discretization while simultaneously suppressing unwanted and unstable oscillations. HFEBs have important advantages over both standard finite element bases and spectral bases. The separation of scales inherent in HFEBs (but which is totally absent from standard bases) allows for the selective application of artificial viscosity to only the high frequency components of the discrete solution. On the other hand, HFEB functions defined with respect to the finest grid levels are locally supported. This leads to the easy identification of the positions of discontinuities (something difficult to do with spectral bases) which, in turn, enables the efficient implementation of grid refinement strategies and the spacially selective application of artificial diffusion. All of these desirable features lead to the possibility of developing stable, high-accuracy methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Analytical and computational studies will be carried for multi-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws. Among the important algorithmic questions that need to be answered are how to best choose the frequency and spacially-dependent artificial viscosity coefficient and how to efficiently implement higher-order HFEBs. The second project deals with exact controllability problems for hyperbolic PDEs that impact, among many other applications, the stabilization of vibrating structures and the reduction of aerodynamically induced noise. Some preliminary studies have resulted in efficient finite difference algorithms for one-dimensional and geometrically simple two-dimensional wave equation problems. The algorithms are based on discretizing the wave equation and the initial and terminal conditions to produce and underdetermined linear system. This system acts as a constraint for an optimization problem which is defined in order to extract particular solutions of the controllability problem. Compared to previous approaches, the new method does not require regularization to obtain convergent approximations. The proposed work includes the extension of the new algorithmic approach to the finite element setting so that more complicated and realistic geometries can be treated. Extensions to equations with variable coefficients and to systems of hyperbolic PDEs, e.g., the equations of linear elasticity, will also be considered. The algorithmic studies will be complemented with analyses of the convergence properties of the optimization-based methods.<br/><br/>The proposed projects are directly related to important problems in many applications so that their completion should have significant impact on how those problems are solved. For example, although huge efforts have been devoted to developing computational techniques for supersonic flows, there is still a need for developing high-accuracy methods that can be implemented for general geometries such as flows about airplanes. The first proposed project has exactly this goal, and its successful completion would directly impact the way problems are solved in the aerospace, nuclear, geophysics, and other communities. <br/>Furthermore, for the setting of controlling the unstable motions of structures or for the reduction in noise produced by engines, there are few existing algorithms, despite the fact that that setting is directly related to problems in the design of bridges, airplanes, buildings, transmission towers, etc. Thus, the successful completion of the second project, which has as its goal the development, implementation, and analysis of efficient and accurate computational methods, would have great impact on these and other applications.<br/><br/>"

The research addresses several unsolved scientific problems through a combination of approximate analysis and computation. The specific projects include: (1) The investigator will determine the continuum equations for a sediment at low volume fraction, with special attention to the proper way to understand particle diffusion, and the role of intrinsic noise in the dynamics; (2) The investigator will attempt to uncover the origin of recently observed violations of the no slip boundary condition on hydrophobic surfaces. In particular the investigator will address both the stability and the dynamical consequences of small bubbles adhering to the solid surface, as observed experimentally; (3) The investigator will study the role of elastic stresses in influencing the morphology of growing tissue, and in particular develop mathematical models for the morphology of growing yeast colonies; (4) The investigator will develop accurate short time solutions to the Fokker Plank equation in arbitrary potentials as a means towards a novel algorithm for numerical computation of dynamics in fluctuating environments. The educational programs center around teaching a unified view of ''the art of approximation'' (including both asymptotic and numerical methods) to students at all levels. New courses at the graduate level and the beginning undergraduate level will be developed to teach how to effectively combine analysis with computation, for understanding difficult mathematics problems. <br/><br/>The proposal consists of two parts: the research questions to be investigated address important problems of current interest, whose solution could lead to significant scientific and technological advances, with impact on fields ranging from applied mathematics, to materials science, to geophysics and biology. The specific problems range from developing mathematical models for understanding when fluid sticks to surfaces to developing new ways of simulating complex objects undergoing Brownian motion to developing a proper mathematical description for a set of particles falling in a fluid. These are all fundamental questions whose solution could significantly advance the design and development of materials for nanotechnology. For example, all nano-scale objects in an underlying fluid undergo Brownian motion; the lack of an efficient numerical algorithm for simulating these objects severely hampers computational design efforts. The second part of the proposal is educational, focusing on developing methodologies for teaching the art of approximation (combining computation and approximate analysis in a single framework). By finding ways of training students at all levels to effectively combine analysis and computation, they will be better educated to address the important questions of today. The materials that are developed will be broadly disseminated, both through web-based and traditional texts. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

These systems are frequently metastable.  They give rise to challenging and novel issues for modeling, analysis, and simulation.  In this project we have isolated two broad areas for investigation directly from potential application.  Diffusion- mediated transport applies to Brownian motors and molecular ratchets and, typically, involves very small scales. Here, there is a collaboration between a diffusive process, which tends to spread density isotropically through a medium, and a transport process, which tends to localize density, to produce net transport or work when either taken separately would not. Methods from Monge-Kantorovich mass transportation theory are employed to determine the metastable environment of this type of system, but additional techniques seem to be required for better information.  The second broad area concerns interfaces in polycrystalline materials and especially the large-scale simulation of grain growth.  Here we are implementing a novel data structure and carefully designed algorithms to produce simulations which can accommodate experimentally derived energy and mobility functions and also be large enough to produce reliable statistics.  It is a fundamental question to actually derive the relationship between the statistics and the simulation. <br/><br/>Mesoscale phenomena in biological and material systems assume prominence when an intermediate length or time scale is required to assess gross system behavior or when the finer active scales cannot be directly interrogated.  These systems are frequently metastable.  They give rise to challenging and novel issues for modeling, analysis, and simulation.  Here, we have chosen two quite different areas with important applications.  Diffusion-mediated transport lies behind the Brownian motor.  This mechanism is implicated, most importantly, in the motor proteins responsible for eukaryotic cellular traffic.  The opportunity to discover the interplay between chemistry and mechanics and to elaborate the implications of metastability could not offer a more exciting venue.  The second broad area concerns interfaces in polycrystalline materials and their large-scale simulation. Most useful materials are polycrystalline, comprised of many small grains separated by interfaces called grain boundaries.  These interfaces play a role in many material properties and across many scales of use.  Preparing arrangements of grains and boundaries, a texture suitable for a given purpose, is a central problem in microstructure. There is a changing paradigm of experimental science.  Automated data acquisition technologies, now practiced in disciplines as varied as materials science and molecular biology, allow interrogation at vastly diverse ranges of scales.  These scales need not be the smallest nor the largest and, indeed, they are typically those mesoscales which are rich in information.  The principal challenge is the development of strategies for the extraction of this information in a reliable and robust way.  Simulation is becoming an increasingly important tool and, moreover, interpreting the results of this type of simulation is a major question. We believe that understanding the predictive character of large-scale simulations of metastable systems used to interrogate and model physical and biological systems is an emerging fundamental challenge for computational science.  The goal of this project, of course, is to meet this challenge.<br/>"

It includes coordinated efforts in experiment, mathematical analysis, modeling, and numerical simulation, supported by a long-standing industrial collaboration. Continuum models of granular materials are desirable from several points of view, but the associated partial differential equations are typically ill-posed, a mathematical difficulty that has severely hampered progress, especially for multidimensional flow. This ill-posedness reflects a real instability, the tendency of the deformation in granular flow to localize into shear bands.  Fundamental issues surrounding the continuum description will be addressed through inter-related projects that investigate: (i) the role of discreteness and nonlinearity in regularizing the ill-posed continuum description, (ii) the formulation from micromechanical considerations, based on experiments and MD simulations, of a continuum model that accounts for microscopic velocity fluctuations, (iii) mathematical predictions and experimental tests of multidimensional steady-state hopper flows, and (iv) the settling of powders, an industrially significant prototype two-phase flow problem.<br/><br/> The research program attacks different aspects of a basic question:  What behavior of slowly flowing granular material can be understood by modeling the material as a continuum?  This is particularly an issue for industrial settings such as the flow of agricultural grains in a converging hopper:   When a silo is discharged, the granular material flows somewhat like a continuous fluid, but the forces on the hopper walls are unlike those exerted by a fluid due to the solid-like properties of the material and its discreteness.  Scientifically, we wish to understand these properties, especially the role that the discreteness of the material plays in the models.  Among other contributions, this research is expected to improve predictive capabilities in the materials-handling industry and thereby increase efficiency in manufacturing.  The group will create a research environment that integrates research with the training of students and post-docs, through weekly group meetings, participation in conferences and a new course on granular materials.  Collaboration across fields will be facilitated by the proximity of the mathematics and physics departments at Duke University, and by the existing collaborations between PIs at NC State and Duke Universities.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/>"

It combines analytical, computational, and experimental approaches to fundamental issues concerning surfactant spreading, patterned surfaces, vibrational forcing, Marangoni flows, flows on curved surfaces, and spin-coating flows.  Methods include the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, scientific computing, mathematical modeling, asymptotics, and experiments.  Connections will be made with applications such as the role of surfactants in lung physiology, and the emerging field of microfluidics.  The weekly Focused Research Group meeting, a central organizing feature of the project, combines research and education by promoting discussion and interaction across disciplines, and among faculty, students, and post-docs.  <br/><br/>The central theme of this project is the study of how surface tension forces govern the motion of micro-scale fluids in many different settings.  Progress in this basic research on thin liquid films will lead to new theoretical understanding of the physics of fluid flow on a microscopic scale, which is crucial to the emerging technology of microfluidic devices.  These ""labs on a chip"" are transforming biotechnology in much the same way that microelectronics has transformed the computing industry.  Contributions from this project will help to identify fluid flows and surface properties relevant to specific devices, as well as establishing the theoretical underpinnings for future research in this area.  In addition to microfluidics, research will also be undertaken in the modeling of surfactant transport in the liquid lining of the lung.  In developing new theory for this important physiological application, the research group will focus on how the surfactant changes surface tension, giving rise to a force that mobilizes the fluid coating of the lung walls.  Development of theory, experiments, and numerical simulations in this project will involve ongoing interactions with scientists and engineers directly connected with the applications. <br/>"

Meshfree methods may avoid these difficulties by constructing approximation functions entirely in terms of a set of nodes. Most meshfree methods are based on the Galerkin principle and employ moving least-squares approximation for the construction of shape functions. Although there is no need for an explicit mesh in the construction of moving least-squares shape functions, a separate background mesh is required to integrate the weak form, so they are not truly meshfree methods. Due to the non-interpolative character of the moving least-squares approximation, the enforcement of essential boundary conditions in the Galerkin formulation is quite awkward. Moreover, the moving least-squares approximation is more expensive computationally than the finite element interpolation. In the proposed research, we will develop a least-squares meshfree particle finite element method which combines the features of the least-squares finite element method and the meshfree particle method. The least-squares finite element method (LSFEM), based on minimization of the L2 norm of the residuals of a first-order system of differential equations, is a simple, efficient and robust technique, and can solve almost any kind of partial differential equation with the same mathematical/computational formulation.  Since the least-squares method doesn't make use of the integration by parts for converting domain integration into boundary integration, and the meshfree particle method employs the usual finite element interpolations based on particles, all troubles that plague the Garlerkin-based meshfree methods disappear. The least-squares meshfree particle finite element method always leads to a symmetric positive definite system of linear algebraic equations. The matrix-free particle-by-particle conjugate gradient method can be used to solve very large problems on parallel computers, and the implementation is straightforward.. <br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to develop a new computer method to simulate complicated engineering designs and sophisticated multi-physical processes with much greater accuracy and efficiency. Achievements of this project would enable numerical simulations beyond current capabilities in many important applications of national interest, including car crash safety analysis, noise reduction of cars, energy efficiency in full cells, heat reduction in semiconductor devices, etc. <br/>"

We will particularly study mixing induced by time-periodic electroosmosis that is driven by externally applied electric fields, hence eliminating the need for mechanical pumping components.  Rapid switching between several electric field configurations will be utilized to create different flow fields, resulting in increased interspecies contact area and/or chaotic mixing.  Numerical simulations of mixing require robust algorithms that minimize the dispersion and diffusion errors.  To address this need, we will develop nonconforming spectral element algorithms using the Mortar element and constrained approximation methods.  Our approach will allow both h-type and p-type nonconformities for efficient resolution of all flow features, including the thin electric double layers. In addition to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes and species transport equation solvers, we will develop necessary algorithms to calculate the particle trajectories, Poincare sections, and other tools required to characterize the chaotic mixing and mixing efficiency. Implementation of both the Mortar element and constrained approximation methods will also allow detailed comparisons between the accuracy and computational efficiency of these two schemes.<br/><br/>In the absence of turbulence, mixing of fluids on micro-scales requires very long mixing lengths and long times.  This creates significant challenges in design of efficient mixers for micro-fluidic devices, such as micro-total-analysis-systems, utilized in detection of biological and chemical agents for medical, pharmaceutical, and national security applications.  Utilization of time-periodic electroosmosis allows design of new mixing strategies that either enhance diffusive mixing by increasing the interspecies contact area, or induce chaotic mixing.  This project will enable enhanced understanding and characterization of electroosmotically induced chaotic and diffusive mixing.  The research will facilitate development of new micro-fluidic mixing concepts, which can be implemented in design of new efficient micro-mixers for micro- and nano-fluidic applications.<br/>"

Polyhedral cutting plane methods work with linear programming relaxations of the problem of interest. Interior point cutting plane methods have the potential to solve problems that are not amenable to simplex methods, because of the size of the problem or because superior cutting planes may be generated at an interior point.

This project focuses on a technology transfer from contemporary ideas in topology, geometry, and dynamics to bear upon application domains which include the following: First, Robotics: tools from configuration space theory, CAT(0)complexes, and computational topology will be directed toward specific problems in reconfigurable robotics, sensor-based navigation of mobile agents, and self-assembly systems. Second, Parabolic coupled systems: a Morse-theoretic homotopy index for braids will be used to solve parabolic variational problems arising in pattern-formation PDE's, discrete Lagrangian mechanics, and coupled oscillators. A Floer-theoretic extension of the braid index will also be developed for infinite dimensional systems. Third, Hydrodynamics: tools from contact geometry and topology will be directed toward solving global problems of the dynamics and stability of Eulerian fluid flows in dimensions higher than two.<br/>In most systems of interest in science and engineering, multiple cooperative tasks must be globally coordinated. A common thread is that whether the tasks involve macro-scale robots, micro-scale devices, coupled oscillators, or fluid particles, there is an abstract space of configurations lurking behind the physical phenomena. Unearthing and examining those properties of physically-motivated configuration spaces which capture the global features, the topology, geometry, and dynamics, holds the promise of providing global tools which transcend the physical instantiation of the system at hand: ostensibly different systems possess similar topological underpinnings. The research component of this project is the development of contemporary topological and global-geometric techniques for analyzing the dynamics and coordination of systems of interest in engineering and computer science. The overall goal is an effective technology transfer from cutting-edge perspectives in topology to bear upon systems in application domains, which include robotics, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. This is combined with a blend of pedagogical service across graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels, featuring a focused research group on topological robotics and a high-school outreach program of expository lectures on the relevance and joy of mathematical research.<br/><br/><br/>This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

What<br/>makes these problems difficult is that one wants totally local<br/>information about errors when, in fact, the solution and its<br/>approximation are globally influenced in particular by the<br/>singularities.  The investigators also look into a priori error<br/>estimates for second order elliptic partial differential<br/>equations with discontinuous coefficients on nonconvex polygonal<br/>domains, allowing meshes that are highly refined.  The estimates<br/>under consideration justify the use of refined grids in a variety<br/>of highly singular problems.  Because most refined grids are<br/>constructed using self-adaptive codes that may have different<br/>methods of choosing a grid, no a priori assumption is made about<br/>the distribution of the mesh.  The work described above is carried<br/>out under the assumption that meshes are shape-regular, but<br/>basically nothing else is assumed concerning the meshes.  If some<br/>further local structure is placed on the mesh (so-called one plus<br/>alpha regular meshes), then a limited amount of superconvergence<br/>may occur (as shown by Xu and Zhang in a particular situation).<br/>The investigators, together with Zhang, apply this idea in<br/>greater generality, namely to meshes that are perturbations of<br/>those symmetric with respect to a point.

The first, a materials<br/>science application, arises during the solidification of a ternary alloy.  <br/>Here the porous medium is made up of dendritic crystals that solidify or <br/>melt depending on local thermodynamic conditions of the interstitial fluid.  <br/>The fluid flow and solidification processes are tightly coupled in this <br/>reactive porous medium.  The second project arises in response to interest <br/>by environmental scientists in developing strategies for the removal or <br/>containment of groundwater contaminants in nonhomogeneous porous media.  <br/>The proposed work addresses gravity-driven flow through spatially nonuniform <br/>porous media using asymptotic homogenization methods in order to identify <br/>effective media properties which characterize a relatively complex porous <br/>media by a much simpler description.  The third project involves fluid flow<br/>through a porous medium whose porous matrix can be deformed by the fluid <br/>moving through it.  Such flows appear in soils, in tissues, organs and <br/>tumors in the human body and in industrial applications such as injection <br/>molding, filtration and inkjet printing.  The proposed work attempts to <br/>extend mathematical modeling tools for inkjet printing technology and to <br/>connect these ideas to other application areas. <br/> <br/>The proposed research is of an interdisciplinary nature that through<br/>the use of applied mathematical techniques addresses directly problems <br/>in materials processing, environmental science and industrial printing <br/>technologies.  Applications impacted directly by this research include <br/>industrial alloy processing, strategies for the removal or containment of <br/>groundwater contaminants and related environmental hazards, and flows <br/>arising during industrial applications such as inkjet printing.  This <br/>work may indirectly impact the understanding of geophysical flows that <br/>occur in the earth's core or during the formation and melting of sea ice, <br/>other industrial applications such as injection molding and filtration, <br/>and biological applications involving the transport of fluid in tissues, <br/>organs and tumors in the human body.  The work proposed by the PI at <br/>George Mason University will involve collaboration with researchers at <br/>the University of Tennessee, the University of North Carolina as well <br/>as with researchers in the United Kingdom and at the National Institute <br/>of Standards and Technology."

Algorithms for computing the eigenvalues, singular values and the solution to a linear system are executed on modern computers in finite precision arithmetic. As a consequence, round-off errors can cause loss of accuracy in these computations when ill-conditioned problems are solved, usually leaving the user with the only remedy of running the same algorithm using wider precision at a much higher computational cost.  The goal of this study is to identify matrix structures and understand matrix properties which make it possible to design algorithms that will perform matrix computations accurately in the face of roundoff and will succeed in computing the right answer even when the traditional structure-ignoring algorithms fail. The matrix structures that will be studied appear very often in practical applications and include: Totally positive, tridiagonal, M-matrices, (generalized) Vandermonde, Cauchy, etc. and combinations thereof.<br/><br/>Most scientific and engineering computations compute in their core the solution of a linear system, an eigenvalue or a singular value problem. Typical examples include simulations automobile crash-testing, testing bridge and building structural designs and behavior under stress (earthquakes, explosions, etc.).  Structure-exploiting accurate and efficient matrix algorithms make running such applications faster, easier, less reliant on super computers and allow for computations of more sophisticated designs and simulations than is currently possible. As a result it may become easier to design safer cars, which cost, weight and pollute less, and it may allow for an easier and faster design of bridges, buildings and other structures that are less expensive, faster to build and are also less susceptible to the forces of nature.<br/>"

Meshfree methods may avoid these difficulties by constructing approximation functions entirely in terms of a set of nodes. Most meshfree methods are based on the Galerkin principle and employ moving least-squares approximation for the construction of shape functions. Although there is no need for an explicit mesh in the construction of moving least-squares shape functions, a separate background mesh is required to integrate the weak form, so they are not truly meshfree methods. Due to the non-interpolative character of the moving least-squares approximation, the enforcement of essential boundary conditions in the Galerkin formulation is quite awkward. Moreover, the moving least-squares approximation is more expensive computationally than the finite element interpolation. In the proposed research, we will develop a least-squares meshfree particle finite element method which combines the features of the least-squares finite element method and the meshfree particle method. The least-squares finite element method (LSFEM), based on minimization of the L2 norm of the residuals of a first-order system of differential equations, is a simple, efficient and robust technique, and can solve almost any kind of partial differential equation with the same mathematical/computational formulation.  Since the least-squares method doesn't make use of the integration by parts for converting domain integration into boundary integration, and the meshfree particle method employs the usual finite element interpolations based on particles, all troubles that plague the Garlerkin-based meshfree methods disappear. The least-squares meshfree particle finite element method always leads to a symmetric positive definite system of linear algebraic equations. The matrix-free particle-by-particle conjugate gradient method can be used to solve very large problems on parallel computers, and the implementation is straightforward.. <br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to develop a new computer method to simulate complicated engineering designs and sophisticated multi-physical processes with much greater accuracy and efficiency. Achievements of this project would enable numerical simulations beyond current capabilities in many important applications of national interest, including car crash safety analysis, noise reduction of cars, energy efficiency in full cells, heat reduction in semiconductor devices, etc. <br/>"

The topics of the Advanced Study Institute conference, geometric algebras and computational group harmonic analysis, have emerged as key tools for resolving the ever expanding conceptual and computational demands on signal and image processing as it rapidly grows in importance. Signal and image processing is used in remote sensing, micro and unmanned vehicles, biological processing and neural and quantum computing. The ASI will bring together world leaders from both academia and industry with extensive multidisciplinary backgrounds for an interactive forum; they will initiate new efforts and intensify existing efforts towards a unified computational framework for the advancement of a broad range of applications.

Accordingly, such models have difficulty in<br/>providing reliable predictions of behavior due to the large<br/>variance seen in replicate data sets. This substantially limits<br/>their practical application to the biological control of crop<br/>pests. In previous work, the investigator formulated a family of<br/>deterministic models, including an idealized paradigm defining a<br/>class of reaction-diffusion systems. He studies two general<br/>issues relating to the analysis and practical applications of the<br/>reaction-diffusion system and related models. First, he<br/>investigates the presence of several distinct families of stable<br/>waves and spatial patterns of these equations, their<br/>instabilities and bifurcations, and the presence of exotic<br/>wave-like patterns. By combined analytical and approximate<br/>methods, he describes theoretical mechanisms by which such<br/>unstable waves can form the organizing center of spatio-temporal<br/>chaos, while in other regimes, complex but non-chaotic, stable<br/>spatio-temporal patterns appear spontaneously. A second topic<br/>concerns the derivation of the model, which is based on<br/>experiment. This addresses the manner in which the<br/>reaction-diffusion model simulates stochasticity through<br/>postulated low-density thresholds in the growth rates. The<br/>investigator studies hybrid numerical procedures addressing the<br/>crucial issue of parameter estimation, which can be problematic<br/>both for stochastic patch models and for the reaction-diffusion<br/>model, but at opposite spatio-temporal scales. For example, the<br/>low-density thresholds involve the micro-local dynamics of a<br/>small number of individuals, whereas large-scale emigration over<br/>large regions is difficult to measure in a laboratory. However,<br/>simple stable waves may suggest one instance in which this may be<br/>possible. The investigator examines this in numerical<br/>simulations with patch models, which may form the basis for new<br/>and simpler experimental designs that can detect such behavior.<br/>Together, these two approaches present a unified picture of how<br/>""dynamic stochasticity"" driven by the presence of certain<br/>unstable waves and spatio-temporal patterns is theoretically<br/>linked to parameters of population change governing behavior at<br/>the smallest micro-local scales, and thus the generation of<br/>asynchrony through demographic and environmental stochasticity.<br/> Plant-eating mites, and the mites that eat them in turn,<br/>often show cycles of growth and decline in numbers that are<br/>closely related. Sometimes the populations decline rapidly to<br/>near-extinction levels. But in a classic experiment Huffaker and<br/>colleagues showed that these strongly coupled cycles can be<br/>moderated by small changes in demographic or geographic factors,<br/>leading to a long-term survival of both species that shows itself<br/>in patterns, in time and space, of the numbers of predator and<br/>prey mites. Of course, when the prey mite is eating a valuable<br/>crop, one wants both mite populations to go extinct. So issues of<br/>how mite populations vary together are of considerable practical<br/>importance in the biological control of crop pests. The economic<br/>impact of phytophageous species is considerable, and although the<br/>use of predatory mites as a biological control is widespread in<br/>certain local agricultures, many agricultural enterprises rely on<br/>chemical pest controls. Chemical controls provide a short-term<br/>solution, but have many damaging long-term effects. However, the<br/>risks and uncertainties of biological pest control are difficult<br/>to quantify due to their complex and unpredictable patterns of<br/>behavior. The investigator's numerical simulations indicate the<br/>presence of many different kinds of chaos, some of which achieve<br/>better levels of suppression of both herbivore populations and<br/>crop damage. The project explores new theoretical and<br/>computational tools that may find practical application in the<br/>biological control of crop pests and, in other contexts, in<br/>inoculative control of certain exotic species."
