NNs are a core component of modern AI models and are widely used in numerous applications across science, engineering, and industry. Training refers to a learning process of AI models. It is notoriously challenging due to the nonlinear and nonconvex nature of NNs. The state-of-the-art methods frequently fail to produce satisfactory results and exhibit unstable behaviors, limiting the accuracy and reliability of AI models. This project will develop effective training methods that significantly improve the training performance over the state-of-the-art, overcoming the current limitations. The broader impacts include creating educational opportunities for undergraduates through a summer research program, developing professional training for K-12 educators on computational mathematics for AI, and establishing public engagement through interactive demonstrations and online resources, all of which will broaden participation in computing and improve public understanding of the role of mathematics in AI.<br/><br/>The project develops a novel exploration-exploitation-determination (EED) framework for training neural networks that uniquely combines both local and nonlocal information. Four objectives are: (1) establishing the EED framework for two-layer neural networks by utilizing mathematical analysis of gradient flow dynamics and nonlocal effects; (2) developing a layer-wise training strategy for deep neural networks that sequentially trains each hidden layer; (3) extending the framework to handle noisy and corrupted data through l1-norm minimization; and (4) validating the methods through applications to scientific machine learning tasks including operator learning for PDEs and flow map learning for data-driven discovery of dynamical systems. The computational methods will be rigorously analyzed mathematically, and the resulting algorithms will be made publicly available to enhance reproducibility and maximize impact across multiple scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The success of machine learning is dependent upon a sufficient amount of labeled data samples. A key limitation of most machine learning methods is their reliance on large labeled sets. Labeled data is scarce for many applications. Obtaining enough labeled data is often difficult because it is time-consuming and expensive, especially when experts are required for the labeling task. This project develops novel strategies for machines to effectively learn in limited labeled data scenarios. The foundation of the new strategies lies in data analysis and algorithm development and the project involves the training of graduate and undergraduate students in these areas through mentoring and curriculum development.  User-friendly software packages will be made available to the community to ensure the results from the project can be used by other researchers who use machine learning. <br/> <br/>To address the challenge of data with limited labeled samples, and to develop computationally tractable methods for machine learning tasks such as data classification, the PI will incorporate a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework. Specifically, one of the main advantages of semi-supervised learning is its ability to make use of the important information from the vastly available unlabeled data without the additional cost of external interaction; moreover, the graph-based framework provides information about the extent of similarity between the data elements and the overall structure of data. In particular, the proposed research encompasses the following three aims:  (1) development of graph-based similarity-driven auction dynamics learning methods (2) development of graph-based similarity-driven neural network methods (3) development of graph-based similarity-driven maximum-flow learning methods. Although all three aims involve developing graph-based approaches for learning tasks using semi-supervised techniques, each of the aims will formulate procedures with their own advantages. Overall, this proposal will develop computationally tractable semi-supervised graph-based methods for machine learning tasks that will require less labeled data for accurate predictions, which is crucial due to the scarcity of labeled data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research on minimax problems dates back almost a century, when von Neumann published his minimax theorem about zero-sum games. The past several years have witnessed tremendous research interest in solving minimax problems, motivated by training deep learning models, including generative artificial intelligence and robust machine learning. Though well-trained deep learning models can deliver high-quality performance in many tasks, they are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Using such models can cause serious safety and security risks; thus, improving their robustness is very important. Most existing methods for solving minimax problems require certain strong conditions that do not hold for modern applications, such as training robust deep learning models. This project will develop new optimization algorithms for solving minimax problems, which can deliver guaranteed stability and reliability under weaker and more practical conditions. Software packages will be developed and released for public use to benefit both academic and industry researchers. The results from the project will be integrated into regularly offered or topical courses at RPI for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Different algorithms will be designed by leveraging the structures of the considered minimax problems, and analysis will be conducted as well to show the convergence of these algorithms and their complexity. For solving nonconvex nonsmooth minimax problems that satisfy a certain regularity condition for the dual part, a momentum-accelerated primal-dual stochastic subgradient method (PDSsG) will be investigated, and a Moreau-envelope based smoothed PDSsG, as an alternative, will also be explored. For solving nonconvex-nonconcave nonsmooth minimax problems that do not satisfy regularity conditions, new approaches will be developed by using the log-exponential smoothing function to approximate the maximization part. On solving problems that involve too-big data, new distributed methods will be designed under the setting of either a complete network or an incomplete connected network. Low-precision communication and error-compensation techniques will be used, for the first time, to solve nonconvex minimax problems, to save communication, and achieve fast convergence. These investigations are expected to invent new analysis techniques and lead to novel and efficient algorithms for solving large-scale minimax structured optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To obtain solutions that translate best into real-world settings, these problems should involve models of the real world that are as accurate as possible, which in a mathematical context means that the problems may need to involve a large number of decision variables and complicated formulas with features such as nonsmoothness.  Thanks to the thriving field of mathematical optimization, there exist algorithmic methodologies for solving certain instances of problems of this type.  However, contemporary methodologies also have limitations that preclude their use for solving complex problems robustly and efficiently.  for example, it may be that with respect to an objective that is optimized, only the consequences of a certain set of decisions can be estimated (in terms of a cost, error, or other measure).  This can occur, when the value can only be determined through a computer simulation or as a statistical prediction over only partially observed data.  Such a context demands that contemporary approaches be extended so that they can intelligently handle noisy or stochastic (i.e., randomized) estimates of the value of decisions.  This project aims to design such algorithmic extensions for solving important classes of optimization problems arising in these prevalent and challenging application areas.<br/><br/>This project will involve the design, analysis, and implementation of gradient-sampling-based algorithms for solving locally Lipschitz optimization problems, specifically those that have nonconvex and nonsmooth objective functions.  The main scope of the project is to extend contemporary gradient-sampling-based algorithms for settings when function and derivative evaluations are corrupted by computational and/or stochastic noise.  In settings with such noise, fundamental properties on which gradient-sampling methods rely for their convergence guarantees break down, meaning that these fundamental properties need to be revisited and enhanced for settings with computational and/or stochastic noise.  These, in turn, will necessitate careful redesigns of complete algorithmic methodologies along with their corresponding convergence theories.  The real-world impact of the project will be enhanced by the fact that it will translate into enhancements to the state-of-the-art software developed by the principal investigator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Helmholtz problems are notoriously difficult to solve computationally, and there has been much research into finding better algorithms for this key and essential task. Despite this past research, there remains room for improvement. The benefit of improved algorithms could be, for example, the creation of advanced optical meta-materials that can outperform traditional optical devices used in civilian and military applications, e.g., being lighter, using less power, or operating in multiple regimes. This proposal will develop new fast algorithms for solving Helmholtz problems. The algorithms are optimal in the sense that the number of operations needed to solve the problem is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom (number of unknowns). The breakthrough is based on viewing the Helmholtz problem as the time-periodic solution of an associated wave propagation problem using the recently developed WaveHoltz algorithm.<br/><br/>Time-periodic problems and associated eigenvalue problems arise in a wide range of applications in engineering and applied sciences involving systems exhibiting time-harmonic behavior. This proposal aims to address problems of this type by developing new and efficient high-order accurate algorithms for solving large-scale Helmholtz and eigenvalue problems for multi-domain and multi-physics applications. Numerical schemes for these problems will be based on an extended WaveHoltz algorithm for Helmholtz problems, along with a new EigenWave algorithm for eigenvalue problems.  WaveHoltz computes solutions to the Helmholtz problem by filtering solutions of a related time-domain wave equation, thus avoiding the need to invert a large, indefinite matrix. The EigenWave algorithm follows a similar approach and can compute eigenvalues of an elliptic operator anywhere in the spectrum without inverting an indefinite shifted matrix. In addition to the extension of WaveHoltz to complex geometry on overset grids, the basic WaveHoltz approach will be accelerated using large-time-step implicit time-stepping at an O(N) cost per iteration (N being the number of grid points), and by deflation using eigenmodes (or approximate coarse-grid eigenmodes) computed with the new EigenWave algorithm. Dispersive (pollution) errors will be ameliorated using high-order accurate spatial approximations. WaveHoltz will also be extended to dispersive wave propagation problems as well as multi-domain problems that couple different physics or materials in different domains, coupled with high-order accurate interface conditions. For open domain problems (e.g. scattering problems) the new algorithms will be coupled to advanced radiation boundary conditions.  The development of the proposed algorithms and simulation capabilities will lead to a new and transformative approach for solving large-scale Helmholtz and eigenvalue problems, and will provide high-performance open source software tools to the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project additionally provides opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge research, and supports creation of materials for an advanced undergraduate-level modern numerical linear algebra course to be used at Harvey Mudd College (HMC) and beyond.  This course will feature significant curricular research projects which align with the technical directions identified in this project; descriptions of potential course project topics will be released with the public course materials.  The project will additionally provide vertically-integrated mentorship opportunities for visiting graduate students, HMC undergraduates, and high school students through HMC?s federally funded Upward Bound (UB) program.  Finally, the project will support an annual professional development workshop for early career participants interested in research mentorship at primarily undergraduate institutions.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this CAREER project is the development and analysis of a suite of randomized iterative methods for problems with devastating adversarial corruption, problem constraints, and extremely large data dimension.  The project will focus specifically on three main research thrusts: (1) Developing and analyzing corruption-robust variants of randomized iterative methods in numerical linear algebra for least-squares regression, and generalizing these analyses to first-order methods in numerical optimization for a more general class of convex optimization problems. (2) Analyzing the iterative behavior of common combinatorial and numerical iterative methods for randomly sketched and subsampled regression problems with nonnegative and related constraints, and using these analyses to develop efficient randomized iterative methods for such problems.  (3) Extending the application of randomized iterative methods to problems in which both the number and size of data may be massive by developing provably effective randomly compressed and sparsified iterative updates. Open-source software implementations of the developed and analyzed methods will accompany the work completed under each of the above thrusts.

Conformal fractals are intricate geometric objects generated via iterated schemes of conformal (angle-preserving) transformations, and they have numerous interdisciplinary applications in mathematical physics, computer graphics, and data science. Measuring the size of conformal fractal attractors has been one of the central themes in the evolution of modern dynamical systems. One of the most well-known ways for measuring such complex geometric objects is the concept of Hausdorff dimension, which provides a robust way of determining the roughness of a set, extending the idea of dimension beyond integer values. The Hausdorff dimension of conformal fractals cannot be derived via simple analytic closed formulas, and obtaining effective and rigorous estimates becomes a challenging computational problem. The scope of this project is to introduce new methods from numerical partial differential equations with the scope of developing versatile, rigorous, and efficient methods for computing the Hausdorff dimensions of various conformal attractors.<br/><br/>The project's topic is naturally interdisciplinary, encompassing a wide range of problems across Real and Complex Analysis, Dynamical Systems, Numerical Analysis, and Large-Scale Computations. The goal is to derive accurate and rigorous Hausdorff dimension estimates for a broad class of conformal fractals by integrating techniques from finite element methods, dynamical systems, and fractal geometry. Finite element analysis is a well-established approach for approximating solutions to a wide range of partial differential equations, with numerous refined methods developed over the years to ensure accurate and reliable numerical results. In contrast, the field of rigorous computation of Hausdorff dimensions for conformal limit sets is still in its infancy. The primary innovation of this project lies in adapting numerical methods typically used for solving PDEs to the estimation of Hausdorff dimensions. This new methodology demands deep analytical foundations and the development of novel theoretical results, presenting significant challenges, especially within the broader context of conformal graph-directed Markov systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But more complicated phenomena (e.g. featuring nonlinearities or spatially-varying media), which are increasingly relevant in applications in medical imaging and also have long-standing intrinsic importance in geophysical exploration, have posed a substantial barrier to this class of methods---which thus have significant untapped potential in these application domains. This project will develop numerical methods with rigorous approximation guarantees to solve these physical problems and enable new scientific questions to be answered / for new technology to be designed, thereby strengthening the U.S. competitiveness and national defense.

By suitably exploiting Green's identity the proposed methods allow for singularity-oblivious quadrature to nevertheless be used for these erstwhile singular integrals; accompanying error analysis in two and three dimensional contexts and in curvilinear domains will place the proposed methods on a firm theoretical foundation, and they will be integrated with fast N-body interaction methods. These methods will be coupled into advanced solvers that enable treatment of complex nonlinearities that arise in acoustic problems found in medical imaging. More generally, the methods will allow the extension of the integral equation methods to nonlinear and possibly time-dependent PDEs, as VIOs reduce inhomogeneous linear PDEs to corresponding homogeneous problems---for which surface integral methods have always been highly advantageous.

As is well known, the past two decades have witnessed an exponential increase in the use of social or other networks, which consist of objects and connections between them, and carry a lot of information. These networks can be used to detect different groups of objects, each with similar characteristics or preferences. In materials science, advanced engineering alloys, such as steels and high-entropy alloys, may be thought of as 3-dimensional graphs with atoms residing at the nodes of a graph and its edges as bonds. These materials are often polycrystalline, and sudden, unexpected failures occur frequently in the form of fractures along crystal boundaries. Such failures are extremely costly, resulting in, for example, oil and gas spills and even bridge collapses. All the above problems can be cast as balanced graph cut problems, which are very challenging. In the literature, many existing approaches resort to approximate solutions. However, these solutions may differ significantly from the optimal ones. This proposal mainly focuses on the development of efficient and reliable methods for finding optimal graph cuts, which could significantly promote their applications to practical problems in the fields of materials science and social sciences.  <br/><br/>Partitioning a large data set into a prescribed number of subsets is a fundamental problem in machine learning, and it assumes wide applications in fields such as social networks, computer science, chemical engineering, and materials science. To conduct the partition, different balanced graph cuts have been proposed, including the Cheeger cut, the ratio cut, and the normalized cut. As one of the most important balanced graph cuts, the Cheeger cut is a challenging NP-hard problem. Existing approaches only provide approximate solutions. Recently, a novel nonlinear spectral graph theory was developed, and finding the Cheeger cut amounts to solving a constrained optimization problem with a non-smooth objective function over a non-convex set that consists of many different-dimensional simplex cells. The number of these cells is an exponential function of the number of vertices of a graph. Therefore, this raises another tough optimization problem. The proposed research in this project consists of three parts: 1) developing novel efficient and reliable numerical algorithms to solve the above-mentioned problem by using optimization techniques; 2) extending the existing nonlinear spectral graph theory to weighted graphs to enrich the theory and significantly expand its applications to real problems; 3) applying the proposed methods to tackle practical problems in metallurgical engineering and materials science.

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) aims to develop new techniques based on topology and other disciplines in pure mathematics to understand complex data. Research questions are strongly motivated by applications from neuroscience, image recognition, biology, material science, geography, and beyond. The underlying idea is that topology helps recognize patterns within data and, therefore, turn data into compressed, useful knowledge. Besides advancing the progress of science by helping to prepare the next generation of applied topologists, this school is also designed to expand the reach of applied topology.<br/><br/>The topic of the school is the study of general techniques to achieve stability of invariants in TDA that can be applied to different objects, from persistence modules to Reeb graphs. In particular, the focus is on questions about the stability of various TDA tools: 1) Which metrics can be introduced to ensure the stability of traditional topological invariants? 2) Which invariants can be developed to ensure stability with respect to traditional metrics? Through questions like these, TDA enriches the traditional fields of algebraic topology and geometry while at the same time striving for theoretical guarantees for practitioners in data analysis. There will be three lecturers alternating in the mornings, an introductory poster section, problem sessions in the afternoons, and a few short research talks from the participants. Ultimately, the school?s goal is to encourage students to develop their own application-motivated results in TDA by considering well-established principled strategies.

Many real-world data sets, such as genetic information or molecular images, contain hidden structures that can be uncovered using geometric methods. Leveraging these hidden structures can decrease the computational resources needed to analyze large data sets and can also provide scientific insight regarding various biological and physical processes. The goal of this project is to harness the full power of geometric methods for modern machine learning by the design of innovative solutions to the critical challenges facing the field. The project will focus on developing methods that can handle noisy data and tools for data visualization that preserve important geometric details. In addition to its scientific goals, the project will have a broad impact by offering new educational programs to support student mental health, increase diversity in data science, and encourage underrepresented groups to engage in this field. By addressing both technical and social challenges, the project aims to create more reliable, scalable tools for data analysis while promoting inclusion and innovation in science and education.  <br/><br/>In many applications, real data often concentrates around low-dimensional structures or manifolds, and manifold learning algorithms are a powerful tool for uncovering this low-dimensional structure. The project is on manifold learning algorithms, tackling the key challenges facing the field, including how noise affects algorithm performance, how to preserve both local and global geometric details, and how to effectively handle complex collections of manifolds. This research will investigate best practices for denoising, analyze how noise impacts spectral manifold learning algorithms, and clarify the regime in which algorithms can reliably recover manifold structure. The project will develop novel algorithms that utilize diffusion to faithfully encode geometric information at various scales and also hybrid methods for geometric regularization of manifold learning algorithms. Since real data often fails to concentrate around a single manifold, this work will contribute a robust and scalable solution for clustering collections of manifolds via a novel angle-based path metric on simplices, so that manifold learning algorithms can be applied under less restrictive assumptions. In addition, since data often contains numerous irrelevant features and features measured on very different scales, the project aims to develop a probabilistic framework for learning and adjusting features according to their actual relevance. Overall, the goal is to design a comprehensive data analysis pipeline that is noise-robust and capable of balancing local and global geometric information to represent data in just a few dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of ECOM is to introduce students and early-career researchers to current trends in optimization as well as to provide a strong networking environment between academia, industry, and the national laboratories. The focus of this fifth meeting will be on the role of optimization for Digital Twins. Digital Twins are expected to have a significant impact on science, engineering, and society. For instance, it is anticipated that they will lead to new developments in identifying weaknesses in structures such as bridges, nuclear plants, and wind turbines. Digital Twins of human organs have the potential to lead to cures of diseases that have long eluded researchers.  The variety of topics to be discussed in the meeting such as stochastic optimization, modeling, partial differential equations, and risk averse optimization are also of much wider interest beyond Digital Twins. The meeting will also provide a unique opportunity for graduate students, postdocs and other early career scientists to take courses from two leading researchers in modeling, optimization, and scientific computing. <br/><br/>ECOM speakers and participants will study the key question of how to best utilize optimization to combine physics-based and data-driven models. This approach, when carried out for the entire complex physical system, for its lifetime, can be termed a ""Digital Twin."" One of the critical components of a Digital Twin, which distinguishes it from classical modeling, is the use of data over the entire lifetime of the physical system to update the Digital Twin. Subsequently, Digital Twins bring together several research areas in mathematics, including modeling, analysis, control, optimization, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. New algorithmic developments are expected in these areas and this workshop aims to dive deeper into the topics relevant to Digital Twins: optimization constrained by simulation, optimization under uncertainty, and inexact optimization algorithms. A particular focus of this workshop will be the identification and development of benchmark applications and software implementation. The tutorials and invited talks will focus on consequential problems and will discuss state-of-the-art optimization solvers to handle these problems. As a result, the attendees will be equipped to tackle a new set of challenging problems.

Numerical weather prediction and climate modeling are notable examples of such applications that rely on the computational solution of primitive equations, which are used to predict the behavior of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, ice, etc., as well as the complex interactions among them. Numerical solutions of such multiphysics problems remain a challenging task due to the presence of multiple time scales in the system where different processes take different amounts of time to complete. As such, developing advanced numerical methods capable of offering fast and reliable solutions is crucial for many applications that rely on large-scale simulations of complex systems. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel time integration methods for stiff and highly oscillatory systems and demonstrate their performance on applications such as numerical weather prediction, ocean modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, the project aims to train one doctoral student and offer opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics at Mississippi State University. Training of at least one graduate student on the topics of the proposed work is expected. <br/><br/>The project has four primary aims. First, the investigator will derive novel mixed exponential integrators and preconditioned rational exponential integrators for stiff systems and implement them. Second, the investigator will develop stiffly-accurate embedded multirate exponential methods for additively partitioned systems. Third, the investigator will develop stiffly-accurate exponential Nystrm methods. Fourth, the investigator will investigate the performance of the newly developed methods on applications in numerical weather prediction, ocean modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations. The investigator will build off of his previous expertise in constructing, analyzing, and implementing exponential and multirate time integration methods to achieve these aims. Ongoing collaborations with numerical analysts, meteorologists, and computer scientists will also contribute to the success of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
