The success of machine learning is dependent upon a sufficient amount of labeled data samples. A key limitation of most machine learning methods is their reliance on large labeled sets. Labeled data is scarce for many applications. Obtaining enough labeled data is often difficult because it is time-consuming and expensive, especially when experts are required for the labeling task. This project develops novel strategies for machines to effectively learn in limited labeled data scenarios. The foundation of the new strategies lies in data analysis and algorithm development and the project involves the training of graduate and undergraduate students in these areas through mentoring and curriculum development.  User-friendly software packages will be made available to the community to ensure the results from the project can be used by other researchers who use machine learning. <br/> <br/>To address the challenge of data with limited labeled samples, and to develop computationally tractable methods for machine learning tasks such as data classification, the PI will incorporate a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework. Specifically, one of the main advantages of semi-supervised learning is its ability to make use of the important information from the vastly available unlabeled data without the additional cost of external interaction; moreover, the graph-based framework provides information about the extent of similarity between the data elements and the overall structure of data. In particular, the proposed research encompasses the following three aims:  (1) development of graph-based similarity-driven auction dynamics learning methods (2) development of graph-based similarity-driven neural network methods (3) development of graph-based similarity-driven maximum-flow learning methods. Although all three aims involve developing graph-based approaches for learning tasks using semi-supervised techniques, each of the aims will formulate procedures with their own advantages. Overall, this proposal will develop computationally tractable semi-supervised graph-based methods for machine learning tasks that will require less labeled data for accurate predictions, which is crucial due to the scarcity of labeled data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NNs are a core component of modern AI models and are widely used in numerous applications across science, engineering, and industry. Training refers to a learning process of AI models. It is notoriously challenging due to the nonlinear and nonconvex nature of NNs. The state-of-the-art methods frequently fail to produce satisfactory results and exhibit unstable behaviors, limiting the accuracy and reliability of AI models. This project will develop effective training methods that significantly improve the training performance over the state-of-the-art, overcoming the current limitations. The broader impacts include creating educational opportunities for undergraduates through a summer research program, developing professional training for K-12 educators on computational mathematics for AI, and establishing public engagement through interactive demonstrations and online resources, all of which will broaden participation in computing and improve public understanding of the role of mathematics in AI.<br/><br/>The project develops a novel exploration-exploitation-determination (EED) framework for training neural networks that uniquely combines both local and nonlocal information. Four objectives are: (1) establishing the EED framework for two-layer neural networks by utilizing mathematical analysis of gradient flow dynamics and nonlocal effects; (2) developing a layer-wise training strategy for deep neural networks that sequentially trains each hidden layer; (3) extending the framework to handle noisy and corrupted data through l1-norm minimization; and (4) validating the methods through applications to scientific machine learning tasks including operator learning for PDEs and flow map learning for data-driven discovery of dynamical systems.

Conformal fractals are intricate geometric objects generated via iterated schemes of conformal (angle-preserving) transformations, and they have numerous interdisciplinary applications in mathematical physics, computer graphics, and data science. Measuring the size of conformal fractal attractors has been one of the central themes in the evolution of modern dynamical systems. One of the most well-known ways for measuring such complex geometric objects is the concept of Hausdorff dimension, which provides a robust way of determining the roughness of a set, extending the idea of dimension beyond integer values. The Hausdorff dimension of conformal fractals cannot be derived via simple analytic closed formulas, and obtaining effective and rigorous estimates becomes a challenging computational problem. The scope of this project is to introduce new methods from numerical partial differential equations with the scope of developing versatile, rigorous, and efficient methods for computing the Hausdorff dimensions of various conformal attractors.<br/><br/>The project's topic is naturally interdisciplinary, encompassing a wide range of problems across Real and Complex Analysis, Dynamical Systems, Numerical Analysis, and Large-Scale Computations. The goal is to derive accurate and rigorous Hausdorff dimension estimates for a broad class of conformal fractals by integrating techniques from finite element methods, dynamical systems, and fractal geometry. Finite element analysis is a well-established approach for approximating solutions to a wide range of partial differential equations, with numerous refined methods developed over the years to ensure accurate and reliable numerical results. In contrast, the field of rigorous computation of Hausdorff dimensions for conformal limit sets is still in its infancy. The primary innovation of this project lies in adapting numerical methods typically used for solving PDEs to the estimation of Hausdorff dimensions. This new methodology demands deep analytical foundations and the development of novel theoretical results, presenting significant challenges, especially within the broader context of conformal graph-directed Markov systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, it is well-known that the fluid drag on particles in dead-end channels is greater than in free space. This is relevant in many applications, including biological fluids such as blood, in which the suspended red blood cells and platelets become non-uniformly distributed in the bloodstream as a result of boundary interactions. However, confined suspensions are challenging to simulate because of their multiscale nature and the difficulty of resolving the thin films that may develop between particles and boundaries.

The goal is to study the fluid dynamics of suspensions in confined geometries and accelerate simulations of these phenomena.<br/><br/>To achieve the project goals, a hierarchy of mathematical models and numerical methods will be developed. Simulations of fluid-structure interaction will be performed to explicitly capture the wall-induced migration of elastic objects away from walls, and these will be used to parameterize a reduced model of elastic deformations and corresponding lift coefficients. In addition, the classical Oldroyd-B model of non-Newtonian fluids will be revisited to incorporate the effect of a heterogeneous particle distribution near boundaries, and the method of images will be applied to extend the Stokeslet solution to the case of dead-end geometries. Taken together, these projects will provide a set of practical numerical and analytical tools to study the behavior of suspensions in the presence of boundaries. As broader outcomes, the results from this work will be integrated into course materials, and open-source implementations of the resulting computational methods will be released to make them widely accessible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are intended to complement existing particle-in-cell approaches for collisionless plasmas and to offer improvements in scalability and stability for collisional plasma simulations. The second objective is to design reduced-order methods for optimization problems constrained by kinetic equations. This will involve leveraging the multiscale nature of the equations or employing intelligent use of randomness.

However, accurately and efficiently simulating these equations remains a major challenge due to their complexity and sensitivity, which demand a careful balance of precision and speed, along with the use of stable numerical schemes to ensure reliable results. This project develops robust and efficient numerical algorithms for solving wave equations, optimized for high performance on both current and next-generation computing platforms. These computational tools will advance foundational research and have wide-ranging applications in areas where accurate wave prediction is critical. Beyond technical innovation, the project supports the development of a skilled scientific workforce by training graduate researchers and engaging students through reading groups and seminars. These educational initiatives promote participation in computational mathematics and contribute to the nation's continued leadership in science, engineering, and technological innovation.<br/><br/>The main computational challenges associated with nonlinear second-order wave equations stem from their rich and intricate range of behaviors. These equations can exhibit solitary waves, solitons, finite-time blow-ups, singularities, and rapid oscillations.  These equations, often derived from Euler?Lagrange equations, carry intrinsic geometric and energetic structures that critically shape their dynamics.  Standard numerical approaches typically reformulate them into first-order systems, which increase computational cost and potentially compromise key physical properties.  Building on the investigator?s prior success with numerical methods for (semi-)linear second-order wave problems, this project aims to address these challenges.  The goal is to design numerical schemes specifically tailored to the nonlinear second-order formulation, emphasizing stability, high accuracy, computational efficiency, and fidelity to the underlying physics.  In particular, the research will focus on constructing fully discrete, structure-preserving energy discontinuous Galerkin methods and applying them to complex physical systems, such as geometric wave models and coupled first- and second-order hyperbolic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) aims to develop new techniques based on topology and other disciplines in pure mathematics to understand complex data. Research questions are strongly motivated by applications from neuroscience, image recognition, biology, material science, geography, and beyond. The underlying idea is that topology helps recognize patterns within data and, therefore, turn data into compressed, useful knowledge. Besides advancing the progress of science by helping to prepare the next generation of applied topologists, this school is also designed to expand the reach of applied topology.<br/><br/>The topic of the school is the study of general techniques to achieve stability of invariants in TDA that can be applied to different objects, from persistence modules to Reeb graphs. In particular, the focus is on questions about the stability of various TDA tools: 1) Which metrics can be introduced to ensure the stability of traditional topological invariants? 2) Which invariants can be developed to ensure stability with respect to traditional metrics? Through questions like these, TDA enriches the traditional fields of algebraic topology and geometry while at the same time striving for theoretical guarantees for practitioners in data analysis. There will be three lecturers alternating in the mornings, an introductory poster section, problem sessions in the afternoons, and a few short research talks from the participants. Ultimately, the school?s goal is to encourage students to develop their own application-motivated results in TDA by considering well-established principled strategies.

Many real-world data sets, such as genetic information or molecular images, contain hidden structures that can be uncovered using geometric methods. Leveraging these hidden structures can decrease the computational resources needed to analyze large data sets and can also provide scientific insight regarding various biological and physical processes. The goal of this project is to harness the full power of geometric methods for modern machine learning by the design of innovative solutions to the critical challenges facing the field. The project will focus on developing methods that can handle noisy data and tools for data visualization that preserve important geometric details. In addition to its scientific goals, the project will have a broad impact by offering new educational programs to support student mental health, increase diversity in data science, and encourage underrepresented groups to engage in this field. By addressing both technical and social challenges, the project aims to create more reliable, scalable tools for data analysis while promoting inclusion and innovation in science and education.  <br/><br/>In many applications, real data often concentrates around low-dimensional structures or manifolds, and manifold learning algorithms are a powerful tool for uncovering this low-dimensional structure. The project is on manifold learning algorithms, tackling the key challenges facing the field, including how noise affects algorithm performance, how to preserve both local and global geometric details, and how to effectively handle complex collections of manifolds. This research will investigate best practices for denoising, analyze how noise impacts spectral manifold learning algorithms, and clarify the regime in which algorithms can reliably recover manifold structure. The project will develop novel algorithms that utilize diffusion to faithfully encode geometric information at various scales and also hybrid methods for geometric regularization of manifold learning algorithms. Since real data often fails to concentrate around a single manifold, this work will contribute a robust and scalable solution for clustering collections of manifolds via a novel angle-based path metric on simplices, so that manifold learning algorithms can be applied under less restrictive assumptions. In addition, since data often contains numerous irrelevant features and features measured on very different scales, the project aims to develop a probabilistic framework for learning and adjusting features according to their actual relevance. Overall, the goal is to design a comprehensive data analysis pipeline that is noise-robust and capable of balancing local and global geometric information to represent data in just a few dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve these goals, scientists and engineers often build digital twins---computer models that emulate and interact with the underlying physical systems. The current project describes fundamental research into the generalization ability of digital twins: to what degree can digital twins predict outcomes under conditions they have not previously encountered? For example, if the digital twin for an airplane has only seen data collected under normal operating conditions, can it accurately predict the plane's response to turbulence? By combining mathematical tools from nonlinear dynamics and computational tools from machine learning, this project aims to develop fundamental theories on generalization and build robust digital twins that can perform well in extreme or unexpected conditions. While the proposed framework applies to a broad class of complex systems, it is first being applied to circadian rhythms, which are the internal timekeeping mechanisms of the human body. Human biological clocks are increasingly subject to disturbances introduced by modern lifestyles such as long-haul air travel and nighttime computer use. Predictive digital twins can give personalized recommendations on effective interventions, such as optimal strategies to speed up recovery from jet lags. The project will also provide opportunities to teach modern mathematical concepts to a diverse population of undergraduate and graduate students. Through this project, students learn valuable skills in mathematical modeling, data analysis, science communication, and gain first-hand experience in building and managing state-of-the-art machine learning pipelines.<br/><br/>Current domain-agnostic digital twins based on deep neural networks are very expressive but can struggle when generalizing beyond their training conditions. Physics-based digital twins, on the other hand, generalize better to unseen conditions thanks to the strong inductive bias built into the model. On the other hand, they are often not sufficiently flexible to fully capture the rich dynamics in data. This project develops a new class of hybrid digital twins with tunable physics-based and domain-agnostic components, allowing practitioners to balance expressivity versus generalization, depending on the available data and the nature of the task. Utilizing concepts such as basins of attraction in multistable dynamical systems, a key objective of the project is to quantify how the generalization ability of the digital twin changes as the weights assigned to the two components are adjusted. In particular, the project explores the possibility that a properly weighted domain-agnostic component in the hybrid digital twin can sometimes improve out-of-distribution generalization, especially when the inductive bias provided by the physics-based component is imperfect. Digital twins that generalize to unseen conditions are crucial to applications such as finding optimal interventions for restoring disrupted circadian rhythms.

The goal of ECOM is to introduce students and early-career researchers to current trends in optimization as well as to provide a strong networking environment between academia, industry, and the national laboratories. The focus of this fifth meeting will be on the role of optimization for Digital Twins. Digital Twins are expected to have a significant impact on science, engineering, and society. For instance, it is anticipated that they will lead to new developments in identifying weaknesses in structures such as bridges, nuclear plants, and wind turbines. Digital Twins of human organs have the potential to lead to cures of diseases that have long eluded researchers.  The variety of topics to be discussed in the meeting such as stochastic optimization, modeling, partial differential equations, and risk averse optimization are also of much wider interest beyond Digital Twins. The meeting will also provide a unique opportunity for graduate students, postdocs and other early career scientists to take courses from two leading researchers in modeling, optimization, and scientific computing. <br/><br/>ECOM speakers and participants will study the key question of how to best utilize optimization to combine physics-based and data-driven models. This approach, when carried out for the entire complex physical system, for its lifetime, can be termed a ""Digital Twin."" One of the critical components of a Digital Twin, which distinguishes it from classical modeling, is the use of data over the entire lifetime of the physical system to update the Digital Twin. Subsequently, Digital Twins bring together several research areas in mathematics, including modeling, analysis, control, optimization, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. New algorithmic developments are expected in these areas and this workshop aims to dive deeper into the topics relevant to Digital Twins: optimization constrained by simulation, optimization under uncertainty, and inexact optimization algorithms. A particular focus of this workshop will be the identification and development of benchmark applications and software implementation. The tutorials and invited talks will focus on consequential problems and will discuss state-of-the-art optimization solvers to handle these problems. As a result, the attendees will be equipped to tackle a new set of challenging problems.

Numerical weather prediction and climate modeling are notable examples of such applications that rely on the computational solution of primitive equations, which are used to predict the behavior of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, ice, etc., as well as the complex interactions among them. Numerical solutions of such multiphysics problems remain a challenging task due to the presence of multiple time scales in the system where different processes take different amounts of time to complete. As such, developing advanced numerical methods capable of offering fast and reliable solutions is crucial for many applications that rely on large-scale simulations of complex systems. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel time integration methods for stiff and highly oscillatory systems and demonstrate their performance on applications such as numerical weather prediction, ocean modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, the project aims to train one doctoral student and offer opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics at Mississippi State University. Training of at least one graduate student on the topics of the proposed work is expected. <br/><br/>The project has four primary aims. First, the investigator will derive novel mixed exponential integrators and preconditioned rational exponential integrators for stiff systems and implement them. Second, the investigator will develop stiffly-accurate embedded multirate exponential methods for additively partitioned systems. Third, the investigator will develop stiffly-accurate exponential Nystrm methods. Fourth, the investigator will investigate the performance of the newly developed methods on applications in numerical weather prediction, ocean modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations. The investigator will build off of his previous expertise in constructing, analyzing, and implementing exponential and multirate time integration methods to achieve these aims.
