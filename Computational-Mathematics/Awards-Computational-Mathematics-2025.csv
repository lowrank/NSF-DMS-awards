The incredible growth in size and complexity of data sets commonly analyzed has made it imperative to have randomized computational techniques that are robust to adversarial error, incorporate or are adaptable to natural problem constraints, and can be applied in settings in which both the number and dimension of data are massive.  This project additionally provides opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge research, and supports creation of materials for an advanced undergraduate-level modern numerical linear algebra course to be used at Harvey Mudd College (HMC) and beyond.  This course will feature significant curricular research projects which align with the technical directions identified in this project; descriptions of potential course project topics will be released with the public course materials.  The project will additionally provide vertically-integrated mentorship opportunities for visiting graduate students, HMC undergraduates, and high school students through HMC?s federally funded Upward Bound (UB) program.  Finally, the project will support an annual professional development workshop for early career participants interested in research mentorship at primarily undergraduate institutions.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this CAREER project is the development and analysis of a suite of randomized iterative methods for problems with devastating adversarial corruption, problem constraints, and extremely large data dimension.  The project will focus specifically on three main research thrusts: (1) Developing and analyzing corruption-robust variants of randomized iterative methods in numerical linear algebra for least-squares regression, and generalizing these analyses to first-order methods in numerical optimization for a more general class of convex optimization problems. (2) Analyzing the iterative behavior of common combinatorial and numerical iterative methods for randomly sketched and subsampled regression problems with nonnegative and related constraints, and using these analyses to develop efficient randomized iterative methods for such problems.  (3) Extending the application of randomized iterative methods to problems in which both the number and size of data may be massive by developing provably effective randomly compressed and sparsified iterative updates. Open-source software implementations of the developed and analyzed methods will accompany the work completed under each of the above thrusts.  Additionally, this work will be distributed both in formal peer-reviewed journal and conference submissions, and in educational resources for students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many real-world data sets, such as genetic information or molecular images, contain hidden structures that can be uncovered using geometric methods. Leveraging these hidden structures can decrease the computational resources needed to analyze large data sets and can also provide scientific insight regarding various biological and physical processes. The goal of this project is to harness the full power of geometric methods for modern machine learning by the design of innovative solutions to the critical challenges facing the field. The project will focus on developing methods that can handle noisy data and tools for data visualization that preserve important geometric details. In addition to its scientific goals, the project will have a broad impact by offering new educational programs to support student mental health, increase diversity in data science, and encourage underrepresented groups to engage in this field. By addressing both technical and social challenges, the project aims to create more reliable, scalable tools for data analysis while promoting inclusion and innovation in science and education.  <br/><br/>In many applications, real data often concentrates around low-dimensional structures or manifolds, and manifold learning algorithms are a powerful tool for uncovering this low-dimensional structure. The project is on manifold learning algorithms, tackling the key challenges facing the field, including how noise affects algorithm performance, how to preserve both local and global geometric details, and how to effectively handle complex collections of manifolds. This research will investigate best practices for denoising, analyze how noise impacts spectral manifold learning algorithms, and clarify the regime in which algorithms can reliably recover manifold structure. The project will develop novel algorithms that utilize diffusion to faithfully encode geometric information at various scales and also hybrid methods for geometric regularization of manifold learning algorithms. Since real data often fails to concentrate around a single manifold, this work will contribute a robust and scalable solution for clustering collections of manifolds via a novel angle-based path metric on simplices, so that manifold learning algorithms can be applied under less restrictive assumptions. In addition, since data often contains numerous irrelevant features and features measured on very different scales, the project aims to develop a probabilistic framework for learning and adjusting features according to their actual relevance. Overall, the goal is to design a comprehensive data analysis pipeline that is noise-robust and capable of balancing local and global geometric information to represent data in just a few dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, if the digital twin for an airplane has only seen data collected under normal operating conditions, can it accurately predict the plane's response to turbulence? By combining mathematical tools from nonlinear dynamics and computational tools from machine learning, this project aims to develop fundamental theories on generalization and build robust digital twins that can perform well in extreme or unexpected conditions.

The goal of ECOM is to introduce students and early-career researchers to current trends in optimization as well as to provide a strong networking environment between academia, industry, and the national laboratories. The focus of this fifth meeting will be on the role of optimization for Digital Twins. Digital Twins are expected to have a significant impact on science, engineering, and society. For instance, it is anticipated that they will lead to new developments in identifying weaknesses in structures such as bridges, nuclear plants, and wind turbines. Digital Twins of human organs have the potential to lead to cures of diseases that have long eluded researchers.  The variety of topics to be discussed in the meeting such as stochastic optimization, modeling, partial differential equations, and risk averse optimization are also of much wider interest beyond Digital Twins. The meeting will also provide a unique opportunity for graduate students, postdocs and other early career scientists to take courses from two leading researchers in modeling, optimization, and scientific computing. <br/><br/>ECOM speakers and participants will study the key question of how to best utilize optimization to combine physics-based and data-driven models. This approach, when carried out for the entire complex physical system, for its lifetime, can be termed a ""Digital Twin."" One of the critical components of a Digital Twin, which distinguishes it from classical modeling, is the use of data over the entire lifetime of the physical system to update the Digital Twin. Subsequently, Digital Twins bring together several research areas in mathematics, including modeling, analysis, control, optimization, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. New algorithmic developments are expected in these areas and this workshop aims to dive deeper into the topics relevant to Digital Twins: optimization constrained by simulation, optimization under uncertainty, and inexact optimization algorithms. A particular focus of this workshop will be the identification and development of benchmark applications and software implementation. The tutorials and invited talks will focus on consequential problems and will discuss state-of-the-art optimization solvers to handle these problems. As a result, the attendees will be equipped to tackle a new set of challenging problems.

In particular, Digital Twins play a fundamental role in designing, managing and optimizing 5G wireless networks and will be essential in enabling next-generation 6G wireless networks. Despite recent advances in realistic channel modeling, there are still many fundamental challenges in developing fit-for-purpose Digital Twins for next generation wireless networks that can seamlessly integrate data for informed decision making, and can be dynamically updated as the physical environment varies and network operational objectives change. Motivated by these challenges, the team of investigators develops novel mathematical theories, and new data-driven, AI-guided models and algorithms that will lay the mathematical foundations for digital twinning of next generation wireless networks. The award also supports undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in research and educational activities as well as organization of K-12 outreach programs.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to advance the mathematical foundations of next generation wireless network Digital Twins. The investigators will place the ray tracing problem?essential to such digital twins?in the more general framework of first order Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and will make theoretical and algorithmic advances in data-driven learning of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The research team will prove optimal sample size complexity bounds for learning Hamilton-Jacobi equations and their solutions from data, and develop algorithms for achieving these bounds, in both the static and active learning settings. They will develop a temporal surface reconstruction algorithm that combines temporal LiDAR and video camera information by leveraging neural kernels and transport equations. In order to quantify the uncertainty in their results, the investigators will establish posterior contraction rates for learning Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and develop methods to construct and analyze Bayesian credible sets and perform scalable posterior sampling. Finally, the investigators will integrate their theoretical and algorithmic advances into a next generation wireless network Digital Twin platform that will be evaluated in both controlled and dynamic real-world environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RDCs operate through the injection of an air-fuel mixture which is detonated through a reactive shock wave rotating at supersonic speeds and fed through the mixer to cool and slow the flow before it reaches a turbine which ultimately harnesses the energy.  RDC-mixers hold great promise to revolutionize power and propulsion systems, but they are difficult to model/optimize due to unsteady mixing, extreme temperatures, and high-speed diffusion.  This collaborative project aims to develop models and methodologies that enable optimization of the RDC-mixer for maximal fuel efficiency.  The investigators will leverage a three-pronged meta-modeling framework featuring an innovative digital twin, a novel statistical surrogate model, and a physical experiment involving a high speed wind tunnel in which the mixer will be assessed through high-frequency optical and probe-based measurement techniques.  RDC-mixer-turbine systems are directly impactful to clean energy and heat production, but their potential impact is even broader. Diffusing elements and mixers are used in a variety of applications, ranging from aviation, aerospace, agriculture, refrigeration cycles and heat exchangers. The mathematical modeling foundations developed in this project will be widely applicable to computer simulation experiments and digital twins. <br/><br/>This project is organized into three aims. First, motivated by the complexities of the digital twin, a gradient-enhanced Bayesian deep Gaussian process surrogate will be developed to provide non-stationary flexibility, uncertainty quantification, gradient-enhancement for improved accuracy, and gradient predictions to facilitate Bayesian optimization.  Second, the digital twin of the RDC-mixer will be developed at reduced computational costs as existing simulations of RDC-mixers require weeks of compute time.  Tailored unsteady boundary conditions are proposed to separate the computational fluid dynamic simulations for the combustor and mixer, which will enable faster computation.  The digital twin will incorporate steady and unsteady flows, meshing, and adjoint solvers to provide gradient information at minimal cost.  Third, a novel calibrated Bayesian optimization framework will be developed to first optimize calibration parameters of the digital twin, then use these with a bias-correction model to sequentially optimize the physical experiment. The physical model will be used in the calibration feedback loop to train the bias-correction model and to test and validate the best designs.  Collectively, the surrogate model, digital twin, and physical experiment will enable effective optimization of the RDC-mixer design for optimal fuel efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
