The incredible growth in size and complexity of data sets commonly analyzed has made it imperative to have randomized computational techniques that are robust to adversarial error, incorporate or are adaptable to natural problem constraints, and can be applied in settings in which both the number and dimension of data are massive.  This project additionally provides opportunities for students to engage in cutting-edge research, and supports creation of materials for an advanced undergraduate-level modern numerical linear algebra course to be used at Harvey Mudd College (HMC) and beyond.  This course will feature significant curricular research projects which align with the technical directions identified in this project; descriptions of potential course project topics will be released with the public course materials.  The project will additionally provide vertically-integrated mentorship opportunities for visiting graduate students, HMC undergraduates, and high school students through HMC?s federally funded Upward Bound (UB) program.  Finally, the project will support an annual professional development workshop for early career participants interested in research mentorship at primarily undergraduate institutions.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this CAREER project is the development and analysis of a suite of randomized iterative methods for problems with devastating adversarial corruption, problem constraints, and extremely large data dimension.  The project will focus specifically on three main research thrusts: (1) Developing and analyzing corruption-robust variants of randomized iterative methods in numerical linear algebra for least-squares regression, and generalizing these analyses to first-order methods in numerical optimization for a more general class of convex optimization problems. (2) Analyzing the iterative behavior of common combinatorial and numerical iterative methods for randomly sketched and subsampled regression problems with nonnegative and related constraints, and using these analyses to develop efficient randomized iterative methods for such problems.  (3) Extending the application of randomized iterative methods to problems in which both the number and size of data may be massive by developing provably effective randomly compressed and sparsified iterative updates. Open-source software implementations of the developed and analyzed methods will accompany the work completed under each of the above thrusts.  Additionally, this work will be distributed both in formal peer-reviewed journal and conference submissions, and in educational resources for students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many real-world data sets, such as genetic information or molecular images, contain hidden structures that can be uncovered using geometric methods. Leveraging these hidden structures can decrease the computational resources needed to analyze large data sets and can also provide scientific insight regarding various biological and physical processes. The goal of this project is to harness the full power of geometric methods for modern machine learning by the design of innovative solutions to the critical challenges facing the field. The project will focus on developing methods that can handle noisy data and tools for data visualization that preserve important geometric details. In addition to its scientific goals, the project will have a broad impact by offering new educational programs to support student mental health, increase diversity in data science, and encourage underrepresented groups to engage in this field. By addressing both technical and social challenges, the project aims to create more reliable, scalable tools for data analysis while promoting inclusion and innovation in science and education.  <br/><br/>In many applications, real data often concentrates around low-dimensional structures or manifolds, and manifold learning algorithms are a powerful tool for uncovering this low-dimensional structure. The project is on manifold learning algorithms, tackling the key challenges facing the field, including how noise affects algorithm performance, how to preserve both local and global geometric details, and how to effectively handle complex collections of manifolds. This research will investigate best practices for denoising, analyze how noise impacts spectral manifold learning algorithms, and clarify the regime in which algorithms can reliably recover manifold structure. The project will develop novel algorithms that utilize diffusion to faithfully encode geometric information at various scales and also hybrid methods for geometric regularization of manifold learning algorithms. Since real data often fails to concentrate around a single manifold, this work will contribute a robust and scalable solution for clustering collections of manifolds via a novel angle-based path metric on simplices, so that manifold learning algorithms can be applied under less restrictive assumptions. In addition, since data often contains numerous irrelevant features and features measured on very different scales, the project aims to develop a probabilistic framework for learning and adjusting features according to their actual relevance. Overall, the goal is to design a comprehensive data analysis pipeline that is noise-robust and capable of balancing local and global geometric information to represent data in just a few dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To achieve these goals, scientists and engineers often build digital twins---computer models that emulate and interact with the underlying physical systems. The current project describes fundamental research into the generalization ability of digital twins: to what degree can digital twins predict outcomes under conditions they have not previously encountered? For example, if the digital twin for an airplane has only seen data collected under normal operating conditions, can it accurately predict the plane's response to turbulence? By combining mathematical tools from nonlinear dynamics and computational tools from machine learning, this project aims to develop fundamental theories on generalization and build robust digital twins that can perform well in extreme or unexpected conditions. While the proposed framework applies to a broad class of complex systems, it is first being applied to circadian rhythms, which are the internal timekeeping mechanisms of the human body. Human biological clocks are increasingly subject to disturbances introduced by modern lifestyles such as long-haul air travel and nighttime computer use. Predictive digital twins can give personalized recommendations on effective interventions, such as optimal strategies to speed up recovery from jet lags. The project will also provide opportunities to teach modern mathematical concepts to a diverse population of undergraduate and graduate students.

Physics-based digital twins, on the other hand, generalize better to unseen conditions thanks to the strong inductive bias built into the model.

This project develops a new class of hybrid digital twins with tunable physics-based and domain-agnostic components, allowing practitioners to balance expressivity versus generalization, depending on the available data and the nature of the task. Utilizing concepts such as basins of attraction in multistable dynamical systems, a key objective of the project is to quantify how the generalization ability of the digital twin changes as the weights assigned to the two components are adjusted. In particular, the project explores the possibility that a properly weighted domain-agnostic component in the hybrid digital twin can sometimes improve out-of-distribution generalization, especially when the inductive bias provided by the physics-based component is imperfect. Digital twins that generalize to unseen conditions are crucial to applications such as finding optimal interventions for restoring disrupted circadian rhythms. For example, to find optimal strategies to speed up recovery from jet lags, a digital twin needs to predict the dynamics of a severely perturbed circadian clock based on data gathered mostly from normally operating clocks.

The focus of this fifth meeting will be on the role of optimization for Digital Twins. Digital Twins are expected to have a significant impact on science, engineering, and society. For instance, it is anticipated that they will lead to new developments in identifying weaknesses in structures such as bridges, nuclear plants, and wind turbines. Digital Twins of human organs have the potential to lead to cures of diseases that have long eluded researchers.  The variety of topics to be discussed in the meeting such as stochastic optimization, modeling, partial differential equations, and risk averse optimization are also of much wider interest beyond Digital Twins. The meeting will also provide a unique opportunity for graduate students, postdocs and other early career scientists to take courses from two leading researchers in modeling, optimization, and scientific computing. <br/><br/>ECOM speakers and participants will study the key question of how to best utilize optimization to combine physics-based and data-driven models. This approach, when carried out for the entire complex physical system, for its lifetime, can be termed a ""Digital Twin."" One of the critical components of a Digital Twin, which distinguishes it from classical modeling, is the use of data over the entire lifetime of the physical system to update the Digital Twin. Subsequently, Digital Twins bring together several research areas in mathematics, including modeling, analysis, control, optimization, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. New algorithmic developments are expected in these areas and this workshop aims to dive deeper into the topics relevant to Digital Twins: optimization constrained by simulation, optimization under uncertainty, and inexact optimization algorithms. A particular focus of this workshop will be the identification and development of benchmark applications and software implementation. The tutorials and invited talks will focus on consequential problems and will discuss state-of-the-art optimization solvers to handle these problems. As a result, the attendees will be equipped to tackle a new set of challenging problems.

RDCs operate through the injection of an air-fuel mixture which is detonated through a reactive shock wave rotating at supersonic speeds and fed through the mixer to cool and slow the flow before it reaches a turbine which ultimately harnesses the energy.  RDC-mixers hold great promise to revolutionize power and propulsion systems, but they are difficult to model/optimize due to unsteady mixing, extreme temperatures, and high-speed diffusion.  This collaborative project aims to develop models and methodologies that enable optimization of the RDC-mixer for maximal fuel efficiency.  The investigators will leverage a three-pronged meta-modeling framework featuring an innovative digital twin, a novel statistical surrogate model, and a physical experiment involving a high speed wind tunnel in which the mixer will be assessed through high-frequency optical and probe-based measurement techniques.  RDC-mixer-turbine systems are directly impactful to clean energy and heat production, but their potential impact is even broader. Diffusing elements and mixers are used in a variety of applications, ranging from aviation, aerospace, agriculture, refrigeration cycles and heat exchangers. The mathematical modeling foundations developed in this project will be widely applicable to computer simulation experiments and digital twins. <br/><br/>This project is organized into three aims. First, motivated by the complexities of the digital twin, a gradient-enhanced Bayesian deep Gaussian process surrogate will be developed to provide non-stationary flexibility, uncertainty quantification, gradient-enhancement for improved accuracy, and gradient predictions to facilitate Bayesian optimization.  Second, the digital twin of the RDC-mixer will be developed at reduced computational costs as existing simulations of RDC-mixers require weeks of compute time.  Tailored unsteady boundary conditions are proposed to separate the computational fluid dynamic simulations for the combustor and mixer, which will enable faster computation.  The digital twin will incorporate steady and unsteady flows, meshing, and adjoint solvers to provide gradient information at minimal cost.  Third, a novel calibrated Bayesian optimization framework will be developed to first optimize calibration parameters of the digital twin, then use these with a bias-correction model to sequentially optimize the physical experiment. The physical model will be used in the calibration feedback loop to train the bias-correction model and to test and validate the best designs.  Collectively, the surrogate model, digital twin, and physical experiment will enable effective optimization of the RDC-mixer design for optimal fuel efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
