Such algorithms are faster<br/>than the traditional methods of computational algebra by a factor<br/>exponential in the dimension, but have so far been discovered<br/>only in various isolated contexts.  So a unified algorithmic<br/>approach has a broad impact.  Furthermore, the underlying<br/>approach takes numerical conditioning into account from the<br/>outset, thus providing algorithms that are certifiably precise<br/>even when applied to approximate data.  Another novelty is that<br/>the underlying theory applies in the even broader arena of real<br/>and p-adic analytic functions.  The algorithmic aspects of p-adic<br/>analytic functions are almost completely unexplored, so a<br/>secondary focus of this project is to elaborate and apply this<br/>new theory to equation-solving over finite fields and motivic<br/>integration.<br/>     The investigator combines advanced techniques from numerical<br/>analysis and algebraic geometry to provide a new approach to a<br/>fundamental problem occuring in many applications: solving<br/>analytic inequalities.  For example, finding the optimal<br/>allocation of resources in a large organization (e.g., an army,<br/>an airline, or a large business) has long been known to reduce to<br/>solving linear inequalities.  From a different direction, it is<br/>known that the complexity of certain neural net architectures<br/>(which are useful in training automated bomb-sniffers and pattern<br/>recognition systems) depends critically on understanding the<br/>solutions of nonlinear polynomial inequalities.  Both these<br/>examples are special cases of analytic inequalities, and this<br/>project provides new algorithms for their solution that are<br/>magnitudes faster than current algorithms.  Furthermore, these<br/>new algorithms provide certifiably precise solutions --- a<br/>feature which is especially important when facing uncertain<br/>physical data.  Another novel aspect is the principal<br/>investigator's recent discovery that the underlying techniques<br/>apply to an even broader context, which can provide new solutions<br/>to many problems in the design of cryptosystems."

The same holds for normal linear operators, except that now the spectrum may include more than just the eigenvalues.  This statement does not hold for nonnormal matrices and linear operators, and there is considerable interest in identifying sets in the complex plane that can be associated with nonnormal operators to provide the sort of information that the spectrum provides in the normal case.  The goal of this project is to  identify such sets and determine their geometrical properties, to find efficient ways to compute or approximate these sets, and to apply them to some interesting problems in applied mathematics. <br/><br/>Eigenvalues explain the asymptotic behavior of many different systems: from hydrodynamic stability to the behavior of finite difference chemes and iterative linear system solvers to the Markov chain modeling of probabilistic events.  Eigenvalues do not explain the transient behavior of these systems, however, and it is this transient behavior that is often most important.  In this work we attempt to provide the tools necessary to understand and predict this transient behavior.

Both analytic and computational means will be used to analyze the effective properties of such materials in many spatial dimensions and time.  Analytically, by applying homogenization to the relevant hyperbolic systems with spatio-temporally varying senior coefficients, attainable bounds will be specified for the effective parameters of the binary mixtures of isotropic dielectrics in the framework of Maxwell's theory.  Computationally, a direct numerical simulation of the original equations will be used to better understand the physics of wave propagation through heterogeneous media with complex microstructure.  Together, both approaches will lead to a correct formulation and analysis of optimal material design in space time in response to a dynamic environment.<br/><br/>By allowing spatio-temporal variability in the material properties, it is possible to create effects that are unachievable through purely spatial design.  For example, by appropriately controlling the design factors of an elastic construction, i.e., its mass and stiffness, it is possible to selectively screen major parts of it from the invasion of destructive dynamic disturbances caused by impacts<br/>or other dynamic factors.  Disturbances can be purposefully guided into regions where their effect is less pernicious.  Another example is related to electromagnetic or acoustic waveguides.  To function properly, a conventional waveguide must have a certain minimum diameter relative to the wavelength of the signal.  If the waveguide is too narrow or the frequency of the waves is too low, then propagation will not be possible.  However, by allowing the material properties of the filling of the waveguide to vary both in space and in time, it will become possible to transmit waves of all frequencies.<br/>"

One main application is on the design of efficient discretization for nonmatching (either overlapping or nonoverlapping) grids.  The main idea of nonmatching grids is to divide a physical domain into a set of overlapping or nonoverlapping subregions which can accommodate smooth, simple, easily generated grids.  In this approach, a grid generation for complex geometries can be made simple, refinement grids can be added or removed without changing other grids, different equations/numerical methods may be used on different grids, efficient structured grid solvers may be used.  Furthermore, overlapping grids are well suited for parallelization and vectorization.  The proposed generalized finite element method based on partition of unity provides a general and powerful discretization framework for this type of grids.  Another major task is the development of a multigrid iterative method for solving the resulting algebraic systems for these new discretization schemes. As divide and conquer techniques, the proposed multiscale algorithms are suitable for parallel and high-performance computers.  <br/><br/>A class of new multiscale techniques are proposed to study for efficient numerical solution of partial differential equations. Multiscale methods in general are proven to be among the most powerful mathematical tools for the investigation of a broad range of models that are described by partial differential equations. Their pivotal role in the design of fast, reliable, and robust numerical methods for the solution of various problems places them among the most important research areas in the applied mathematics in the recent years. Since these methods are in some sense problem-independent, they are expected to have many important applications in science and engineering such as composite materials and subsurface flows in environmental applications.<br/><br/><br/>Date: May 28, 2002<br/>"

This method has found use in at least 15 different areas of mathematics, which includes solving linear equations and inequalities, signal analysis, and computed tomography. The main practical drawback of the MAP, at least for some applications, is its slow convergence. We will study rates of convergence for the MAP by extending the notion of ``angle'' between subspaces to that of more general convex sets, as well as determine means for accelerating the convergence of the MAP. In addition, we expect to show that the speed of convergence of the MAP is directly related to a property (the ``strong conical hull intersection'' property) of the convex sets in question that we have studied in several papers over the last 20 years. <br/><br/>The method of alternating projections is an algorithm for computing nearest points in certain sets by a repetitive application of the same few simple steps. Since the method has  applications to so many different areas of mathematics (one of the earliest being in medical imaging via X-rays), it is important to know how fast (i.e., how many steps) this algorithm needs to take before  the results give good accuracy of the exact solution. The ``rate of convergence'' of the algorithm deals with the question of how fast the algorithm is for any given problem. For those problems when the rate of convergence is slow, we will also study ways to  make the algorithm work faster by making appropriate modifications of certain steps in the algorithm.   <br/><br/><br/>Date: May 13, 2002<br/>"

They arise naturally as discretization of continuous models described by systems of partial differential equations and pose new numerical challenges. The problem matrix may be available only implicitly through a function that computes the corresponding vector-matrix product for a given vector, which thus calls for <br/>matrix-free eigenvalue solvers. The growth of the problem size often leads to badly conditioned problems, which require improved algorithm stability and new tools to estimate the accuracy of computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Classical eigenvalue solvers that do not scale linearly with the problem size are very expensive for modern practical problems. The focus of the present project is on an alternative technique, called preconditioning. While the mainstream research in the area introduces preconditioning for eigenvalue problems by using preconditioned inner iterations for solving linear systems with <br/>shift-and-invert matrices, the approach of the present project is to incorporate preconditioning directly into Krylov-based solvers such as the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The preconditioned iterative methods of this kind are specially designed for large-scale ill-conditioned matrix-free problems and can be effective and parallelizable. The investigator studies preconditioning for  singular values computations, an adaptation of the preconditioned eigensolvers to some problems with nonlinear dependence on the spectral parameter, and an efficient solution of eigenproblems resuling from partial differential equations with large jumps in coefficients.<br/>     The investigator develops fast, reliable methods to solve very large eigenvalue problems. Numerical simulations are performed on modern parallel computing systems, e.g., on a Beowulf cluster. The targeted applications for a joint investigation with engineers include structural dynamics finite element models associated with re-entry vehicles and their complex aerospace and electronic systems, and evolution of the error covariances in Kalman filter equations for chemistry-transport atmospheric models. <br/>"

Recent years have seen significative advances in the performance and robustness of iterative methods, prompted by the need to solve increasingly large systems of equations. The linear systems (and eigenvalue problems) arising from the discretization of partial differential equations in three space dimensions are too large for direct solution methods, and the only viable option is to use preconditioned Krylov subspace methods or, if applicable, multigrid-type methods. While robust and effective iterative solvers are available in the case of systems  involving symmetric positive definite matrices or M-matrices, much work remains to be done in the case of indefinite systems. A major part of the project consists in the development of algebraic preconditioners for symmetric indefinite matrices. The investigator develops both incomplete factorization methods and sparse approximate inverses. He makes use of techniques developed by the direct solvers community, like pivoting strategies of the Bunch-Kaufman and Bunch-Parlett type. Preliminary experiments on saddle-point and shifted linear systems are encouraging. He also explores multilevel variants of these preconditoners. Special methods targeted to so-called KKT-type systems are investigated. Other parts of the project deal with the construction of robust preconditioners for least-squares problems, and for singular linear systems arising from Markov chain calculations. The latter problem is currently of particular interest due to recent  applications in data mining. Specifically, the largest matrix problems currently being solved are the so-called ""Google Problems"", which amount to computing the stationary distribution vector of Markov chains with 2.7 billion states. Improvements in solution techniques have the potential of greatly affecting this important area.<br/>     Advances in many important fields of science and technlogy depend on progress in mathematical algorithms used in computer simulations. A recent example is provided by the emerging field of data mining. The well-known search engine ""Google"" (see http://www.google.com) relies on the solution of an extremely large, sparse matrix model; in technical terms, a stochastic matrix, or Markov chain. This amounts to finding the solution to a very large set of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. Part of this project deals with finding improved solution methods for problems of this type. More generally, the project aims to solve  challenging, large-scale problems in numerical linear algebra. The main goal is to develop efficient and robust algorithms, and related software, for solving difficult problems arising in various fields of  engineering and physical sciences. Some other areas that would benefit from this work include computational fluid dynamics, structural analysis, acoustics, electromagnetics, and optimal control. In all of these areas, computer simulations are of paramount importance and there is a strong need for reliable and efficient solution algorithms and software.  <br/>"

Achievement of these goals is expected to<br/>lead to deeper understanding of both the real climate and more complex<br/>mathematical models of it, such as general circulation models (GCMs).<br/><br/>The earth's climate system is notoriously complex.  Many different<br/>physical processes interact in a tangled web of feedbacks to produce the<br/>dynamic and variable climate we observe.  Unlike a laboratory science,<br/>meteorology and oceanography are hindered by the impossibility of<br/>controlled experiments which might allow the key mechanisms to be<br/>conclusively revealed.

It is therefore a grand<br/>scientific challenge to derive global climate  models which are reliable <br/>and trustworthy. Exploiting certain geophysical balances, such as <br/>geostrophic balance (due to earth rotation) or hydrostatic balance <br/>(due to the shallowness of the ocean and atmosphere) geophysicists derive<br/> reasonable, yet less complex, balanced models. It is therefore essential to <br/>justify rigorously the  validity of these models, for the relevant spatial<br/>and time scales. The focus  of the proposed project is on the analytical,<br/>statistical and numerical properties of solutions to nonlinear ocean <br/>dynamics models and turbulent sub-grid models. The first aspect of this <br/>project is to: show existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on <br/>initial data, to some of these reduced geophysical models. In particular, <br/>a two-layer zonal jet model, a planetary geostrophic ``thermocline'' model, <br/>the lake equations with degenerate varying bottom topography and the <br/>two-dimensional primitive equations. This is the first and the most essential <br/>step in validating the derivation of these  models. In order to justify the <br/>long-time behavior of fluid dynamical models, one has to compare the statistical <br/>properties of their attracting invariant sets, rather than compare individual<br/>solutions. To do so, it is necessary to focus on models which include some <br/>mechanism of dissipation. This project addresses questions related to the asymptotic <br/>derivation of these models and the effect of numerical dissipation on their <br/>solutions, which include boundary layer analysis. The second aspect of this<br/>project is to: derive new large-eddy simulation models, the so-called alpha-models, <br/>in the context  of the  two-layers geostrophic zonal jet models. The alpha-models <br/>are asserted to reproduce the right energy spectrum for a wide range  of large <br/>scales. It is proposed to investigate  this claim using rigorous analytical tools. <br/>It is also proposed to perform computational tests on the newly derived two-layers <br/>geostrophic zonal jet alpha-model to verify the above assertion. Furthermore, <br/>it is proposed to explore the implementation of the alpha-models approach as <br/>sub-grid models. <br/><br/>The grand challenge in climate prediction is that the mathematical equations <br/>governing the ocean and atmosphere dynamics, are too difficult to study <br/>analytically, and still prohibitively expensive computationally. Indeed, <br/>it is well established, based on physical grounds and collected experimental <br/>data, that atmospheric and oceanic turbulent flows involve a broad spectrum <br/>of spatial and time scales. This in turn  makes them inaccessible  to the most <br/>powerful  and state-of-the-art computers. However, due to the rotation of the <br/>earth and other geophysical situations, such as the shallowness of the oceans <br/>and the atmosphere - in the sense that they are much wider than they are deep - <br/>geophysicists take advantage of certain geophysical balances to derive simplified<br/>balanced models. The first theme of this project is to: establish existence <br/>and regularity of solutions to some of these nonlinear reduced models. This is<br/>a crucial step  in justifying the derivation  of these models and their<br/>consistency with the physical observations for the relevant length  and time <br/>scales. Furthermore, in global climate prediction one is interested in the <br/>long-time statistical features of the climate. The second theme of this project <br/>is to develop a systematic approach for deriving and studying  new averaged <br/>models, in the context of ocean and atmosphere dynamics, which are reliable in <br/>reproducing the correct long-term statistics."

A new a posteriori error estimation strategy, interpolation-error based error estimation, developed in one dimension will be extended to three dimensions. This strategy provides asymptotically exact estimates of the error not only for the current grid, but for a grid whose elements are one degree higher than the current one.  The estimates involve obtaining approximations of appropriate solution derivatives from the finite element solution and are thus, easy to compute.  They will enhance the reliability of hp-refinement codes.  The investigator will also improve efficiency through the development of new assembly and solution algorithms for large linear systems.  A new incomplete assembly algorithm that appears promising in a nonadaptive setting will be extended to an hp-adaptive code.  Incomplete assembly is analogous to incomplete factorization in that only a fixed number of nonzero entries are stored per row and a drop tolerance is used to discard small values.  A variable order-variable step implicit/explicit solver will be built.  A method for selecting a good initial guess for an approximate inverse preconditioner for time-dependent problems based on past history will be investigated. These strategies will be embedded in an hp-refinement code developed previously by the investigator and tested on a set of reaction-diffusion systems.<br/><br/>  Many important physical and biological processes can be modeled by elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, especially those of the reaction-diffusion type.  Some examples include pattern formation in chemical and biological systems, combustion and voltage propagation in the heart.  Solving such problems often involves significant computational resources, both time and storage, especially when the problems must be solved in three space dimensions. Adaptive methods have proven effective by automatically targeting these resources to areas where the solution must be enhanced while reducing the effort in areas where the solution is changing little. They also increase the reliability of the solution by basing resource allocation on appropriate estimation of the error.  The aim of this proposal is to significantly improve adaptive methods in two ways. First a new error estimation strategy will be developed that is cheaper and provides more information on which to base resource allocation, thereby increasing reliability.  The second involves the creation of several new methods to solve large systems of equations thus improving both time and storage efficiency.  This in turn, means that scientists and engineers will be able to explore more realistic models rather than deliberate over the finer details of numerical analysis.<br/>"

They will also study the direct numerical simulation of blood flow around three-leaflet prosthetic heart valves.

The resulting methodology has been successfully applied by the authors and other scientists and engineers to the solution of difficult problems from Sciences and Engineering. Among these problems are the direct simulation of sedimentation, fluidization and particle transport phenomena, which play an important role in various areas in Sciences and Engineering (Petroleum Engineering, Food Industry,...). The main goals of this project are to (1) improve the existing methodology so that it can address fluid/particle interaction for particles of relatively complicated shape, (2) develop realistic models and efficient methods for the computational treatment of the collisions taking place in fluid/particle interactions, (3) apply the resulting methodology to an important problem in cardio-vascular medicine namely, the simulation of blood flow/heart valve interaction and (4) simulate slurry transportation in horizontal pipelines and wells, an important issue in enhanced oil recovery. In the heart valve project, the goal is to use the simulation tool to design artificial heart valves generating much less thrombin (a natural blood thickener causing artery clotting) than the ones currently used, which require the patient to take blood thinning drugs which have in general health damaging side effects. The hope is that with an improved design the need for blood thinners will be substantially reduced if not eliminated.

Often, these sub-discretizations are independently modeled, or available from previously constructed meshes. Therefore, to support a flexible meshing procedure, it is crucial that an efficient method be employed to join these independently modeled sub-meshes. Recently, the principal investigator introduced, a non-conforming hp finite element technique to accomplish such coupling. The proposed research will systematically develop, improve and combine sophisticated non-conforming hp finite element methods with high performance computing, through the accomplishment of the following four objectives. First, the stability and convergence of these non-conforming techniques will be theoretically established and computationally validated in higher dimensions. Secondly, the robustness of such methods to concatenate domains of different dimensions will be investigated. Third, the performance of these methods will be analyzed for problems in fluid mechanics. Finally, <br/>the stability and convergence of a more general three-field technique will be investigated. Numerical results will be presented to validate the exponential convergence of these techniques both theoretically and computationally. <br/><br/>An ultimate goal of this research is to develop a flexible problem solving methodology tuned to high performance computing that allows a rigorous coupling of different physical processes, mathematical models, or discretization methods in different parts of a simulation domain. The successful integration of the proposed objectives will contribute to a common infrastructure that provides efficient computational support and parallel data-management for solving a wide variety of problems in science and engineering. The solution methodology to be developed will provide efficient and accurate solutions that will not only benefit various engineering fields such as aerospace, materials science, and bioengineering, but also aid in the process of designing better <br/>processes and products from aircraft to prosthetic implants.<br/><br/><br/>Date: June 6, 2002<br/>"

One important feature of the multigrid conference series is the use of tutorials.

The principal approach of numerical bifurcation analysis is based on continuation of  solutions to well-defined operator equations. Such computational results give a deeper  understanding of the solution behavior, stability, multiplicity, and bifurcations. This project is concerned with development of new algorithms and software for bifurcation analysis in large nonlinear systems and applications to MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS). Typical MEMS devices lead to multiscale-multiphysics problems. These devices include coupled mechanical, electrical, thermal and other parts. In addition to the bifurcations like beam buckling which involve a single type of physics, MEMS also exhibit bifurcations due to interactions between different energy domains. Bifurcations in MEMS play a variety of roles: (i) bifurcation as a failure mode (lead systems to fail), (ii) bifurcation as a design feature (i.e. bistable systems), (iii) bifurcations to extract material properties.<br/><br/>From the engine of an automobile to a hospital operating room, MicroElectroMechanical (MEMS) products are finding applications in every aspect of our lives at an increasing rate. SUGAR is a new system level simulation program in MATLAB for three-dimenisonal MEMS developed at the University of California Berkeley. It is already widely used in academia and industry and is currently under active development, which is a part of the revolution in the MEMS design. SUGAR will be made freely available in source and as a web service. New algorithms for bifurcation analysis in MEMS will be implemented in MATLAB, and then the resulting new code will be incorporated into a MATLAB continuation toolbox, developed at Universiteit Utrecht, to enhance its capabilities for bifurcation analysis of large systems. The upgraded MATLAB continuation toolbox will be integrated into SUGAR and will become a part of the MEMS design loop which includes design, simulation, fabrication, laboratory measurements, and comparison of simulation with measurements."

It will, for the first time, emphasize research and applications in the newly developing vast area of delay and Volterra partial differential and integral equations.  The subject of Volterra equations includes functional differential equations (delay, advanced, and neutral) as well as delay and Volterra partial differential equations.  <br/><br/>Volterra equations have have important and crucial applications as models in diverse areas of science and engineering; e.g. biomathematics and medical science, population dynamics, control theory, electrodynamics, neutron transport theory, oscillation theory, and viscoelasticity.  These applications arise in a variety of critical areas such as modeling of the spread of infectious diseases and biological agents like anthrax and smallpox, the design of nuclear reactors and weapons, aerospace technology, the guidance of drone weapons and intelligence vehicles, and even the design of super computers themselves.  Since the solution of Volterra and delay equations can almost never be obtained in closed form, computational techniques must be used.  By their nature, Volterra problems create enormous demands on computing resources (both on computer speed and memory) and therefore require the use of extremely high performance super computers. This conference will bring together the experts in these areas and will help to stimulate various research efforts.<br/><br/>Date: June 25, 2002<br/>"

The project includes derivation and mathematical analysis of models, development of algorithms for the approximation of solutions, implementation of the algorithms as computer codes, comparisons of the output of numerical simulations with field data, the use of the models for prediction and their development as a tool for effective coastal engineering.  The basic issue under consideration is challenging in that it involves the temporal evolution of two free surfaces whose dynamics are connected in a complex and nonlinear way.  The wave motion involves the deformation of the water's  surface, or in the case of internal waves, the pycnoclines.  Even over a fixed bottom, these issues are difficult in their exact formulation, and consequently model equations are typically used.  In the present conception, the bottom is not fixed, and this added complexity is what makes the issues proposed here for study scientifically very interesting.  In view are three-dimensional models that are initiated by incoming wave fields from deep water.   These models will allow for long-shore variation and take account of reflection.  It is planned to develop such models and to test them extensively against both laboratory experiments and field observation.  Comparisons are in view at several sites around the world, including the Field Research Facility of the US Army Corps of Engineers at Duck, NC, a site of the Polish Academy of Sciences on the Baltic Sea, the North Coast of the Magdelan Islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Gold Coast of Australia, the Island of Djerba off the Tunisian coast and two regions in Morocco (Alger in the Gibraltar Strait and Agadir on the Atlantic coast).      <br/><br/>The motivation for carrying out the study outlined above is several-fold.  First is the pure science of the subject.  The project involves interesting and substantial issues from hydrodynamics, partial differential equations, and sediment transport theory.  Secondly, it is an ideal venue in which to acquaint students with interdisciplinary research.  There is a strong practical reason for this study as well.  The erosion and retreat of coastlines is a worldwide phenomenon.  Global warming will increase the activity of storms, raise the sea level, and further degrade the present, sometimes catastrophic state of many beaches.  Fragile Arctic coasts, beaches on the Great lakes and on many coastal regions already display the unmistakable signs of deterioration caused by these global changes and aggravated by social developmental pressure.  Severe erosion is likely to spread to many coastal areas within half a century and thus increase the demand for effective prevention methods.  The present project aims at deepening our understanding of fundamental wave-bottom interaction processes, especially as regards sediment dispersal. Going beyond the science, the project also grapples with the intelligent use of this kind of knowledge in designing coastal protection strategies.  With experience already in hand, it is clear that there are a variety of protection options and that it is not always smart to simply build some permanent, often-ugly structure.  So-called 'soft' protection methods are a useful addition to the reperatoire of the coastal engineer.  These are much less expensive when they can be made to work.   The assessment of the practicality of a protection plan, be it 'hard' or 'soft' relies upon the kind of knowledge investigated under the auspices of this project. <br/><br/>"

The DSM method is used as a general approach to the<br/>construction of regularizing algorithms for solving ill-posed<br/>problems, i.e. a stopping rule is developed: a rule for choosing<br/>that moment of time at which the value of the solution to the<br/>basic evolution equation stably approximates the solution to the<br/>original ill-posed equation in the case when the data are given<br/>with some error.  Applications of different versions of the DSM<br/>are considered to classical ill-posed problems of computational<br/>mathematics, such as stable differentiation of noisy data, stable<br/>inversion of ill-conditioned matrices, and to nonlinear inverse<br/>problems arising in geophysics, quantum physics, medicine, remote<br/>sensing in technology, and other applied areas.  The DSM with<br/>simultaneous updates of the inverse derivative operator without<br/>actual inverting of this operator is developed for solving<br/>nonlinear ill-posed problems.  The DSM is used as a general method<br/>for constructing convergent iterative processes for solving<br/>ill-posed operator equations.

In all these areas nonnegative matrices and/or their associated<br/>M--matrices are used to represent the basic model according to weights or probabilities connecting between states  or vertices. The sensitivities and elasticities of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, as well as other properties,  of such matrices  are used to analyze and understand the behavior of the models and their response to  changes in the input data. Generalized inverses are needed because they enter into expressions for the derivatives, when they exist,  of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices as functions of the  entries and thus generalized inverses help in measuring the effects of various types of perturbation on the models.<br/><br/>Many physical phenomena can be modeled by mathematics, and mathematics is a primary tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of the phenomena. Take the simple-looking problem of a population, be it of humans or of animals or of germs, that is divided according to age.  At each age the females may have a different birth rate and at each age members of the population may have a different probability of survival to the next age group.  If one knows the initial distribution of the population into the different age groups, then can one predict the short and long term evolution trends of the population?!  Could it be that the population can reach in time a situation that is called an equilibrium?  This is a situation in which the sizes of each age group may continue to change, but the relative size of each age group to the other age groups does not change.  There are many problems of this sort which the fields of mathematics called Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory can help model and solve.  In this project matrix methods are applied to investigate the behavior of three models, one from population growth, one from a networking problem, and one from physical systems that is governed by probability rather than by surety."

The team will consolidate several scattered advances into a unified body of theory and methods to be called Multiscale Geometric Analysis, which can probe the fine structure of 2-, 3- and higher- dimensional functions and point clouds, able to isolate and manipulate intermediate-dimensional phenomena. Simple examples include edges in 2-d images, filaments and sheets in 3-d point catalogs. Characterizing such intermediate-dimensional phenomena is essential for fundamental progress in a wide range of problem areas (including 2-d and 3-d imaging) where traditional multiscale methods have now run their course. Our united effort has three main outcomes. 1. Theory. Coherent, comprehensive knowledge, showing what can and cannot be accomplished with computational harmonic analysis. 2. Tools. A wide range of practical MGA algorithms and a unified, publicly available software environment - BeamLab - deploying them. 3. Applications. Our main initial focus will be on the analysis of 3-d point catalogs in astronomy, such as those coming on-line soon from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We know a priori that the data contain filaments and sheets, embedded in a scattered background, and MGA provides a decisive set of tools to resolve the structural properties of such catalogs, far more sensitive and more comprehensible than any tools currently available for such analysis.<br/><br/>Many new kinds of massive databases are being created in our era's revolutionary transition to a data-rich society.  Many of these databases contain geometric structures such as surfaces, and filaments, albeit in a sometimes hidden manner. Databases of this sort can include galaxy catalogs in astronomy -- in which the filaments and sheets are predicted by various theories of universe formation -- 3-D scanning of faces and other objects -- in which filaments and surfaces are caused by structures such as skin and hair -- and statistical databases in which curves and surfaces arise from existence of predictable patterns. This Focused Research Group on Multiscale Geometric Analysis is a research effort bringing together mathematicians, statisticians, image analysts and astronomers to create new tools and theories to help extract geometric structure and meaning from such databases.  The participants are skilled at multiscale analysis, which will be a central organizational principle. We expect multiscale methods to have an impact here comparable to what wavelets have had over the last twenty years in many other problems in science and technology.<br/>"

The proposed research on de-convolution models will seek to correct both difficulties. The usefulness of LES in industrial applications is severely limited by the crude near wall models currently used.  Layton has developed improved near wall models for channel flow with the correct double-asymptotics (Re -> infinity and delta -> 0).  These will be extended to produce nonlinear near wall models suitable for recirculating flows.  Layton will also investigate a new variational multiscale method based on a multiscale decomposition of the fluid stresses rather than fluid velocities.<br/><br/>Layton proposes to continue the mathematical development of large eddy simulation.

It is organized into four projects, chosen partly because of their importance in the field of granular materials, but also because they raise intriguing mathematical and scientific issues of broader significance.  The first project attacks a fundamental physical problem: How to include micromechanical effects in a continuum description of granular flow, especially the effect of velocity fluctuations.  The second project concerns the mathematics surrounding multidimensional continuum models for granular flow, specifically the issue of extracting mathematically rigorous information from ill-posed partial differential equations.  The third project proposes to extend Jenike's radial solution for flows in axisymmetric hoppers to conical hoppers with a general cross section.  The fourth project deals with flows of fine granular materials, where the interstitial gas significantly affects the flow. The research program involves coordinated efforts in modeling, analysis, numerical simulations, and experiment.<br/><br/>At the heart of this research project is a basic question concerning the flow of granular materials: ""What behaviors of slowly flowing granular material can be understood in terms of a continuum formulation?""  This question may be viewed as an attempt to reconcile continuum models, used in industrial design and engineering problem solving, with discrete models, introduced to understand the results of small- to medium-scale physical experiments.  Continuum models are highly desirable since they are much more tractable analytically and computationally than particle dynamics simulations, which treat the discreteness of the flow directly.  An important issue that arises from this basic question, and which is addressed in this project, is the form that a continuum description should take.  This issue has been the subject of debate in the engineering literature ever since Janssen in 1895 demonstrated that stresses in a column of granular material do not increase indefinitely with depth, but approach asymptotically to a constant. The research program has significance well beyond the context of granular materials in mathematics as well as physics.  The project is supported by a long-standing industrial collaboration."

The strength of these methods derives in part by the use of preconditioners, which are matrices (or operators) changing the spectral properties of the linear system. In recent years, several researchers (including the PI), have proposed and analyzed Krylov methods in which the preconditioner is allowed to change from one (outer) step to the next. In particular, the preconditioner can be a Krylov method itself. Some of these inner-outer methods have been shown experimentally to work well.  As part of this project, it is proposed to undertake a detailed analysis of general inner-outer methods of this kind.  This analysis should give us an understanding of these methods, and also indicate how to think of new inner-outer methods. Experiments will be conducted with all these methods together with comparison with restarted ones.<br/> <br/>Inexact Krylov subspace methods refer to the situation where the matrix-vector multiplication at each step is not performed exactly. This situation appears in numerous applications, including block matrices and the approximation of Schur complements at each step. It was shown experimentally by some researchers that the amount of inexactness can be allowed to grow as the iterations progress. We propose to study this phenomenon in detail, both to provide an understanding of this phenomenon, and to devise bounds on the amount of inexactness to be used computationally. <br/><br/>During the last few years we have developed a new algebraic formulation of additive and multiplicative Schwarz methods. These methods, which are used as fixed) preconditioners for the (parallel) solution of differential equations, are extensively used in industry, science and engineering applications. This new formulation allow us to study these methods using the rich theory of linear algebra. This new theory complements the analytical theory usually used for these methods. For example, we have recently completed the analysis of the Restrictive Additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner, for which there is no analytical convergence results.In the second part of this project, it is proposed to further use this new formulation to analyze other Schwarz variants. <br/> <br/><br/>"

Modeling complex behavior exhibited by multi-scale nonlinear dynamics often entails an effective description of large scale, coarse-grained dynamics. Their resolution requires a precise mathematical characterization of all spatial and temporal excitations present in systems. The issue of quantification of statistical properties of long-time, large-scale dynamics of spatiotemporal chaos will be addressed in a near-integrable setting and in a system in which the separation of scales, as well as instability, can be precisely tuned and controlled. Once a good statistical characterization is obtained, it can provide not only guidance in modeling coarse-grained dynamics but also statistical calibrations of these effective models against the original full dynamics. With these statistical insights, the research further focuses on the study of coarse-grained dynamics and invariant measures for two possible situations --- namely, dynamics with and without separation of scales. The projects also address important aspects of dispersive wave turbulence: clarification of the derivation of kinetic equations and their validation; and detailed characterization of resonance conditions, flux dynamics, and spatially localized, coherent structures.<br/><br/>A multitude of spatiotemporal scales may arise in modeling problems in modern science, ranging from molecular dynamics simulation of protein folding to short term climate prediction for coupled atmosphere-ocean dynamics --- the study of which has great impact on our daily world. This project investigates mathematical methods that can be used to understand and predict the complicated behavior of systems of this type.<br/>"

Promising algorithms are tested and compared using mathematical analyses and computer experiments.  Tools for mathematical analysis include the concept of effective accuracy, the method of modified equations, linear analysis, and KAM theory.  Computer experiments are performed on model problems chosen to reveal unambiguously the properties of interest.  Faster algorithms are to be implemented in molecular simulation software developed and distributed for public use in a project at the University of Illinois Beckman Institute.

These calculations require the generation of sequences of atomic configurations either for the purpose of modeling actual motion or for the purpose of calculating averaged values and structures from a wide range of representative samples.  The computing time ranges from hours to months, so it can benefit tremendously from faster algorithms.  It is the objective of this research project to do this: to create much more efficient propagators for dynamics and sampling that reliably achieve acceptable levels of accuracy.  The construction of such algorithms employs ideas from mathematics and computer science together with physical insight.  Promising algorithms are tested and compared using mathematical analyses and computer experiments.

They have solved the conjecture in the plane, but many<br/>higher-dimensional questions remain.  For example, there is a<br/>candidate for a configuration that might be a counterexample for<br/>the analogous statement in three-space, and there are some<br/>interesting possible differences between the case for a union of<br/>disks and the intersection of disks.  Another major topic is the<br/>study of linkages in the plane that are locked in the sense that<br/>they can only move a small amount without crossing.  The theory<br/>of frameworks and tensegrities plays an important role here and<br/>can be applied to give reasonable criteria to detect when such a<br/>linkage is locked.  This is continuing work of the investigator,<br/>Erik Demaine, and Gunter Rote, who originally solved the<br/>carpenter's rule problem, which states that any polygonal arc can<br/>be opened without creating any self-intersection.<br/>     The investigator works on certain basic, fundamental<br/>questions about the geometry of discrete objects.  Just as<br/>physics asks fundamental questions about the nature of matter,<br/>space, and the universe, and the physical laws they must obey,<br/>geometry asks fundamental questions about how geometric objects<br/>interact and the implicit constraints they satisfy.  How does the<br/>area of the union of round disks change as the centers are moved<br/>apart?  The investigator (with Karoly Bezdek) has shown that the<br/>area behaves (it increases or stays the same) as expected in the<br/>plane, but the situation in space is not so clear.  When is a<br/>robot arm in the plane rigid, and when can it be opened?  The<br/>investigator (with Erik Demaine and Gunter Rote) has shown that<br/>arms open as expected in the plane, but what about more<br/>complicated linkages?  What can be said about the rigidity of<br/>packings of round balls as a granular material?  The investigator<br/>is an expert in such matters, but there are delicate questions<br/>about the rigidity in a container with a small number of disks.<br/>The volume enclosed by a flexible surface is constant, but what<br/>about other geometric invariants? These are concrete tangible<br/>objects, but accessible to the appropriate geometric insight.<br/>These questions are both relevant and potentially quite useful<br/>for subjects as wide-ranging as cell biology, protein folding,<br/>kinematics, and granular materials.  For example, it is widely<br/>believed that the geometric structure of a cell has a great deal<br/>to do with its function.  So the rigidity of appropriate discrete<br/>objects is relevant.  As has been shown over and over again in<br/>physics and mathematics, if the questions are to the point,<br/>applications follow.<br/><br/>"

Katsoulakis<br/>Institution: University of Massachusetts Amherst<br/>Title: ITR: Mesoscopic Modeling and Simulation: A Novel Approach to Monte Carlo<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/><br/>This project is concerned with a novel framework for Monte Carlo simulations based on recently developed coarse-grained stochastic mesoscopic models.  Mesoscopic models are stochastic partial differential equations which are rigorously derived as asymptotic limits from microscopic Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms by means of techniques from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.  Although such models describe the mesoscopic scales, which are much larger than the underlying molecular scales, they still include detailed microscopic information on particle interactions and dynamics and can systematically model anisotropies and multiple micromechanisms.  Another attractive feature of mesoscopic models is the inclusion of random fluctuations derived directly from the underlying master equation and yielding important nucleation and pattern formation and selection mechanisms.  Finally, formal and rigorous asymptotics using Large Deviation and WKB expansions as well as preliminary numerical simulations indicate that the MC algorithms and the corresponding stochastic mesoscopic models produce essentially identical results for such delicate quantities as nucleation rates and phase transitions.  The main research objectives of this proposal are: (a) to develop non-equilibrium coarse-grained MC algorithms by numerically solving the stochastic mesoscopic equations using highly efficient spectral-based methods and carry out detailed benchmarkings against conventional MC, and (b) to apply the proposed computational tools to applications arising in pattern formation in advanced materials and molecular separation in nanoporous films.<br/><br/>Because of their fundamental nature and their versatility in describing complex out-of-equilibrium interactions between atoms and molecules, molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms have become preeminent computational tools for science and engineering research.  With the advent of enhanced computing capabilities, these methods can provide unprecedented insights into numerous problems ranging from physicochemical and biological processes to biomaterials, drug design, pattern recognition, and image processing.  Despite their widespread use and the substantial progress in related computational methods, molecular algorithms are limited to short length and time scales.  Hence, they are capable of simulating only a relatively small number of atoms or molecules for quite short time periods.  On the other hand, device sizes and morphological features observed in experiments often involve much larger spatial and/or temporal scales.  A major obstacle in meeting this multiscale modeling challenge is the lack of a rigorous mathematical and computational framework providing a direct link from the atomistic scale to the complex mesoscopic and macroscopic phenomena that are the result of the microscopic interactions.  In this direction, our work focuses on developing novel stochastic models and algorithms capable of describing much larger length and time scales than conventional MC simulations while still incorporating microscopic details.  We intend to apply the computational methods to provide new insights into two engineering problems, which are currently intractable with conventional MC techniques:  (1) the study of self-organizing micromechanisms and their role in pattern formation in advanced materials, and (2) the transport and separation of molecules in nanoporous films and membranes.<br/><br/>"

The emphasis is on problems involving non-Hermitian matrices. Recently he has extended optimal methods for Hermitian matrices to problems with normal matrices. This gave rise to two fundamentally different families of algorithms. One is based on a direct extension of the classical Hermitian Lanczos algorithm and the other on using real analytic techniques. These methods can be employed, e.g., in solving linear systems and finding eigenvalues, as well as in multivariate least squares approximation problems and interpolation. Moreover, he has introduced a classification of normal matrices to measure complexity of the algorithms. In light of these methods the investigator aims at finding ways to extend these solution techniques to nonnormal problems. The matrix analytic part of the study deals with, e.g., matrix nearness problems and classes of matrices with which matrix-vector products can be performed inexpensively, typically with the FFT techniques. <br/><br/>     The motivation behind the project is to increase the speed of computations for solving real world problems. Modeling problems of science and engineering realistically leads invariably to large scale problems. Then the number of unknowns to be solved can be millions. To solve problems of this size within a reasonable time limit calls for new algorithms and solution techniques. A concrete example can be given with signal processing: a faster algorithm means faster signal processing and the fast Fourier transformation has revolutionized this particular field of engineering. The investigator studies methods at the most fundamental level of numerical analysis because linear systems need to be solved  practically in every problem one can imagine. Consequently, the impact of the study can be very large. In addition to inventing fast solution methods, in this project mathematical tools are developed that are of interest from a pure matrix analytic point of view.<br/><br/>"

Specifically, the projects investigates statistical<br/>theories of coherent structures in turbulence, which in a model<br/>atmosphere or ocean usually take the form of long-lived, large-scale<br/>jets and vortices.  The approach builds on recent developments in the<br/>equilibrium statistical theory of such structures, which has now<br/>matured to the point that it can be justified mathematically,<br/>implemented computationally and applied succesfully to geophysical<br/>models.  A prime example is the recent model of the zonal jets and<br/>vortical spots in the atmosphere of Jupiter, whose predictions agree<br/>remarkably well with observational data.  In light of these<br/>developments, the goals of the project are two-fold.  First, the<br/>equilibrium statistical theory of coherent structures is elaborated<br/>for increasingly realistic geophysical models, such as multi-layer<br/>quasi-geostrophic models and shallow-water models.  The physical<br/>implications of the theory are investigated by computing families of<br/>equilibrium structures and deriving nonlinear stability theorems for<br/>them.  Second, a novel approach to statistical closure is developed<br/>from the corresponding nonequilibrium theory.  Unlike traditional<br/>closure schemes for fluid turbulence, this new methodology derives<br/>macroscopic equations for some specified resolved variables by<br/>conditioning random paths of microstates on the ensemble-averaged<br/>dynamics for those resolved variables.  A combined theoretical and<br/>computational investigation of this approximation to nonequilibrium<br/>behavior is undertaken for some prototype problems.  In the context of<br/>model geophysical systems with damping and driving, this approach is<br/>envisioned as a general procedure for deriving effective subgrid-scale<br/>parametrizations of unresolved eddies.<br/><br/><br/>Turbulent fluid flow remains one of the unsolved puzzles of physical<br/>science.  A better theoretical understanding of turbulence is needed<br/>as a basis for the computational simulation of almost all natural<br/>fluid motions.  This is especially true of geophysical fluid flows --<br/>the motions of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere -- which involve<br/>complex motions over a wide range of scales, from meters up to the<br/>planetary size.  Every modern computer code used in weather<br/>forecasting or climate prediction requires special, but often<br/>unreliable, assumptions about how the small-scale turbulent motions<br/>affect the computed large-scale behavior.  The research conducted in<br/>this project addresses the general issue of modeling a complex fluid<br/>flow -- a mathematical prototype of an atmosphere or ocean -- in such<br/>a way that its predominant large-scale features can be captured<br/>reliably without resolving the full complexity of its small-scale<br/>motions.  In particular, the work seeks to develop the mathematical<br/>and computational tools necessary to predict the behavior of modeled<br/>geophysical fluid systems which exhibit organized features on large<br/>scales but disordered and random motions on a range of small scales.<br/>To do so, the project draws on sophisticated techniques from<br/>statistical physics to construct theoretical models of complex systems<br/>of this kind, and thereby to provide efficient and reliable methods<br/>for computing their expected or most probable behavior.  A recent<br/>example of this approach is the remarkably successful explanation of<br/>the persistent jetstreams and vortices, such as the Great Red Spot, in<br/>the atmosphere of the giant planet Jupiter, which for the first time<br/>shows quantitative and qualitative agreement between mathematical<br/>theory and NASA spacecraft observations.  In the context of Earth's<br/>atmosphere and oceans, such theoretical models and computational<br/>methods can used as building blocks in predictions about the long-term<br/>trends in the ocean-atmosphere system.<br/>"

Local refinements (the h-methods) and moving mesh methods (the r-methods) are two basic types of approaches.  Each has its features. The h-methods are robust and reliable. The r-methods can be highly efficient and effective for time dependent problems. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive combined h- and r-refinement method to achieve the advantages of both approaches. This combined method is especially useful in solving advection-diffusion problems, with which the numerical diffusion and advection speed can be significantly reduced. Major issues to be addressed in this research include: the error estimates used to guide the hr-refinement, stable and accurate time integration methods used in conjunction with the spatial hr-refinement; the conservative numerical schemes based on the hr-refined meshes; the efficient solution of the linear algebraic equations arising from the discretization; the implementation and software development. While the analysis and algorithms will be established in the context of general time dependent advection-diffusion problems, we shall focus on two specific applications: the contamination and remediation of ground water systems in environmental science, and the motion and deformation of white blood cells in biophysics.<br/><br/>With the advances of modern computer technology, numerical experiments have now become one of the two primary tools in science, industry, and engineering (the other is physical experiments). Numerical simulation of many important processes involves the solution of advection-diffusion problems. Examples include optimal design of aircrafts and automobiles, forecast of global weather change, remediation of surface and ground water contamination, and innovation of biomedical devices. This project aims to develop a robust, reliable, and highly efficient mesh refinement method used for solving the advection-diffusion problems. Major issues<br/>in the design, analysis, and implementation of this method will be addressed. In particular, it will be applied directly to solve environmental and biophysical problems. We anticipate that successful completion of this project will not only enrich the mathematical theory of adaptive solution of partial differential equations, but also generate highly efficient and accurate numerical algorithms, which will find applications in a variety of industrial and engineering areas that are essential to our national economy and security.<br/><br/><br/>Date: May 22nd, 2002<br/>"

The first aim of this project is to better <br/>understand the structure of Weierstrass semigroups of m-tuples of <br/>points on certain curves over finite fields.  The second goal is <br/>to apply this knowledge to improve bounds on the minimum distances <br/>of codes constructed using these curves as well as arbitrary <br/>curves over finite fields.  This builds on the investigator's <br/>previous work showing that Weierstrass semigroups of pairs of <br/>points can be used to construct algebraic geometry codes with <br/>parameters exceeding the usual lower bounds.   These codes, <br/>constructed using two points on a curve, have better parameters <br/>than any comparable code constructed using a single point on the <br/>same curve.  Thus, in the third component of this project, the <br/>investigator compares codes constructed using m points on a curve <br/>to those constructed using fewer than m points.  In addition to <br/>these topics, this project includes a focus on semigroups used in <br/>decoding algorithms for algebraic geometry codes.   <br/><br/>Error-correcting codes are used to ensure reliable transfer of <br/>information across noisy communication channels by detecting <br/>and correcting errors.  Such codes are found in a wide range of <br/>devices, from computing equipment to cellular telephones to <br/>compact disc players.  For practical applications, codes should <br/>be efficient and correct as many errors as possible.  While there <br/>are many ways to construct codes, one of the most promising uses <br/>tools from algebraic geometry.  In particular, curves over finite <br/>fields are used to define error-correcting codes, called algebraic <br/>geometry codes.  One can gain information about these codes by <br/>studying the curves used to define them.  In this proposal, the <br/>investigator examines curves commonly used to define algebraic <br/>geometry codes by studying semigroups associated with the curves.  <br/>This knowledge is then applied to obtain better estimates of the <br/>efficiency and error-correcting capabilities of the corresponding <br/>codes.  In addition, the investigator pursues applications of <br/>semigroups to the process of decoding algebraic geometry codes.     <br/><br/>"

The WTG equations form a<br/>""balance model"", or set of singular limit equations, asymptotically valid<br/>in a parameter regime relevant to the tropical atmosphere.  The WTG<br/>equations are designed to facilitate study of key aspects of the tropical<br/>climate problem, such as the large-scale dynamical roles of moist<br/>convection and other diabatic processes.  This focus is achieved by<br/>eliminating other processes which can be present in solutions to the<br/>primitive equations, such as gravity waves and baroclinic instability, in<br/>the same way as gravity waves are eliminated in extratropical balance<br/>models  such as the quasi-geostrophic equations.  One goal of this project<br/>is to develop new mathematics by studying the WTG equations' properties.<br/>Another goal is to solve the equations under geometries, boundary<br/>conditions and forcings which represent idealizations of those relevant to<br/>the real earth's climate, and then to study the sensitivity of the<br/>solutions to key parameters.  Achievement of these goals is expected to<br/>lead to deeper understanding of both the real climate and more complex<br/>mathematical models of it, such as general circulation models (GCMs).<br/><br/>The earth's climate system is notoriously complex.  Many different<br/>physical processes interact in a tangled web of feedbacks to produce the<br/>dynamic and variable climate we observe.  Unlike a laboratory science,<br/>meteorology and oceanography are hindered by the impossibility of<br/>controlled experiments which might allow the key mechanisms to be<br/>conclusively revealed.  We are stuck with the one planet on which we live<br/>and cannot change its basic properties to see what happens.  Consequently,<br/>the science proceeds by observation and by a heavy reliance on numerical<br/>simulation with GCMs, which are sophisticated computer programs run on the<br/>most powerful computers available.  These simulations offer the<br/>possibility of a certain kind of controlled climate experiments:  we can<br/>create virtual earths on the computer, control their properties, and<br/>observe their behavior with precision.  One obvious limitation of this<br/>approach is that the models are imperfect representations of reality.  A<br/>less obvious, but equally important problem is the models' complexity,<br/>which both limits the number and type of simulations which can be done and<br/>renders the results nearly as difficult to understand as the real climate<br/>system.  Because of these problems, there is a need to supplement<br/>observational and GCM studies with theoretical studies using models that<br/>are simpler than GCMs - if not simple enough to allow solution with pencil<br/>and paper, then at least using very simple computer programs that run<br/>quickly on a PC.  To the extent that these simpler models have key<br/>features in common with the real system, their simplicity allows a deeper<br/>level of understanding of the basic dynamics of climate and leads to<br/>explicit hypotheses that can be tested against observations and GCM<br/>simulations.  This project  harnesses the physical insight of climate<br/>scientists and the sophisticated methods of applied mathematicians to<br/>develop and study simple models designed specifically to represent the<br/>tropical atmospheric component of the earth's climate system.<br/>"

This process of<br/>sequestration and de-sequestration is therefore (at least<br/>partially) responsible for the timing of cell division events.<br/>The mathematical model predicts the probability of each of the<br/>sequestration sites being sequestered, as a function of time.  The<br/>replicated DNA strands are moved apart in the longitudinal<br/>direction (towards the cell poles) in order to assure exactly one<br/>set of chromosomes in each daughter cell.  The process by which<br/>this occurs is unknown, but the timing of this event is crucial<br/>to viability.  The project studies viable models for this<br/>seqregation.  The site for septation is marked by formation of a<br/>Z-ring at the center of the rod-shaped cell, halfway between the<br/>poles.  This Z-ring is involved in causing the cell to form a<br/>septum between the daughter halves.  Placement of the Z-ring at<br/>the center is a result of the cooperative actions of three<br/>proteins from the min locus of the DNA.  Three proteins behave in<br/>an oscillatory manner, with MinD alternately forming a layer on<br/>the cell membrane near one pole, then disassembling and<br/>re-forming at the other pole.  The investigator studies a model<br/>for the dynamics of the Min system.<br/>     The investigaor develops mathematical models to improve the<br/>understanding of the biology of cell division in E. coli.  The<br/>basic philosophy is to determine mechanisms that can describe<br/>observed events, and to evaluate whether these mechanisms can<br/>operate for reasonable parameter values, that is, whether the<br/>kinetic rates, diffusivities, and concentrations are within<br/>reasonable ranges of observed values.  Location and timing of<br/>cellular events is an important aspect of molecular biology.<br/>Moreover, mathematical models that incorporate intracellular<br/>transport and reactions, including reactions with organelles,<br/>should prove to be of general applicability to cellular biology.<br/>Such models can focus biological research on aspects of molecular<br/>dynamics that otherwise seem unconnected.<br/>"

It is therefore a grand<br/>scientific challenge to derive global climate  models which are reliable <br/>and trustworthy. Exploiting certain geophysical balances, such as <br/>geostrophic balance (due to earth rotation) or hydrostatic balance <br/>(due to the shallowness of the ocean and atmosphere) geophysicists derive<br/> reasonable, yet less complex, balanced models. It is therefore essential to <br/>justify rigorously the  validity of these models, for the relevant spatial<br/>and time scales. The focus  of the proposed project is on the analytical,<br/>statistical and numerical properties of solutions to nonlinear ocean <br/>dynamics models and turbulent sub-grid models. The first aspect of this <br/>project is to: show existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on <br/>initial data, to some of these reduced geophysical models. In particular, <br/>a two-layer zonal jet model, a planetary geostrophic ``thermocline'' model, <br/>the lake equations with degenerate varying bottom topography and the <br/>two-dimensional primitive equations. This is the first and the most essential <br/>step in validating the derivation of these  models. In order to justify the <br/>long-time behavior of fluid dynamical models, one has to compare the statistical <br/>properties of their attracting invariant sets, rather than compare individual<br/>solutions. To do so, it is necessary to focus on models which include some <br/>mechanism of dissipation. This project addresses questions related to the asymptotic <br/>derivation of these models and the effect of numerical dissipation on their <br/>solutions, which include boundary layer analysis. The second aspect of this<br/>project is to: derive new large-eddy simulation models, the so-called alpha-models, <br/>in the context  of the  two-layers geostrophic zonal jet models. The alpha-models <br/>are asserted to reproduce the right energy spectrum for a wide range  of large <br/>scales. It is proposed to investigate  this claim using rigorous analytical tools. <br/>It is also proposed to perform computational tests on the newly derived two-layers <br/>geostrophic zonal jet alpha-model to verify the above assertion. Furthermore, <br/>it is proposed to explore the implementation of the alpha-models approach as <br/>sub-grid models. <br/><br/>The grand challenge in climate prediction is that the mathematical equations <br/>governing the ocean and atmosphere dynamics, are too difficult to study <br/>analytically, and still prohibitively expensive computationally. Indeed, <br/>it is well established, based on physical grounds and collected experimental <br/>data, that atmospheric and oceanic turbulent flows involve a broad spectrum <br/>of spatial and time scales. This in turn  makes them inaccessible  to the most <br/>powerful  and state-of-the-art computers. However, due to the rotation of the <br/>earth and other geophysical situations, such as the shallowness of the oceans <br/>and the atmosphere - in the sense that they are much wider than they are deep - <br/>geophysicists take advantage of certain geophysical balances to derive simplified<br/>balanced models. The first theme of this project is to: establish existence <br/>and regularity of solutions to some of these nonlinear reduced models. This is<br/>a crucial step  in justifying the derivation  of these models and their<br/>consistency with the physical observations for the relevant length  and time <br/>scales. Furthermore, in global climate prediction one is interested in the <br/>long-time statistical features of the climate. The second theme of this project <br/>is to develop a systematic approach for deriving and studying  new averaged <br/>models, in the context of ocean and atmosphere dynamics, which are reliable in <br/>reproducing the correct long-term statistics."

The WTG<br/>equations are designed to facilitate study of key aspects of the tropical<br/>climate problem, such as the large-scale dynamical roles of moist<br/>convection and other diabatic processes.  This focus is achieved by<br/>eliminating other processes which can be present in solutions to the<br/>primitive equations, such as gravity waves and baroclinic instability, in<br/>the same way as gravity waves are eliminated in extratropical balance<br/>models  such as the quasi-geostrophic equations.  One goal of this project<br/>is to develop new mathematics by studying the WTG equations' properties.<br/>Another goal is to solve the equations under geometries, boundary<br/>conditions and forcings which represent idealizations of those relevant to<br/>the real earth's climate, and then to study the sensitivity of the<br/>solutions to key parameters.  Achievement of these goals is expected to<br/>lead to deeper understanding of both the real climate and more complex<br/>mathematical models of it, such as general circulation models (GCMs).<br/><br/>The earth's climate system is notoriously complex.  Many different<br/>physical processes interact in a tangled web of feedbacks to produce the<br/>dynamic and variable climate we observe.  Unlike a laboratory science,<br/>meteorology and oceanography are hindered by the impossibility of<br/>controlled experiments which might allow the key mechanisms to be<br/>conclusively revealed.  We are stuck with the one planet on which we live<br/>and cannot change its basic properties to see what happens.  Consequently,<br/>the science proceeds by observation and by a heavy reliance on numerical<br/>simulation with GCMs, which are sophisticated computer programs run on the<br/>most powerful computers available.  These simulations offer the<br/>possibility of a certain kind of controlled climate experiments:  we can<br/>create virtual earths on the computer, control their properties, and<br/>observe their behavior with precision.  One obvious limitation of this<br/>approach is that the models are imperfect representations of reality.  A<br/>less obvious, but equally important problem is the models' complexity,<br/>which both limits the number and type of simulations which can be done and<br/>renders the results nearly as difficult to understand as the real climate<br/>system.  Because of these problems, there is a need to supplement<br/>observational and GCM studies with theoretical studies using models that<br/>are simpler than GCMs - if not simple enough to allow solution with pencil<br/>and paper, then at least using very simple computer programs that run<br/>quickly on a PC.  To the extent that these simpler models have key<br/>features in common with the real system, their simplicity allows a deeper<br/>level of understanding of the basic dynamics of climate and leads to<br/>explicit hypotheses that can be tested against observations and GCM<br/>simulations.
