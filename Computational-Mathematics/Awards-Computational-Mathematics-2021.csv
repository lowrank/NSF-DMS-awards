This ability allows waves to carry information, be it through speech or electronic transmission of data. Waves can also be used to probe the interior of the earth, the human body or engineered structures like buildings or bridges. This probing can be turned into images of the interior by the means of solving inverse problems, and in the extension, mitigate seismic hazards by accurate predictions of ground motion caused by earthquakes. In this project the principal investigator will develop computational simulation tools that increases our ability to exploit the properties of wave propagation for the common good. The tools developed in the project can also be used to design modern materials with exotic properties that cannot be found in nature. Such metamaterials can enable better sensing technologies and faster acoustic and electromagnetic circuit components such as miniaturized speakers, 5G components and other millimeter wave technologies. <br/><br/>The research will use a new idea that enables the use of time domain methods for wave equations to design frequency domain Helmholtz type solvers. The approach is remarkable in that the underlying linear operator corresponds to a symmetric positive definite matrix allowing the  solution of a coercive problem rather than an indefinite Helmholtz problem. As the proposed Helmholtz solvers rely solely on evolving the wave equation they will be massively parallel, scalable and high order accurate. A goal of the research is to solve the Helmholtz equation in three dimensions at higher frequencies, and on a larger number of cores than is currently possible. The research will also seek to improve the time-step constraints of time domain discontinuous Galerkin methods by exploiting approximation spaces built on discrete periodic extensions from equidistant node data. Such improvements will result in faster simulation times and more accurate predictions. Applications of the methods to modeling of micropolar materials and to simulation of seismic waves will be carried out in collaboration with researchers from academic institutions and national laboratories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The applications include energy (nuclear, wind, solar, etc.) generation, control and manufacturing, atmosphere-ocean modeling, weather prediction, surface water and ground water contamination, and so on. For all of these applications, the model problem is subject to numerous sources of uncertainty that include uncertain model parameters, forcing functions, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. For instance, in numerical weather prediction, to deal with uncertain initial conditions the weather model needs to be run multiple times with different initial conditions to generate an ensemble of possible model outputs, which will be analyzed and predictions made according to these data. This process is called ensemble forecasting, which is commonly done at all major operational weather prediction facilities worldwide, including the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). One common problem faced in these calculations is the excessive cost in terms of both storage and computing time. For many complex systems, especially those that deal with large spatial scales, running the model once is already very expensive. Running the model multiple times within a given limited computational time is very challenging even with modern supercomputers, and is not feasible in most large-scale applications. An efficient ensemble simulation algorithm that can reduce the computing cost significantly is thus highly desirable. This project seeks to develop novel, efficient ensemble algorithms and their analytical foundation for fast calculation of flow ensembles that is required to account for uncertainties in predictive simulations of fluid flows.<br/><br/>The inevitable conflict of high-resolution single realizations and computing ensembles is a central difficulty in many engineering and geophysical applications that are subject to uncertainties in both input data and model parameters. The development of efficient methods that allow for fast calculation of flow ensembles at a sufficiently fine spatial resolution is of great practical interest. This research is to develop novel, efficient ensemble algorithms for fast calculation of flow ensembles and conduct rigorous numerical analysis for the new algorithms and methods. The first research problem is to develop new efficient ensemble algorithms to compute multiple realizations for the Boussinesq equations. This includes the development of partitioned ensemble algorithms so that highly optimized Navier-Stokes-equation codes can be used to solve the problem. The second is to advance higher-order time discretizations for ensemble algorithms based on artificial compression. The third problem is the development of novel, efficient ensemble algorithms for the fast calculation of flow ensembles with varying model parameters. The methods studied will allow efficient determination of the multiple solutions corresponding to many parameter sets."

The focus of this project is on multiscale systems that do not have clear scale separation, such as nanoscale multi-physics systems. For such systems the existing approaches feature so-called memory effects and non-Markovian behavior, which limit their understanding and control. The project will develop new advanced computational tools based on machine learning to construct highly accurate models of multiscale systems directly from first-principle-based descriptions.  The constructed models retain a molecular-level fidelity and can be broadly applied to investigate the dynamic processes relevant to material design, drug delivery, and soft matter assembly.  This project will also provide interdisciplinary training and research experiences for both graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The research in this project will address a fundamental problem in model reduction and multiscale modeling for dynamic systems without clear scale separation. Current empirical models generally show limitations to retain the microscale level fidelity due to the over-simplification of the state-dependent Markovian memory term arising from the unresolved dynamics on microscale. This gap can be bridged by the methods based on machine-learning developed in this project; these will provide a general framework to learn a set of non-Markovian features from the full descriptions, and simultaneously, train the stochastic reduced model by embedding the state-dependent memory term in the extended dynamics of the non-Markovian features. Different from the conventional machine learning approaches for modeling dynamic equations, the models developed in this project  are based on rigorous projection formalism and retain a clear physical interpretation. Consistent noise terms can be naturally introduced to the reduced models, which are well-suited for studying complex dynamic systems out of equilibrium. As a result, the methods can be employed to investigate open scientific questions such as the nanoscale assembly process by faithfully accounting for the microscale interactions. In the long term, this project will provide more comprehensive computational tools for establishing predictive modeling and control of such systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this workshop is to bridge these communities with the aim of creating efficient and more robust methods and techniques for the use of AI in mathematical and computational modeling of phenomena in physics, biology, and the social sciences. The workshop will be driven by several factors. The first is the wide range of numerical and mathematical models for real-time interactions at different scales.

Yet, numerical simulations can be a challenge to implement, because computers cannot reproduce all scales from the quantum mechanical to the macroscopic scales of interest. A particularly challenging system to simulate are collections of interacting particles, which are studied in a wide variety of applications, from designing new materials such as impact-resistant or energy-efficient materials, to understanding how the interior of a cell works, to biomedical applications such as designing the lipid nanoparticles that carry the mRNA vaccines. This project will develop methods to simulate interacting particles which currently require the computer to take timesteps that are many times smaller than the timescales of interest. We will build upon a recent mathematical description of the effective interactions between such particles to allow a simulation to take significantly larger timesteps. This will allow for simulations over significantly longer times and of larger collections of particles, and hence will enable scientists to use computations to understand a richer collection of systems that arise in a variety of important applications. Students will be involved and trained in interdisciplinary applications. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop numerical methods to simulate high-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) modeling systems of particles that can repeatedly form, break and re-form bonds due to stiff, short-ranged forces. Such particles are models for systems such as colloids, cross-linked polymers (gels), DNA nanotechnology, networks of actin filaments or other cytoskeletal components, chromatin in the cell, among many others. Because of the stiffness of the particle forces, current simulation methods require extremely small time steps and thus prohibitively long simulation times. The project will develop methods that allow significantly larger timesteps and thus can work for systems of hundreds to thousands of particles, and the approach is based on two key developments. The first is an analytic result which eliminates the stiff forces and replaces them with rigid bonds when particles are in contact, which can be achieved with the help of sticky boundary conditions. The resulting sticky diffusion allows particles to evolve stochastically subject to rigid distance constraints, but crucially, allows these constraints to change. The second is a discretization of SDEs in space and numerical PDE theory to discretize the infinitesimal generator of the sticky diffusion to be later used to simulate a Markov Jump Process. This approach allows one to handle sticky boundary conditions because one can choose discretization points directly on the boundary. The methods will be applied to study systems such as DNA-coated colloids and networks of actin filaments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will focus on ideas from statistical learning for the discovery of governing laws and turning the observational data into equations that can be used for predictions. While machine learning techniques are particularly promising for this task their application to learning dynamical systems is still in its infancy.

Systematic learning theories will be developed to study the well-posedness and model selections to achieve statistically optimal performance. The second part of the project will develop robust methods to recover linear diffusion processes over graphs from partial observations of evolving states, with applications to graph signal processing. In particular the project will develop sampling theorems to collect space-time samples as well as robust reconstruction algorithms.

This work will develop efficient, robust and theoretically sound technologies that will accelerate convergence to solutions of matrix and tensor eigenvalue problems. In response to the increased prevalence of remote-learning, the integrated educational plan will develop stand-alone apps to aid in the delivery of standard and advanced topics in numerical analysis and linear algebra.

Often one needs to determine the rate of change of some quantity of interest. In that case, the models will generally include partial differential equations (PDEs), which can be solved computationally using finite element methods.  The quantity of interest is a function of, say, space that is approximated over small simple shapes called elements which together form a computational mesh. Meshes are often composed of simple triangles and rectangles (or simplices and bricks in 3D), but these meshes have various limitations.  Meshes of polygons (or polyhedra in 3D) are more flexible, but there are not many finite elements available for these meshes that accurately approximate the function. This project will develop practical finite elements on polygons and simple polytopes that merge together continuously and are provably accurate.  The new finite elements are expected to have an impact on broad areas of science and engineering by making the use of polytopal meshes more accessible. They may also have a broader impact in terms of interpolation and visualization of functions in computer graphics and in the representation of data.  Specific applications to the geosciences (subsurface modeling for energy and water resource management) are planned.  The project will support the research of students who will work in an interdisciplinary environment. Students thus trained are in high demand in industrial and governmental labs, as well as in academia.<br/><br/>Many computational scientists are interested in defining finite elements on nonstandard, polytopal elements (polygons and polyhedra). Often one desires a conforming approximation with an explicit finite element basis.  The latter is particularly helpful when dealing with nonlinear PDEs and coupled systems of equations.  One could define a finite element on a reference element and map it to the physical element. However, there is a loss in accuracy due to the fact that the map is non-affine, and also mapped mixed elements generally do not preserve the divergence free property in a pointwise sense. The proposed research involves explicit and practical construction of minimal degree of freedom finite elements on polygons and simple polytopes, as well as the mathematical analysis of their approximation properties and numerical applications.  The approach is to define H1-conforming shape functions in terms of polynomials posed directly on the physical element and supplement the space with a small number of explicitly defined nonpolynomial functions. These supplemental functions will be defined as rational functions that allow us to define a nodal basis. The de Rham theory can then be used to define mixed finite elements. The objectives are to: 1) Develop direct serendipity and mixed finite elements on 2D convex polygons; 2) Develop direct serendipity and vector-valued H(curl) and H(div) finite elements on 3D cuboidal hexahedra;  3) Develop direct serendipity and vector-valued finite elements on general 3D convex polyhedra (however, it is not expected that this objective will be fully resolved within the three year duration of the project); and 4) Use the new finite elements to solve problems in subsurface flow applications, including some that can use and explore hp-refinement properties of the polygonal elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on computational methods for control of optimal transport and mixing of some quantity of interest in fluid flows.  The question of what fluid flow maximizes mixing rate, slows it down, or even steers a quantity of interest toward a desired target distribution draws great attention from a broad range of scientists and engineers in the area of complex dynamical systems. The goal of this project is to place these problems within a flexible computational framework, and to develop a solution strategy based on optimal control tools, data compression strategies, and methods to reduce the complexity of the mathematical models. This project will also help the training and development of graduate students across different disciplines to conduct collaborative research in optimal transport and mixing, flow control, and computational methods for solving these problems.<br/><br/><br/>The project is concerned with the development and analysis of numerical methods for optimal control for mixing in fluid flows.  More precisely, the transport equation is used to describe the non-dissipative scalar field advected by the incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes flows. The research aims at achieving optimal mixing via an active control of the flow velocity and constructing efficient numerical schemes for solving this problem. Various control designs will be investigated to steer the fluid flows. Sparsity of the optimal boundary control will be promoted via a non-smooth penalty term in the objective functional. This essentially leads to a highly challenging nonlinear non-smooth control problem for a coupled parabolic and hyperbolic system, or a semi-dissipative system. The project will establish a novel and rigorous mathematical framework and also new accurate and efficient computational techniques for these difficult optimal control problems. Compatible discretization methods for coupled flow and transport will be employed to discretize the controlled system and implement the optimal control designs numerically. Numerical schemes for the highly complicated optimality system will be constructed and analyzed in a systematic fashion. New incremental data compression techniques will be utilized to avoid storing extremely large solution data sets in the iterative solvers, and new model order reduction techniques specifically designed for the optimal mixing problem will be developed to increase efficiency. The synthesis of optimal control and numerical approximation will enable the study of similar phenomena arising in many other complex and real-world flow dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viscoelastic properties of materials are a result of dissipative processes that could stem from nonlinear wave energy dissipation in atomic lattices, from grain boundaries dislocations in thin films and polycrystalline materials, or from damage, fracturing, and repairing at the microscale in polymers and biological materials. In biomedical applications, changes in viscoelasticity of soft tissues often serve as an important biomarker associated with specific malignancies and have a diagnostic value for the detection, characterization, and monitoring of arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and various cancers. Recent advances in reduced order modeling of large scale systems have enabled us to approach many practical problems viewed as unsolvable ten years ago. However, viscoelastic modeling and imaging are still challenging problems. Wave propagation in viscoelastic media is characterized by attenuation and dispersion effects, which are absent in the case of elastic materials. This project will develop an efficient computational method for imaging of viscoelastic media and simulation of attenuating waves propagating in dissipative materials.<br/><br/>The project develops an extension of the Stieltjes-Krein continuous fraction reduced order modeling method to dissipative viscoelastic systems. This very efficient method is based on the Stieltjes network realizations of nondissipative problems and currently cannot be applied to problems with dissipation and dispersion. The project will eliminate this limitation and extend the method to dissipative viscoelastic systems.  Three main components of the approach are the following: (1) Efficient dissipative sparse network realizations of ROMs for viscoelastic problems by generalizing the matrix continued-fraction approach beyond Stieltjes-Krein theory; (2) Multiscale simulation framework based on dissipative sparse network approximations of Neumann-to-Dirichlet maps; (3) Extension of the network embedding approach to dissipative problems and direct nonlinear imaging algorithms for viscoelastic media.

Such features allow flexibility, especially for high dimensional and nonlinear problems, where characteristics are difficult to track. The errors occurred in approximating characteristics will be integrated in time by Runge-Kutta (RK) methods via the method-of-lines approach. This fully discrete scheme is termed ""EL RK DG."" When the characteristics are approximated well, the very restrictive CFL constraint in the RK DG framework can be relaxed, leading to CPU savings. The EL RK DG method can be viewed as a general framework generalizing both the classical Eulerian RK DG formulation and the SL DG formulation. Thus, existing research on positivity preserving limiters, well-balanced treatments, asymptotic preserving properties, entropy stability, and error estimates on Eulerian RK DG methods can be potentially generalized to the EL RK DG framework.

These simulations often involve the solution of problems that are prescribed by physics models. In many cases, the geometry where the problem is posed is complex and/or the equation that is modeling the physical phenomena results in geometry complexities. Applications involving complex geometries include materials design, inverse scattering and fluid simulations.  Due to the sophisticated nature of solutions, it is desirable to keep the computational cost as low a possible. The key to doing this is to use as few degrees of freedom as possible to capture the physics and to couple this with efficient solution techniques. A recent numerical technique called the hierarchical Poincare-Steklov (HPS) method  is able to do this for many problems. This method has been demonstrated to be effective for high frequency scattering problems and has been integrated into inverse scattering simulations. However, the current version of the HPS method is not able to handle the complex geometries that arise in most applications. This research will address this shortfall allowing the method to be applied to complex geometries. This work will also connect the new version of the HPS method to existing software for complex geometries allowing it to be integrated into simulation packages.<br/><br/>The numerical simulations under consideration in this project are linear elliptic partial differential equations with variable coefficients including high frequency Helmholtz problems. These equations arise in the modeling of physical phenomena such as scattering, electrostatics, and when using many time-stepping techniques for solving time dependent problems (i.e. in fluid simulations). The current version of the HPS method can only handle geometries that can be easily mapped from a square or cube. This is problematic as in most applications, there are geometric features that do not fall into either of these categories. This project will extend the HPS method to a general range of geometries and will integrate seamlessly with existing mesh generation software. Additionally, this project will make the HPS method efficient for three dimensional problems (which it currently is not) and develop the necessary analysis to support the numerical results that are observed in practice. Thanks to the robustness of the HPS method, it can be used in material design and inverse scattering with a known a priori computational cost. This means that practitioners can confidently use this technique for scattering applications knowing that the method is achieving the desired accuracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wildfires emit pollutants into the air creating poor air quality that is hazardous to people?s health and the environment.  Communities use results from high resolution global scale simulations of wildfire smoke to prepare for poor air quality. This project will quantify the uncertainty in operational smoke forecasts due to incomplete knowledge of the smoke plume, wind and other weather conditions.  Uncertainty estimates provide a more complete understanding of smoke forecasts, and can be communicated along with the predictions. These estimates have the potential to improve weather prediction models that are affected by smoke, and planning efforts by rural and downstream communities. This project will support two graduate students and one undergraduate student per year for each year of the three year project. <br/><br/>Weak constraint four dimensional data assimilation (4DVAR) will be implemented to combine wind field, emission and concentration data with a partial differential equation that describes transport of PM2.5 concentrations generated by wildfire smoke. Data from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, including NCEP and EMCWF, smoke emission models from NOAA and US Forest service, and concentration data from EPA will be used.  The representer method will be developed for 4DVAR to reduce the search space for the optimal estimates from the state space to the data space.  The computational cost of 4DVAR will be further improved by developing algorithmic advances for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in parallel with storage and checkpointing of adjoints.  Approximation of the Dirac delta distributions, appearing in the adjoint method, will be improved with a new formulation inspired by the Immersed Boundary Method.   Estimates of PM2.5 concentration, wind field and emission estimates arising in the transport model will fit observations within specified error covariances.

Yet, numerical simulations can be a challenge to implement, because computers cannot reproduce all scales from the quantum mechanical to the macroscopic scales of interest. A particularly challenging system to simulate are collections of interacting particles, which are studied in a wide variety of applications, from designing new materials such as impact-resistant or energy-efficient materials, to understanding how the interior of a cell works, to biomedical applications such as designing the lipid nanoparticles that carry the mRNA vaccines. This project will develop methods to simulate interacting particles which currently require the computer to take timesteps that are many times smaller than the timescales of interest. We will build upon a recent mathematical description of the effective interactions between such particles to allow a simulation to take significantly larger timesteps. This will allow for simulations over significantly longer times and of larger collections of particles, and hence will enable scientists to use computations to understand a richer collection of systems that arise in a variety of important applications. Students will be involved and trained in interdisciplinary applications. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop numerical methods to simulate high-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) modeling systems of particles that can repeatedly form, break and re-form bonds due to stiff, short-ranged forces. Such particles are models for systems such as colloids, cross-linked polymers (gels), DNA nanotechnology, networks of actin filaments or other cytoskeletal components, chromatin in the cell, among many others. Because of the stiffness of the particle forces, current simulation methods require extremely small time steps and thus prohibitively long simulation times. The project will develop methods that allow significantly larger timesteps and thus can work for systems of hundreds to thousands of particles, and the approach is based on two key developments. The first is an analytic result which eliminates the stiff forces and replaces them with rigid bonds when particles are in contact, which can be achieved with the help of sticky boundary conditions. The resulting sticky diffusion allows particles to evolve stochastically subject to rigid distance constraints, but crucially, allows these constraints to change. The second is a discretization of SDEs in space and numerical PDE theory to discretize the infinitesimal generator of the sticky diffusion to be later used to simulate a Markov Jump Process. This approach allows one to handle sticky boundary conditions because one can choose discretization points directly on the boundary. The methods will be applied to study systems such as DNA-coated colloids and networks of actin filaments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The design of deployable surfaces such as solar panels, solar sails, space telescopes, airbags, flapping devices, and ingestible robots are few examples benefiting from this technology. This project encompasses the mathematical modeling of folding devices, the design of numerical algorithms predicting their deformations, and a mathematical analysis guaranteeing the efficiency of the predictions.<br/><br/>The PI will consider thin materials resisting shear and stretch but allowing for bending away from non-necessarily straight creases. In recent years, these curved origamis received significant attention from the scientific community in view of the fascinating variety of shapes they can exhibit, their ability to produce rigid configurations and flapping mechanisms, their capacity to undergo large deformations using a small amount of energy, and their applicability at small and large scales alike. The outcomes of this research program include the derivation of a reduced plate model for thin materials resisting bending and allowing for folding along curved locations, the design and analysis of finite element algorithms approximating the dynamics and equilibriums of the corresponding plate deformations, and a parallel implementation of the proposed algorithms illustrating their efficiency on benchmarks as well as on configurations relevant to practitioners.

The research will improve on current approaches and will formulate a new polarizable multipole implicit solvent model with improved and enhanced modeling accuracy. Furthermore, efficient and accurate numerical algorithms will be developed to meet computational challenges of the new model. This research will provide biophysicists a new tool for analyzing electrostatic interactions of solvated biomolecules in the form of models and algorithms implemented in a freely available software package. In addition, this project will offer interdisciplinary research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in biological modeling, computation, and mathematical analysis.<br/><br/>The project will address limitations in the existing implicit solvent models for studying electrostatic interaction between solutes. These include the facts that the solute charge sources are often modeled as point charges located at atomic centers, and this rough approximation to the quantum mechanical charge density is known to be a major source of the modeling errors. Moreover, polarization, an important physical phenomenon account for the redistribution of the electron density in the presence of an external electric field is missing in this point charge model. The project will develop a novel nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model associated with an atomic polarizable multipole (PM) force field to describe the self-consistent polarization process and study electrostatic interactions among permanent multipoles, induced dipoles, and reaction-field potential. The coupling of PM source with the nonlinear PB (NPB) equation, as opposed to the linearized PB, is challenging in many aspects involving modeling and numerical difficulties such as charge singularities, geometric complexity, interface jumps, nonlinearity, polarization, as well as high computational cost. To overcome such difficulties, a set of efficient, accurate, and seamlessly coupled numerical methods will be developed to resolve numerical challenges associated with the PM-NPB model. In particular, multipole charge singularities are regularized using Green?s function based decomposition; self-consistent polarization, which involves repeatedly solving an NPB equation across the molecular interface, is efficiently realized by a linearized iterative algorithm coupled with a fast 3D Augmented Matched Interface and Boundary (AMIB) method.

Immersed finite element (IFE) methods are a class of accurate and efficient numerical methods for solving interface problems on structured meshes, which are desirable in PIC method because of the efficient particle-mesh interactions. However, in simulations involving conductors, one usually only knows the total electric charge quantity on the conductor surface, not the surface charge density, which is necessary for solving the second-order elliptic interface equation. Therefore, this project will start from the modeling for an inverse interface problem to identify the surface charge density based on the lab experiment data. According to the lab data availability, different mathematical considerations of the data in the cost functionals will lead to various adjoint problems. Then efficient iterative algorithms based on IFEs will be developed to solve the inverse problem.

Finite element methods have undergone decades of study by mathematicians, scientists and engineers in many fields and there is a rich mathematical theory concerning them. They are widely used in scientific computing and modelling to generate accurate simulations of a wide variety of physical processes, most notably the deformation of materials and fluid mechanics. By contrast, deep neural networks are relatively new and have only been widely used in the last decade. In this short time, they have demonstrated remarkable empirical performance on a wide variety of machine learning tasks, most notably in computer vision and natural language processing. Despite this great empirical success, there is still a very limited mathematical understanding of why and how deep neural networks work so well. We hope to leverage the success of deep learning to improve numerical methods for partial differential equations and to leverage the theoretical understanding of the finite element method to better understand deep learning. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will also provide a good training experience for junior researchers. This project will support 1 graduate student each year of the three year project. <br/><br/>Piecewise polynomials represent one of the most important functional classes in approximation theory.  In classical approximation theory and numerical methods for partial differential equations, these functional classes are often represented by linear functional spaces associated with a priori given grids, for example, by splines and finite element spaces. In deep learning, function classes are typically represented by a composition of a sequence of linear functions and coordinate-wise non-linearities. One important non-linearity is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function and its powers (ReLUk).  The resulting functional class, ReLUk-DNN, does not form a linear vector space but is rather parameterized non-linearly by a high-dimensional set of parameters.  This function class can be used to solve partial differential equations and we call the resulting numerical algorithms the finite neuron method (FNM). Proposed research topics include: error estimates for the finite neuron method, universal construction of conforming finite elements for arbitrarily high order partial differential equations, an investigation into how and why the finite neuron method gives a much better asymptotic error estimate than the corresponding finite element method, and the development and analysis of efficient algorithms for using the finite neuron method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ground states of BEC are described by the solutions to the static Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), a nonlinear eigenproblem with nonlinearity in eigenvectors, with the lowest total energy. Preconditioned optimization methods based on the structure of the energy functional will be studied. (2) Iterative methods for the complex Bethe-Salpeter Eigenvalue problem (BSE). BSE is a Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem, which can be transformed to a Hermitian problem with symmetric spectrum. The linear response eigenvalue problem is a subclass of BSE. Structure-preserving iterative methods will be investigated for computing a few smallest eigenvalues. (3) Reliable detection of instability of nonlinear eigenproblems. Evaluation of the distance of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem to instability largely depends on robust computation of the rightmost eigenvalues of a sequence of perturbed problems. Algorithms based on functions of matrices approximated by rational Krylov subspace methods will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is concerned with developing a novel reduced-order model based methodology for inverse scattering and for imaging of periodic, dispersive structures in nano-photonics. Reduced-order models are extensively used in the dynamical-systems community; however, their use in inverse problems has been limited. The inverse scattering problems in this project are formulated for typical setups, where data are gathered by arrays of sensors that probe an unknown heterogeneous medium with waves and measure the returns. Rather than asking the question ""which scattering medium could have caused the measured wave returns"" directly, this novel methodology first constructs a reduced-order model from the measured data. The reduced-order model is defined to preserve the physics of wave propagation. The research is motivated by applications in nondestructive evaluation of materials, estimation of sea ice thickness using airborne radar, medical imaging, oil exploration and nano-photonics. Open source software will be provided in the scope of this project<br/> <br/>This project seeks new directions in inverse scattering and reduced-order modeling. It shows how to view wave propagation as a dynamical system driven by a linear operator that contains information about the medium, modeled by unknown coefficients in the acoustic or electromagnetic wave equation. The dynamical system framework allows the connection to reduced-order modeling techniques, which need to be adapted in order to be useful in inverse scattering. The project pursues this goal for the following specific questions: (1) How can one control waves for improved focusing and subsequent improved imaging, in a pixel scanning fashion? (2) How can one construct and use a ROM for quantitative estimation of the coefficients in the governing wave equations? (3) How can one invert in lossy media? The latter question is connected to an important problem in reduced-order modeling, concerned with the identification of port-Hamiltonian dynamical systems from measurements of their transfer function. This project also seeks to develop model-driven ROMs for dispersive, periodic nano-photonic structures, for speeding up design optimization and parametric inversion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Starting from this collaborative work, the investigators plan to disseminate the proposed model, methods, and code packages to more engineers and scientists for solving their problems, present the work in professional conferences and colloquia, and organize special sessions in conferences for related works. <br/><br/>In the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method for plasma simulation involving materials, the electric potential is governed by the second-order elliptic interface problem with discontinuous dielectric coefficients and non-homogeneous flux jumps. Immersed finite element (IFE) methods are a class of accurate and efficient numerical methods for solving interface problems on structured meshes, which are desirable in PIC method because of the efficient particle-mesh interactions. However, in simulations involving conductors, one usually only knows the total electric charge quantity on the conductor surface, not the surface charge density, which is necessary for solving the second-order elliptic interface equation. Therefore, this project will start from the modeling for an inverse interface problem to identify the surface charge density based on the lab experiment data. According to the lab data availability, different mathematical considerations of the data in the cost functionals will lead to various adjoint problems. Then efficient iterative algorithms based on IFEs will be developed to solve the inverse problem. The key techniques to improve the IFE solver include new trilinear IFE basis functions, a partially penalized scheme, realistic interface shapes, and adaptive mesh refinement based on a posteriori error estimates. The numerical results will be compared with the corresponding lab experiment results.

Although the FDA recently granted approval for a disease-modifying therapy for AD, questions remain regarding the efficacy of removing amyloid plaques for delaying cognitive decline. The conflicting results of clinical trials of anti-amyloid agents as well as the 99% failure rate of trials of other classes of AD treatments are rooted in an incomplete understanding of the complex mechanisms resulting in AD, and how the response to treatment may vary in the individual. Personalized optimization of treatment of AD will likely play a central role in future management and counseling of patients. Such treatment will be facilitated by the growing availability of electronic AD brain data. Although to date there are no clinical markers that can easily distinguish AD patients, nor predict AD risk, mathematical modeling and computational techniques could be helpful for constructing a personalized brain environment virtually to predict AD risk and therapeutic response. This project aims to provide an AD personalized prediction via validating a mathematical model on a multi-institutional dataset of AD biomarkers. Personalized therapeutic simulation studies for AD patients will also be performed via the validated mathematical model. Through their involvement with this project, graduate and undergraduate students will receive interdisciplinary training in both mathematical biology and AD research.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to develop an operational understanding of AD using an integrated mathematical modeling approach, based on clinical, omics, imaging, and other biomarker data to accelerate drug discovery. The project will use publicly available data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database to develop a personalized multifactorial mathematical model of AD progression that identifies patient-specific triggers, predicts disease trajectory, and simulates therapeutic response. The investigators plan to accomplish the objective through three specific aims: 1) Validate a newly developed mathematical model of AD using patient data from the ADNI database; 2) Expand the AD model by integrating spatial information available from multidimensional imaging biomarkers; 3) Develop personalized therapeutic plans for AD patients via mathematical modeling. At the completion of the project, the investigators expect to have a personalizable, data-driven mathematical model that will yield future personal biomarker trajectory predictions as well as model-optimized single or combination therapeutic strategies.

Examples include models of weather systems, ocean circulation, contaminant transport, porous media flow, or spread of infectious diseases. Models governing complex systems typically include a large number of parameters that are needed for a full model specification. Typically, some of the model parameters are uncertain and need to be estimated using indirect measurements. This is done by solving an inverse problem that uses the model and measurement data to estimate the unknown parameters. Measurements are often scarce and noisy. Moreover, not all parameters can be estimated due to lack of data that informs them or the sheer computational cost associated with estimating all model parameters. This project makes fundamental contributions to parameter estimation and model-based prediction by establishing methods for assessing sensitivity of the solution of parameter estimation problems to additional model uncertainties and for making principled decisions on the choices of experiments one needs to conduct to obtain measurement data. The latter, i.e., the experimental design problem, is a crucial aspect of successful parameter estimation as it enables making judicious use of scarce experimental resources to obtain informative data. The PI will disseminate research results through peer-reviewed publications, organization of mini-symposia at international conferences, and release of open-source software.  <br/><br/>This project will support 1 graduate student each of the three years of the project. This research program focuses on Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) with infinite-dimensional parameters. Examples include estimation of boundary conditions or coefficient functions in PDE models. Available measurement data are usually not sufficient to simultaneously inform all of the model parameters. Hence, the governing model typically contains parameters, herein referred to as auxiliary parameters, which are uncertain but must be specified for a complete model characterization necessary for an inverse problem formulation. An important question regarding such parameterized inverse problems is: what is the relative importance of the different auxiliary parameters to the solution of the inverse problem? This is addressed by developing a sensitivity analysis framework, called hyper-differential sensitivity analysis (HDSA), for large-scale Bayesian inverse problems. Another key aspect of successful parameter estimation is collection of informative experimental data. Physical or budgetary constraints often put severe limits on the amount of data that can be collected. Therefore, optimal data acquisition is crucial; this can be tackled through optimal experimental design (OED). This research program will bring about key advances in computational methods for PDE-based Bayesian inverse problems by developing methods for (i) analyzing the sensitivity of the solution of a Bayesian inverse problem to auxiliary parameters and (ii) fast computation of optimal experimental designs. The proposed methods achieve these goals through an intricate combination of rigorous methods from numerical analysis, randomized linear algebra, probability, and optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viscoelastic properties of materials are a result of dissipative processes that could stem from nonlinear wave energy dissipation in atomic lattices, from grain boundaries dislocations in thin films and polycrystalline materials, or from damage, fracturing, and repairing at the microscale in polymers and biological materials. In biomedical applications, changes in viscoelasticity of soft tissues often serve as an important biomarker associated with specific malignancies and have a diagnostic value for the detection, characterization, and monitoring of arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and various cancers. Recent advances in reduced order modeling of large scale systems have enabled us to approach many practical problems viewed as unsolvable ten years ago. However, viscoelastic modeling and imaging are still challenging problems. Wave propagation in viscoelastic media is characterized by attenuation and dispersion effects, which are absent in the case of elastic materials. This project will develop an efficient computational method for imaging of viscoelastic media and simulation of attenuating waves propagating in dissipative materials.<br/><br/>The project develops an extension of the Stieltjes-Krein continuous fraction reduced order modeling method to dissipative viscoelastic systems. This very efficient method is based on the Stieltjes network realizations of nondissipative problems and currently cannot be applied to problems with dissipation and dispersion. The project will eliminate this limitation and extend the method to dissipative viscoelastic systems.  Three main components of the approach are the following: (1) Efficient dissipative sparse network realizations of ROMs for viscoelastic problems by generalizing the matrix continued-fraction approach beyond Stieltjes-Krein theory; (2) Multiscale simulation framework based on dissipative sparse network approximations of Neumann-to-Dirichlet maps; (3) Extension of the network embedding approach to dissipative problems and direct nonlinear imaging algorithms for viscoelastic media.

As a result, the development of efficient algorithms for classification tasks is an important research area. One approach, machine learning,  has proved successful in classification tasks, but it is usually focused on data points in vector spaces. In many applications, however, instances of data are naturally interpreted as entire point clouds, or as distributions, and do not lie in a vector space. Furthermore, the high dimension of such datasets leads to theoretical and computational challenges. This project is devoted to the development of classification algorithms for high-dimensional datasets consisting of distributions, and will focus both on their theoretical analysis and computational efficiency. To this end, the principal investigator will use the framework of optimal transport, which provides a natural way of comparing distributions. Students will be involved and trained in interdisciplinary aspects of this project.<br/><br/>This project applies knowledge from computational optimal transport, such as linear embeddings and regularized optimization, and machine learning algorithms, to study classification tasks for datasets consisting of distributions. The main goal is to develop approximation methods with guaranteed error bounds that also allow for algorithmic insights and efficient implementation. Open problems on approximation power, computational feasibility, and numerical analysis will be addressed. Specifically, the project addresses four fundamental questions that arise in the field: (1) What are the types of distributions that can be classified with traditional machine learning techniques through linear embeddings, and how does the choice of a regularizer affect accuracy? (2) How well can the Wasserstein distance and Wasserstein barycenters be approximated through linear embeddings using Euclidean distances? (3) Under which conditions can we guarantee separability with simple classifiers in the embedding space for disjoint classes of distributions? (4) How can we tailor our framework to address various applications, such as classifying structures in audio or video segments?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many existing computational models can sometimes predict unphysical structures and also suffer from inefficiency in large scale computations, especially when the system of interest involves nonlinear and nonlocal interactions. On the other hand, some powerful numerical methods have been designed to approximate the interfacial structures in a stable and efficient manner. This can only happen if numerical methods are designed to preserve the underlying physical structures of the system of interest. The purpose of this project is to bring together researchers with complementary backgrounds to come up with a unified computational model to investigate the interfacial structure and dynamics with nonlocal and nonlinear interactions. The model will largely improve the efficiency of computations for interfacial structures, as well as correctly describe key quantities of interest in equilibria and dynamic structures of an underlying interfacial system. In addition, the mathematical modeling techniques and computational methods of this project will address key scientific challenges in applied mathematics, and meet basic research needs and provide necessary modeling tools for the applications to other systems involving interface problems. Besides, the computational model can provide theoretical guidance on producing nanostructured materials, which will ultimately promote a wide range of contemporary engineering applications such as materials synthesis, nanomedicine, and nanotechnology. Further important impacts will be research oriented curriculum development, mentoring undergraduate/graduate students to take part in the project, and the engagement of various outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project focuses on developing a unified computational phase field model to investigate the complex interfacial structures with nonlinear and nonlocal interactions. Though some existing phase field approaches can be applied to model simple periodic structures such as lamellar, spherical, bicontinuous syroidsin block copolymers, some other interesting patterns are overlooked and have not been well studied theoretically. Therefore one needs to examine the variational problem in its full generality from a mathematically more sophisticated point of view, one which in particular allows for a fuller analysis of the competition between different terms in the system of interest. The inclusion of the general nonlocal and nonlinear interactions in this research project can characterize a broader class of features of microphase separation and pattern formation for interfacial structures, and provide more insights on theoretical studies of these subjects. The PIs will develop efficient, stable and accurate numerical methods for the system of interest. More specifically, asymptotically compatible, maximum principle preserving and energy stable schemes will be explored to preserve specific physical structures of the system of interest at the level of numerical approximations. Additionally, the designed numerical solvers will be used for the systematic study of materials science applications such as block copolymer melts and the bubble assemblies of the block copolymer system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these problems are inherently non-linear and non-smooth, which makes the development of algorithms and their analysis extremely challenging. The project aims to create new optimization algorithms that will overcome these challenges and that are widely applicable. The precise target applications include, magnetic drug targeting, quantum spin chains, harmonic maps, structure design, and solving inverse problems using machine learning. Open-source software will be created and collaborations with practitioners will be carried out to maximize the impact of the work.<br/><br/>The applications described above can be modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs). These PDEs are geometric (harmonic maps), nonlocal (fractional), multiphysics (magnetic drug delivery), multiscale with an unknown domain, i.e., free boundary problems (FBPs). The goal of this project is to study optimization problems with PDE constraints, i.e., PDE constrained optimization. Specifically, it aims to create new optimization methods based on Deep Learning and Augmented Lagrangian frameworks to solve several currently intractable optimization problems, for instance, problems constrained by advection dominated (also limiting transport equations) arising in magnetic targeted drug delivery. All these problems are nonlinear, nonconvex, and non-smooth in nature. Novel optimization algorithms will provide new insights into nonconvex non-smooth problems. In particular for optimization problems with state or gradient constraints, where concepts from set-valued analysis are typically needed. The deep learning work will help create new research directions. Cancerous cells absorb only a small amount of medicine, magnetic drug targeting has shown to increase this absorption rate without harming vital organs. This research will also improve our understanding of magnetic fluids and will create mathematical understanding of control of conservation laws. Nonlocal problems are increasingly important in science and engineering. They lead, for instance, to better models for quantum spin chains, cardiac electrical response, additive manufacturing (materials science), image denoising and phase separation. Open-source software will be created. This will not only benefit scientists in optimization, FBPs, and nonlocal problems but also scientists in nonlinear PDEs and data science.

The project will explore and extend the novel analytic techniques the PI recently developed to prove the admissibility, stability, and convergence of a simple non-monotone narrow-stencil finite difference method for stationary Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations.  Another objective is to formalize an abstract convergence framework based on the notion of generalized monotonicity rather than standard monotonicity, as the new methods do not require the use of wide-stencils.  The new narrow-stencil methods are easy to formulate and implement and have higher-order truncation errors than monotone methods when first-order terms are present in the PDE.

Traditional machine learning algorithms often lack scalable computational complexity, while modern approaches lack solid mathematical foundations. Moreover, high data dimensionality creates challenges for traditional methods of data analysis. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to combine classic dimension reduction methods with data-driven distances, so that both the distance and embedding procedure are data dependent. This novel approach allows for greater flexibility in balancing the density-based and geometric features of the data, achieves a density-based simplification of geometry, and insightfully represents the data in a small number of dimensions. In contrast to black box methods such as deep learning, the developed methodology can be rigorously analyzed to derive strong theoretical guarantees for several statistical and machine learning tasks.

These metrics are both density-sensitive and geometry-preserving, with the balance governed by the choice of a single parameter p. By utilizing the space of paths through data, the PIs will obtain density based metrics and embeddings while avoiding the explicit computation of a density estimator, which may be unreliable in a large number of dimensions. The PIs will propose a simple yet highly flexible data model which does not assume the data is sampled from a manifold or collection of manifolds, and investigate the continuous limit of these metrics and an associated graph Laplacian operator. By continuously varying the parameter p, the PIs will propose to create data videos which represent the data from multiple perspectives. The PIs will investigate both multidimensional scaling and graph Laplacian embeddings as mechanisms for obtaining path-based low dimensional representations, and will explore fast algorithms with scalable computational complexity for approximating these metrics.

Each of these will be an essential component of the work for this proposal. The first of these is critical and from a mathematical viewpoint typically the most challenging. Without such a result we have no guarantee that even finding a solution to the mathematical problem allows us to correlate this with the actual physical solution.  In each of the works we anticipate this will require the greatest effort and challenges.   Answering the stability question will be essential for us to determine: ""given a tolerance level between our constructed solution and the actual one, what is the allowed maximal error in the data measurements that will allow us to achieve this."" Of course, to carry this out one needs a reconstruction method and each algorithm, even if it provides a solution, may require a different error bound on the data.  Thus in some sense the question we have to answer is not only if a computational algorithm can be found, but in what sense is it near to being optimal? This latter question is one where the work of a mathematically strong undergraduate student can be engaged.  Mentoring of such students will be an aspect of this work. This project will support 3 undergraduate students each year of the 3 year grant. <br/><br/>Specifically, the recovery of the nonlinear terms in nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations and systems of parabolic type is sought; that is, coefficients such as the conductivity or the reaction or interaction terms that depends on the solution itself.  An example here is a (spatially or environment variable) rate coefficient in a complex inter-species interaction term that itself has to be determined as is typical in sophisticated epidemic models. Also considered are nonlinear hyperbolic equations occurring in, for example, medical imaging.  Nonlinear acoustics has a term  that essentially represents the object to be reconstructed and this is coupled to a second term that arises from the nonlinear model and appears as a coefficient in the leading term of the partial differential operator. The simplest model that retains the nonlinear effects is to take this to be the identity operator but a more realistic case is to assume this is more complex and additionally seek its recovery. The damped or attenuated wave equation occurs in many areas of physics and engineering.  The usual assumption is the damping mechanism is proportional to velocity so that a time-derivative term is incorporated into the basic equation.  It is often been observed in applications such as acoustics, viscoelasticity, structural vibration and seismic wave propagation, that the magnitude of the damping is frequency dependent and obeys a power law behavior.  A typical formulation involves operators of nonlocal type and these are usually based on fractional derivatives or fractional powers of differential operators.  The aim is to explore these effects with particular emphasis on asking whether the inverse problems are more tractable (that is, in terms of ill-conditioning and convergence of numerical methods) for both types of damping.  In all cases, the analysis of iterative schemes to recover the unknown terms is an essential feature of the work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will improve on current approaches and will formulate a new polarizable multipole implicit solvent model with improved and enhanced modeling accuracy. Furthermore, efficient and accurate numerical algorithms will be developed to meet computational challenges of the new model. This research will provide biophysicists a new tool for analyzing electrostatic interactions of solvated biomolecules in the form of models and algorithms implemented in a freely available software package. In addition, this project will offer interdisciplinary research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in biological modeling, computation, and mathematical analysis.<br/><br/>The project will address limitations in the existing implicit solvent models for studying electrostatic interaction between solutes. These include the facts that the solute charge sources are often modeled as point charges located at atomic centers, and this rough approximation to the quantum mechanical charge density is known to be a major source of the modeling errors. Moreover, polarization, an important physical phenomenon account for the redistribution of the electron density in the presence of an external electric field is missing in this point charge model. The project will develop a novel nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model associated with an atomic polarizable multipole (PM) force field to describe the self-consistent polarization process and study electrostatic interactions among permanent multipoles, induced dipoles, and reaction-field potential. The coupling of PM source with the nonlinear PB (NPB) equation, as opposed to the linearized PB, is challenging in many aspects involving modeling and numerical difficulties such as charge singularities, geometric complexity, interface jumps, nonlinearity, polarization, as well as high computational cost. To overcome such difficulties, a set of efficient, accurate, and seamlessly coupled numerical methods will be developed to resolve numerical challenges associated with the PM-NPB model. In particular, multipole charge singularities are regularized using Green?s function based decomposition; self-consistent polarization, which involves repeatedly solving an NPB equation across the molecular interface, is efficiently realized by a linearized iterative algorithm coupled with a fast 3D Augmented Matched Interface and Boundary (AMIB) method. Finally, model benchmarking and biological applications will be carried out to ensure that the research results provide a robust tool for simulating electrostatic interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project uses computational algebra to attack such problems. The main themes are: (1) Data Analysis, (2) Graphics, visualization, geometric modeling, (3) Computer science and computational complexity. A main problem in Data Analysis is to extract meaning from a massive dataset: imagine a dense, cloud of moving points. One approach is to freeze the cloud at a moment in time, and then increase the size of the individual points until nearby groups coalesce. Topological Data Analysis uses sophisticated mathematical tools to study the problem, and has led to insights into visual cortex activity, cancer pathology, and viral evolution. Companies from Boeing to Pixar use computer graphics and geometric modeling in applications ranging from analyzing turbulent fluid flow (air passage over a plane's wing) to accurate simulations and virtual reality. Key mathematical tools are splines, which provide a way of assembling a coherent big picture from local pieces. A third theme of this project is the modeling of dynamic processes, which often comes down to multiplying (massive) matrices many times (a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers).  Finding efficient ways to multiply matrices is the topic of a subfield of Computer Science known as complexity theory. The project builds on prior work of the PI using algebraic objects known as permanents to provide insight into the problem. While at his previous position at Iowa State, the PI partnered with the Iowa State Veterans Center to provide extra math tutoring and support for student veterans, including an intensive day long Math Boot Camp at the start of each semester. In this project, he will develop similar programs at Auburn, with the first boot camp planned for fall 2021.<br/><br/>The proposal revolves around a few main themes: permanents, polytopal parameterizations, and persistent homology, approximation theory and splines. The first group of topics is unified by homological methods and simplicial complexes, and the second by the interplay of algebra and discrete geometry; the objects of investigation are central players in computational mathematics. The problems share three traits: they are of importance in real world applications; subtle geometric or combinatorial data is reflected algebraically; and they are computationally tractable. The project will use the power of computational algebra to discover hidden connections between important applied invariants and geometry, combinatorics, and algebra. There are elegant characterizations of key invariants for applications (e.g. dimension of the spline space for a polytopal subdivision, equations for Wachspress parametric surfaces, the support locus of persistent homology) in terms of algebra. The concrete and computational aspect of the problems means they are ideal for involving graduate students and postdocs, and makes prospects for progress excellent. In addition to scientific advances, the project will result in development of specialized software, to be coauthored with students and integrated into the NSF-sponsored Macaulay2 software package.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project the PI aims to develop, together with students and a postdoctoral associate, rigorous analyses of approximation techniques for nonsmooth, nonlinear, and nonlocal systems that describe a wide range of phenomena. The analysis will require a careful interplay between subtle smoothness properties of the solutions and the fine structure of the problems and schemes at hand.

Model reduction (complexity reduction) has become a ubiquitous tool that makes these repeated numerical simulations computationally tractable by exploiting intrinsic low-rank structures in the system dynamics. However, most of today's model reduction methods exploit linear structures that are present only in a limited class of problems, which excludes, for example, important problems with transport phenomena that describe waves and other moving coherent structures. This severely limits the use of today's model reduction methods in a wide range of applications from multi-phase problems in materials science to combustion in engineering to pattern formation in biology. The goal of this project is to develop new types of model reduction methods at the intersection of machine learning, numerical analysis, and scientific computing that exploit nonlinear structures to make tractable repeated simulations of transport phenomena to support scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The nonlinear model reduction techniques proposed in this project will derive reduced solutions on manifolds as compositions of low-rank approximations. This means that the traditional linear vector-space structure of today's model reduction methods is given up in favor of increased expressiveness (""breaking the Kolmogorov barrier""). The work packages are as follows: (i) New approximation theory concepts will be developed to show for prototypical transport-dominated partial differential equations that the proposed reduced models break the Kolmogorov barrier of today's linear model reduction methods, meaning the best-approximation error of the proposed nonlinear models decays exponentially faster than the best-approximation error of linear models. (ii) Numerical methods will be proposed that exploit the nonlinear low rankness of the composed approximations of the proposed nonlinear reduced models to achieve speedups compared to traditional models. The nonlinear solutions will be numerically computed by integrating in time the governing equations to ensure that the nonlinear reduced models generalize well to new inputs/parameters, in contrast to purely relying on data-fitted maps without going back to the governing equations. (iii) Two real-world applications in collaborations with domain scientists in storm-surge forecasting and additive manufacturing will demonstrate that the proposed techniques have the potential to impact a wide range of applications that currently are limited by prohibitively expensive simulations of transport phenomena.

The scientific thrust of this project is devoted to the development of numerical simulation tools for wave propagation in anisotropic and inhomogeneous media. The principal application targeted is wave propagation in aeroacoustics to study the noise generated by a turbo-reactor in a flow, where the source of inhomogeneity and anisotropy is the non-uniform air flow around the engine.

Instead, the new methods rely on basis functions that are approximate solutions of the governing equation rather than exact solutions.

The goal of this project is to develop the next generation of mathematical and algorithmic tools that can harness the information content of large datasets acquired from experiments and observations to create coherent representations of complex systems, and use these representations to perform prediction, and ultimately, control. These objectives will be addressed through a novel combination of mathematical techniques, bridging dynamical systems theory and differential geometry with machine learning and data science.

For these tools to be accepted by the scientific community, a rigorous mathematical framework is required to match the verifiability and quantifiability of the classical modeling approach.  Recently, a new tool called the diffusion forecast has been developed based on provably consistent estimators, which learn the unknown structure of a large class of stochastic dynamical systems on manifolds.  Moreover, the results of many published numerical experiments indicate that this framework can be applied far beyond the restricted context of the current theory.  In particular, the evidence suggests that the consistency proofs can be extended to non-autonomous projections of complex systems, deterministic chaotic systems represented by non-compact operators, non-smooth domains such as fractal attractors, and even generalized tensors on metric-measure spaces.

An abrupt ecological change, a new disruptive technology, a global economic downturn, or an emerging pandemic ? any such game-changer event may transform the planning environment and shift the priorities of decision makers.  Reactive planning is often the norm in practice, with the working assumption that global mode switches are too rare and unlikely to take them into account.  But if a statistical characterization of such switches is available, using it in strategic planning can significantly improve the performance of the controlled system.  Models with these features arise naturally in many research areas including economics, behavioral ecology, public policy, robotic navigation, evolutionary biology, and security applications (e.g., preventing illegal logging or wildlife poaching). PI will develop efficient numerical methods for controlling such systems, focusing on trade-offs between the average-case optimality and robustness (interpreted as minimizing the probability of undesirable outcomes.) This project will support 2 graduate students in each of the first two years and 1 graduate student in the third year. <br/><br/>Piecewise-Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) provide an excellent framework for modeling large-scale stochastic perturbations of the global environment.  The aleatoric uncertainty due to such perturbations is an important feature of realistic control problems, but until recently it has attracted far less attention in mathematical literature than the diffusive perturbations  studied in ``classical'' stochastic optimal control theory.  Practitioners often want to model these environment-switch uncertainties as well as time-structured information accumulation patterns present in their applications.   Moreover, it may not be enough for them to optimize the expected value of the outcome.  They often need to maximize the probability of good outcomes while imposing constraints on the worst-case scenario.  To accomplish this, we need to modify the partial differential equations (PDEs) encoding the optimal behavior, and this presents a range of new computational challenges: free boundaries, discontinuities, higher dimensionality of the state space, and larger systems of coupled nonlinear PDEs.  We propose to study the trade-offs involved in using such modified models and to develop numerical methods to solve them efficiently.  In the PDMP setting, even the traditional risk-neutral approach of optimizing the expected performance can be computationally costly since it involves solving a coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations.  We develop several approaches for decreasing this computational cost by constructing new discretization schemes and leveraging efficient methods previously developed for fully deterministic problems.  We also extend our recent approach for optimizing the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the total cost incurred by a stochastic switching system. This is accomplished by solving a different system of HJB equations on an expanded state space, with ``threshold-optimal'' controls recovered for all starting configurations and all threshold values simultaneously.

The goal in all these projects is to compute the dimension of some space of functions, generally in terms of combinatorial and geometric data, and if possible to find a basis for that space. The theoretical tools to be employed are homological algebra and algebraic geometry; the investigations also use computation as a vehicle for experiment. The project will result in development of specialized software, which will be integrated into the Macaulay2 software package.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Viscoelastic properties of materials are a result of dissipative processes that could stem from nonlinear wave energy dissipation in atomic lattices, from grain boundaries dislocations in thin films and polycrystalline materials, or from damage, fracturing, and repairing at the microscale in polymers and biological materials. In biomedical applications, changes in viscoelasticity of soft tissues often serve as an important biomarker associated with specific malignancies and have a diagnostic value for the detection, characterization, and monitoring of arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and various cancers. Recent advances in reduced order modeling of large scale systems have enabled us to approach many practical problems viewed as unsolvable ten years ago. However, viscoelastic modeling and imaging are still challenging problems. Wave propagation in viscoelastic media is characterized by attenuation and dispersion effects, which are absent in the case of elastic materials. This project will develop an efficient computational method for imaging of viscoelastic media and simulation of attenuating waves propagating in dissipative materials.<br/><br/>The project develops an extension of the Stieltjes-Krein continuous fraction reduced order modeling method to dissipative viscoelastic systems. This very efficient method is based on the Stieltjes network realizations of nondissipative problems and currently cannot be applied to problems with dissipation and dispersion. The project will eliminate this limitation and extend the method to dissipative viscoelastic systems.  Three main components of the approach are the following: (1) Efficient dissipative sparse network realizations of ROMs for viscoelastic problems by generalizing the matrix continued-fraction approach beyond Stieltjes-Krein theory; (2) Multiscale simulation framework based on dissipative sparse network approximations of Neumann-to-Dirichlet maps; (3) Extension of the network embedding approach to dissipative problems and direct nonlinear imaging algorithms for viscoelastic media. The method will lead to an orders-of-magnitude reduction in the computational cost of large-scale wave propagation simulations as well as novel direct imaging algorithms for scattering problems based on network embedding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first class of applications has relevance for oil-water-surfactant systems, which are important in  oil recovery, development of environmentally friendly solvents, consumer and commercial cleaning product formulations, and drug delivery systems. The crystal models to be studied will be useful in detecting topological defects within crystalline materials, a task which is of great interest in the material science community. Specific examples include supercooled liquids, crack propagation in a ductile material, and applications relating to photonics and semiconductors, cell structure substrates and MRI contrast agents.?A major challenge impeding their use by the general mathematical and scientific community has been a lack of understanding of these complex systems. This?project will build efficient algorithms for simulation that will support the study of these processes and the design of advanced materials. The project will provide opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students and introduce them to the theory and implementation of state-of-the-art numerical methods. <br/><br/>In this project the PIs will develop C0 interior penalty finite element methods for the two classes?of applications and mathematical models. The C0 interior penalty finite element method was originally constructed to handle fourth-order elliptic problems arising in mechanics, but its adaptations have been applied to other fourth- and sixth-order partial differential equations. The focus of this project is on numerical methods for time-dependent sixth-order partial differential equations. The high derivative order in combination with a time-dependent component presents many challenges to the creation of stable, convergent, and efficient numerical methods approximating solutions to these models. The work to be accomplished includes the establishment of formal proofs for the unique solvability, stability, and convergence of the proposed numerical methods. The largest challenge will be to develop a framework which establishes optimal order error estimates. Finally, in order to improve upon the efficiency of the proposed numerical methods, the PIs plan to develop efficient solvers for space-time discretized systems using operator-splitting techniques and space-time adaptivity based on a posteriori error estimates obtained by the goal-oriented dual weighted approach.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Computational Mathematics program, and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite their great successes in many practical applications, it is widely accepted that approximation properties of neural networks are not yet well-understood. This project would have the potential to understand why and how neural networks work, particularly, why a neural network is much better than other functional classes for computer simulations of problems with singularities and discontinuities. The self-adaptive neural network method developed in this project would have the potential to dramatically improve the computational capabilities for computer simulations of complex physical, biological, and human-engineered systems exhibiting computational difficulties. Understanding of the role of neural network width and depth in approximation and the new ideas gained in this project would have significant impacts on many other artificial intelligence tasks such as transfer learning, online control, and pattern recognition. Training of at least one graduate on the topics of the proposed research is expected. <br/><br/>A fundamental, open question in machine learning is on how to design the architecture of neural networks, in terms of their width and depth, in order to approximate functions or numerically solve partial differential equations accurately and efficiently. Addressing this issue for applications to computationally challenging problems is the focus of this project. More precisely, for any given partial differential equation, this project is going to develop an adaptive neuron enhancement (ANE) method that adaptively constructs a neural network with a nearly minimum number of neurons and parameters such that its approximation accuracy is within the prescribed tolerance. A key component of developing ANE methods is an error indicator for determining the number of new neurons to be added at either the current or next layer.  This project plans to develop efficient indicators by studying the role of additional neurons in the current and next layers. This knowledge is crucial for designing efficient and accurate ANE methods, but is generally not provided by the standard a priori error estimates. The exceptional approximation powers of neural networks come with a price: the procedure for determining the values of the parameters is now a problem in nonlinear optimization even if the underlying partial differential equation is linear. Nonlinear optimizations usually have many solutions, and the desired one is obtained only if one starts from a close enough first approximation. The ANE method to be developed in this project is a good continuation process. This project will focus on how to initialize parameters of new neurons at each adaptive stage of the ANE method. This will be done by analyzing the physical meanings of neurons at each layer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Institute will be held July 19-August 28, 2021 online; more information can be found on its website (http://geometry.institute).  Overall, SGI aims to accomplish the following objectives: (1) spark wide collaboration among students and researchers in geometry processing, (2) launch inter-university research projects in geometry processing involving team members across broad levels of seniority (undergraduate, graduate, faculty, industrial researcher), (3) introduce students to geometry processing research and development, and (4) diversify the ""pipeline"" of students entering geometry processing research, in terms of gender, race, socioeconomic background, and home institution. The first week of the Institute will train undergraduate and MS student participants on state-of-the-art techniques in geometry processing, intended as their first exposure to this discipline.  Then, for the remaining weeks, student teams collaborate on research problems, with the goal of exploring directions suggested by senior attendees.  Beyond these day-long interactions, visitors will give talks on frontier areas and lead relevant tutorials.  The opportunity cost for students taking six weeks to participate will be covered by the workshop.  <br/><br/>As a discipline, geometry processing presents substantial theoretical challenges motivated by practical considerations of manufacturing/fabrication, computer vision, physical simulation, and high-performance computing.  Participants will be exposed to---and will advance state-of-the-art in---technical problems ranging from the development of a toolkit for discrete differential geometry to the incorporation of probability/uncertainty in the shape processing pipeline.  Participating in geometry processing research also gives mathematics students exposure to fields like differential geometry in a more tangible environment, coupled with computer visualizations and concrete applications with immediate impact.  Our workshop is designed to make progress on several concrete challenges in geometry processing, including development of robust geometry processing algorithms, design of high-throughput shape analysis methods, design of sensible machine learning architectures for understanding and processing geometry built on foundations from differential/algebraic geometry, and extending machinery from geometry processing to higher-dimensional problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, risk-adverse decision-makers are often interested in solutions that provide a good trade-off between the expected return and risk, which can be modeled naturally as the ratio function. Also, fractional objectives can be used for feature selection and clustering in data mining as well as for solving isoperimetric problems on graphs that can be applied for error-correcting codes and image segmentation. There are no adequate solution approaches for these classes of optimization problems if they involve integrality and/or combinatorial restrictions (constraints). Therefore, if successful, the proposed research will substantially enhance the ability to solve these hard classes of optimization problems and can lead to a more widespread use of single- and multiple-ratio fractional measures in existing and emerging applications.<br/><br/>The project's main goal is to develop computational approaches with the solid underlying theoretical foundation, that deliver provably good solutions and can be used to solve realistically sized instances of single- and multiple-ratio fractional combinatorial optimization problems. In order to do so, the investigators propose to systematically exploit the combinatorial structure of the feasible region and structural properties of the ratio functions to construct strong convex relaxations of the fractional combinatorial optimization problems. The investigators will also explore single- and multiple-ratio fractional combinatorial optimization problems under parameter uncertainty. The proposed research, unlike most of previous work in the related literature, does not enforce restrictive simplifying assumptions on either the combinatorial structure induced by the constraint set or the number of ratios. Furthermore, the research does not rely on assuming that the functions in the numerators and denominators of the ratios are affine. The proposed approaches draw ideas and will contribute to the literature of mathematical optimization, particularly conic, fractional and discrete optimization, combinatorics, and algebraic graph theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
