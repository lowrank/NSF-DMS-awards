Numerical analysts develop algorithms for simulating these systems by solving PDEs on a computer; these simulations enable engineers and scientists to develop prototypes and to interpret data from sensors. For example, the NSF-funded Nobel-winning detection of gravitational waves would not have been possible without advances in numerical analysis. In recent decades, numerical analysts discovered that ideas from differential geometry, an area of pure mathematics, can be used to develop good algorithms for solving PDEs. In fact, these ideas help not only for geometric problems in fields of study like computer vision and general relativity, but also for fields like electromagnetism that have little to do with geometry. Although applying differential geometry to numerical analysis has been very successful, thus far this link has been explored only for a small number of differential geometry ideas. In this project, the investigators will continue exploring this link, taking more ideas from differential geometry and applying them to develop new numerical algorithms. These algorithms could then be used both in applied areas, by solving PDEs in science and engineering, and in pure areas, by solving PDEs in differential geometry itself. The project will also support the training of graduate student researchers.<br/><br/>This project focuses on problems at the cusp of numerical analysis and differential geometry.  It deals specifically with the design of finite element methods for PDEs that involve vector fields and tensor fields on Riemannian manifolds.  In the long term, these efforts have the potential to lead to robust numerical methods for solving geometric PDEs like the Einstein field equations, which are useful for studying gravitational wave signals, as well as PDEs like the elasticity equations, which model how objects deform under stress. This project has three main goals. The first is to develop a new family of finite elements for discretizing algebraic curvature tensors and other bi-forms---tensor products of differential forms---on simplicial triangulations. The second goal is to develop an intrinsic finite element discretization of the Bochner Laplacian, which is a basic differential operator in Riemannian geometry that differs from the familiar Hodge Laplacian from finite element exterior calculus. The third goal is to leverage what we learn to design numerical methods for a wide range of geometric problems, such as computing spectra of elliptic operators on manifolds, simulating intrinsic geometric flows, and solving prescribed curvature problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mean field games have strong descriptive power in socioeconomics and biology, e.g. in the understanding of social cooperation, stock markets, trading and economics, biological systems, election dynamics, population games, robotic control, machine learning, dynamics of multiple populations, pandemic modeling and control as well as vaccination distribution. It is therefore essential to develop accurate numerical methods for large-scale mean field games and their model recovery. However, current computational approaches for the recovery problem are impractical in high dimensions. This project will comprehensively study new computational methods for both large-scale mean field games and their model recovery. The comprehensive plans will cover algorithmic development, theoretical analysis, numerical implementation and practical applications. The project will also involve research on speeding up the forward and inverse problem computations to speed up the computation for mean field game modeling and turn real life mean field game model recovery problems from computationally unaffordable to affordable. The research team will disseminate results through publications, professional presentations, the training of graduate students at the University of California, Riverside as well as through public outreach events that involve public talks and engagement with high school math fairs. The goals of these outreach events are to increase public literacy and public engagement in mathematics, improve STEM education and educator development, and broaden participation of women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The project will provide novel computational methods for both forward and inverse problems of mean field games. The team will (1) develop two new numerical methods for forward problems in mean field games, namely monotone inclusion with Benamou-Brenier's formulation and extragradient algorithm with moving anchoring; (2) develop three new numerical methods for inverse problems in mean field games with only boundary measurements, namely a three-operator splitting scheme, a semi-smooth Newton acceleration method, and a direct sampling method. Both theoretical analysis and practical implementations will be emphasized. In particular, numerical methods for inverse problems for mean field games, which is a main target of the project, will be designed to work with only boundary measurements.  This represents a brand new field in inverse problems and optimization. The project will also seek the simultaneous reconstruction of coefficients in the severely ill-posed case when only noisy boundary measurements from one or two measurement events are available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Successful completion of this project should stimulate the mathematical research for topological insulators and beyond. The developed computational frameworks will also provide physical experimentalists and engineers with the computational tools to improve the performance and functionalities of topological materials.

First, based on the spectral analysis of the PDE operators in periodic media, a new optimization framework through the enforcement of parity for the eigenfunctions will be built to solve for wave insulators that attain Dirac points at desired Bloch wave vectors and eigenfrequencies. Numerical algorithms based on the construction of wave propagators in periodic media and the design of the spectral indicator function will be developed to efficiently identify the interface parameters that allow for the existence of edge modes in joint topological wave insulators. Finally, efficient convex semidefinite programming based numerical methods will be developed for solving the optimization problems that arise from maximizing the band gaps of the PDE operators for topological wave insulators in order to enlarge the spectral bandwidth of edge modes.

Solving these problems typically requires iterative algorithms like Newton's method, which linearizes the nonlinear problem in each iteration. Newton's method is known for its rapid local convergence. However, the convergence theory only applies when the initialization is (very) close to the unknown solution. Thus, relying on local convergence theory is often impractical. Farther from the solution, small Newton updates are typically necessary to prevent divergence, leading to slow overall convergence. This project aims to develop better nonlinear solvers. This will benefit outer-loop problems, such as parameter estimation, learning, control, or design problems, which typically require solving many nonlinear (inner) problems. The project will also support the training and research of at least one graduate student, the mentoring of undergraduate students through the Courant?s Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program, and the outreach to K-12 students through the cSplash activity in New York City.<br/><br/>To address issues of slow nonlinear convergence, This project aims to develop methods that lift the nonlinear system to a higher-dimensional space, enabling the application of nonlinear transformations that can mitigate nonlinearity before Newton linearization. The project will develop and systematically study the resulting novel Newton methods for severely nonlinear systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed lifting and transformation method can be interpreted as nonlinear preconditioning, a research area much less developed than preconditioning for linear systems. The goal of this project is to study for which classes of nonlinear PDE problems this approach improves convergence, to theoretically analyze why, and to make these methods a more broadly accessible tool for solving severely nonlinear systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The continuous problem is well-posed. The numerical schemes are well-posed, parameter-robust, and convergent. It is even possible to prove convergence rates. However, the situation is more precarious for modern, complex systems of equations. Oftentimes, the uniqueness of solutions is not known. Even when there is uniqueness, the theory is far from complete, and so besides (weak) convergence of numerical solutions, little can be said about their behavior. In these scenarios, one must settle for simpler yet still relevant goals. An important goal in this front is that of structure preservation. The study of structure preservation in numerical methods is not new. Geometric numerical integration, many methods for electromagnetism, the finite element exterior calculus, and some novel approaches to hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, have this goal in mind: geometric, algebraic, or differential constraints must be preserved. This project does not focus on the problems mentioned above. Instead, it studies structure preservation in some evolution problems that have, possibly degenerate, diffusive behavior. This class of problems remains a largely unexplored topic when it comes to numerical discretizations. Bridging this gap will enhance modeling and prediction capabilities since diffusive models can be found in every aspect of scientific inquiry.<br/><br/>This project is focused on a class of diffusive problems in which stability of the solution cannot be obtained by standard energy arguments, in other words, by testing the equation with the solution to assert that certain space-time norms are under control. Norms are always convex. Structure preservation may then be a generalization of the approach given above. Instead of norms being under control, a (family of) convex functional(s) evaluated at the solution behave predictably during the evolution. The project aims to develop numerical schemes that mimic this in the discrete setting. While this is a largely unexplored topic, at the same time, many of the problems under consideration can be used to describe a wide range of phenomena. In particular, the project will develop new numerical schemes for an emerging theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, active scalar equations, and a class of problems in hyperbolic geometry. These models have a very rich intrinsic structure and a wide range of applications, and the developments of this project will serve as a stepping stone to bring these tools to the numerical treatment of more general problems. The students involved in the project will be trained in exciting, mathematically and computationally challenging, and practically relevant areas of research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these simulations are hampered by the limitations of currently available numerical methodologies. Specifically, complex systems are driven by multiple simultaneous physical processes with different dynamic characteristics, e.g., atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric transport. Consequently, different components evolve at different rates, some very fast (e.g., concentrations of chemical tracers) and some very slow (e.g., ocean temperature). Traditional numerical methods are ill-suited to solve complex systems with multiple scales and multiple dynamics.  This project develops new numerical algorithms that solve different complex system components with different discretizations and different time steps. This new approach will allow accurate and efficient simulations of complex systems and will positively impact many fields in science and engineering.<br/><br/>A novel hybrid time integration framework will be constructed to co-simulate complex systems governed by time-dependent partial differential equations. The particular innovation of the hybrid methodology is that it combines discrete and continuous internal stages during each integration step. The mathematical framework offers local truncation error estimates (unlike operator splitting), and provides solutions that do not depend on the convergence of an outer iteration process (unlike relaxation). It allows us to build methods with a higher order of accuracy than current co-simulation methodologies.

This project seeks to develop new numerical methods that address these needs. The methods under consideration belong to the family of integral equation methods, which attain asymptotically optimal cost in the solution of certain (""linear homogeneous exterior elliptic boundary value"") problems. The project seeks to extend them to challenging nonlinear settings, while improving their efficiency when modeling boundary layers, and developing new methods for the case where volume contributions are needed. Examples of technical fields in which such methods are needed include the project's motivating applications, which will be used to demonstrate our methods' efficacy: (1) Wetting problems, relevant across chemical engineering and biology. (2) Nonlinear plasmonics, a promising avenue for the construction of optical networks. Accurate computer simulation can help confirm or refute scientific theories by comparison with experiment, can replace experiments, and can be used in engineering design processes. The PhD students trained under the project will add to the nation's scarce expert labor supply, and the methods and open-source software released under the project will enable science and industry users around the world to deploy the newly-developed methods for the advancement of science.<br/><br/>Since they are based on the superposition principle, integral equation methods (IEMs) are not often used to solve partial differential equation (PDE) problems with nonlinearities. This project removes important obstacles to the adoption of IEMs in such a setting, and it validates the case for them through two ambitious motivating nonlinear model applications involving interfaces. The efficient solution of elliptic (i.e. globally coupled) computational problems remains a major challenge, and IEMs have crucial strengths in this area. While one major strength of IEMs is the use of boundary (i.e. lower-dimensional) unknowns to represent volume solutions, the presence of nonlinearities invariably necessitates the use of volume unknowns. We demonstrate that this use can often be kept localized, particularly in problems modeling interfaces, while maintaining IEM's suitability for problems on unbounded domains. We propose a new method for the evaluation of the resulting volume potentials that retains high-order accuracy in the presence of complex geometry. The project builds on recent advances made by the PI on high-order accurate fast algorithms for the evaluation of layer potentials, the building blocks of IEMs, in the presence of complex geometry in two and three dimensions. We further propose research leading to major efficiency gains in the underlying singular quadrature method and, motivated by empirical observations, a theoretical investigation of the influence of geometry on the accuracy of that method. A final line of proposed research concerns the reduction of resolution demands posed by boundary layers, embodied in IEMs by rapidly-decaying Green's functions, which often result in increases of computational cost that threaten to make certain simulations infeasible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By integrating research findings into university courses and involving students from potentially diverse backgrounds, the project will help prepare the next generation of mathematicians and engineers. Additionally, it aims to share breakthroughs with broader communities through journal publications, workshops, and conferences, while also connecting students with real-world industry applications.<br/><br/>As previously stated, the project aims to address the challenge of compressing large neural networks, which are pivotal in modern AI applications but are resource-intensive. Thus, the research will focus on developing algorithms that reduce the computational demands of these networks by minimizing the memory and power needed without compromising their performance. Our approach involves three main strategies, quantization, pruning, and low-rank approximation. Among these, quantization transforms neural network parameters into formats that require fewer bits, thus reducing memory usage and computational intensity. Meanwhile, pruning selectively removes less important parameters from the network to streamline computations. Finally, low-rank approximation replaces large matrices representing the weights in the network with products of smaller matrices, in a way that retains essential information while requiring less memory and computation.  We will develop algorithmic approaches for quantization, pruning, and low-rank approximation that are underpinned by rigorous mathematical theories to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of the compressed models. In our analysis, we will utilize stochastic process theory, geometric functional analysis, discrete geometry, discrepancy theory, optimization theory, compressed sensing, and dimensionality reduction, to name a few. These diverse areas will help us establish a solid theoretical foundation for our algorithms consisting of lower bounds on best-possible theoretical error guarantees as well as upper bounds on the errors resulting from our algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These models play a prominent role in many applications. A very important example that will receive particular attention is the evolution of the internal structure (microstructure) of polycrystalline materials, such as most metals and ceramics, during manufacturing processes such as heat treatment (annealing). Polycrystalline materials are very common. They are composed of tiny crystallites, known as grains, stuck together. During annealing, the boundaries between the grains, described by a network of surfaces, start to move as some grains get larger, while others shrink and disappear. The shapes and sizes of the grains making up these materials are known to have profound implications for their physical properties, such as their strength and conductivity. Materials scientists have long had mathematical models that describe the motion of the network of grains; what has been lacking is accurate, efficient, reliable, and flexible numerical methods that would allow them to compare large scale simulations of their models against experimental measurements. In recent years, as experimental measurements of time evolution of the three dimensional internal structure of materials have become available, the need for algorithms to simulate the relevant models have become increasingly acute. The project will take steps to address this need. Resulting algorithms will be implemented in software, which will be made available to the broader scientific community. The project will also support the training and research of one graduate student working towards a Ph.D. in mathematics.<br/><br/>The project will take a new approach to designing level set methods for multiphase geometric motions such as motion by mean curvature of networks of surfaces. It will exploit a precise, mathematical connection between a particular discretization of the level set formulation of motion by mean curvature, known as the median filter scheme, and another class of algorithms known as threshold dynamics. This will allow extending advantages of one method to the other. The advantage of threshold dynamics is its generality and highly developed theory of stability and convergence. In particular, recent advances in our theoretical understanding of threshold dynamics enabled its extension to the more elaborate microstructure evolution models of interest to materials scientists. Via its precise connection to median filter schemes, elements of this theory will be carried over to level set methods. The new level set methods will allow arbitrary, normal dependent (anisotropic) surface tensions and mobilities to be assigned to any interface in the network of surfaces ? a level of generality that cannot even be attempted by most existing techniques. They will also allow subgrid accuracy in locating the interface even when implemented on uniform grids ? a distinct advantage of the level set method over threshold dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main goal of solving inverse problems is to use measurements to estimate the parameters of physical models. Being able to solve inverse problems efficiently, accurately, and with quantifiable certainty remains an open challenge. Randomized algorithms have made several advances in numerical linear algebra due to their ability to dramatically reduce computational costs without significantly compromising the accuracy of the computations.

This important and often overlooked question was brought to light by the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Several techniques have been used to account for silent spreaders along with varying testing and healthcare seeking habits as the main reasons for under-reporting of incidence cases. It has been observed that silent spreaders play a more significant role in disease progression than previously understood, highlighting the need for policymakers to incorporate these hidden figures into their strategic responses. Unlike other disease parameters, i.e., incubation and recovery rates, the case reporting rate and the time-dependent effective reproduction number are directly influenced by a large number of factors making it impossible to directly quantify these parameters in any meaningful way. This project will advance iteratively regularized numerical algorithms, which have emerged as a powerful tool for reliable estimation (from noise-contaminated data) of infectious disease parameters that are crucial for future projections, prevention, and control. Apart from epidemiology, the project will benefit all real-world applications involving massive amounts of observation data for multiple stages of the inversion process with a shared model parameter. In the course of their theoretical and numerical studies, the PIs will continue to create research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including women and students from groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. A number of project topics are particularly suitable for student research and will be used to train some of the next generation of computational mathematicians.<br/><br/>In the framework of this project, the PIs will develop new regularized alternating minimization algorithms for solving ill-posed parameter-estimation problems constrained by nonlinear dynamics. While significant computational challenges are shared by both deterministic trust-region and Bayesian methods (such as numerical solutions requiring solutions to possibly complex ODE or PDE systems at every step of the iterative process), the team will address these challenges by constructing a family of fast and stable iteratively regularized optimization algorithms, which carefully alternate between updating model parameters and state variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Boltzmann equation is often regarded as the first-principle model for plasmas; however, its numerical simulation is prohibitively expensive even on today?s most powerful supercomputers. The challenges manifest as: 1) High-dimensionality. The Boltzmann equation resides in six-dimensional phase space. Hence, full 6D deterministic simulation requires excessive computing effort and memory. 2) Collision operator. Collisions between particles are described by nonlinear, nonlocal integral operators that are extremely difficult to approximate. Yet, they play a critical role in driving the system towards local thermodynamic equilibrium and must be included in the simulation, especially in transition and fluid regimes. 3) Multiple scales. Plasmas inherently exhibit multiscale physics. Different scaling can lead to different asymptotic models. How to conduct efficient kinetic simulations such that multiscale behaviors are properly captured is a long-standing problem. The overall objective of this project is to develop a set of ultra-efficient deterministic numerical methods for multiscale kinetic plasma simulations. The algorithms to be developed in this project have the potential to provide high-fidelity kinetic plasma simulations across a range of regimes at a manageable computational cost. <br/><br/>The basic framework we will employ is the dynamical low-rank method (DLRM), a robust dimension reduction technique for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations. In essence, DLRM can be viewed as a time-dependent singular value decomposition; instead of solving the 6D equation, it tracks the dynamics of low-rank factors of the solution, which depend on either the three-dimensional position variable or the three-dimensional velocity variable, thus drastically reducing the computational cost and memory footprint. Our focus will be on the nonlinear collisional kinetic equations for plasmas, allowing us to address a broader range of regimes beyond the collisionless ones. We will design an efficient low-rank ansatz inspired by various asymptotic limits of plasma kinetic equations such that the method only requires a few ranks in the limiting regime and is as efficient as solving the reduced fluid models. We will also study the uniform stability and longtime behavior of DLRM rigorously, justifying the method's robustness for treating multiscale problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on computational methods for control of optimal transport and mixing of some quantity of interest in fluid flows.  The question of what fluid flow maximizes mixing rate, slows it down, or even steers a quantity of interest toward a desired target distribution draws great attention from a broad range of scientists and engineers in the area of complex dynamical systems. The goal of this project is to place these problems within a flexible computational framework, and to develop a solution strategy based on optimal control tools, data compression strategies, and methods to reduce the complexity of the mathematical models. This project will also help the training and development of graduate students across different disciplines to conduct collaborative research in optimal transport and mixing, flow control, and computational methods for solving these problems.<br/><br/><br/>The project is concerned with the development and analysis of numerical methods for optimal control for mixing in fluid flows.  More precisely, the transport equation is used to describe the non-dissipative scalar field advected by the incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes flows. The research aims at achieving optimal mixing via an active control of the flow velocity and constructing efficient numerical schemes for solving this problem. Various control designs will be investigated to steer the fluid flows. Sparsity of the optimal boundary control will be promoted via a non-smooth penalty term in the objective functional. This essentially leads to a highly challenging nonlinear non-smooth control problem for a coupled parabolic and hyperbolic system, or a semi-dissipative system. The project will establish a novel and rigorous mathematical framework and also new accurate and efficient computational techniques for these difficult optimal control problems. Compatible discretization methods for coupled flow and transport will be employed to discretize the controlled system and implement the optimal control designs numerically. Numerical schemes for the highly complicated optimality system will be constructed and analyzed in a systematic fashion. New incremental data compression techniques will be utilized to avoid storing extremely large solution data sets in the iterative solvers, and new model order reduction techniques specifically designed for the optimal mixing problem will be developed to increase efficiency. The synthesis of optimal control and numerical approximation will enable the study of similar phenomena arising in many other complex and real-world flow dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typical examples are coupling of free fluid and porous media flows, fluid-structure interaction, and fluid-poroelastic structure interaction. Applications of interest include climate modeling, interaction of surface and subsurface hydrological systems, fluid flows through fractured or deformable aquifers or reservoirs, evolution of soil structures, arterial flows, perfusion of living tissues, and organ modeling, such as the heart, lungs, and brain. The work presented at the conference will cover both rigorous mathematical and numerical analysis and applications to cutting-edge problems.<br/><br/>The mathematical models describing the multiphysics systems of interest consist of couplings of complex systems of partial differential equations. Examples include the Stokes/Navier-Stokes equations for free fluid flows, the linear or nonlinear elasticity equations for structure mechanics, the Darcy equations for porous media flows, and the Biot equations for poroelasticity. Physical phenomena occurring in different regions are coupled through kinematic and dynamic interface conditions. The modeling and simulation process involves well-posedness analysis of the mathematical models, design and analysis of stable, accurate, and robust numerical methods, and development of efficient solution strategies. Despite significant progress in recent years, many challenges remain in all three areas. Examples include, on the mathematical modeling side, the nonlinear advection term in the Navier Stokes equations in coupled settings, nonlinear fully-coupled flow-transport models, nonlinear diffusion, mobility, and elastic parameters, and non-isothermal effects; on the numerical side, structure preserving and parameter robust discretization methods, a posteriori error estimation and mesh adaptivity in both space and time, multiscale and reduced order models; on the solution side, stable and higher-order loosely-coupled time splitting methods, domain decomposition methods, and parameter-robust monolithic solvers and preconditioners.

SIAM UQ24 is dedicated to recognizing the natural synergy between computational models and statistical methods, strengthened by the emergence of machine learning as a practical tool. Thus, for the first time there will be a large international meeting on the whole UQ ecosystem viewed through a unifying lens. For graduate students and young researchers entering the field of UQ, SIAM UQ24 offers a unique opportunity to learn from and exchange ideas with diverse groups of UQ professionals from academia, industry, and government laboratories. As attractive as this opportunity is, the size and breadth of the conference could be daunting. PoD UQ is targeted to graduate students and young researchers to ease their approach to SIAM UQ24 and ensure they make the most out of it.<br/><br/>The name of the event highlights the central role played by diversity in UQ, a field whose advancement requires the integration of mathematics and statistics, theory and computations. Diversity refers also to the community of under-represented groups that the event targets for greater inclusivity. The goals of PoD UQ are to: (i) Introduce students and early-career researchers to the state-of-the-art and current trends in modeling, sampling, and analyzing uncertainties. The meeting will feature three talks meant to give an overview of the different areas in UQ and two introductory talks on current hot topics. All the talks will be delivered by internationally renowned leaders in the field. In addition, a panel of established UQ researchers will discuss the opportunities and challenges of working in an application-driven and inherently interdisciplinary field that relies on a broad range of mathematical and statistical foundations, domain knowledge, and algorithmic and computational tools. (ii) Offer an excellent chance for networking with both peers and more established researchers. Recognizing the importance of a supportive network in building a career, especially for people from minority groups, the schedule of PoD UQ includes ample time to connect and interact.

Driven by practicality and reinforced by rigor, this project aims to conduct a comprehensive investigation of composite nonconvex optimization problems and games. The technologies developed will offer valuable tools for fundamental science and engineering research, positively impacting the environment and fostering societal integration with the big-data world.

These systems have found applications in diverse fields, including ecology, engineering, and social sciences, yet their high-dimensional nature makes them challenging to study. This often leads to significant theoretical and computational difficulties, known as the ?curse of dimensionality.? Recent advances in applied mathematics have shed light on these complexities, revealing that complex NetID patterns can arise from low dimensional interactions. Building on these insights, this project is dedicated to developing a theoretical and computational framework to address the estimation problems within these models by exploiting the underlying low dimensional structures. The overarching goal is to create efficient, physically interpretable surrogate models that bridge the gap between qualitative analysis and quantitative data-driven applications, ranging from sensor network optimization to modeling the environmental and climate impacts on fish migration. This research program will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, featuring a graduate summer school at the intersection of NetIDs and machine learning. There will be a particular focus on engaging female and underrepresented minority students in this vibrant field, blending machine learning with differential equations. The project's findings will also enrich mathematical data science course materials for both undergraduate and graduate education.<br/><br/>This project aims to make fundamental mathematical, statistical, and computational advances for solving NetIDs' estimation problems. The research will focus on three primary areas: (1) Developing innovative sampling strategies for optimal data recovery in NetIDs with linear interactions by exploiting their inherent low-dimensionality in terms of sparsity, smoothness, low-rankness. (2) Establishing robust statistical estimation of NetIDs with nonlinear time-varying interactions by combining machine learning, numerical analysis, and functional data analysis to create physically consistent estimators that bypass the ?curse of dimensionality,? while exploring the identifiability and convergence as sample sizes increase. (3) Investigating the statistical predictive properties of Graph Neural Differential Equations, aiming to derive upper bounds for their transferability and generalization error. The results of this project are expected to address the computational challenges of large-scale Graph Neural Networks and bridge theory and practice in NetIDs research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The deformation can be elastic, so that when the force is removed the material recovers its original shape. Alternatively, the deformation can be plastic, whereby the material undergoes irreversible changes that may subsequently lead to breakage. Many materials of technological importance exhibit a combination of these two types of deformation depending on the applied force, and are called elasto-plastic. One example are bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are alloys that have an amorphous atomic arrangement in contrast to most metals. BMGs have desirable properties, such as the ability to be processed like plastics, making them attractive candidates for many applications (e.g. next-generation smartphone cases) due to considerable improvements in manufacturing efficiency. However, experimental measurements of BMG breakage properties show wide variations, limiting their usage. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop predictive theoretical and computational models of BMG elasto-plasticity. This project is based on a surprising similarity between the equations for elasto-plastic materials and the equations for incompressible fluids. Using this similarity, computational approaches that were originally developed for fluid flow will be translated to elasto-plasticity. These computational methods will be used in collaboration with theorists and experimentalists to study the fracture properties of BMGs. The ultimate aim is to provide a practical engineering tool for predicting when elasto-plastic materials will break, and how to best design structures using them. This work will be undertaken as part of an integrated program of research, teaching, and mentorship, and will involve outreach activities in New England, including a local library lecture series.<br/><br/>The projection method of Chorin (1968) is a well-established approach for simulating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. This proposal is based on a surprising mathematical correspondence between fluids in the incompressible limit and elasto-plastic solids in the quasi-static limit (when inertia can be neglected). In this proposal, this correspondence is harnessed to translate several modern numerical approaches derived from Chorin's projection method to quasi-static elasto-plasticity, resulting in a practical and powerful set of new simulation tools for a different class of physical problem. Compared to existing techniques, the resultant numerical methods are likely to be especially well-suited to problems involving large plastic deformations. An example type of elasto-plastic material are the bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), which are alloys with many favorable properties such as excellent strength and wear resistance. The numerical methods developed here will be used in a collaboration with theorists and experimentalists to study the fracture toughness properties of BMGs, with the aim of predicting BMG toughness over a wide range of experimental conditions. The PI plans to expand the graduate curriculum in numerical methods to address a pressing need in this area. Open source software will be released as part of this project, and the PI will train students in best practices to make software accessible to a broad audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some examples include shaving cream, blood, and the liquid crystals used in displays (LCD displays) like the one you are probably using right now to read this abstract. On a microscopic scale, the molecules of complex fluids have a special structure, which at a macroscopic scale affects the mechanical response to stress and strain. For instance, the molecules of liquid crystals react to electric fields on a microscopic scale, which on a macroscopic scale changes the polarization of the light passing through the material. Monitors take advantage of this property to allow a certain amount of red, green, or blue light through each pixel. We have barely scratched the surface of what is possible to achieve with complex fluids. Medical researchers hope to exploit the microscopic properties of ferrofluids for magnetic drug targeting, to control with precision the parts of the human body the drug is able to interact with. Materials engineers hope to use complex fluids to assemble nano-structures such as the silicon circuits in CPUs. Mathematical models and computer simulations can be used to describe the dynamics of these fluids. The goal of this research project is to design and analyze new computational algorithms that simulate the behavior of liquid crystals and ferrofluids. The algorithms will be used in simulations which may complement and ultimately replace expensive physical experiments. This research activity may also contribute to our general understanding of pattern formation in complex materials.<br/><br/>Mathematical models for ferrofluids and liquid crystals consist of systems of partial differential equations. Due to the inherent fine scale structure of the fluids under consideration, these partial differential equations are highly nonlinear and coupled. Preserving discrete versions of energy balances, length and other constraints of the solutions of these nonlinear partial differential equations is crucial for obtaining fast and stable numerical schemes that capture realistic scenarios of their dynamics. The aim of this research project is to develop efficient and convergent finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Rosensweig model of ferrohydrodynamics, multi-phase flow models of ferrofluids, and models of liquid crystal flows, that mimic the intrinsic structure of the underlying partial differential equations at the discrete level. The resulting algorithms will be implemented and used for extensive simulations to compare to physical observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, our mathematical understanding of these algorithms is still far beyond their practical development and widespread adoption. Put simply, in many cases we do not know how or why machine learning algorithms work so well, which in turn limits our ability to safely deploy them in safety critical engineering and scientific scenarios. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical formalism and understanding of problems at the intersection of machine learning and science (i.e., scientific machine learning) using rigorous mathematics, leading to novel algorithms and computational methodologies that are interpretable, supported by rigorous theory, and aware of uncertainties.<br/><br/>The project is focused on the development of novel Gaussian Process (GP) based computational frameworks for scientific machine learning that are provably well-posed, robust, and stable, thereby meeting the high standards of scientific computing. The developed methodologies will be capable of rigorous uncertainty quantification and inherit the desirable properties of machine learning algorithms such as flexibility, generalizability, and applicability in high-dimensions. The efforts of the project are directed in three primary directions: (1) GPs for solving nonlinear, high-dimensional and parametric PDEs; (2) GPs for operator learning, emulation, and physics discovery; and (3) GPs for high-dimensional sampling, inference, and generative modeling. Each research direction focuses on the development of algorithms, foundational theory, and concrete applications in engineering and science.

Finite element methods have undergone decades of study by mathematicians, scientists and engineers in many fields and there is a rich mathematical theory concerning them. They are widely used in scientific computing and modelling to generate accurate simulations of a wide variety of physical processes, most notably the deformation of materials and fluid mechanics. By contrast, deep neural networks are relatively new and have only been widely used in the last decade. In this short time, they have demonstrated remarkable empirical performance on a wide variety of machine learning tasks, most notably in computer vision and natural language processing. Despite this great empirical success, there is still a very limited mathematical understanding of why and how deep neural networks work so well. We hope to leverage the success of deep learning to improve numerical methods for partial differential equations and to leverage the theoretical understanding of the finite element method to better understand deep learning. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will also provide a good training experience for junior researchers. This project will support 1 graduate student each year of the three year project. <br/><br/>Piecewise polynomials represent one of the most important functional classes in approximation theory.  In classical approximation theory and numerical methods for partial differential equations, these functional classes are often represented by linear functional spaces associated with a priori given grids, for example, by splines and finite element spaces. In deep learning, function classes are typically represented by a composition of a sequence of linear functions and coordinate-wise non-linearities. One important non-linearity is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function and its powers (ReLUk).  The resulting functional class, ReLUk-DNN, does not form a linear vector space but is rather parameterized non-linearly by a high-dimensional set of parameters.  This function class can be used to solve partial differential equations and we call the resulting numerical algorithms the finite neuron method (FNM). Proposed research topics include: error estimates for the finite neuron method, universal construction of conforming finite elements for arbitrarily high order partial differential equations, an investigation into how and why the finite neuron method gives a much better asymptotic error estimate than the corresponding finite element method, and the development and analysis of efficient algorithms for using the finite neuron method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The meeting aims to achieve three primary goals: (1) Community building in CompMath by bringing together the CompMath community to strengthen and expand the network of NSF-supported PIs. Parallel research sessions serve as a platform to highlight the achievements of the PIs and the CompMath program; (2) Engagement of early career scientists through a poster session designed to highlight their works, activities aimed at the professional development of early career researchers, and travel support for these attendees; (3) A forward-looking report will be compiled by the organizers by leveraging community input that presents an overview of discussions during the meeting and summarizes any strategic community recommendations and outcomes from the meeting focusing on the major achievements of CompMath, current challenges, and exciting new research directions.<br/><br/>The CompMath disciplinary program at NSF supports a variety of research endeavors, which include more classical foci of numerical analysis, PDE solving algorithms, and mathematical optimization, along with the more recent and/or nascent subfields of randomized linear algebra, computational imaging, and mathematical aspects of data science and machine learning. Investigators from these subfields indeed attend their own discipline-specific conferences and professional events and also take opportunities to attend meetings in related fields. However, there is a dearth of meeting opportunities between a large collection of researchers who focus on the broad collection of foundational research questions in CompMath. Because the community of PIs supported by project awards from the NSF CompMath program does not have targeted events/conferences where the community broadly meets, the main motivation for this proposal is to organize such a professional meeting.
