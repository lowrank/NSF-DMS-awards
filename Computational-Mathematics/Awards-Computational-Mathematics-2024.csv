Finite element methods have undergone decades of study by mathematicians, scientists and engineers in many fields and there is a rich mathematical theory concerning them. They are widely used in scientific computing and modelling to generate accurate simulations of a wide variety of physical processes, most notably the deformation of materials and fluid mechanics. By contrast, deep neural networks are relatively new and have only been widely used in the last decade. In this short time, they have demonstrated remarkable empirical performance on a wide variety of machine learning tasks, most notably in computer vision and natural language processing. Despite this great empirical success, there is still a very limited mathematical understanding of why and how deep neural networks work so well. We hope to leverage the success of deep learning to improve numerical methods for partial differential equations and to leverage the theoretical understanding of the finite element method to better understand deep learning. The interdisciplinary nature of the research will also provide a good training experience for junior researchers. This project will support 1 graduate student each year of the three year project. <br/><br/>Piecewise polynomials represent one of the most important functional classes in approximation theory.  In classical approximation theory and numerical methods for partial differential equations, these functional classes are often represented by linear functional spaces associated with a priori given grids, for example, by splines and finite element spaces. In deep learning, function classes are typically represented by a composition of a sequence of linear functions and coordinate-wise non-linearities. One important non-linearity is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function and its powers (ReLUk).  The resulting functional class, ReLUk-DNN, does not form a linear vector space but is rather parameterized non-linearly by a high-dimensional set of parameters.  This function class can be used to solve partial differential equations and we call the resulting numerical algorithms the finite neuron method (FNM). Proposed research topics include: error estimates for the finite neuron method, universal construction of conforming finite elements for arbitrarily high order partial differential equations, an investigation into how and why the finite neuron method gives a much better asymptotic error estimate than the corresponding finite element method, and the development and analysis of efficient algorithms for using the finite neuron method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These technologies have also profoundly transformed sciences with new ideas and algorithms being developed at an immense speed. However, our mathematical understanding of these algorithms is still far beyond their practical development and widespread adoption. Put simply, in many cases we do not know how or why machine learning algorithms work so well, which in turn limits our ability to safely deploy them in safety critical engineering and scientific scenarios. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical formalism and understanding of problems at the intersection of machine learning and science (i.e., scientific machine learning) using rigorous mathematics, leading to novel algorithms and computational methodologies that are interpretable, supported by rigorous theory, and aware of uncertainties.<br/><br/>The project is focused on the development of novel Gaussian Process (GP) based computational frameworks for scientific machine learning that are provably well-posed, robust, and stable, thereby meeting the high standards of scientific computing. The developed methodologies will be capable of rigorous uncertainty quantification and inherit the desirable properties of machine learning algorithms such as flexibility, generalizability, and applicability in high-dimensions. The efforts of the project are directed in three primary directions: (1) GPs for solving nonlinear, high-dimensional and parametric PDEs; (2) GPs for operator learning, emulation, and physics discovery; and (3) GPs for high-dimensional sampling, inference, and generative modeling. Each research direction focuses on the development of algorithms, foundational theory, and concrete applications in engineering and science. The project also contains an extensive education plan focused on machine learning and data science education from high-school through graduate levels with extensive opportunities for training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as local and international outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, analytical tools will hold great promise to provide theoretical guidance on how to acquire data more efficiently than current practices. To retrieve useful information from data, numerical methods will be investigated with emphasis on guaranteed convergence and algorithmic acceleration. Thanks to close interactions with collaborators in data science and information technology, the investigator will ensure the practicability of the proposed research, leading to a real impact. The investigator will also devote herself to various outreach activities in the field of data science. For example, she will initiate a local network of students, faculty members, and domain experts to develop close ties between mathematics and industry as well as to broaden career opportunities for mathematics students. This initiative will have a positive impact on the entire mathematical sciences community. In addition, she will advocate for the integration of mathematical modeling into K-16 education by collaborating with The University of Texas at Dallas Diversity Scholarship Program to reach out to mathematics/sciences teachers.<br/><br/>This project addresses important issues in extracting insights from data and training the next generation in the ""big data"" era. The research focuses on signal/image recovery from a limited number of measurements, in which ""limited"" refers to the fact that the amount of data that can be taken or transmitted is limited by technical or economic constraints. When data is insufficient, one often requires additional information from the application domain to build a mathematical model, followed by numerical methods. Questions to be explored in this project include: (1) how difficult is the process of extracting insights from data? (2) how should reasonable assumptions be taken into account to build a mathematical model? (3) how should an efficient algorithm be designed to find a model solution? More importantly, a feedback loop from insights to data will be introduced, i.e., (4) how to improve upon data acquisition so that information becomes easier to retrieve? As these questions mimic the standard procedure in mathematical modeling, the proposed research provides a plethora of illustrative examples to enrich the education of mathematical modeling. In fact, one of this CAREER award's educational objectives is to advocate the integration of mathematical modeling into K-16 education so that students will develop problem-solving skills in early ages. In addition, the proposed research requires close interactions with domain experts in business, industry, and government (BIG), where real-world problems come from. This requirement helps to fulfill another educational objective, that is, to promote BIG employment by providing adequate training for students in successful approaches to BIG problems together with BIG workforce skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems have found applications in diverse fields, including ecology, engineering, and social sciences, yet their high-dimensional nature makes them challenging to study. This often leads to significant theoretical and computational difficulties, known as the ?curse of dimensionality.? Recent advances in applied mathematics have shed light on these complexities, revealing that complex NetID patterns can arise from low dimensional interactions. Building on these insights, this project is dedicated to developing a theoretical and computational framework to address the estimation problems within these models by exploiting the underlying low dimensional structures. The overarching goal is to create efficient, physically interpretable surrogate models that bridge the gap between qualitative analysis and quantitative data-driven applications, ranging from sensor network optimization to modeling the environmental and climate impacts on fish migration. This research program will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students, featuring a graduate summer school at the intersection of NetIDs and machine learning. There will be a particular focus on engaging female and underrepresented minority students in this vibrant field, blending machine learning with differential equations. The project's findings will also enrich mathematical data science course materials for both undergraduate and graduate education.<br/><br/>This project aims to make fundamental mathematical, statistical, and computational advances for solving NetIDs' estimation problems. The research will focus on three primary areas: (1) Developing innovative sampling strategies for optimal data recovery in NetIDs with linear interactions by exploiting their inherent low-dimensionality in terms of sparsity, smoothness, low-rankness. (2) Establishing robust statistical estimation of NetIDs with nonlinear time-varying interactions by combining machine learning, numerical analysis, and functional data analysis to create physically consistent estimators that bypass the ?curse of dimensionality,? while exploring the identifiability and convergence as sample sizes increase. (3) Investigating the statistical predictive properties of Graph Neural Differential Equations, aiming to derive upper bounds for their transferability and generalization error. The results of this project are expected to address the computational challenges of large-scale Graph Neural Networks and bridge theory and practice in NetIDs research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The meeting is open to all with interest in CompMath, with a particular emphasis on attracting current and recent PIs of the CompMath program, as well as early career researchers such as junior professors, postdocs, and Ph.D. students working in CompMath. The meeting aims to achieve three primary goals: (1) Community building in CompMath by bringing together the CompMath community to strengthen and expand the network of NSF-supported PIs. Parallel research sessions serve as a platform to highlight the achievements of the PIs and the CompMath program; (2) Engagement of early career scientists through a poster session designed to highlight their works, activities aimed at the professional development of early career researchers, and travel support for these attendees; (3) A forward-looking report will be compiled by the organizers by leveraging community input that presents an overview of discussions during the meeting and summarizes any strategic community recommendations and outcomes from the meeting focusing on the major achievements of CompMath, current challenges, and exciting new research directions.<br/><br/>The CompMath disciplinary program at NSF supports a variety of research endeavors, which include more classical foci of numerical analysis, PDE solving algorithms, and mathematical optimization, along with the more recent and/or nascent subfields of randomized linear algebra, computational imaging, and mathematical aspects of data science and machine learning. Investigators from these subfields indeed attend their own discipline-specific conferences and professional events and also take opportunities to attend meetings in related fields. However, there is a dearth of meeting opportunities between a large collection of researchers who focus on the broad collection of foundational research questions in CompMath. Because the community of PIs supported by project awards from the NSF CompMath program does not have targeted events/conferences where the community broadly meets, the main motivation for this proposal is to organize such a professional meeting. The PI meeting will feature focused presentation sessions where PI?s will highlight their NSF-supported work in the previously described technical research areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some examples include shaving cream, blood, and the liquid crystals used in displays (LCD displays) like the one you are probably using right now to read this abstract. On a microscopic scale, the molecules of complex fluids have a special structure, which at a macroscopic scale affects the mechanical response to stress and strain. For instance, the molecules of liquid crystals react to electric fields on a microscopic scale, which on a macroscopic scale changes the polarization of the light passing through the material. Monitors take advantage of this property to allow a certain amount of red, green, or blue light through each pixel. We have barely scratched the surface of what is possible to achieve with complex fluids. Medical researchers hope to exploit the microscopic properties of ferrofluids for magnetic drug targeting, to control with precision the parts of the human body the drug is able to interact with. Materials engineers hope to use complex fluids to assemble nano-structures such as the silicon circuits in CPUs. Mathematical models and computer simulations can be used to describe the dynamics of these fluids. The goal of this research project is to design and analyze new computational algorithms that simulate the behavior of liquid crystals and ferrofluids. The algorithms will be used in simulations which may complement and ultimately replace expensive physical experiments. This research activity may also contribute to our general understanding of pattern formation in complex materials.<br/><br/>Mathematical models for ferrofluids and liquid crystals consist of systems of partial differential equations. Due to the inherent fine scale structure of the fluids under consideration, these partial differential equations are highly nonlinear and coupled. Preserving discrete versions of energy balances, length and other constraints of the solutions of these nonlinear partial differential equations is crucial for obtaining fast and stable numerical schemes that capture realistic scenarios of their dynamics. The aim of this research project is to develop efficient and convergent finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods for the Rosensweig model of ferrohydrodynamics, multi-phase flow models of ferrofluids, and models of liquid crystal flows, that mimic the intrinsic structure of the underlying partial differential equations at the discrete level. The resulting algorithms will be implemented and used for extensive simulations to compare to physical observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multiphysics systems model the physical interactions between two or more media, such as couplings of fluid flows, rigid or deformable porous media, and elastic structures. Typical examples are coupling of free fluid and porous media flows, fluid-structure interaction, and fluid-poroelastic structure interaction. Applications of interest include climate modeling, interaction of surface and subsurface hydrological systems, fluid flows through fractured or deformable aquifers or reservoirs, evolution of soil structures, arterial flows, perfusion of living tissues, and organ modeling, such as the heart, lungs, and brain. The work presented at the conference will cover both rigorous mathematical and numerical analysis and applications to cutting-edge problems.<br/><br/>The mathematical models describing the multiphysics systems of interest consist of couplings of complex systems of partial differential equations. Examples include the Stokes/Navier-Stokes equations for free fluid flows, the linear or nonlinear elasticity equations for structure mechanics, the Darcy equations for porous media flows, and the Biot equations for poroelasticity. Physical phenomena occurring in different regions are coupled through kinematic and dynamic interface conditions. The modeling and simulation process involves well-posedness analysis of the mathematical models, design and analysis of stable, accurate, and robust numerical methods, and development of efficient solution strategies. Despite significant progress in recent years, many challenges remain in all three areas. Examples include, on the mathematical modeling side, the nonlinear advection term in the Navier Stokes equations in coupled settings, nonlinear fully-coupled flow-transport models, nonlinear diffusion, mobility, and elastic parameters, and non-isothermal effects; on the numerical side, structure preserving and parameter robust discretization methods, a posteriori error estimation and mesh adaptivity in both space and time, multiscale and reduced order models; on the solution side, stable and higher-order loosely-coupled time splitting methods, domain decomposition methods, and parameter-robust monolithic solvers and preconditioners.
