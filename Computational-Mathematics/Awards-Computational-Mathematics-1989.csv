The theoretical aspects of this project may be considered as                    applied analysis and efficiency in computations and                             implementation is emphasized in the applications.  One of the                   problems addressed is to determine the approximation power of a                 multivariate spline space.  Once it is known, the next step is                  to identify a much lower dimensional subspace with the same                     approximation power so that specific features of this subspace                  can be used to efficiently construct approximates with optimal                  order of approximation.  Another problem is to develop                          efficient schemes that guarantee the optimal order of                           approximation.  Since interpolation is sometimes expensive to                   attain, and in some situations may not even be desirable, it is                 also important to study the constrution of quasi-interpolants.                  Recently the investigators have characterized all                               quasi-interpolants induced by a compactly supported function to                 gridded data.  From this, one should be able to study                           quasi-interpolants with ""minimum support"".  For scattered data,                 the problem will be approached via vertex splines.  One of the                  most important applications of multivariate splines is the                      construction of approximants that have certain shape preserving                 characteristics.  Part of this project is to apply the theory                   developed during the previous project to investigate the                        implications of that approach to shape preserving problems.                     Finally, the basic problems on dimension and construction of                    local bases of the important subspaces will be investigated                     further."

Work on inverse scattering continues efforts to study higher               dimensional problems by means of a new approach derived from                    methods of several complex variables: the d-bar method.  Although               this approach has had considerable formal success in two space                  dimensions and some success in higher dimensions, very few                      problems have been analyzed rigorously.  In particular, work will               be done on problems with large potentials or with general                       singular scattering data.                                                            Recent analyses of the d-bar-Neumann problem associated to                 domains in a complex manifold have shown that the corresponding                 trace of the heat kernel (for the heat equation) has a small time               asymptotic, expansion whose coefficients are integrals of local                 geometric invariants, including the logarithmic terms.  Very                    little is known about these invariants beyond some general                      results about their form and degree of homogeneity.  Work will                  continue in efforts to elicit more concrete information.                             New proofs of the boundedness of the Cauchy integral and                   other singular integral using special bases has opened up areas                 of exploration both in operator theory and numerical analysis.                  Using basic Littlewood-Paley theory, one can translate the T(1)                 theorem of David and Journe into an effective numerical tool.                   This powerful result establishes the boundedness of a singular                  operator solely through its action on the constant functions.                   Work will be done in representing integral operators in wavelet                 bases as matrices which decay rapidly off the diagonal.  These                  techniques can be shown to produce considerable reduction in                    complexity in the discrete approximation to the operators.  A                   wide range of applicability of these ideas to signal and image                  processing is expected as a consequence of this research.                            Other work will focus on relationships between the Cauchy                  integral, analytic capacity and rectifiable sets.  Work directed                at characterizing rectifiable curves has led to new insights into               the traveling salesman problem.  Further applications will be                   considered relative to the problem of estimating the integral of                the derivative of a conformal mapping and on determining the                    relationship between analytic capacity and Favard length of                     compact planar sets.  Although they are not equivalent                          quantities, it is likely that they do agree on sets of finite                   one-dimensional Hausdorff measure.  Work will be done to resolve                this issue.  //"

Three of the topics are involved with                   synchronous and asynchronous parallel iterative methods for                     numerical solution of linear systems of equations.  The                         remaining two topics are involved with matrix theory and linear                 algebra.  In particular, they are 1) an analytic approach to                    nonnegative bases for the generalized eigenspace of nonnegative                 matrix and 2) the determination of reachability sets for                        nonnegative orthant of a linear dynamic system approximated by                  finite differences."

The mathematics                    involves matrix-valued functions on planar regions such as the                  disc. Among these there is a particularly well-behaved class of                 functions called analytic. Best-approximation of more or less                   arbitrary functions by analytic ones, and finding analytic                      functions that take on prescribed values at prescribed points in                the region are problems that turn out to be important in the                    design of feedback stabilized control systems. By applying                      methods of functional analysis and operator theory, Helton seeks                efficient ways of solving problems like these.                                       Helton's point of view is that commutant lifting in operator               theory is nearly equivalent to interpolation theory for matrix-                 valued functions. He will seek to develop a nonlinear commutant                 lifting theory, and to link it with the existing theory of                      nonlinear control systems. He will investigate qualitative and                  numerical aspects of optimization over spaces of analytic                       functions; computational experiment and theoretical insight will                support one another mutually in this part of the project.                       A further aspect of the work involves matrix completion, filling                in the entries of a partially specified matrix so as to make the                result have a particular property such as positivity. Throughout,               Helton will keep in view applications to optimal control and                    worst case design in the frequency domain."

The first objective is to prove injectivity and                     support theorems for generalized Radon transforms in the setting                of real analytic measures on real analytic submanifolds, possibly               in the presence of a group action. Such results for classical                   Radon transforms have been extremely useful for group                           representations, partial differential equations, and tomography.                The second objective is to solve two problems in tomography,                    namely the development of a dose plan algorithm for cancer                      radiation therapy, and the adaptation of an existing algorithm                  for the exterior Radon transform to the non-destructive                         evaluation of rings and rocket exit cones.                                           The gist of the mathematics in this project is as follows.                 Take a manifold (surface, solid, or higher-dimensional analogue)                and a function defined on it. Suppose the manifold is sliced up                 in some fashion and the average of the function over each slice                 is known. The problem is to reconstruct the original function. A                good example is the function that gives the density at each point               of a solid body whose inside is not directly accessible. X-ray                  images give average densities along lines in the direction of the               beam. Tomography is the science of deducing densities inside the                object from an economical number of these images."

The               objective of this research is the application of new iterative                  method techniques to transient problems, stressing the                          implementation on parallel computers.  Two approaches are                       considered here, one to solve a set of implicit difference                      equations that are usually nonlinear, and the other to develop                  methods of the waveform type, which is iteration applied to a                   functional formulation of the transient problem.  The methods to                be employed consist of the analysis and algorithms developed for                both initial value problems and for the iterative solution of                   linear algebraic equations.

The significance                will be to improve efficiency of algorithms for solving large                   scale transient problems on vector and parallel processors."

Another project, more geometric in nature, is to settle completely a Goldbach-like problem in function fields over finite fields. As with the Stark- Conjecture problem, Dr. Hayes will make extensive use of supercomputers in these investigations. Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of mathematics.
