Using  univariate or multivariate time series produced by a  deterministic physical process, the phase space of the process  can be faithfully reconstructed.  Topological and diffeomorphic  embedding theorems guaranteeing this in various physically  verifiable contexts have been the results of previous and ongoing  research by the investigator and coworkers.  Among the many  applications of these mathematical foundations are computational  techniques for noise reduction (filtering) and time series  prediction, to enhance and/or replace conventional methods from  the fields of signal processing and time series analysis, which  are of limited applicability for data from chaotic processes.  A  related task that is targeted by this research is the development  of reliable diagnostics with which to distinguish linear and  nonlinear noise processes from nonlinear dynamics, on the basis  of data measured from experiment or the environment.  New  techniques for these applications are developed in this project,  involving methods from numerical analysis used in conjunction  with existing signal processing methods.  The study of the  validity of computer simulations of chaotic processes by means of  shadowing is also pursued in conjunction with collaborators.       The central goal of this research is to identify and analyze  nonlinear behaviors in systems, by measurement and analysis of  quantitative signals produced by that system.  New techniques  allow exploitable deterministic descriptions, using the paradigms  of deterministic chaos, for some systems written off earlier as  noise, or as too difficult to study.  Complex phenomena of this  type are being identified in physical, chemical, engineering and  biological/medical settings.  As an example, hippocampal slices  from mammals and other small neural systems are being studied by  the investigator, in conjunction with a g roup of medical  researchers headed by a neurosurgeon specializing in epilepsy,  with the purpose of detecting deterministic information  processing in the brain.  The first mathematical foundations of  the reconstruction techniques pursued in this proposal were  disseminated in 1980, which led almost immediately to intensive  research across several scientific disciplines, the impact of  which has not yet been fully felt.  The investigator has done  previous work on expanding these conceptual foundations and  developing related computational implementations, and under this  proposal will widen their areas of validity and increase their  power for the study of complex systems in natural, experimental,  and engineering-related contexts."

Specifically, they (a) develop fast parallel numerical  methods for the solution of the Boltzmann equation used to model  the transport of neutral and charged particles in 1 and 3 spatial  dimensions; (b) develop multilevel zonal techniques for large  scale computational fluid dynamics applications on parallel  computers; (c) study discretization and solution techniques for  fluid flows in porous media that involve complex geometry with  heterogeneous material properties; (d) develop a new methodology  for the solution of systems of partial differential equations by  introducing new dependent variables and forming a least-squares  functional.  In each case, they exploit and extend multi-level  computational techniques.         These projects are focused on important applications, such as  calculating radiation doses for cancer treatment, ion implantation  for semiconductor development, global weather modeling, fluid flow  over airfoils and through rocket nozzles, oil recovery and  contaminant transport in subsurface water supplies.  They reflect  the growing recognition that effective numerical modeling of  physical phenomena involves several stages - formulation of the  mathematical model, transforming the model into a discrete  problem, and developing algorithms for the numerical solution of  the discrete problem on advanced computers - none of which should  be attempted without consideration for the others.

The case is considered in which a vortex ring is  formed by ejecting an amount of fluid from an opening.  In the  first part of the project, the focus will be on the initial  formation process of axisymmetric rings.  Viscous effects  dominate the flow in an initial time interval and affect the  vortex trajectory and total shed circulation.  The effects of  viscosity by adapting a successful 2-dimensional Navier Stokes  solver for high Reynolds number flow to the axisymmetric case  will be investigated.  Inviscid effects of the flow using a  vortex sheet model will also be studied in order to determine  whether present similarity theory predictions can be adjusted to  better predict the initial flow.  The second part of the project  concerns 3-dimensional dynamics of vortex rings formed at an  opening.  The development of a numerical method to compute  3-dimensional vortex sheet separation at an edge will enable the  study of the stability of these flows, as well as the effects of  nonaxisymmetric openings and nonaxisymmetric forcing.  For this  purpose, a 3-dimensional vortex filament method will be developed  which incorporates vortex separation at a sharp edge and  implements a fast summation algorithm to enable high resolution  calculations.    Understanding the dynamics of vortex rings is essential to  understand more complicated flows such as those that occur in  combustion processes, or in the airborne vortex structures  presenting a hazard to aircraft.  An inviscid numerical model has  been developed for axisymmetric vortex rings generated at a  circular opening.  This model was proven by comparison with  experiment to recover detailed information about the real flow.   In the present work, this model will be extended to 3-dimensional  flows, and will be used to study the stability of the flows, the  effects of non-axisymmetric openings a nd nonaxisymmetric forcing,  as well as the potential applicability of present theoretical  results to predict the flow.  Several of these aspects of the  flow are difficult to understand experimentally or analytically,  and the computations promise to give a deeper insight into the  flow dynamics. In order to perform this work, current numerical  tools available for 2-dimensional flows will be expanded to  3-dimensions."

Major themes are ordinary differential equation theory and  software as applied in method of lines (MOL) algorithms for  time-dependent partial differential equations, theoretical  aspectsof MOL algorithms including error estimation and stability  considerations, the design and development of MOL software,  scientific and engineering applications of MOL software, and the  impact of modern computer architectures, particularly distributed  memory parallel processors, on the structuring and implementation  of MOL algorithms.  The workshop brings together both new and  experienced researchers in the numerical analysis of ordinary and  partial differential equations to discuss the interaction of  their MOL research.  In particular, it facilitates collaboration  among theoreticians, designers of MOL software packages, and  researchers applying the MOL to large scale problems, with the  aim of improving parallel implementations, and identifying  theoretical and practical constraints impacting MOL algorithms.     Many issues of considerable current interest, such as global  climate change or the behavior of contaminants in the  atmosphereor in groundwater, are influenced by a variety of  physical and chemical processes.  These processes can be  simulated by mathematical models solved by techniques in this  workshop.  As tools in the study of these models, researchers  participating in the workshop are developing advanced  computational techniques for use on high performance computing  systems involving parallel processing.  On a computer of this  type, several tasks, sometimes as many as several hundred, can be  executed simultaneously.  As a consequence, it becomes feasible  to solve more realistic, and usually more complex, models than  those previously considered.  The computational speed afforded by  techniques discussed in this workshop permits comprehensive  models that can  lay a firmer scientific foundation for policy  decisions.  With such models, the short-and long-term effects of  a change in policy, for example in emission standards, can be  effectively predicted before a proposed change is actually  implemented."

In particular, issues in robot motion planning and  computation with inexact data are studied in depth.  Robots  maneuver about in a configurations space of allowed  configurations.  The robot controller must have an internal model  of its configuration space.  As the robot learns more about the  external world, its configuration space will change.  Often these  changes are of a fundamentally topological nature: a new obstacle  appears; a new connection is found; a passage is too narrow to  enter.  Before one can design algorithms for robot motion, one  must understand these topological changes and the manner of their  occurrence.  Algorithms for problems of a topological nature will  also be studied.  Problems such as ""compute the degree of a map  from one manifold to another,"" or ""how many components are there  in the complement of a polyhedron?"" are of a fundamentally  topological type and of interest in the field of computer graphics  and combinatorial geometry.  These problems are well understood  from a theoretical and ideal perspective, but in practice there  are several difficulties.  Real world data comes with errors.  These errors raise such issues as, How do we model data with  errors? How does the presence of undetected errors affect the  reliability of the algorithm?  What is meant by general position  in the presence of errors?       Both robot motion planning and computational geometry with  real world data, and real world data comes with errors.

These coherent  fluid patterns, and in particular their persistence and  flow-independent scales, have stimulated a great deal of interest  and investigations among the fluid dynamic community.  Although  it has been found that their appearance and dynamics play a  crucial role in the transition to turbulence and in fully  developed turbulence, our knowledge about streaks in wall-bounded  shear flows is rather limited despite remarkable progress over  the past years. The present proposal aims at investigating the  dynamics of streaks as well as their role in the production and  sustainment of turbulent fluid motion by a nonlinear stability  analysis.  Owing to experimental and computational evidence,  special emphasis will be directed toward the important phase of  the breakdown of streak-like structure.         A combined theoretical and numerical approach will be taken,  employing a Floquet stability analysis where the primary  finite-amplitude disturbance state will consist of a (slowly  decaying) streamwise vortex. The resulting stability equations  for three-dimensional secondary disturbances will then be treated  within a temporal and spatial framework using both asymptotic,  eigenvalue-based tools and transient, initial-value-based  techniques. Direct numerical simulations will be conducted to  complement and scrutinize the theoretical results. The emphasis  of this project will be on the influence of flow parameters on  the overall stability behavior and on the complete  description  of the dynamics of the breakdown process."

Included  within its auspices are theoretical and experimental studies of  various fluid flows, studies of water waves and formation of sand  structures in the near- shore zone of large bodies of water, and  theoretical and experimental studies of liquid crystals. One of  the larger investigations will be concerned with the modelling of  water waves with an eye toward a better understanding of the  interaction of waves travelling in opposite directions. Another  interesting study is concerned with flows in which there is a  balance between dissipative effects and surface tension. Still  another sub-project will reconsider some classical flows such as  flow past a sphere in a pipe, Taylor-Couette flow and the related  issues of stability and vortex breakdown. The complex  mathematical modelling needed to describe exotic materials like  liquid crystals will also be high on the agenda. Allied to all of  these investigations will be the development of specific  theoretical results in partial differential equations and in  numerical analysis. Especially important in the latter area will  be work on highly efficient methods for the solution of large  linear systems arising in the algorithms for the solution of  complicated nonlinear differential equations. The resulting  computer codes will be used in conjunction with experimental work  on all the forementioned topics and the outcomes interpreted  within the relevant theoretical framework.  This work is exciting  for several reasons. First, many of the issues being addressed  are not only of fundamental theoretical importance, but they also  have potential to provide new insights into engineering and  technological design and processing. Secondly, because of the  presence of the fluid mechanics laboratory sited within the  mathematics department at Pe nn State, the group has the ability  to combine theoretical, numerical and experimental work in a  rarely realized close collaboration. In addition, some of the  work on development of optimal numerical techniques will have  impact in a much broader arena of science and engineering  activity than just the confines of the present study."

In such models the cells of a  lattice interact according to rules based on abstractions of the  physics governing a system.  This approach examines the  interactions between the parts of a system--interactions that  lead to the behavior of the system as a whole--and allows  evaluation of what aspects of the underlying detailed physics are  most import to the overall dynamics.  One main goal of the  proposed research is the development of a cellular-computational  model of braided streams that incorporates the basic physics of  free-surface flow over a movable bead.       To date such models have usually been evaluated only  qualitatively due to a lack of a quantitative method of  comparison between the models and data from real systems.  The  second main goal of this project is to develop new data-analysis  techniques base=d on recent advances in dynamical-systems  mathematics that will facilitate quantitative testing of  cellular-computational methods.  Our approach is to treat  downstream series of measurements in spatially extended systems  like the time series of dynamical systems.  Graphs of spatial  ""attractors"" that characterize the downstream development of  various geometrical variables, and discrete iterative plots that  show how the value of these variables influence the values  further downstream, both quantify the interactions between the  parts of a spatially extended system and characterize the  behavior of a system as a whole.  Analyses such as these, applied  to data from natural systems, laboratory experiments, and  computational models, will provide a more effective quantitative  test of the models that existing techniques.  In the proposed  projects such tests will be applied to the braided-stream model  mentioned above and to existing models  of aeolian and subaqueous  bedforms, using data collected form laboratory and field examples  of all three systems.  ***"

Appearance and disappearance of a homoclinic orbit can lead to  creation or destruction of periodic orbits.  Bifurcations of  codimension 2 of homoclinic orbits can play the role of organizing  centers for the interesting dynamics.  Existence of a structurally  unstable connecting orbit can lead to bifurcations associated with  the birth or death of a strange attractor.  Connecting orbits often  arise as traveling wave solutions of parabolic and hyperbolic  PDEs.  Recently Doedel and the investigator developed and analyzed  an accurate, robust, and systematic method for computing branches  of connecting orbits in the case that the solution approaches the  equilibria exponentially as well as in the case of center  manifolds, and considered some applications.  The investigator  extends these results in several directions: 1) Generalizing the  algorithm for locating starting connecting orbits, 2) Improving  detection of bifurcations on a branch and selecting specific  branches, 3) Locating multi-hump homoclinic orbits. 4) Qualitative  global error analysis of orbits for the discretized problem and  Adaptive choice of the truncating interval using a posteriori  error estimates, 5) Computation of connecting orbits in a Banach  space.  Applications include: The completion of the investigation  of the bifurcations of connecting orbits in the sine-Gordon  equation and the Hodgkin&ndash;Huxley equations.  Bifurcations of  traveling wave solutions in the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations and its  generalization: a heteroclinic loop bifurcation, searching for  twisting points.

Bifurcation of heteroclinic orbits in a Bana ch  space, with applications  to the phase field model of  solidification phenomena.

The need is therefore paramount  for the development of software for global analysis of connecting  orbits.  The investigator extends the results obtained under prior  NSF support on development of robust numerical algorithms for  global analysis of connecting orbits and incorporates the  resulting algorithms into AUTO, a well known continuation computer  program,  to make them more accessible to a wider scientific  community.  The investigator also considers various applications  that are of independent interest, and that will also be used to  test and refine the developed algorithms.

The investigators evaluate the advantages of using a  massively parallel supercomputer to conduct the computer  experiments and also examine methods for improving the  computational efficiency.       Positron emission tomography (PET) is an emerging technology  with unique capability for imaging biochemical processes in the  human body.  The motivation for this research is that by  accounting for scattered photons, the diagnostic and research  value of PET data is improved.  Scattered photons is a significant  problem as 10 to 25 percent of detected photons are deflected from  their straight path prior to detection.  Moreover, the fraction of  photons is even greater, 40 to 50 percent, with the latest  generation of PET scanners that use three-dimensional imaging  capability to scan the entire body for cancer detection.  Even as  such, PET is more sensitive for cancer detection and can detect  cancer earlier than computed tomography (CT) and magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI).  PET images can show the vast changes in  sugar metabolism associated with cancerous tumors, whereas the  tumors must grow to a size sufficent to significantly alter the  normal tissue structure in order to be visualized by CT and MRI.  More generally, a proper scatter correction will benefit PET's  ability to detect and quantify the biochemical changes associated  with numerous diseases and particularly those of the heart and  brain."

In the turbulence studies,  the aim is to understand the origins of short-lived coherent  structures and their role in causing intermittent and  non-Kolmogorov-like behavior.  It is important first to gain a  clear picture of weak turbulence theories, the reasons for more  than one Kolmogorov finite flux solution, and to understand the  roles that these solutions play in producing inverse cascades and  the roles that inverse cascades may play in originating collapse  structures.  The principal aim of the studies on pattern  formation  is to extend the previous far-from-onset theories to include a  description of pattern behavior when the local wavenumber is  driven outside of a stability band known as the Busse balloon.   The results of the research so far have led to a properly  regularized theory of patterns that can handle pattern  singularities such as dislocations and disclinations.  Moreover,  the latest work suggests that all point defects of almost  periodic  patterns are composed of the two elementary disclinations.       Patterns of an almost periodic nature arise all over the  place.  One sees them in the sand ripples under an advancing or  receding tide, in geological formations, on the coats of animals,  as fingerprints.  They occur in systems driven far from  equilibrium by some external stress that acts to destabilize  spatially and temporally uniform states and preferentially  amplify  certain shapes and configurations.  Geometrical symmetries, such  as rotation in the plane, lead to degeneracies (the wavelength of  a periodic pattern may be chosen but the direction remains  undetermined) and the competition betwee n the various amplified  states leads to patterns that often consist of a mosaic of almost  periodic patches separated by grain boundaries, domain walls and  point defects.  The goal of this research is to build a  macroscopic field theory for patterns that will unify and  simplify  the behavior of systems seemingly unrelated at the microscopic  level and that can capture both the smooth (field) and singular  (particle) components of the pattern."

These  patterns are associated with narrow reaction zones in which rapid  changes in the dependent variables occur across narrow spatial  regions.  The solutions are obtained using an adaptive  pseudo-spectral method in which coordinate transformations are  introduced during the course of the computation to better resolve  the reaction zone and the associated patterns.  He considers the  formation of modulated traveling waves (MTWs) in cellular flames,  transitions between different types of MTWs and transitions  between MTWs and chaotic patterns, one-step and multiple reaction  mechanisms, the role of thermal expansion of the gas on the  formation and evolution of the patterns, and the formation of  spatial and temporal patterns in condensed phase gasless  combustion.  He also further develops the numerical method to  account for problems where there are multiple regions of rapid  variation.       It has been observed that many combustible mixtures do not  necessarily burn in a unifrom pattern.  Rather, ripples and other  patterns can occur along the flame.  The formation of such  patterns is believed to be an important stage in the transition  from laminar combustion (in which the burning occurs in a  regular,  predictable manner) to turbulent combustion (in which the burning  occurs in an erratic, seemingly random fashion).  An  understanding  of the transition process is an essential prerequisite to control  of the transition process to lead to more efficient burning.  In  many instances these patterns can not be predicted by analytic  means and experiments are much less advanced than for nonreacting  flows.

In  this project the investigators apply sophisticated computing  techniques to the study of knots.  In particular, they continue  the development of a new approach to knots: physical knot theory.   The mathematical knot is given physical properties, and knot  types are distinguished by computations involving these  properties.  For example, knot conformations can be assigned an  energy, and then knot types can be distinguished by considering  minimum energy conformations.  The conceptual basis of the  approach is familiar to researchers in biology, chemistry, and  physics as well as mathematics.  The project produces both  theoretical results and software."

In order to better characterize algorithms with good  practical performance, worst case computational aomplexity results  are complemented, whenever possible, by probabilistic complexity  results. The goal of this study is to better understand practical  performance of interior point methods and eventually to develop  new interior point algorithms with superior numerical efficiency.       The advent of interior point methods has revolutionized the  field of mathematical programming.  On the theoretical side,  interior point methods have been used to prove that some important  classes of optimization problems have polynomial complexity, which  means that such problems are computationally tractable even when a  large number of variables are involved.  On the practical side,  interior point methods have been implemented in several very  efficient codes capable of solving large scale problems arising in  economics, science, and technology that cannot be solved with  classical methods.

The work will involve both the development of  further theoretical knowledge on the numerical methods being used  and the further development of a large computer package (BIEPACK)  to solve BIE on surfaces in three dimensions.  The numerical  analysis problems to be studied include the further development  of theory for the approximation of surfaces, the numerical  integration of singular and nonsingular functions over surfaces,  the use of graded meshes to approximate functions that are  ill-behaved around edges and corners of the surface, and the  iterative solution of the large dense linear systems of equations  which arise when discretizing the BIE.  In addition, new topics  involving the use and numerical solution of BIE are to be  considered.  These include: (1) the use of BIE of the first kind  in solving the Dirichlet and Neumann problems for Laplace's  equation; (2) the approximation and solution of hypersingular  BIE; and (3) the use of ""clustering methods"" to reduce the cost  of the numerical integration and matrix-vector multiplications  that are a part of most numerical methods.  Many of the results  of these studies will be incorporated into the present package  BIEPACK, to both improve its present programs and to extend it to  new BIE.  It is also planned to apply numerical methods that were  developed for BIE to the solution of integral equations arising  in computer graphics, and in particular, the ""rendering  equation"".    Many engineering problems involve the solution of a mathematical  equation called ""Laplace's equation"" or perturbations of it; and  the name ""potential theory"" is given to the study and application  of Laplace's equation and closely related equations.  The Laplace  equation itself occurs in applications such as fluid mechanics  (irrotational incompressible fluid flows), heat transfer,  gravit ational fields, electrostatic fields, and others.   Variations on Laplace's equation occur in fluid mechanics  (Stokes' flows), linear elasticity theory, electromagnetic and  acoustic wave propagation, and other topics.  The solution of  Laplace's equation is a function defined for all points of some  region in space, and the objective is to find this function.  In  three dimensions, this can be a very time-consuming process.   Many analytical and numerical techniques are used to solve  Laplace's equation and related equations, including finite  difference methods, finite element methods, and boundary integral  equation methods.  One of the advantages of the latter is that  the problem is re-defined as a new equation over the boundary of  the original region on which the Laplace equation of interest is  defined, and this can often lead to time savings in the overall  solution process.  The new problem is called a ""boundary integral  equation"" or BIE.  The intention of the present study is to  improve numerical methods for the numerical solution of BIE, as  well as to develop a further theoretical understanding of  numerical methods for solving BIE.  These results will be used to  improve a package, called BIEPACK, that has been developed for  the numerical solution of many BIE for Laplace's equation.  It is  also planned to apply numerical methods that were developed for  BIE to the solution of integral equations arising in computer  graphics."

The focus is on two conformation spaces: polygonal  knots, and harmonic knots, where harmonic knots are those given  by finite Fourier series parametrizations.  Recent theorems  relate the invariants given by these energy functions to  classical invariants such as crossing number.  So this project  should lead to a better understanding of knots realizable with  relatively low degrees of freedom.       Knot theory is the mathematical study of the everyday  objects called knots.

Chaos and solitons have generally been portrayed as  being disparate with the consequence that quantum theory and  chaos have been generally dissociated.  However, the present line  of research points toward mathematical affinities between quantum  field theory and multidimensional nonstationary solitons; these  affinities indicate simpler methods for describing quantum  processes, derivable from classical chaos and network theories.  Algebraic and topological methods for representing the  statistical descriptions of attractor field states will be  explored.   Extension of one-dimensional chaotic soliton models  into two, three and four dimensions with constraints relevant to  observed physics will be a fundamental first step.    An extensive amount of theoretical work has been done in  particular by a long-standing group of mathematicians at the  Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, under the  direction of Dr. I.

A spatially-homogeneous chaotic system is defined to be  extensive if its fractal dimension grows linearly with the volume  of the system.  Theorists hope that extensively chaotic systems  may be amenable to a thermodynamic-like description that  characterizes complex systems through laws relating intensive and  extensive macroscopic (coarse-grained) variables.  Specific  research problems studied are: the identification and analysis of  simplified mathematical models that have experimentally relevant  features of extensive chaos; a comparison of different spatial  correlation lengths for quantifying extensive chaos; a study of  the variation of dimension density and other intensive variables  with system inhomogeneities; the development and testing of  algorithms for estimating fractal dimension densities from time  series; the analysis of the lengthscales and timescales involved  with the transition between non-extensive and extensive chaos; the  identification and testing of Langevin descriptions of extensively  chaotic regimes; and the development of related numerical  algorithms and optimized computer codes for scalable parallel  computers such as the Duke 32-node CM-5 computer.       Many nonequilibrium physical systems---both natural and  manmade---are complex in that they evolve nonperiodically in both  space and time.  An increasingly important theme in many modern  areas of science and technology is how to quantify this complex  behavior.  Why do systems become complex as one varies parameters,  how does one complex state differ from another, and how does  transport of energy and matter depend on complexity?  Recent  experimental advances in the study of fluid flow, of liquid  crystals, of nonlinear optics,  and of chemical excitable media  have identified a new and important class of complex systems to  understand: large homogeneous sustained nonequilibrium systems  that undergo a sudden change from a time-independent homogeneous  state to a non-transient temporally and spatially disordered state  (spatiotemporal chaos).  This research uses a combination of  mathematical analysis and large-scale parallel computing to  explore the properties of carefully chosen models of  spatiotemporal chaos.  Of particular interest is to understand how  complexity grows with the size of a physical system (extensive  chaos) and whether a thermodynamic-like description can be found  in the limit of infinite system size.  An improved understanding of  extensive chaos should improve the design, control, and  optimization of engineering applications, improve the forecasting  of nonperiodic time series, and improve the validation,  efficiency, and accuracy of large-scale computer simulations for  complex systems."

This project will initiate a  collaborative research and reciprocal training program to address  these issues.  The focus will be on the processes of uncertainty  propagation and formal statistical inference about climatic  changes based on raw records from deep lake sediments.  Similar  issues exist and deserve attention in the assessment of data from  deep sea sediments, ice cores, and tree rings.  Technically, the  project concerns statistical calibration of raw data records, and  time series analysis to assess patterns of variation in the  geological records over time.

Cross-  disciplinary training for each investigator will  e a central and  continuing feature of the collaboration.  This will be directed  at bridging the gulf between, on one hand, current standards of  practice in statistical  analysis of paleoclimate data (e.g.  Pisias and Moore 1981; Hagelberg, Pisias and Elgar 1991)  and, on  the other hand accessible and appropriate modern statistical   methods and models.

Geologist Tom Johnson will become familiar with the capabilities  and pitfalls of statistical methods, especially methods of time  series analysis that are currently used in this area, and gain  appreciation of the consequences for  uncertainty assessment in  geochronology.  The investigators anticipate eventual development  of Bayesian methods in statistical calibration at the various  stages of the experimental process, and resulting time series  analysis in assessing cyclical variability in calibrated records.   Both investigators will also become familiar with the statistical  issues and methods of calibration of 14C dates (together with  associated uncertainty assessments) to calendar dates, and with  the recent development of advanced statistical methods in the   field.       This project will eventually lead to focussed research  efforts in developing Bayesian statistical models and methods  appropriate for all stages of the experimental process in  sediment based paleoclimatology, and that will ultimately apply  in other geological and archaeological arenas.  Most  optimistically, it is hoped that this collaboration will seed the  development of an internationally recognised centre for the  statistical analysis of paleoclimate proxy records at Duke  University.  ***"

Solution algorithms are studied for  each of these difficulties from one aspect to another.

These  issues arise in  the analysis of experimental data in molecular biology and  synthetic  polymer chemistry.  The applications include model building and  theoretical  proofs of the structure and mechanism of enzymes that act on DNA,  the  quantization of topological entanglement of molecules in random  polymer  systems, the development of algorithms for the numerical  computation and  simulation of macromolecular structure, and the implementation of  these  algorithms to create mathematical data that one can compare with  experimental data.  In the topological approach to enzymology,  enzymes  vital in cellular metabolism are reacted with circular DNA  substrate.  A  topological enzyme signature is observed in the family of DNA  knots and  links produced by the reaction.  One long-range goal of this  research is  the development of a complete set of experimentally observable  topological  parameters with which to describe and compute enzyme mechanism  and the  structure of the active enzyme-DNA synaptic intermediate,  allowing  mathematical proof of 3-dimensional enzyme-DNA structure, and the  ability  to predict results of future experiments.

The results of this basic research project have potential  utility in  biotechnology, rational drug design and the design and  manufacture of  synthetic polymers.  Before one can harness the manufacturing  power of  bacterial cells, one must first understand what these cells are  capable of,  and then how to control these processes.  In order to combat  viruses in  human disease, and to exploit the ability of viruses to control  cellular   processes, one must understand at a fundamental level what  viruses are  doing.  An integral part of this understanding process is the  study of the  spatial configuration of large flexible molecules.  For example,  the  3-dimensional shape of cellular DNA, RNA and proteins is  crucially  important to their biological function.  Cellular DNA is highly  twisted and  convoluted, and for information retrieval and cell viability,  some  geometric and topological features must be introduced, and others  quickly  removed.  Some enzymes maintain the proper geometry and topology  of DNA in  the cell by passing one strand of DNA through another via an  enzyme-bridged  transient break in the DNA; this enzyme action plays a crucial  role in cell  metabolism, including segregation of daughter chromosomes at the  termination of replication.  Other enzymes break the DNA apart  and  recombine the ends by exchanging them.  These enzymes regulate  the  expression of specific genes, mediate viral integration into and  excision  from the host genome, mediate transposition and repair of DNA,  and  generate antibody and genetic diversity.

Part of the project will involve the study of turbulence, based  on a dynamical systems approach; according to dynamical systems  theory the permanent regime for a turbulent flow is  mathematically represented by an attractor that is a compact set  in the phase space.  It is hoped that the study of this attractor  can improve understanding of the physics of turbulent flows.    The approximation of attractors by smooth finite dimensional  manifolds called Approximate Inertial Manifolds (AIMs) is part of  this study.  On the one hand these manifolds are related to the  concept of slow manifold used in meteorology for data  assimilation.  Used from a different point of view in  computational fluid dynamics they lead, on the other hand, to new  multi-resolution algorithms and to methods of data compression in  scientific computing.  Thus, it is believed that approximations  of this attractor can lead to efficient new algorithms for the  numerical simulation of turbulence.  Finally, a significant part  of the effort will be devoted to problems related to climate and  global changes.  Various models for climate will be investigated  from the mathematical and computational points of view in order  to see how they are connected and what are their domains of  validity.  Such models include the primitive equations of the  atmosphere, the primitive equations with vertical viscosity, and  the geostrophic and quasi geostrophic equations.  Models of this  type will be studied for the atmosphere and for the ocean  separately and also for the Coupled system of Atmosphere and  Ocean (CAO).     The understanding of the equations of fluid mechanics and  turbulence as well as the development of efficient numerical  codes for the solution of these equations are challenging  problems of considerable importance in p articular in industry or  for studies in meteorology or global climate change.  The aims  for this project are three fold: (i) to explore what can be  learned about these problems from the theoretical and  computational viewpoints, using the dynamical systems approach to  turbulence; (ii) to develop new efficient computational  algorithms taking into account the physics of turbulence and well  adapted to the current evolution of large scale computing towards  parallel computing; and (iii) to devote special attention to the  problems related to the study of climate and global changes."

The extension of these  algorithms to problems involving condensed matter involves  modifications to accommodate a realistic condensed phase equation  of state, the inclusion of realistic constitutive relations for  modeling the strength effects in solids, and the development of  robust algorithms for describing vacuum states.

This project is concerned with developing advanced  computational methods, based on methods originally developed to  address aerospace and defense problems, and applying the new  methods to important problems in the geosciences.  These new  computational methods are used to design an improved experimental  technique for determining sound speeds in geophysical materials.  Accurate knowledge of sound speeds is important for the correct  interpretation of seismic data.  The new computational methods are  also used to model the effect the impact of a large comet or  asteroid would have on the Earth.

The equations describing such  problems are then said to be `equivariant' with respect to this  symmetry group.  The focus of this project is to continue to  study systematic techniques for exploiting symmetry in the  numerical solution of such equivariant equations.  This  exploitation leads to more stable solution methods and to a  greatly increased numerical efficiency.  One of the methods  studied by the investigators (the symmetry reduction method) can  be viewed as a generalization of Fourier Transform methods (which  exploit symmetry under a cyclic group).  Among other projects,  the investigators further develop the symmetry reduction method  and study hidden symmetries, optimal equivariant preconditioners  for problems that are only `nearly'equivariant, domain reduction  via symmetries, the numerical solution of nonlinear equivariant  equations and bifurcation phenomena.  Preliminary numerical codes  are further developed into a collection of codes for a range of  important applications.         Geometric symmetries have always played an important role in  theoretical physics and some branches of applied mathematics.  However, exploiting these symmetries has only lately been  developed in the areas of numerical analysis and computational  mathematics.  The aim of this project is to use geometric and  algebraic techniques to give efficient algorithms for solving  large numerical problems that enjoy such symmetries.  Very large  problems are broken down (via symmetry considerations) into  smaller problems that can be handled independently and more  efficiently on modern architectures of high-performance  computing. Problems that are only `nearly' equivariant (i.e.,  where certain symmetry structures have imperfections) occur quite  frequently in engineering (e.g., in elasticity or flow problems,  or in structural mechanics).  An efficient exploitation of these  imperfect sym metries would reduce the computational effort for  solving such problems.  This has two direct benefits: firstly,  one can solve moderately sized problems much faster, possibly in  real time; secondly, very large problems that are inaccessible  via standard methods can be solved with this symmetry reduction  method."

A key element of this  endeavor is the development of statistical estimation algorithms  for the assimilation of data into the forward model.

Ballistic models of computation, for  example, suggest ways to exploit atomic-scale effects for  computer-logic operations.  Fine-grained digital models of  processes traditionally described by continuum methods (e.g.,  fluid dynamics) help in understanding what types of macroscopic  behavior can be obtained from given microscopic laws.         Information Mechanics is the study of computation viewed as a  distinguished mode of operation of dynamical systems with a  physics-like structure.  A main task for information mechanics is  to develop theoretical models of computation that more  expressively and accurately reflect essential aspects of the  underlying physics (such as locality, invertibility, inertia,  quantum character), opening the way to more direct and efficient  physical implementations of computing processes.  Results of this  line of investigation have a direct bearing on the theory and  practice of computation and on the computational modeling of  physics.  For example, logic invertibility is now being exploited  to reduce energy dissipation in computers; and lattice gases  provide theoretical models and simulation tools for a better  understanding of complex fluids."

Several  numerical algorithms for estimating the solution of an ordinary  differential equation can produce highly accurate approximations  at a finite set of points.  It is often desirable to construct a  closed form approximation based on this data; however, the obvious  piecewise polynomial interpolants frequently do not work,  especially for highly nonuniform meshes.  An interpolant based on  local collocation seems to be stable but further analysis and  algorithms are needed.  A related problem is that of finding  interpolants given accurate discrete data for Sturm-Liouville  eigenfunctions: it is desirable to retain the accuracy with an  interpolant having the correct oscillation properties.       The problems to be studied are a natural outgrowth of prior  work that resulted in a widely used software package.  Advances in  both theory and computer implementation are sought.

An additional aim is to study the relationships between various eigensystem algorithms, the related areas of classical real analysis and approximation theory, and applications in signal processing and control.

It is therefore vital to have at hand a variety of reliable, efficient methods for computing eigensystems. The aim of this project is to study and develop new computational methods for analyzing eigensystems. The high-performance computers of today and the near future are organized very differently from older computers and require that new methods be devised and old methods be reorganized to make efficient use of the processing power of the new machines.

The problem is to choose values of parameters, subject to certain limits on their values, so as to make some function of the parameters take on an extreme value. For instance, one might try to locate warehouses so as to minimize the costs of shipping items to individual distribution sites. Or one might choose the placement of structural members to maximize the strength of the structure subject to weight constraints. Problems like these can involve thousands of parameters and tens of thousands of constraints.

It has been shown recently that wavelets are useful as activation functions in neural networks, permitting faster adaptation to required tasks than do sigmoidal activation functions, in common use up to now. The success of wavelet methods has already been impressively demonstrated in important optimization problems using radial basis functions. The work of this project develops better theoretical underpinnings for the construction of neural nets that learn efficiently, and studies minimal complexities of neural nets that emulate ""intelligent"" tasks, e.g., recognition of visual images. The investigators also study the construction of wavelet-based algorithms for image compression. They examine the optimization of signal compression, aiming at an improved theoretical understanding of how such signal compression works from the standpoint of the mapping between functions and their wavelet transforms. Applications of the mathematics proposed here are closely related to the creation of ""intelligent"" systems using neural network technology. This technology in many ways emulates the operation of biological nervous systems. The present work is based on indications that the actions of biological neurons have in some cases been too well emulated in artificial neural systems. It has been shown in the work of Girosi and Poggio and others that attaining desired behavior in neural networks can be better achieved with networks that have ""localized activation functions,"" i.e., ones for which output eventually decreases with very large inputs. An additional issue related to effecting proper input-output behavior using neural networks is knowledge of the basic complexity of certain desired tasks, and how neural networks can best achieve this level of complexity. Such tasks (e.g., the visual recognition of object s) can already be performed by biological neural networks, and have a complexity that can be defined and studied in a relatively precise way, to determine how complicated artificial neural networks need to be in order to emulate the behaviors of the biological networks. In addition, the work on signal compression using wavelets has a two-fold impact. The first involves the improvement of techniques for compression, e.g., storage of large quantities of video, audio or other data on compact media (such as compact discs, hard disks, or random access memory). The second is related to the fact that if such data are compressed to smaller sizes, certain kinds of information may be extracted from them more easily. For example, it is easier to find evidence of an irregular heartbeat (or precursors to arhythmia) using a computer if the cardiological data have been compressed in a way that allows them to be more easily manipulated. These and other applications have made the data compression issues that are studied here an area with high priority in mathematical signal processing."

Moreover, many scientific, economic and engineering problems can be modeled by polynomial equations, and polynomials arise in computational statistics, integer programming, and a variety of other optimization problems.

So the theory plays a significant role not just in basic research but also in the solution of problems of strategic interest.
