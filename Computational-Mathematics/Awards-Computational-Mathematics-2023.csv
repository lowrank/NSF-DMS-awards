Waves are ubiquitous, for example, wireless signals are communicated in the form of electromagnetic waves, and ultrasound CT imaging is based on propagation of acoustic waves. In fact, wave simulation is a fundamental, growing technology in a variety of disciplines ranging from synthetic aperture radar, sonar, geophysical resources exploration, medical imaging, submarine detection, remote sensing and electronics to microscopy and nanotechnology. Developing fast algorithms for these fields and applications will serve the national interest very well in many aspects, such as advancing national health by providing fast algorithms for medical imaging and advancing national energy security by helping the U.S. petroleum industry maintain its edge in oil and gas exploration. One of the most challenging problems in computational wave propagation is how to carry out large-scale high frequency wave simulation efficiently and accurately, and the investigator will develop new fast butterfly-compressed integrator to address this crucial objective. To expand the educational impacts, the project will integrate the scientific discoveries with a series of short courses so that graduate students can be trained on the latest scientific tools. Interdisciplinary hands-on training will be developed for both undergraduate and graduate students, with an emphasis on increasing the diversity and participation of under-represented groups of students for STEM education.<br/><br/>The project will design novel fast butterfly-compressed microlocal Hadamard-Babich (HB) integrators for large-scale high-frequency acoustic, electromagnetic, and elastic wave modeling and inversion motivated by industrial and military applications. The targeted problems for this scientific computing project are large-scale wave modeling and inverse problems with big data sets. The aimed model equations include high-frequency Helmholtz equations, Maxwell's equations, and elastic wave equations in inhomogeneous media in the presence of caustics. This project will foster breakthrough innovations in at least three theoretical and computational aspects. First, the new butterfly-compressed HB integrators will meet significant scientific challenges in large-scale high-frequency wave modeling and inversion in the presence of caustics. Second, significant advances will be made in developing novel butterfly compression and HB integrators for PDE-based Eulerian microlocal analysis and computational wave propagation.

This project focuses on computational methods for control of optimal transport and mixing of some quantity of interest in fluid flows.  The question of what fluid flow maximizes mixing rate, slows it down, or even steers a quantity of interest toward a desired target distribution draws great attention from a broad range of scientists and engineers in the area of complex dynamical systems. The goal of this project is to place these problems within a flexible computational framework, and to develop a solution strategy based on optimal control tools, data compression strategies, and methods to reduce the complexity of the mathematical models. This project will also help the training and development of graduate students across different disciplines to conduct collaborative research in optimal transport and mixing, flow control, and computational methods for solving these problems.<br/><br/><br/>The project is concerned with the development and analysis of numerical methods for optimal control for mixing in fluid flows.  More precisely, the transport equation is used to describe the non-dissipative scalar field advected by the incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes flows. The research aims at achieving optimal mixing via an active control of the flow velocity and constructing efficient numerical schemes for solving this problem. Various control designs will be investigated to steer the fluid flows. Sparsity of the optimal boundary control will be promoted via a non-smooth penalty term in the objective functional. This essentially leads to a highly challenging nonlinear non-smooth control problem for a coupled parabolic and hyperbolic system, or a semi-dissipative system. The project will establish a novel and rigorous mathematical framework and also new accurate and efficient computational techniques for these difficult optimal control problems. Compatible discretization methods for coupled flow and transport will be employed to discretize the controlled system and implement the optimal control designs numerically. Numerical schemes for the highly complicated optimality system will be constructed and analyzed in a systematic fashion. New incremental data compression techniques will be utilized to avoid storing extremely large solution data sets in the iterative solvers, and new model order reduction techniques specifically designed for the optimal mixing problem will be developed to increase efficiency. The synthesis of optimal control and numerical approximation will enable the study of similar phenomena arising in many other complex and real-world flow dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They offer many advantages over traditional mesh-based methods, particularly for problems with complex or moving geometries, large deformations of materials, or other singular behaviors of solutions. The goal of this project is to investigate an innovative approach for designing and analyzing meshfree and particle methods through the study of continuum nonlocal models and their robust discretizations. A central idea is to design ""asymptotically compatible schemes"" with respect to the nonlocal/integral relaxation scale of PDEs so as to advance the stability, accuracy and efficiency of meshfree and particle methods. The proposed research will advance the theoretical understanding of meshfree and particle methods and enhance their practical performance and functionality. Central to the project is an integrated plan of educational goals, and these include promoting the engagement and retention of female and underrepresented groups in math and science, enhancing applied and computational mathematics curricula, and disseminating new scientific discoveries. The PI proposes a variety of activities that aim at promoting computational thinking in middle/high school students and teachers, inspiring and preparing undergraduates for early research experience, and contributing to a more connected and inclusive intellectual environment. <br/><br/>The project primarily focuses on three objectives. The first is the development of monotone meshfree methods for elliptic equations via nonlocal relaxation. This includes the study of linear and nonlinear elliptic equations in Euclidean space and on manifolds. The central theme is to preserve the monotonicity in the discretization while keeping a compact selection of nearby points. The second subject is meshfree methods for systems of equations via the study of nonlocal vector calculus. The study of well-posed nonlocal models through nonlocal vector calculus is crucial for designing of stable numerical discretizations, without which instabilities are often observed (e.g., in the SPH method and peridynamics correspondence model). In the last subproject, we focus on improving the accuracy and efficiency of Lagrange type particle methods for nonlinear time-dependent PDEs through nonlocal analysis. The discussion includes aggregation equation, degenerate diffusion, and convection-diffusion equation. The study of Wasserstein gradient flows will also be needed for rigorous convergence studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The challenges posed by the increasing complexity of forward models and dynamical systems in inverse problems and data assimilation can be mitigated by the development of computational methods that are derivative-free and require few model evaluations. This project is concerned with two important families of cost-efficient, derivative-free algorithms: ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization. Rigorous mathematical analyses will established which will contribute to the understanding of these algorithms, determining their potential and limitations in high-dimensional inverse problems and data assimilation. Methodological contributions will focus on the design of novel algorithms and computational frameworks to merge derivative-free optimization with machine learning. Numerical implementations of these new algorithms will be made publicly available. Beyond inverse problems and data assimilation, the principal investigator will also investigate the potential of ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization in large-scale scientific computing problems where gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute, and in data science applications where privacy is a concern. A central component of the project is the integration of education and research. The principal investigator will engage in the new Preceptor Program, a collaborative initiative to build data science curricula at minority-serving community colleges in Chicago. This program will create pathways for community college students from underrepresented groups to transfer to the University of Chicago. In addition, the investigator will complete two books aimed at graduate and upper-level undergraduate students that will incorporate topics drawn from this project.  Mentorship of graduate students and development of graduate-level courses is a core part of the project.<br/><br/>The project will consist of two interrelated research thrusts on ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization. Ensemble Kalman methods are popular algorithms in the geophysical  sciences, where they are often used with a small ensemble size to keep the number of model evaluations low. The first research thrust of the project will develop a new comprehensive non-asymptotic analysis of ensemble Kalman methods that rigorously explains when and why a small ensemble size may suffice. Previous analyses have focused instead on large ensemble asymptotics that cannot explain the practical success of these algorithms with a small ensemble size. Methodological contributions of this research thrust will be focused on deriving principled frameworks to blend ensemble Kalman methods and machine learning, as well as novel regularization techniques based on hierarchical formulations of inverse problems and data assimilation.  The proposed non-asymptotic theory will establish ensemble size requirements for these new methods. The second research thrust of the project will advance Bayesian optimization in graphical and manifold settings by developing new geometry-aware kernels, acquisition functions, and convergence guarantees. The PI will use tools from computational harmonic analysis to obtain approximation guarantees for stochastic processes on manifolds and tools from information theory to obtain regret bounds under mis-specified models. Finally, the investigator will explore synergistic ways to combine ensemble Kalman methods and Bayesian optimization, leveraging the strengths of both families of algorithms to mitigate their weaknesses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With many computational tasks in biomedical or Earth sciences involving billions of degrees of freedom, model order reduction is necessary to scale the problem of interest down to a tractable size that fits onto the available computing platforms. Model order reduction techniques allow to construct a reduced order model (ROM) that retains the key features of a high-fidelity computational model while being much cheaper to simulate. Conventionally, a ROM represents a specific instance of the system and needs to be recomputed from scratch should the system experience significant changes to its properties. Thus, the question of constructing a ROM that captures the dependence of the system on its parameters arises. This is the main objective of the so-called parametric model reduction. Its main challenge is to develop efficient ROMs that can accurately predict solutions of parametrized high-fidelity models for parameter values that lie outside of the ""training"" set. The project will include training of graduate students.<br/><br/>This project aims at addressing the above-mentioned challenges by developing a ROM that extends the ideas of conventional projection-based model order reduction to parametric systems using the concepts and tools of modern numerical multi-linear algebra. The main techniques utilized are tensor decompositions, low-rank tensor approximation and completion. In particular, low-rank tensor approximations such as canonical polyadic, Tucker (a.k.a. high order SVD, HOSVD) and tensor train are employed in place of truncated SVD, a key conventional dimension-reduction technique. The resulting reduced model is referred to as tensorial ROM (TROM). The three main objectives of the project are: (1) developing a two-stage (training/evaluation) TROM for non-linear dynamical systems, including a tensor version of the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method; (2) developing novel low-rank tensor completion methods for use with TROM to ease the burden of the training stage by working with a sparse sampling of the parameter space; (3) integrating TROM into inverse modeling workflows, in particular, parameter estimation of the phase-field model for a multi-component lipid membrane modeled by surface Cahn-Hilliard equations, and quantitative imaging with waves for medical imaging and geophysical monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the very properties that define these particle systems make them very challenging to simulate, as we must accurately reproduce their behavior for long periods of time. The overarching goal of this research project is to provide transformative improvements to state-of-the-art solvers for the numerical simulation of these particulate systems. By design, each of the contributions in this project has, on its own, foreseeable broad impact in multiphysics simulation and in numerical methods for scientific computing, and ultimately, in advancing our scientific and technological capabilities by enabling simulation methods to bridge the gap between theory and experiment. This project is integrated with ongoing educational initiatives, including the development of novel applied mathematics curricula and providing research opportunities for a diverse group of students. The project will include training of graduate students.<br/><br/>This research project involves the development of a fast simulation framework for rigid particulate suspensions. This work is centered around the formulation of long-range forces with Boundary Integral Methods and of short-ranged contact forces employing optimization-based methods, as this is ideal to effectively tackle the many-body interactions in dense particle systems. This framework features three separate contributions aimed at unlocking the full potential of this approach: (1) Fast singular and near-singular revaluation schemes to resolve long-range particle interactions and analyze integral operators for spheroidal, ellipsoidal and axis-symmetric geometries, enabling the study of a wide array of particle systems and confining geometries, (2) Structured preconditioners for boundary integral equations in evolving geometries leveraging prior work on structured matrices and tensor train decompositions to accelerate the solution of resulting linear systems of equations, and (3) Systematic, robust and adaptive acceleration method for optimization-based collision resolution using matrix-splitting schemes for viscous flow mobility matrices, which may be adapted to most formulations for particulate suspensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In cell biology, many biological functions require the generation and coordination of complex mechanical events distributed throughout individual or populations of cells. This includes the generation and control of cellular motions in response to environmental signals of toxins or nutrients, generation of forces during cell division, and regulation of growth within tissues. Understanding of the roles of conditions arising in diseases, development of therapeutics and vaccines, engineering of bioreactors, and development of novel materials calls for advanced quantitative methods for studying cell mechanics. A central challenge in cell mechanics is to understand the principles by which larger scale mechanics arise from the smaller scale molecular-level events. This project develops new mathematical modeling paradigms and simulation software tools for investigating cell mechanics over multiple scales. This includes contributions from cell membranes and the cytoskeleton, which are structures providing the mechanical support maintaining the cell shape and internal organization. The methods capture contributions including the roles of the geometry, elastic structures, fluid mechanics, and fluctuations. Outreach activities are planned for engaging diverse and under-represented students at the University of California Santa Barbara and in the local community. This includes working with local area K-12 schools and colleges on programs to engage students on topics in the sciences, mathematics, and computation. Educational activities are also planned providing unique opportunities to train the next generation of researchers and students on recent emerging quantitative methods at the interface of mathematics and biology. <br/> <br/>The project addresses challenges in cell mechanics by providing new theoretical and computational stochastic approaches for handling molecular-level interactions and kinetics spanning over a hierarchy of scales.

The project develops new stochastic computational methods for capturing both continuum and discrete contributions from the elastic mechanics, hydrodynamic coupling, geometry, and fluctuations. Stochastic numerical methods and efficient solvers and samplers are developed for handling the geometry of curved surfaces and general bulk domains. The methods draw on results from differential geometry and formulate unstructured discretizations building on finite element methods and meshless approaches. The methods will be used to study mechanisms underlying the mechanics of cytoskeleton-membrane interactions and in vitro active soft materials consisting of reconstituted cytoskeletal elements. This includes processes playing important roles in blebbing during initiation of cell motility and the generation of cytoskeletal forces. For the introduced modeling approaches and computational methods, software tools also will be developed and released with C++/python interfaces allowing for performing general simulations and analysis of phenomena in cell mechanics, complex fluids, and soft materials.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Mathematical Biology and Computational Mathematics Programs at the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program at the Division of Physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ever-growing amount of data has created a pressing need for new methodologies to reduce storage demands and extract representative features for downstream analysis. Many data, such as those arising in computer vision and imaging, neuroscience, networks (e.g., epidemic tracking, cyber security), and more, are natively represented as multiway arrays, or tensors. As a result, tensor-based approaches have become increasingly attractive for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. However, many tensor-based approaches suffer from a so-called ?curse of multidimensionality;? that is, that fundamental mathematical properties break down when applied to multiway data. Recent advances in tensor algebra have overcome this limitation by reframing tensors as mathematical operators rather than stagnant arrays of data. This project will take these advancements to the next level by learning the optimal mathematical operations required to drive down storage costs further while increasing the accuracy of tensor representations. The methods developed in this project will be useful for a wide range of high-impact applications, including precision medicine, climate simulations, and engineering. All algorithms and methods produced will be made available to the public in well-documented, open-source code. <br/><br/>This project focuses on developing new methods to maximize the benefits of matrix-mimetic tensor frameworks- multidimensional frameworks that preserve linear algebraic properties. Such frameworks yield theoretical and empirical advantages over traditional matrix-based approaches and alternative tensor-based approaches. The matrix mimeticity arises from interpreting tensors as t-linear operators that multiply using tensor-tensor products. The choice of tensor-tensor product, given by an underlying tensor algebra, is crucial to representation quality, and thus far, has been made heuristically. This project will develop a unifying optimization framework to learn tensor algebras and efficiently represent multiway data with implicit correlations (i.e., relationships unknown a priori and thus challenging to capture heuristically). The learned tensor-tensor products will introduce algorithmic advantages (e.g., fast evaluations and low storage costs) while preserving theoretical guarantees of the matrix-mimetic framework. The main thrusts of this project are (1) to optimize tensor algebras by exploiting the coupling between matrix-mimetic tensor factorizations and tensor-tensor products, (2) to capture nonlinearity in multilinear algorithms by designing novel nonlinear tensor-tensor products, and (3) to extend the proposed algorithms using new, scalable strategies to increase the applicability of matrix-mimetic tensor approaches to massive multiway data applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples touched upon in this project include subsurface flow through porous media, fiber optics, waveguide design, and material science applications.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a mathematically rigorous framework for ?learning? the underlying complex models from the given sources of information. The recent stunning successes of modern machine learning, especially deep learning, in error-tolerant applications, does not automatically imply its success in error-sensitive scientific tasks. Targeting the latter, this project aims to significantly advance prediction capabilities through rigorous accuracy quantification and certification, arguably an indispensable feature of next generation simulation tools in science and technology. This requires integrating conceptual tools from diverse areas such as numerical and functional analysis, machine learning, statistics, optimization, and information geometry. The project gathers a diverse team for this purpose, and as a byproduct, creates a unique educational framework for students and young researchers.<br/> <br/>Governing physical laws are formulated in terms of (systems of) parameter dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) of various types depending on the application.  Partially observed states of interest are then among (or close to) all those solutions that are obtained when traversing the parameter space.  Learning or optimizing such states boils down to ill-posed inverse problems involving functions of many (parametric) variables. To cope with these obstructions, this project formulates a ?learning? framework as a nonlinear regression problem over hypothesis classes comprised of deep neural networks. Residual type loss functions are employed to avoid expensive computation of a large number of high-fidelity training samples. Accuracy quantification and a posteriori certification is then warranted by so-called variationally-correct residual risks. This means that the size of the loss at any stage of the optimization is uniformly proportional to the error incurred by the resulting estimation in a physically relevant metric.  The variational correctness is achieved through stable variational formulations of the underlying PDEs. They are typically based on currently evolving (discontinuous) Petrov-Galerkin methodologies. Due to the inherent appearance of dual norms, this requires new strategies for efficiently evaluating resulting loss functions in the high dimensional parametric context. Moreover, specially adapted gradient flows will serve as an important constituent in developing robust integrated optimization/adaptation/regularization strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, the formation of solid-like gels at water-oil interfaces during oil recovery processes can be unfavorable because gel build-up can clog wells and pipelines. On the other hand, gel formation can actually be beneficial in flow diversion processes by diverting the flow away from porous rocks and enhancing oil recovery. The interface dynamics and morphologies of this open system cannot be predicted solely by an equilibrium phase diagram, and mathematical models and numerical simulations are needed to fully characterize the nonlinear, out-of-equilibrium dynamics.  This project aims to establish a computational framework for models of non-equilibrium phenomena, and design algorithms and experiments to investigate the interface dynamics of complex, reactive fluids. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training for students, and research activities will help develop the next generation of mathematicians, scientists and engineers. The team of PIs consists of the three researchers from three different institutions, where training of graduate students on the topics of the project is expected. <br/><br/>Studies of two or more fluids that are reactive, and flow through a porous medium, are fundamental to many fields. At equilibrium, the mixture may behave like a liquid or a gel (viscoelastic solid) depending on the concentrations of the components according to an equilibrium phase diagram. When driven out of equilibrium by, for instance, injection of one fluid into another, the morphology of the expanding interface between them can be very complex and strongly depends on an interplay between thermodynamic phase behavior and hydrodynamic forces. This project builds upon breakthroughs in modeling, computation, and experimental techniques to develop a unified mathematical framework that resolves the interface dynamics of reactive fluids driven out of equilibrium. Thermodynamically consistent equations governing the non-equilibrium dynamics of ternary reacting systems of immiscible fluids will be derived, focusing on the radial Hele-Shaw geometry as a prototype.

Due to the flexibility in treating complex structures and rigorous theoretical justification, finite element methods have been widely used to compute eigenvalue problems. The study of the finite element methods for linear eigenvalue problems started in the 1970s and has been an active research area since then. The main functional analysis tool is the spectral perturbation theory for linear operators. In contrast, for nonlinear eigenvalue problems, a systematic numerical approach does not exist. Effective finite element methods are highly desirable. Both graduate and undergraduate students are expected to receive training in the topics of analysis, modeling, and programming.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of new finite element methods for nonlinear eigenvalue problems. These problems are recast as the eigenvalue problems of holomorphic Fredholm operator functions. The convergence will be analyzed using the abstract operator approximation theory. Effective numerical methods will be developed to compute the eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors for practical applications. Two important model problems will be studied: the band structure calculation of dispersive photonic crystals and the transmission eigenvalue problem for anisotropic media. Since the eigenvalues of nonlinear problems are complex in general, efficient algorithms to search eigenvalues on the complex plane for large problems in three dimensions will be developed. The novelty is the combination of the spectral theory for holomorphic operator functions and the finite element approximations. The results will advance the finite element theory and enable the scientists and engineers to effectively compute nonlinear eigenvalue problems. The project will also provide a new approach to prove the convergence of finite element methods (both conforming and non-conforming) for linear eigenvalue problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will focus on improving the shortcomings of the classical projection method with the following goals. First, the method will achieve the divergence-free condition. This feature is critical in the accurate simulation of buoyancy-driven fluids. The temperature in these fluids will be transported, rearranged, and stratified by the velocity field, and the enforcement of the divergence-free condition will give a more accurate account of the evolution and the eventual states. Second, this algorithm will be able to handle arbitrarily large Reynolds numbers with high accuracy. The simulations of the 3D Navier-Stokes flows with a high Reynolds number will result in optimal convergence and avoid nonphysical oscillations. Third, stability and error estimates will be established for this scheme, where the results will be independent of the Reynolds numbers. The investigators will apply this numerical method to simulate the buoyancy-driven fluids near the hydrostatic equilibrium and the electrically conducting fluids near a background magnetic field. In the first problem, a Boussinesq-Navier-Stokes system governing the perturbations near the hydrostatic equilibrium will be solved. The Boussinesq system couples the Navier-Stokes equations forced by buoyancy with the temperature transport equation. The numerical method will also be extended to simulate anisotropic flows for which the vertical viscosity is much smaller than the horizontal one. This problem arises in modeling turbulent flows in Ekman layers occurring in the atmosphere and the ocean. In the second problem, the stability and long-time behavior of electrically conducting fluids under a guiding magnetic field will be computed and analyzed.

It describes, for example, the behavior of the sun's rays as they propagate through the atmosphere and are absorbed or scattered by clouds. In these applications, computer simulations are often used to obtain solutions to the radiative transfer equation. However, a substantial challenge arises in these simulations due to the large number of dimensions needed to describe the radiant intensity at each spatial location, and in each possible direction of propagation (east-west, north-south, up-down). The large number of dimensions requires a large amount of computer memory and computing time. Due to this high computational expense, it is common to use simplifications, such as a one-dimensional (1D) approximation or two-stream approximation in weather and climate applications. This project aims to overcome this 1D barrier and solve the full radiative transfer equation, and do so with fast, low-memory computer simulations. The computational methods, the theoretical understanding of these methods, and the development of software tools will improve understanding of climate, weather, and medical imaging, and thus influence the well-being of individuals in society.

In addition to solving the radiative transfer equation for a given atmospheric state (i.e., solving the forward problem), the inverse problem will also be solved, where measurements of the radiation are used to infer the state of the atmosphere. The inverse problem has important applications in medical imaging, remote sensing and data assimilation for weather forecasting. A goal-oriented version of hp-adaptivity will be used to overcome some of the unique challenges that arise for the inverse problem.

The commonly used model for these applications (e.g. biomedical imaging, clinical radiotherapy treatment planning, security scan) is known as the radiative transport equation (RTE). Computationally, finding an accurate solution to RTE is very challenging due to its high dimensionality. Although many studies and developments of numerical methods solving RTE are based on differential formulation, the methods that are based on integral formulation are not fully understood. In this project, the investigator focuses on developing efficient computational tools based on the adaptive hybrid formulation by combining the advantages of both differential and integral formulations. The algorithm will benefit a broad class of forward and inverse problems. It could also be extended to various applications based on nonlocal PDE models. The proposed methods will benefit biomedical imaging, national security, and biofuel development. The developed mathematical tools and computational algorithms will be disseminated broadly to advance scientific and technological progress in these areas.

Machine learning is also attracting fevered interest in the scientific computing community where neural network techniques have been applied to all manner of applications in scientific computing including the numerical solution of differential equations (PDEs). However, the bar is set much higher when it comes to applying neural networks to scientific applications, where there is an expectation that numerical methods are capable of producing high accuracy approximations, supported by a solid theoretical foundation, give results that make sense, are reproducible, intelligible to the analyst, and (ideally) come with reliable numerical bounds on the accuracy. Numerical simulation is routinely used in science and engineering applications to form the basis for a critical decision for which certain minimal levels of confidence in the numerical results are required. Machine learning and neural network techniques will not be accepted until and unless methods are developed that address these minimal requirements. Current machine learning and neural network methods for scientific applications in general, and numerical solution of PDEs in particular, are not at this level.

It describes, for example, the behavior of the sun's rays as they propagate through the atmosphere and are absorbed or scattered by clouds. In these applications, computer simulations are often used to obtain solutions to the radiative transfer equation. However, a substantial challenge arises in these simulations due to the large number of dimensions needed to describe the radiant intensity at each spatial location, and in each possible direction of propagation (east-west, north-south, up-down). The large number of dimensions requires a large amount of computer memory and computing time. Due to this high computational expense, it is common to use simplifications, such as a one-dimensional (1D) approximation or two-stream approximation in weather and climate applications. This project aims to overcome this 1D barrier and solve the full radiative transfer equation, and do so with fast, low-memory computer simulations. The computational methods, the theoretical understanding of these methods, and the development of software tools will improve understanding of climate, weather, and medical imaging, and thus influence the well-being of individuals in society. The interdisciplinary training of a postdoctoral researcher and students in mathematics and atmospheric science is also an important component of the project. Mentoring and broadening the participation of students from underrepresented groups, with outreach activities to local K-12 schools will also be part of the project.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop fast, low-memory numerical methods that overcome the 1D barrier and solve the full radiative transfer equation, The methods include discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods used for their low-memory properties, and hp-adaptive mesh refinement (hp-AMR) to handle steep gradients that arise in medical imaging or from clouds in the atmosphere. In addition to solving the radiative transfer equation for a given atmospheric state (i.e., solving the forward problem), the inverse problem will also be solved, where measurements of the radiation are used to infer the state of the atmosphere. The inverse problem has important applications in medical imaging, remote sensing and data assimilation for weather forecasting. A goal-oriented version of hp-adaptivity will be used to overcome some of the unique challenges that arise for the inverse problem. Finally, machine-learning-based emulators will be trained using synthetic data that is made possible by the methods above.

Such twins have shown significant promise to better understand, monitor, predict, and control real-world systems, particularly in cases where not every aspect about the system can be observed or modeled. This can improve safety, comfort, maintenance and, also the health and well-being of humans. However, many fundamental questions and challenges remain, particularly regarding a rigorous (mathematical) foundation for this emerging field. This award provides support for a workshop titled ?Mathematical Opportunities in Digital Twins? to be held on December 11-13, 2023, in the George Mason University's campus in Arlington, VA. The workshop brings together key experts working in many aspects of mathematics, key application fields, and industry with the goal to determine the ways in which mathematics can contribute to the research on Digital Twins and how Digital Twins can open up new mathematical directions, as well as to identify connections, synergies, and organizational efforts within the mathematical community, and to/with other disciplines. Digital Twins can lead to new developments in many applications, such as: engineering by e.g., determining weaknesses in structures such as bridges, nuclear plants, or wind turbines; medicine, where Digital Twins of organs may lead to better cures and understanding; society, where Digital Twins of large-scale events like sport games can improve safety. A broad impact of the conference is facilitated by the conference website featuring videos and slides of talks and a technical report that will be shared with the entire scientific community. Students and early career researchers are invited to the workshop, with special attention given to groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>Mathematical models and computations have always played a significant role in simulating, understanding, and predicting physical phenomena. While traditionally, many models have been based on first principles via a rigorous mathematical foundation, such approaches face limitations: Not everything in a physical system can be captured using physical principles, and the available computing resources and algorithms may be unable to model an entire complex system, particularly in real-time environments. Significant advances in sensing technology have enabled the equipment of complex real-world systems with sensors and to employ the sensor data to inform the workings of the system. Moreover, recent developments in data science and machine learning have strengthened the interest and confidence in empirical methodologies. However, purely empirical approaches do not take advantage of the physical principles and may require measurements and data generation at a cost that is not feasible. This workshop focuses on 'Digital Twins', which aim to combine physics-based models with data-driven models, with the goal to leverage the best of both worlds. Digital Twins bring together several research areas in mathematics (including: modeling, analysis, control, optimization, numerical analysis, and scientific computing). This workshop is expected to stimulate new developments in these important areas and to initiate new collaborations, and strengthen the existing ones, among the researchers with diverse background on mathematics of Digital Twins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These equations are used to formulate the fundamental laws of nature, from Newton?s law in classical mechanics and Maxwell?s equations in electromagnetism to Einstein?s field equations in general relativity and Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics, and to model the most diverse phenomena (in engineering, chemistry, biology, astronomy, and numerous other fields). Many important applications involve differential equations whose solutions are functions that are defined on manifolds; roughly speaking, a manifold is curved surface. For this reason, the study of function spaces on manifolds is of paramount importance in applied mathematics, and a major part of this project is focused on developing a more complete mathematical understanding of properties of certain function spaces known as Sobolev spaces on manifolds. Additionally, differential equations usually cannot be solved using analytic techniques, and therefore designing and rigorously analyzing various aspects of algorithms for approximating solutions to these equations is of central importance and is a second major part of this project. If our goals are achieved, the results of this project will have a broad impact on areas of mathematics and physics such as the mathematical theory of general relativity, numerical relativity, mathematical and computational membrane mechanics, and other areas of science and engineering. Training of at least one graduate student at UCSD on the topics of the project is expected.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with the properties of Sobolev spaces of functions, differential forms, and more generally sections of vector bundles on manifolds, with particular focus on nonsmooth manifolds. Our primary application is to general Petrov-Galerkin numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDE) on hypersurfaces of arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds, and an important technical tool throughout our work will be the Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) framework. Such function spaces arise naturally in numerical treatment of PDE in two distinct ways: First, the study of boundary value problems (BVP) involving differential forms on Lipschitz domains in Rn leads to nonsmooth differential forms on the Lipschitz boundary manifold. Second, a careful analysis of PDE on triangulated surfaces, which are obtained by discretization of a smooth surface and replacing it with an approximate manifold, involves Sobolev spaces on Lipschitz manifolds. Although there are results on the properties of Sobolev spaces on nonsmooth (primarily compact) manifolds scattered throughout the literature, a complete and coherent rigorous study of the properties of such spaces is missing.  A primary goal of this project is to study the properties of Sobolev spaces needed for theoretical and numerical analysis of PDE on nonsmooth manifolds, and establish results that are currently missing in the literature. It is well-known that in the study of BVP, one quickly encounters fractional-order Sobolev spaces that exhibit surprising behavior even on domains in Rn. One of the challenging features of this project will be to explore the extent to which properties of fractional-order Sobolev spaces on domains in Rn will transfer to Sobolev spaces of differential forms on open manifolds and on Lipschitz manifolds obtained as a result of the triangulation of hypersurfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

QIS involves a fundamentally different logic than classical information science, and advances in the field (in areas such as quantum algorithms and quantum cryptography) have often depended on creative mathematical breakthroughs. Furthermore, mathematics is an accessible entry point to QIS for students and mentors from a wide range of backgrounds and skill levels.

This feature is critical in the accurate simulation of buoyancy-driven fluids. The temperature in these fluids will be transported, rearranged, and stratified by the velocity field, and the enforcement of the divergence-free condition will give a more accurate account of the evolution and the eventual states. Second, this algorithm will be able to handle arbitrarily large Reynolds numbers with high accuracy. The simulations of the 3D Navier-Stokes flows with a high Reynolds number will result in optimal convergence and avoid nonphysical oscillations. Third, stability and error estimates will be established for this scheme, where the results will be independent of the Reynolds numbers. The investigators will apply this numerical method to simulate the buoyancy-driven fluids near the hydrostatic equilibrium and the electrically conducting fluids near a background magnetic field. In the first problem, a Boussinesq-Navier-Stokes system governing the perturbations near the hydrostatic equilibrium will be solved. The Boussinesq system couples the Navier-Stokes equations forced by buoyancy with the temperature transport equation.

Such equations form a core part of many computations performed on laptops, smartphones, tablets, and supercomputers. With the rise of data science and machine learning leading to massive datasets to process, the need for efficient and reliable methodologies for solving such equations is growing. Within the field of NLA, a key innovation in the past couple of decades has been the development of a new set of algorithms that harness the mathematical properties of extensive collections of random numbers to build new randomized algorithms that outperform existing deterministic ones.

This meeting will focus on the nexus between theory and computation, particularly on computational ""tricks'' that lead to deep theoretical insight, and on the use of deep theoretical results in fast, high-performing computation. Three specific areas of interest are random matrix theory, numerical linear algebra, and modern scientific computing. Established experts and promising junior researchers will present the latest advances and state-of-the-art techniques. We seek a fruitful exchange of ideas and the opportunity to interact across disciplinary boundaries. This interaction will be facilitated by the presence of numerous researchers who work at the intersection of two or more of these areas. In addition to the presentations, we have scheduled a poster session for young participants so they can publicize their results and receive feedback and guidance from the experts in the audience. <br/><br/>Random matrix theory, with its myriad modern applications from randomized numerical linear algebra to signal processing and from optimization to machine learning, is informed and deepened by computational and numerics tricks of the sort that have yielded tridiagonal theoretical models for beta-ensembles and calculating limiting distributions via Kolmogorov's backward equation. On the other hand, the use of randomization in numerical linear algebra is a fast-growing subfield, due to the importance of working with extremely large datasets for which classical, deterministic algorithms are too slow. The new methods make extensive use of random matrix tools, while the need to properly address machine learning and optimization applications has in turn guided the modern development of random matrix theory. Finally, modern high-performance computing needs to deal with sparseness, structure, and fast and accurate approximation on the back end, and must allow the users to write code that reads like mathematics on the front end; modern programming languages like Julia are designed to allow for high-level mathematical abstraction with high-performance code. We aim to bring together the three aforementioned communities in order to foster interdisciplinary research and hopefully start and nurture collaborations among both experts and junior participants that will bear fruit in the years to come.

An example of such data sets, and a special focus of this project, are images resulting from new acquisition techniques that render biological tissues at the micron scale while providing high-dimensional information on each cell contained in the tissue. The analysis of geometric data has seen considerable progress in the recent past with, in particular, the mathematical formulation of the notion of shape space and the design of associated computational methods. However, these methods do not scale yet to the massive data size that are associated with the new modalities. This project, which focuses on shape and image data, develops new data science approaches inspired by recent advances over the past decade and develops new models to handle multi-scale representations. Shape analysis provides major elements for the understanding of biological and medical data, and becomes increasingly relevant with the refinement of data acquisition technology. It has been extensively applied in the context of brain diseases or dysfunction, such as schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, autism, Huntington or Alzheimer. This project will extend the range of tools available for such studies, allowing for the analysis of datasets captured at finer resolution, accommodating recently introduced modalities, and enabling statistical investigations working at multiple scales.<br/><br/>The project develops new concepts and models for shape analysis through diffeomorphic mapping. It describes three main research themes: introducing new approaches for multiscale analysis, developing randomized optimization strategies for the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping algorithm, and investigating registration methods for images that may have discontinuities or singularities. The proposed work involves a combination of theoretical analyses, numerical developments, and experimental exploration. The multiscale models studied in the first theme provide an appealing and previously unexplored paradigm, with notable challenges, especially on the numerical side. Results are expected to significantly impact statistical shape analysis by providing an enriched decomposition of shape changes, and enabling the separation of various effects affecting the data when they occur at different scales. The second theme revisits some of the bases underlying diffeomorphic registration to allow for randomized implementations using stochastic gradient descent. Image varifolds, studied in the third theme, have the ability to model shapes carrying spatial information and enable new data modalities to be handled by registration methods. The project will create algorithms, with numerical representation adapted to these modalities, and explore cross-modality registration.

These equations are used to formulate the fundamental laws of nature, from Newton?s law in classical mechanics and Maxwell?s equations in electromagnetism to Einstein?s field equations in general relativity and Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics, and to model the most diverse phenomena (in engineering, chemistry, biology, astronomy, and numerous other fields). Many important applications involve differential equations whose solutions are functions that are defined on manifolds; roughly speaking, a manifold is curved surface. For this reason, the study of function spaces on manifolds is of paramount importance in applied mathematics, and a major part of this project is focused on developing a more complete mathematical understanding of properties of certain function spaces known as Sobolev spaces on manifolds. Additionally, differential equations usually cannot be solved using analytic techniques, and therefore designing and rigorously analyzing various aspects of algorithms for approximating solutions to these equations is of central importance and is a second major part of this project. If our goals are achieved, the results of this project will have a broad impact on areas of mathematics and physics such as the mathematical theory of general relativity, numerical relativity, mathematical and computational membrane mechanics, and other areas of science and engineering. Training of at least one graduate student at UCSD on the topics of the project is expected.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with the properties of Sobolev spaces of functions, differential forms, and more generally sections of vector bundles on manifolds, with particular focus on nonsmooth manifolds. Our primary application is to general Petrov-Galerkin numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDE) on hypersurfaces of arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds, and an important technical tool throughout our work will be the Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) framework. Such function spaces arise naturally in numerical treatment of PDE in two distinct ways: First, the study of boundary value problems (BVP) involving differential forms on Lipschitz domains in Rn leads to nonsmooth differential forms on the Lipschitz boundary manifold. Second, a careful analysis of PDE on triangulated surfaces, which are obtained by discretization of a smooth surface and replacing it with an approximate manifold, involves Sobolev spaces on Lipschitz manifolds. Although there are results on the properties of Sobolev spaces on nonsmooth (primarily compact) manifolds scattered throughout the literature, a complete and coherent rigorous study of the properties of such spaces is missing.  A primary goal of this project is to study the properties of Sobolev spaces needed for theoretical and numerical analysis of PDE on nonsmooth manifolds, and establish results that are currently missing in the literature. It is well-known that in the study of BVP, one quickly encounters fractional-order Sobolev spaces that exhibit surprising behavior even on domains in Rn. One of the challenging features of this project will be to explore the extent to which properties of fractional-order Sobolev spaces on domains in Rn will transfer to Sobolev spaces of differential forms on open manifolds and on Lipschitz manifolds obtained as a result of the triangulation of hypersurfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, the data frequently have some underlying structure that the algorithm can exploit, and to build truly flexible and powerful randomized iterative algorithms we need to learn how to use this information efficiently. The general goal of this project is to advance the understanding of how the data-aware and task-adaptive exploration stage can inform the design of the iterative steps of stochastic algorithms to guide them toward a particular learning task. Examples of such learning tasks include corruption removal, exploration of external knowledge, data regularization, or search for multiple solutions. In addition to the scientific impact, this project will contribute to the broad dissemination of the scientific knowledge via the talks, events organization, and open-sourced codes, and provides student support and research training opportunities.<br/><br/>This project aims to create a range of flexible data- and task-augmented randomized iterative methods.

On the other hand, gel formation can actually be beneficial in flow diversion processes by diverting the flow away from porous rocks and enhancing oil recovery. The interface dynamics and morphologies of this open system cannot be predicted solely by an equilibrium phase diagram, and mathematical models and numerical simulations are needed to fully characterize the nonlinear, out-of-equilibrium dynamics.  This project aims to establish a computational framework for models of non-equilibrium phenomena, and design algorithms and experiments to investigate the interface dynamics of complex, reactive fluids.

Such problems are characterized by fourth-order highly-nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) systems, which are sensitive to traditional numerical methods and data-driven machine-learning approaches. The objectives of the project are organized around three interconnected aspects: 1) Analysis of the regularity and structure of traveling droplets described by coupled PDE systems.

In 2023, over 600,000 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the USA. One of the primary factors behind the high death rate for cancer patients is the late diagnosis of cancer, since most cancers do not present early symptoms. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop fast and effective targeted therapies for treating cancer patients. For this purpose, biomedical imaging is a crucial component for establishing clinical protocols in cancer by helping obtain important anatomical, structural, and functional information of cancer formation and spread. In particular hybrid imaging methods, which use physics of coupled waves, provide quantitative information of cancerous tissues to guide better diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning. One such hybrid imaging method is quantitative photoacoustic tomography (QPAT) that uses short-pulse near infrared light and ultrasound propagation data to reconstruct high-fidelity optical properties, like light absorption and scattering profiles, in cancerous tissues. However, several practical challenges, like lack of adequate datasets and uncertainty of sound speed in tissues, limit the quality of reconstructions with existing computational methods in quantitative photoacoustic tomography. This project brings together a novel combination of theoretical and computational methods in mathematical game theory and statistical sensitivity analysis to tackle the aforementioned challenges and provide high quality reconstructions in QPAT. As a result, it will help facilitate accurate targeted imaging of cancerous tissues and improve clinical outcomes, thereby contributing to one of the strategic goals of USA Heath and Human Services to ?Safeguard and Improve National and Global Health Conditions and Outcomes?. Furthermore, this project will provide a unique interdisciplinary research and training experience for undergraduate and graduate students, especially from underrepresented groups, and will facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration between mathematicians, statisticians, and radiologists in the field of biomedical imaging.<br/><br/>The scientific goal of this project is to build a new class of accurate, fast, stable and robust non-linear reconstruction schemes for solving limited data hybrid imaging problems arising in QPAT. For achieving this goal, the specific research objectives are to (1) develop a new gradient-free Nash games computational scheme for data completion and identification of unknown sound speed and optical energy density in photoacoustic tomography; (2) build a new gradient-free optimization scheme for reconstruction of optical parameters with high contrast and resolution; and (3) use statistical sensitivity analysis to stabilize and calibrate the Nash algorithm for obtaining a stable reconstruction method in QPAT. The computational framework will be validated using real-time photoacoustic data of mice specimens. The project also aims at providing a new paradigm in computational methods for limited data inverse problems that yields computationally inexpensive, stable and superior reconstructions in comparison to existing computational frameworks, and thus will be beneficial for effective detection of cancers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Incorporating uncertainties into mathematical models becomes indispensable in order to develop more accurate and robust mathematical models from biological, engineering, and physical applications, which makes it necessary to consider stochastic partial differential equations as they are the most commonly encountered stochastic models from applications. To seek solutions of those equations require accurate, efficient, and robust computational methods and algorithms, the demand for such methods and algorithms has never been greater. The current approaches for solving stochastic partial differential equations face considerable challenges at large scales, in the meantime, such stochastic models become more complicated as more difficult nonlinearity and noise are considered. The existing numerical approaches are not efficient to solve those problems, which in turn calls for new ideas and approaches. With rapid developments in nontraditional applied sciences such as mathematical finance, image processing, economics, and data science, there is an ever-increasing demand for efficient numerical methods for solving challenging high-dimensional problems such as computing integration and solving partial differential equations. The traditional grid-based methods are hampered by the infamous curse of dimensionality in which the amount of required computations for solving a problem grows exponentially in the dimension. The primary goal of this research project is to develop novel and efficient numerical methods to address those challenges. The project consists of two integral parts. Part I focuses on developing and analyzing efficient numerical methods for solving several nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations which arise from various scientific and engineering applications such as materials science, fluid and quantum mechanics, and optimal control. Part II will be devoted to developing novel numerical methods for high-dimensional computation with a focus on problems of high-dimensional numerical integration and high-dimensional partial differential equations.

This project aims to study an important class of nonlocal models involving nonlocal interactions of a finite range. In a variety of real world applications, these models can serve as an alternative or complement to traditional PDE-based models and help connect PDE models with discrete models. The project is consistent with our vision of informative and intelligent scientific computing, which will broadly contribute to the advance of computation science and various scientific and engineering research fields, particularly as the world becomes increasingly connected (and nonlocal). The investigator will continue to build a close working relationship with research scientists at different institutions to facilitate the collaborative research effort and to strengthen the training and mentoring of young students and junior researchers.  Effort will be made to ensure the timely translation and integration of new research findings into enhanced modeling and simulation capabilities for applications. Training at least one graduate student on the topics of the proposed research is expected.<br/><br/>Nonlocal models differ from the more common local models represented by partial differential equations (PDEs) in that they employ nonlocal operators in integral forms, which can account for nonlocal interactions explicitly and provide more general modeling choices. Despite much progress,  the mathematical theory and numerical analysis of nonlocal models are still at a nascent stage.  Many key questions remain unanswered in all aspects of nonlocal modeling, analysis, and computation.  In this project, the investigator aims to advance the mathematical and algorithmic development of nonlocal models with a finite range of interactions through an integrated solution and learning process. On one hand, the investigator will focus on a few key questions related to the formulation, discretization, and learning of nonlocal models, particularly involving physical boundaries or interfaces. This is represented by some specific tasks concerning the analytical and algorithmic development for solving nonlocal problems with inhomogeneous data at or near the boundary and/or with heterogeneous nonlocal interactions. These problems are notoriously challenging and their satisfactory solutions will have a significant impact on applications.  Meanwhile, the project will help us build integrated modeling and learning processes. New strategies and algorithms will be developed to help bring potentially transformative changes to how nonlocal models are formulated and learned and to the related numerical methods, including their development, analysis, and application.

The focus is on two major problems pertaining to low-dimensional structures in Wasserstein space.  First, what is the ""correct"" model for intrinsically low-dimensional subsets of Wasserstein space, and how can they be computed?  The investigators propose to mimic notions of low-dimensional subspace (exact and approximate), by proposing three models that leverage the geometric properties of Wasserstein space, as well as recent computational advances in entropic regularization.  The goal for these three models is to efficiently encode (analyze) measures by their coefficients in these low-dimensional subsets of Wasserstein space, and also decode (synthesize).  The focus is on efficiency from both a statistical (e.g., estimating given samples from the measures) and computational (e.g., designing algorithms with sub-cubic complexity) perspective.  Second, what are the efficient, computable, and expressive representational systems in Wasserstein space?  The investigators propose to tackle the data-driven problem of, given observed probability measures, how to identify and learn a small number of reference measures that can represent them efficiently.

For instance, the formation of solid-like gels at water-oil interfaces during oil recovery processes can be unfavorable because gel build-up can clog wells and pipelines. On the other hand, gel formation can actually be beneficial in flow diversion processes by diverting the flow away from porous rocks and enhancing oil recovery. The interface dynamics and morphologies of this open system cannot be predicted solely by an equilibrium phase diagram, and mathematical models and numerical simulations are needed to fully characterize the nonlinear, out-of-equilibrium dynamics.  This project aims to establish a computational framework for models of non-equilibrium phenomena, and design algorithms and experiments to investigate the interface dynamics of complex, reactive fluids. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training for students, and research activities will help develop the next generation of mathematicians, scientists and engineers. The team of PIs consists of the three researchers from three different institutions, where training of graduate students on the topics of the project is expected. <br/><br/>Studies of two or more fluids that are reactive, and flow through a porous medium, are fundamental to many fields. At equilibrium, the mixture may behave like a liquid or a gel (viscoelastic solid) depending on the concentrations of the components according to an equilibrium phase diagram. When driven out of equilibrium by, for instance, injection of one fluid into another, the morphology of the expanding interface between them can be very complex and strongly depends on an interplay between thermodynamic phase behavior and hydrodynamic forces. This project builds upon breakthroughs in modeling, computation, and experimental techniques to develop a unified mathematical framework that resolves the interface dynamics of reactive fluids driven out of equilibrium. Thermodynamically consistent equations governing the non-equilibrium dynamics of ternary reacting systems of immiscible fluids will be derived, focusing on the radial Hele-Shaw geometry as a prototype. Both sharp interface and diffuse interface numerical schemes (energy-stable, adaptive finite-difference methods using scalar auxiliary variables) will be developed and validated against asymptotic reductions to sharp interface models and new experimental data generated from this project. The integrated mathematical, computational and experimental approach will provide a framework for understanding the nonequilibrium dynamics, predicting the emergence of complex patterns and developing strategies for controlling the pattern formation process in fundamental multiphysics interface problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, increasingly complex mathematical models arising from physics, biology, and chemistry challenge the efficacy of first-principle-based approaches for solving practical problems, such as those in fluid turbulence, molecular dynamics, and large-scale inverse problems. A major obstacle for numerical algorithms is the so-called curse of dimensionality.  Fueled by advances in Graphics Processing Unit and Tensor Processing Unit general-purpose computing, deep neural networks (DNNs) and deep learning approaches excel in combating the curse of dimensionality and demonstrate immense potential for solving complex problems in science and engineering. This project aims to investigate how mathematical structures within a problem can inform the design and analysis of innovative DNNs, particularly in the context of inverse problems where unknown parameters are inferred from measurements, such as electrical impedance tomography.

The project seeks to bridge OpL and classical methodologies by integrating mathematical structures from classical problem-solving approaches into DNN architectures. In particular, the project will shed light on the mathematical properties of the attention mechanism, the backbone of state-of-the-art DNN Transformers, such as those in GPT and AlphaFold 2.  Furthermore, the project will examine the flexibility of attention neural architectures, enabling the fusion of attention mechanisms with important methodologies in applied mathematics, such as Galerkin projection or Fredholm integral equations, in accordance with the a priori mathematical structure of a problem.

For example, integration is used to mathematically express the total quantity of a substance, such as a hazardous chemical, over a given spatial region (or domain). However, the integration problems in these models can rarely be solved by pen and paper techniques, so researchers must employ numerical integration, or quadrature, methods. This project introduces an entirely new framework, Fredholm Alternative Quadrature (FAQ), for performing the essential task of quadrature. It thus gives researchers new effective options for tackling integration problems, especially those involving geometrically complicated domains and irregularly sampled data. The framework also offers a new approach to a classical subject that has been around for millennia, providing fresh insights and pedagogical opportunities. The project will support one Ph.D. student in the recently created computational math, science, & engineering (CMSE) program, which will also help bolster the research portfolio of this program. Building from a successful track record of recruiting graduate students in computational mathematics from underrepresented groups, the investigator will continue working with the Institute for Inclusive and Transformative Scholarship to help identify potential candidates for the project. New educational opportunities for undergraduate, master's, and Ph.D. students will also be created through the development of a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) that incorporates topics from the project.<br/><br/>The FAQ framework is based on a relationship between the continuous Fredholm Alternative (FA) theorem for Poisson's equation and the discrete FA for linear systems that arise from discretizing this equation. It does not employ integration but instead requires discretizing certain Laplace operators at a given set of points over the integration domain and solving an eigenvalue problem. To maximize the flexibility and practicality of FAQ, the mesh-free radial basis function finite difference (RBF-FD) method for discretizing the Laplace operators will be used. This results in a method that 1) does not require explicitly or implicitly integrating basis functions, 2) can be used on geometrically complicated domains (even surfaces), 3) can be implemented for scattered samples of the integrand without meshing, 4) can yield high orders of accuracy for smooth functions, and 5) can be computed efficiently. Several numerical and theoretical advancements will also be made, including techniques for producing high-order accurate RBF-FD discretizations, efficient meshfree multilevel methods for computing the FAQ formulas, least squares techniques for enhancing the stability of FAQ formulas, tools for analyzing FAQ approximation properties, and new insights on classical quadrature formulas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This theory serves as the fundamental basis for understanding and tackling engineering challenges in these fields. The primary focus of this research project is to investigate kinetic theory through an integrated approach that combines differential-equation analysis with data science techniques. By doing so, the project aims not only to unravel the mathematical properties of the equations involved but also to accurately determine parameter values by integrating experimental data. In addition to advancing our understanding of pure mathematics, this project holds significant societal benefits by providing rigorous mathematical justifications for a specific set of experiments conducted in national labs and the plasma fusion energy industry.

In many applications, one has access to vast amounts of data, but the data is highly noisy and only meaningful when aggregated. For example, in cryo-electron microscopy, one has access to a large volume of molecular images. Still, each image is highly noisy and reflects a random shift, orientation, and projection, making integration highly challenging. Another example is microarray expression data, which is generally collected in small batches with significant batch effects. The traditional statistical approach is to ?standardize the data? before integration, i.e., one subtracts the mean and scales by the standard deviation in each batch and then combines the standardized batches. However, when the sample size of each batch/subpopulation is small, this approach will fail since within-batch estimates of mean and variance can be unreliable. This project will develop computationally efficient and scalable methods for aggregating noisy data from multiple sources. The methodology will be applied to data from the criminal justice system to gain insights into race and gender-based discrepancies. The project will support several tiers of mentorship as well as graduate and undergraduate research and will contribute publicly available code. In addition, the research will also serve as a bridge between the fields of signal processing and statistics. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop mathematical tools for data aggregation invariant to the first and second moments of the data in two distinct contexts. The first context is data aggregation for multi-reference alignment (MRA), a topic motivated by biological applications such as cryo-electron microscopy. In classic MRA one attempts to recover a hidden signal from many noisy observations, where each noisy observation has been randomly translated and corrupted by additive noise. The investigators will explore a generalization of this model where each noisy observation is also corrupted by a random scale change. The research will develop a computationally efficient method for full signal recovery that utilizes Fourier and wavelet-based features to unbias the noisy data for the random scale change. The second context is data aggregation for distribution learning. The investigators consider the scenario where data is collected from various sub-populations to produce data batches, but the sample sizes of the batches are small. Under a simple but compelling model, localization factors affect only the first and second moments of the sub-populations, so that each batch consists of independent, identically distributed observations from some shifted and rescaled universal distribution function. The goal is to recover the underlying distribution by aggregating the sparse data. This is a highly relevant problem, as it allows for reliable nonparametric estimates of the density in settings where traditional approaches fail and, more broadly, leads to more precise comparisons across sub-populations in settings where little data is available. By viewing this problem as a generalized MRA problem where uncertainty due to random sampling replaces Gaussian noise, this project contributes an innovative set of tools for its solution inspired by methods in signal processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such FEMs possess several advantages over existing methods, including superior accuracy, robustness with respect to model parameters, and exact enforcement of multiple conservation laws. However, this class of FEMs is limited in their ability to handle various equation types and geometric domains. This research will overcome these limitations by developing new robust FEMs for incompressible fluid models that can be applied to a wider range of problems.

This 18th conference in the FACM meeting series will be devoted to promising recent research in the field of computational wave propagation and imaging.   Wave scattering and imaging problems are pervasive in a variety of engineering and industrial applications. These include, for instance, the design of optoelectronic devices such as lasers and solar panels, stealth technology, medical imaging, and nondestructive testing of materials (in which a prescribed incident electromagnetic wave is used to illuminate a sample and identify the location and shape of cracks or defects).  Another important example comes from microchip design, which involves challenging wave propagation problems in multilayer materials that call for new numerical methods.  Despite numerous successes, challenges remain in, e.g., high-frequency problems, wave scattering in complex media, design of fast algorithms, and the application of new techniques based on machine-learning, among others. The conference brings together a diverse group of mathematicians, statisticians, scientists, and engineers to present their research in an environment that promotes significant interaction and cross-fertilization among the participants. <br/><br/>The FACM 2023 conference theme is ``New trends in computational wave propagation and imaging,?? and will focus on several problem areas that have either been established as areas of major significance in applied mathematics, or as emerging research fields with exceptional potential. These are: (1) inverse problems and imaging, (2) integral equation and high-frequency methods, (3) optimal transport in optical design, and (4) applications of machine learning in PDE's and inverse problems. The field of computational wave propagation and imaging has grown rapidly in the past two decades, fueled by industrial applications and supported by rapid development in mathematical theory and novel approaches stemming from advances in, for example, nonlinear optimization, randomized and fast linear solvers, and machine learning/data science. Despite the progress, numerous challenges remain, for instance, in treating high frequency problems with multiple scattering effects, computational inversion with limited (sparse, incomplete, or both) data, and high dimensional problems, among many others. In addition, there is a strong need for fundamental theory that can lead to a better understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of the new algorithms. FACM 2023 presents an ideal forum to stimulate new strategies to tackle these challenging problems through cross-fertilization of ideas and new collaborations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such operator learning problems arise in various applications in disciplines such as physics, biology, engineering, economics, and hydrography. These kernels/functions represent the intrinsic physical laws of interactions between particles or the inherent structures of the operators. Thus, they are as fundamental as the physical laws of gravity in physics, shredding insight into models in their applications. Therefore, it is paramount to construct robust convergent estimators when the data size increases to reveal the intrinsic laws that are not sensitive to the data. <br/> <br/>This project will develop a unified computational approach for the nonparametric learning of kernels/functions in operators from high- or infinite dimensional data, and the products are scalable algorithms with performance guarantees in a unifying variational framework. It will study four groups of applications where the goal is to recover the kernels/functions in PDE operators, non-Markovian processes, state-space models, and weighted convolution operators. Notably, a systematic learning theory, covering identifiability and regularization, will address the challenges from nonlocal dependence and high-dimensional data. Furthermore, this theory builds the mathematical foundations for a general framework, making the algorithms and theory applicable to inverse problems far beyond those studied in this proposal. Finally, the research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate teaching in multiple disciplines, promote the fundamental role of computational math in statistical/machine learning, and provide many research opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
