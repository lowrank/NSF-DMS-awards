The Euler equations are a hyperbolic                 system of conservation laws with solutions that can involve shock               waves and other discontinuities.  Special numerical methods are                 required to determine highly accurate solutions with sharp dis-                 continuities.  LeVeque is studying a class of explicit methods                  that can be efficiently applied with large time steps.  This work               involves both algorithmic aspects and extension of the                          mathematical theory of wave interaction in nonlinear conservation               laws.  One aspect of this work is the specification of boundary                 conditions with reasonable time steps for bodies embedded in                    Cartesian grids.                                                                        A related question, handled by different techniques, is the             proper specification of boundary conditions for numerical methods               that solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by                        fractional steps.  A sequence of easier subproblems is solved in                each time step that require special nonphysical boundary                        conditions.  One application of the incompressible Navier-Stokes                equations is to model wave propogation in the cochlea (inner                    ear).  LeVeque is involved in an ongoing project in this                        direction with C. Peskin.                                                               LeVeque is also studying the interaction of solitary waves              in nonlinear partial differential equations such as the KdV                     equations arising in elasticity."

The aim of this research is twofold.  We propose 1) to translate                the theoretical results obtained under the earlier grant into                   practical computational algorithms.  In particular, software will               be developed for triangulation and tesselation, for storing and                 evaluating piecewise polynomial surfaces efficiently, for                       contouring, for surface-surface intersection, for interpolation                 (with and without shape control), for quasi-interpolation, for                  fitting surfaces on surfaces, for computer-aided design schemes,                for least squares fitting of scatted data, for evaluation of                    simplex splines and for solving boundary-value problems.                        Secondly, we propose 2) to develop computational tools which can                be used to support our theoretical work on the dimension, the                   construction of locally supported bases, and the poisedness of                  interpolation problems for multivariate splines."

The glue which               binds them is the investigation of zero finding algorithms of                   higher order (order greater than 2).  The goals of the proposed                 research includes contributions to the understanding of the                     global behavior of zero finding algorithms, application of such                 higher order algorithms to two point boundary value problems, and               the development of fast algorithms for finding ""approximate                     zeros"".

For example, systems of linear                filtering, recursive estimation, time series analysis, as well as               in image processing.  Furthmore, Pisarenko frequency estimates,                 also of interest in signal processing, can be computed using                    Toeplitz and unitary Hessenberg matrices as follows:  a Toeplitz                eigenvalue problem is solved; the Schur parameters associated                   with the orthogonal polynomials defined implicitly by the                       Toeplitz matrix are then used to construct a certain unitary                    Hessenberg matrix; the eigenvalues of this matrix are the                       frequency estimates sought.                                                             Using the close connection between the theory of polynomials            orthogonal on the unit circle and these problems of linear                      algebra, the investigators have already developed competitive                   numerical methods for computing eignevalues and eigenvectors of                 unitary Hessenberg matrices for solving the inverse eigenvalue                  problem for unitary matrices, and for solving systems of linear                 equations with positive definite symmetric Toeplitz matrices.                           The purpose of this work is to further speed up the                     algorithms for the above problems and to investigate how they can               be implemented efficiently on computers with vector and parallel                architectures. The investigators also wish to gain a better                     understanding about the numerical properties, such as stability,                of some of the algorithms mentioned so that fast reliable                       computer programs can be developed.  The work should result in                  published fast stable algorithms for the above problems.                                Another application of fast Toeplitz solvers is the solution            of integral equations.  Iterative schemes with Toeplitz matrices                as preconditioners will also be investigated.  Encouraging                      preliminary results for an integral equation of plane potential                 theory on a piecewise smooth curve currently exist.                             This is a model problem for integral equations on a piecewise                   smooth curve or surface with a displacement kernel.  Such                       integral equations are common in applications of the boundary                   element method.  The project will investigate when Toeplitz                     matrices make good preconditioners.  More generally, it will                    continue the investigation in and develop fast solution methods                 for integral equations by exploiting the structure of the system                of equations obtained after discretization.  Both direct and                    iterative schemes will be considered."

The main analytical tools to be                refined and employed are based on Laplace's method for                          approximating integrals and the theory of weak convergence of                   distributions.  The effect of the parameterization on the size of               apporximation errors will be explored and diagnostic tools for                  assessing the adequacy of an approximation will be obtained.                    Approximations for problems with multimodal posterior densities                 and margianl posterior densities of implicitly defined functions                will be dervied.  The first order behavior of posterior                         distributions based on general nonparametric prior distributions                on densities and hazard functions will be investigated and the                  possibility of extending second order approximations to                         nonparametric, infinite dimensional problems will be explored.                          Bayesian methods are aimed at improving our ability to                  incorporate existing (prior) information into decision and                      prediction strategies.  The Baysian approach has remained rather                philosophical until the recent computer revolution.  The current                thrust of excitement and activity in this area derives from the                 recently obtained computational capability brought by the                       computer revolution and the critical need brought by inundation                 of information relevant to any subject of interest.  These                      scientists are leaders in the effort to dramatically improve                    computational capabilities for Bayesian methods.  Their research                will create more powerful statistical techniques for                            comprehensively using informaion in the decision making process."

The focus is mainly on the        computational effectivness of the method for pure traction and mixed            boundary conditions. The investigator has developed some a priori error         estimates for this difficult problem and now wants to check the                 effectiveness of the method on a computer for various choices of                boundary conditions. The most likely procedure that will be followed is         a simplified variational equation which reduces to a system of linear           algebraic equations with a positive definite matrix. To solve the system        efficiently, a preconditioned conjugate gradient method will be used.           Another project to be pursued involves finite element methods for the           first order scalar hyperbolic problem. The proposed research consists of        continued investigations on the use of nonconforming finite elements of         order higher than one (piecewise polynomials which are continuous at the        midpoints of triangles) including the derivation of a priori error              estimates and computational verification. The ideas of this research            will also be applied to the problem of identifying unknown functional           coefficients in a parabolic system of partial differential equations.           The work on this problem is relevant to underground oil reservoir               identification.                                                                     This research falls into the general area of numerical analysis and         computational mathematics. Its ultimate goal is to develop efficient            computational methods to be used in scientific problems involving               spatially distributed masses, energies, stresses and flows."

Two broad classes of problems to be                     studied that relate parallel processing to other computational                  problems are the use of a parallel system for the computation of                high-dimensional integrals and the optimization of high-                        dimensional functions on a parallel system.  In both classes of                 problems. the basic question is to determine an efficient way to                decompose the computation across a collection of different                      processors operating in parallel.                                                    The methods, algorithms, and software to be developed for                  parallel processing will be useful in the determination of                      optimal or approximately optimal Bayesian solutions in a wide                   variety of sequential decision problems, including applications                 in robotics."

For example, one may cite Cormack's                  Nobel prize work in medical imaging.  Image reconstruction is a                 major scientific and engineering frontier for X-ray tomography,                 emission tomography, electron microscopy, radio astronomy, and                  nuclear magnetic resonance.  Its mathematical foundation in the                 Radon transform and its computational execution via algorithms                  form the subject matter of this proposal.                                               Professor Quinto is an expert in theoretical analysis of the            Radon transform, who holds to the scientific perspectve that                    theoretical progress must go hand in hand with computational                    implemention.  As Professor Quinto has made noteworthy                          contributions in both areas he commands a perspective of the                    entire field.  Thus, the project has a dual thrust.  On the                     theoretical side, Professor Quinto will continue his                            investigation of support theorems for generalized Radon                         transforms.  He will consider such problems for transforms with                 real analytic measures on real analytic submanifolds, including                 limited data theorems for X-ray and k-plane transforms as well as               transforms coming from a double fibration and subgroup invariant                transforms.  In computational work, Professor Quinto will                       complete the implementation of his algorithm to invert the                      exterior Radon transform.  Solution to this problem could allow                 good computer tomographic imaging of the organs around the                      beating heart, of metal in bone, as well as nondestructive                      evaluation of rings or cones such as rocket nozzles."

In many cases, these equations are solved                   directly using sparse techniques.

They constitute a broad and poorly understood area which draws on               a diverse range of mathematical disciplines.  This research                     program addresses to an area of nonlinear analysis which has                    recently shown considerable progress:  nonlinear waves in                       hyperbolic systems and in coupled hyperbolic-elliptic systems.                  The investigators intend to develop computational methods which                 are based on this mathematical theory and to participate in the                 development of the mathematical theory of these waves.                                  The goal of this work is to develop the mathematical theory             and to utilize it to the maximum extent possible within the                     computational process.  The success of front tracking shows that                this goal is attainable.  One of the investigator's major                       accomplishments has been the proof of scientific principle for                  the front tracking method.  This method is now accepted, on the                 basis of evidence developed within the research program.  The                   success of front tracking has been confirmed by independent work                of others.  It parallels in two dimensions the previous success                 which has been achieved by the Random Choice Method in one                      dimension.

Adaptation of this software to the case of delay                     differential equations presents a number of difficulties, one of                them being the numerical computation of eigenvalues.                                The second project aims at developing computational methods                 for finding families of periodic solutions corresponding to                     various values of the parameter in the equation. Methods such as                piecewise polynomial approximation with collocation at Gauss-                   Legendre points and a variant of LU decomposition will be used to               solve the problem.                                                                  The third project involves calculating higher order expansion               terms of a germ fuction by possibly combining symbolic and                      numerical computing.                                                                All three projects have some analytic components and                        applications to specific equations arising in various other areas               of research.  One of the models included in the investigation is                the Hodgkin-Huxley current-clamped nerve conduction model.                      These projects are intended to yield computer codes of wider                    applicability than the specific systems studied.                                    This research falls into the general area of computational                  methods for mathematical analysis of problems described by                      ordinary and functional differential equations. Such equations                  are often used to describe dynamical phenomena in physics,                      engineering and biology."

Two               kinds of problems are considered: disrete-time dynamical                        optimization problems and continuous time problems. It seems                    likely that the results of this research may be also applicable                 to other large-scale structured nonlinear optimization problems.                    The projected Newton method algorithms converge more rapidly                than the standard first order, i.e. gradient based methods, yet                 the associated per iteration computational costs are still only                 proportional to n, where n is the number of subintervals of the                 time interval under consideration. A sizeable portion of the per                iteration work can be organized for parallel computation.                           This research belongs to computational methods in                           optimization and control. Problems of this type arise in many                   applications, typically in optimization of trajectories for space               vehicles and in calculations of optimal programs for control                    computers for various industrial processes."

Work on approximations will deal with the approximation power                   and local structure of spaces of smooth piecewise polynomial                    functions of two and three variables.  The immediate goal is                    to make precise the limitations put on approximation power by                   smoothness demands and choice of the underlying partition or                    mesh of the approximating space.                                                        The underlying structure is relatively simple although                  the problems are difficult and not motivated by one-                            dimensional theory.  A domain is subdivided and a function is                   defined to be equal to some polynomial on each piece of the                     subdivision (the polynomials can change with each piece).                       Each degree of overall smoothness forced on the function                        changes its approximating power.  The interdependency of the                    polynomial pieces makes it difficult to come up with                            effective approximation procedures.  In two-dimensions for                      example, use of highly symmetrical partitions (triangles)                       results in the theorem that the compactly supported functions                   already have best-possible span.  Work is to be done in                         establishing whether or not this is an isolated phenomenon.                             Subdivision algorithms provide an intriguing alternative                to standard ways of generating smooth curves and surfaces.                      Such algorithms obtain a curve or surface as the limit of a                     sequence of successively refined piecewise linear elements,                     each obtained by ""whittling"" pieces off its predecessor.                        They are fundamental tools in the area of computer aided                        geometric design.  One can control the shape of the limiting                    curve by controlling the choice of initial broken lines, for                    example.  Thus one may be able to design specific shapes and                    arrive at specified design characteristics through these                        algorithms.  What is not completely clear is whether or not                     the subdivision algorithms always converge.  As might be                        expected, the problems concerning surfaces are more difficult                   than those for curves.  Yet even in the latter case, examples                   show that limiting curves which for all appearances are                         smooth (on a monitor) are actually fractals."

Understanding               these effects is crucial to the proper design of computational                  methods for modeling both unsteady and steady viscoelastic flows.

The primary objective of this research program is the development               of a new class of robust and very fast algorithms for the                       solution of these problems.  These algorithms are based on the                  use of fast numerical continuation techniques to follow smooth                  penalty paths to optimality.  The key to the development of these               algorithms is an expanded Lagrangian system of equations which                  contains the penalty path as a solution, is a perturbation of the               first order necessary conditions, and sometimes, but not always,                provides a basis for finding multiple optima.  The problem                      formulation and continuation methodology provide a natural                      framework for the development and application of Tikhonov                       regularization techniques to the solution of sensitive, ill-                    conditioned, or ill-constrained optimization problems arising                   from model error or uncertainty and for the investigation of the                parametric optimization problem.  Also, in this setting the                     traditional ill-conditioning associated with a sequential                       optimization algorithm is removed for three smooth penalty                      functions:  the quadratic penalty function for equality                         constraints and the logarithmic barrier and quadratic loss                      function for inequality constraints.  In linear programming one                 of the problem formulations and correspondence algorithms is very               similar to the Karmarkar algorithm with similar expectations in                 speed; however, these fast continuation-penalty path algorithms                 are also applicable to the aforementioned constrained                           optimization problems with similar expectations in speed.                            Research of this type aims at developing new computer                      software for optimization of functions of many variables with                   constraints in the most efficient and robust way.  Software of                  this type has a large number of potential applications, ranging                 from management of resources to airline scheduling and machine                  design."

Hermann Gluck will continue his work on minimizing cycles in               homogeneous spaces; the Blaschke problem and fibrations of                      spheres by great spheres; and the topology of the space of Morse-               Smale vector fields on surfaces.                                                     Wolfgang Ziller will carry out research into Einstein                      metrics, calibrations and the rigidity of symmetric spaces.                          Calabi's research is in the area of geometric variational                  problems. The problems he will study concern extremal Kahler                    metrics, the affine Plateau problem and a variational theory of                 geodesics and minimal subvarieties. Gluck will be continuing the                search for the subvarieties of Lie groups and homogeneous spaces                which are volume minimizing in their homology classes. He will                  also work on the famous Blaschke conjecture that every Blaschke                 manifold is isometric to a round sphere or projective space. His                work on Morse-Smale vector fields is concerned with finding the                 homotopy type of the components of the set of such fields on the                two-sphere. Ziller's work on Einstein metrics is concerned with                 finding information about manifolds which admit such metrics,                   that is, having constant Ricci curvature. His work on symmetric                 spaces involves making local changes on the metric whilst                       preserving the bounds on the curvature. Such changes result in                  metrics isometric to the original metric. He will also use the                  method of calibrations to investigate which subgrassmannians have               minimal volume in their homology class."

In the problem of defining number fields as governed by class number, the discovery of theorems through experimentation has been so empirical yet routine that some expert logic system is called for.
