The objective of this proposal is to exploit<br/>in depth structural properties of matrices from the standpoint of their application<br/>backgrounds and to develop accurate and efficient structural preserving numerical<br/>methods for eigenvalue and related problems of practical significance. A number of<br/>interesting ideas will be pursued here, including a general framework for carrying<br/>out structural preserving subspace projections, an unifying convergence analysis<br/>for all Krylov subspace type projections that connects moment matching properties<br/>in reduced order modeling and eigenvalue and eigenvector convergence theory, and a<br/>sub-orthogonalization process that will serve as the basis to devise efficient<br/>projections.<br/><br/>Eigenproblems appear ubiquitously all across applied science and engineering,<br/>and their solutions are routinely sought and are critical in one way or another<br/>to various scientific computational tasks.

This is the case for nonlinear  conservation laws, advection-dominated flows, multi-phase flows, and free-boundary problems,  where shocks fronts and discontinuities are driving features and pose significant difficulties  for numerical methods. The natural stability setting for these problems involves integrability, bounded variations, or boundedness. This kind of stability naturally occurs when one wants to preserve quantities like mass or when one wishes to preserve the positivity or the boundedness  of quantities like temperature or density. The investigators propose to develop a new nonlinear  approximation technique for solving the above class of differential equations. This new approach  consists of computing the best approximation in the natural stability norm of the problem, which is a radically different point of view than that of standard  techniques. The investigators trade a linear non-optimal perspective (working in energy spaces) for an optimal nonlinear one (working in bounded-variation-like spaces). Even though the nonlinear algorithms are more complicated and difficult to analyze, they yield great benefits when working with rough data, complicated boundary, and stiff nonlinearities.<br/><br/>A large amount of work has been dedicated in the past to the development of robust numerical methods. Significant progress has been made in some areas, but the current state of the art is far from providing accurate and faithful numerical representations of complex processes. For instance, simulating interfaces, shocks, and sharp fronts is still an enormous challenge. The proposed project has a broad impact in many fields. In mechanical and aerospace engineering,  the proposed method improves numerical models for simulating high velocity gas dynamics, nonlinear  elasticity problems, and phase transition in new materials like shape memory alloys. In petroleum engineering the new set of methods  is beneficial for simulating multi-phase flows in reservoirs. In general, the project will also have  significant impact on environmental sciences, geophysics, and nanotechnologies where robust approximation techniques for solving  shocks, sharp interfaces, and nonlinear phenomena are needed."

This is a fundamental scientific problem in which both nanoscale and macroscale effects are important.  The resulting film morphology is determined by a complex interaction between thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In addition, epitaxial growth techniques have been used to create novel materials which contain quantum dots (nanometer sized collections of atoms embedded in a matrix of different species of atoms).  The resulting material has unique electronic properties.  For example, solid-state lasers have been made out of such materials. In addition, there is hope that such materials may be useful in quantum computing applications.  Modeling the growth of such a material is still in its infancy.<br/><br/>The purpose of this proposal is to develop efficient algorithms for the simulation of epitaxial growth using a computer. The proposal will focus on atomistic models rather than continuous ones since they naturally include nanoscale physical effects such as nucleation and fluctuations.  In particular, kinetic Monte Carlo models will be used, in which simple rules for atom motion are evolved in stochastic fashion. The proposal aims at devising efficient computational methods to simulate such models. Our computational strategy is based on coarse-graining both in time and space, taking special care to preserve physical fidelity.  Preliminary results indicate that our algorithms are 5 to 10 times faster than the current state-of-the-art.  It is felt that the numerical methods proposed here will allow model development to proceed at a much faster pace, thereby facilitating the design of new materials.

Differential equations are commonly used to model physical and biological phenomena in many areas of science and engineering.  A differential equation is a rule, a relationship between the solution and its derivatives, that determines how an initial configuration evolves into future configurations.  The focus of this project is on the approximation of Lyapunov exponents and related quantities that provide information on stability, the tendency for nearby configurations to evolve nearby, and instability, the tendency for nearby configurations to move apart, and on the analysis and computation of lattice differential equations, i.e., differential equations that are discrete in space and continuous in time.  Much of this work emphasizes the blending of rigorous analysis with practical implementation of algorithms.  This research has as a central theme: the combination of dynamical systems and numerical analysis ideas together with the modeling and analysis of differential equations.  Discrete models play a prominent role in the modeling of physical and biological systems.  Of particular interest are traveling wave solutions of lattice differential equations.  Sacker-Sell and Lyapunov spectral intervals are natural analogues of the real parts of the eigenvalues that provide stability information for time-varying differential equations.  The investigator develops, analyzes, and justifies the use of numerical techniques for the approximation of these spectral intervals.  A suite of computational modules for the computation of stability information and for functional traveling waves is being developed.  It is backed by analysis of the numerical techniques in a form that should prove useful to working scientists and engineers."

One goal of this project is to develop and employ computational topological techniques to use the observed patterns to identify, quantify and classify the time-dependent properties of the underlying systems. <br/><br/>Mathematical models for spatially dependent systems that evolve with time are typically extremely difficult to analyze using traditional mathematical techniques, and thus much of what we know about the detailed evolution of these systems comes from numerical simulations.

In principle, algebraic topological properties remain invariant under small perturbations.

Vortex sheets are weak solutions of the ideal fluid equations <br/>in which the vorticity is concentrated on a surface and they are widely used in fluid dynamics to <br/>represent thin shear layers in slightly viscous flow. Vortex sheet simulations encounter severe difficulties <br/>due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, singularity formation, and chaotic dynamics, but the investigator has <br/>shown that these difficulties can be overcome by regularizing the Biot-Savart kernel in the equation <br/>governing the motion of material points on the sheet surface. The present project extends the capability <br/>of these regularized particle simulations by developing an improved treecode algorithm for evaluating <br/>the Biot-Savart integral, and adaptive quadrature and particle insertion schemes to maintain resolution <br/>as the sheet rolls up. In contrast to other approaches using spherical harmonics, the present treecode <br/>algorithm uses Taylor approximations in Cartesian coordinates which provides more flexibility and enables <br/>the method to be applied to nonharmonic functions such as the regularized Biot-Savart kernel. <br/>The quadrature and insertion schemes to be developed will make essential use of the Lagrangian <br/>sheet parameterization. The investigator will perform particle simulations of vortex ring dynamics and will <br/>compare the results to laboratory experiments and direct numerical solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.

For example, automobile manufacturers, as well as pharmaceutical companies, <br/>routinely use computer simulations in the design of new products. A successful computer simulation relies <br/>on several components: a mathematical model of the physical problem, numerical algorithms for <br/>implementing the model on a computer, and computer hardware to perform the simulation. <br/>The present project focuses on the first two components by developing better models and algorithms <br/>for the computer simulation of fluid flows which are dominated by vortices. Vortices in air or water are <br/>usually invisible, but they can exert strong forces on nearby solid structures. One example is the trailing <br/>vortex wake behind an airplane which is responsible for the lift of the airplane, but also poses a hazard <br/>for nearby aircraft. In crowded urban airports with few runways, it is often necessary for an airplane to <br/>wait several minutes before taking off, to ensure that the wake of the preceding aircraft has dissipated <br/>to a safe level. The present investigation will contribute better algorithms for simulating the trailing wake <br/>which can be used by aeronautical engineers in designing methods to enhance wake dissipation <br/>and reduce takeoff delays. The algorithms developed in this project are also applicable to evaluating <br/>electrostatic forces at the molecular level, a generic computational problem with many potential <br/>applications in areas such as chemistry and plasma physics. <br/><br/>"

The project contains four components related to these spaces: their geometric analysis, the development of appropriate statistical methods, the required numerical analysis, and the application of the results to medical imaging and computational anatomy. The general framework is addressed by a new approach which in some sense formalizes the mechanics of shapes. Lie groups with right invariant metrics indeed are structures on which classical laws of mechanics can be shown to hold, and in particular the conservation of momentum along paths of minimal energy. It turns out that this momentum is a key to the representation and characterization of deformations in this context. It is albeit difficult to handle, because it is usually singular, as a measure, or a distribution on a singular support. This and the numerical difficulty it creates is probably one of the main challenges that we address in our study. Other important aspects are the study of the geometry such an approach induces on shape spaces, including a study of their curvatures, and the existence and stability of normal coordinates. This will be related to open issues in shape statistics, and applied in particular to biomedical imaging problems. <br/><br/>This approach is therefore designed to provide new tools for describing and analyzing shapes. Although shapes are prevalent in the outside world and in science, this is a difficult problem. For the human mind, there is an intuitive notion of what shapes are, why they differ or look alike, or when they present abnormalities with respect to ordinary observations. Sculpture is the art of rendering existing shapes, or creating new ones, and the fact that artists are still able to provide unambiguous instances of subjects through distorted or schematic representations is a strong indication of the robustness of the human shape recognition engine. However, an analytical description of a shape is much less obvious, and humans are much less efficient for this task, as if the understanding and recognition of forms work without an accurate extraction of their constituting components. We can recognize a squash from an eggplant or a pepper via a simple outline, and even provide a series of discriminative features which distinguish them, but it is much harder to phrase a verbal description of any of them, accurate enough, say for a painter to reproduce it. It is therefore not surprising that, for mathematics, shape description remains mostly a challenge. There are however very important applications which depend on progresses made in this field, one of them being the computerized analysis of biomedical shapes (computational anatomy), which analyzes the impact of diseases on shapes of organs, obtained from modern techniques of non-invasive 3D imagery. The last fifty years of research in computer vision has shown a amazingly large variety of points of view and techniques designed for this purpose: 2D or 3D sets they delineate (via either volume or boundary), moment-based features, medial axes or surfaces, null sets of polynomials, configurations of points of interest (landmarks), to name but a few. Yet, it does not seem that any of these methods has emerged as ideal, neither conceptually nor computationally, for describing shapes. An important aspect of our study will be to describe shapes with an indirect approach, from the way they can be deformed. This is not a new idea, and can be traced back to the seminal works of D'Arcy Thompson at the beginning of the 20th century, but its mathematical formalization and the design of practical algorithms is a comprehensive task, still offering many open problems, that the present group will try to address and convey to the scientific community."

SVD-based methods compute  explicitly the basis<br/>of the dominant singular vectors  and proceed with a projection of the<br/>data on  this basis.  This has  the desirable effect  of filtering out<br/>noise and  redundancy inherent to  the data, while retaining  its main<br/>structural  features  (e.g., `semantic  contents'  in LSI).   However,<br/>SVD-based methods tend to be expensive, both in terms of computational<br/>cost and  storage, and  become impractical for  very large  data sets.<br/>The premise of  this proposal is that there is no  need to compute the<br/>(partial)  SVD  in  order  to perform  dimensionality  reduction.  The<br/>projection  of a  given  vector  onto the  space  associated with  the<br/>largest singular  values can be accurately reproduced  by a polynomial<br/>filtering   technique.   This   technique,   which  entails   repeated<br/>multiplication  of  a vector  by  the  original  data matrix  and  its<br/>transpose, offers  several advantages including  low computational and<br/>storage  requirements.

Conversely, numerical techniques have been applied to solve computational problems arising in ""non-traditional"" fields. A good example is the fruitful interaction between computational mathematics and algebraic geometry. Singularity theory, which builds on ideas of algebraic geometry, has been embraced by computational scientists to compute paths of critical points in multi-parameter systems of differential and partial differential equations. Symmetries and group actions are used to create numerical methods for specific types of problems with significantly improved accuracy and stability properties. Techniques in algebraic geometry are also very useful for finding solutions of differential equations on manifolds, and are currently being applied to develop algorithms to compute decompositions of higher order tensors. On the other hand, numerical techniques for continuation, homotopy and symmetry provide the basis for methods in numerical algebraic geometry that are used to compute solution components of systems of polynomial equations. The ability to carry out the numerical decomposition of polynomial systems has yielded applications in mechanical engineering including the understanding and design of mechanisms that transmit, control, or constrain relative motion, robotics, control theory (pole placement), integer programming, and statistics. The development of hybrid exact/approximate methods for finding solutions of polynomial equations gives rise to issues of errors and stability that confront numerical analysts in many other contexts. <br/><br/>The Workshop on geometry and symmetry in numerical computation will bring together experts from computational mathematics and algebraic geometry in order to explore and develop the potential in this rich interdisciplinary area.  The program has been planned specifically to introduce and attract students and young investigators to this area. Each session will begin with an introductory lecture followed by four talks by leading experts. The introductory speakers will prepare a short ""guide"" describing some basic language and results that the audience can use during the invited talks. The one hour lectures themselves will be aimed towards an audience of advanced graduate students and researchers from different areas of mathematics. We expect the Workshop to break down disciplinary barriers and encourage cross-fertilization between researchers from algebraic geometry and numerical analysis. The lectures and discussion sections will encourage students and young researchers to become involved in the intersection of algebraic geometry and numerical analysis, and will provide stimulation and support for those already engaged in this activity. Potential outcomes range from improved methods to compute large complex physical systems governed by systems of partial differential equations, to advances in computational methods for general relativity, to new geometric methods for the analysis of large data sets, and to more efficient numerical methods for robotics and control.<br/>"

One direction is analysis of the  linear support vector machine which has already been validated as an effective tool in statistical pattern recognition.   Reformulation of the support vector machine to account for errors that may occur in the features of the patterns to be classified, an example of which might be error contaminated microarray data, utilizing the tools of regularized total least squares, will  better account for  these errors in data measurements. Another direction is the use of a total variation regularized structured  total least squares  algorithm to provide a completely new  mechanism for combining edge preserving  regularization with an errors in the variables model of signal inversion. For multiple, but similarly corrupted, signals, a concurrent solution technique will enhance signal inversion and restoration.  While several approaches for Tikhonov regularized total least squares have  been presented in literature, an effective comparison of their competitiveness  for both synthetic and real data has not been performed. These investigators will determine which of algorithms are most suitable for extensions to realistic problems.

Both applications are governed by complex systems of PDEs with nonlinearities due to, e.g., the constitutive equations or the  intricate coupling conditions for the PDEs. Moreover, both optimization problems involve additional equality and inequality constraints due to design  specifications or problem chemistry.<br/><br/>This research provides new algorithmic tools for optimization problems with constraints given by systems of partial differential equations  (PDEs). The solution of such problems is an important task in an increasing number real-life applications such as the shape optimization of  technological devices and the identification of physical quantities in atmospheric and geophysical processes. Despite recent progress, the  reliable numerical solution of these optimization problems still represents a  challenging task.  Challenges arise, e.g., from the complexity of the underlying PDEs, from the large scale of the optimization problems and from the interactions of the structure of the underlying application, the numerical solution of PDEs and the numerical optimization.

Complementarity systems constitute a new mathematical paradigm that finds a wide range of applications in nonsmooth mechanics, robotics, multi-body dynamics, switched circuit systems, economic and traffic systems, and even biological systems.  As such, the rigorous study of these systems is warranted.  Due to their intrinsically nonsmooth characteristics, such a study defies classical dynamical systems theory and requires novel mathematical analysis, computational and design tools.  This proposed project is devoted to the investigation of challenging issues in the analysis and control of complementarity systems.  We propose to apply state-of-art techniques from mathematical programming, convex analysis, systems theory, and control theory to tackle these problems.  On the analytical side, we will address several fundamental and critical issues of system behavior, e.g., existence and uniqueness of solutions and Zeno property, which are directly related to numerical computation and system analysis.  Moreover, we aim at studying controllability and observability and developing control algorithms that will be applied to robot motion planning, multi-body systems subject to unilateral constraints, and constrained dynamic optimization problems.<br/><br/>Dynamical systems modeled by ODEs provide a powerful mathematical and computational framework for the study and understanding of a wide range of time-dependent physical phenomena that naturally occur in many engineering applications.  As the application areas expand, researchers and designers are encountering increasingly complex systems subject to various constraints, which arise as a result of the global behavior of the systems and the interactions between them and their complex environment and/or other systems at different levels.  A trivial example of such constraints is a falling object before and after hitting the ground.  At the instant where the object touches the ground, an impact occurs followed by a rebounce of the object that results in a change of direction of the object's motion.  This is a mode transition.  The proposed research aims at treating dynamical systems where mode transition is an unknown but important component of the overall system configuration.  If successful, the results of the research will let us gain a better understanding of many complex engineering systems with mode changes and will provide a solid foundation for the improved design of such systems that in turn will have a significant impact on many practical fields.

This resource, vital to human activities, is constantly threatened by contamination.  Groundwater becomes contaminated when man-made and sometimes naturally-occurring substances are dissolved in waters recharging the groundwater.  Often, as groundwater is connected with lakes and rivers, the pollution of these surface waters implies the pollution of aquifers.  Thus, it is important to understand the flow and transport of the coupled system of rivers, lakes, and aquifers.  In this first application, such complex multiphysics couplings are studied.<br/><br/>The second application modeled in this work involves sepsis, which in the U.S. is the primary cause of death in critically ill patients.  Sepsis can be defined as an uncontrolled inflammatory response due to bacterial infection.  As of today, there are very few therapeutic options available to patients.  Simulating inflammation and organ dysfunction that accompany sepsis can help understand this complex problem.  The modeling process consists of identifying key chemical components and their interaction in different subdomains such as organs, epithelial layers, and blood arteries.<br/><br/>The underlying mathematical equations characterizing both applications are similar.  Those equations are derived from the balance equations of continuum mechanics that express the conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy of an arbitrary volume moving within a fluid.  Efficient and reliable numerical methods will be developed as a part of this project.  One project output will be a computational tool that is beneficial to both environmental engineers and medical personnel.  On one hand, effective strategies for clean-up of contaminated groundwaters can be simulated.  At the same time,a better understanding of the inflammatory response due to bacterial infection will lead to the design of therapeutic solutions for sepsis.  Another impact of this project will be the stimulation of the discovery process for undergraduate and graduate students involved in the research project.<br/><br/>Educational activities for the proposed project include the development of a new modeling course, the creation of a Master's degree in Computational and Applied Mathematics, the continuous mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students and their exposure to international collaborations, and an increase in the number of students, including minorities, graduating with a Master or Ph.D. degree in Mathematics."

These<br/>topics cover a number of important applications of computational<br/>science, including off-shore petroleum exploration, the numerical<br/>modeling of black holes, the modeling of crystal growth and<br/>biomembranes, capturing diffraction effects of waves and path<br/>planning.

The inclusion of random effects can serve a number of distinct purposes. On one hand, randomness can be used to compensate for elements of a system not fully modeled or for insufficiently resolved scales in the system. This research proposal concentrates on the analysis of how randomness spreads through large dimensional, extended dynamical systems.  One of the central questions is how passing through many nonlinear interactions or scales shapes the randomness. Stochastically forced partial differential equations (SPDEs) such as stochastic fluid equations or stochastically forced reaction diffusion equations will be a focus of the proposed work. These systems are often agitated at one scale and it is of both mathematical and modeling interest to understand the effect of this agitation at other scales. In particular, this proposal hopes to shed light on the transfer of randomness between different scales in turbulent fluid flow. In addition to SPDEs, the proposal will study related questions in large chemical networks arising in cell regulation and nutrient flow in forest environments. The emphasis will be on the pathwise dynamics, novel stochastic numerical methods, and estimation problems.<br/><br/>Quantifying and modeling uncertainty is increasingly important in our attempts to understand and predict our complex and changing world.  From the financial markets, to weather prediction, to environmental engendering, to neuroscience, to aeronautics, models including random influences have become central to the physical sciences, to the social sciences and to engineering.  Of particular significance is understanding how pure randomness is shaped into the structures we observe, especially when the randomness is transferred across disparate spatial scales. This understanding is the key to producing effective models with which to predict complex real systems. This proposal specifically addresses questions central to turbulent water flow and complicated biochemical pathways in cells. More broadly, applied mathematicians are on the leading edge of<br/>our scientific and technological future.  Because of their broad training, they are the best equipped to move into new, non-traditional fields as they appear, build the bridges between classical disciplines, and disseminate the understanding gained in purer mathematical studies to larger scientific and social endeavors. America's leadership in science and technology requires us<br/>to continue producing world-class researchers and students in applied mathematics.

Most people think of a bumpy plane rides (in this case the<br/>domain is the volume around the airplane).  Like the swirls generated by<br/>rocks in a stream, rapidly changing patterns form in the air around the<br/>plane.  Turbulence theories do not attempt to predict the precise<br/>development of these patterns, but rather find (a) consistent laws which<br/>describe how, on average, energy is transferred to smaller length scales,<br/>and (b) critical length scales at which this this phenomenon changes. <br/>True 2-D flows in nature are less prevalent.  The most prominent example,<br/>the earth's atmosphere, is actually a thin 3-D domain, whose behavior<br/>approaches that of a 2-D flow.  The fate of energy over different length<br/>scales is more complicated for 2-D flow, though that of 3-D flow is in<br/>some sense embedded into it.

For example, in recent decades there has been an explosion of interest in the mathematical modeling of neurons.  Models such as the Hodgkin-Huxley equations (and their simplifications) for the voltage across the cell membrane of a neuron are often studied in singularly perturbed regimes.<br/><br/>Because it is rare for the equations that model these systems to have explicit analytical solutions, they are often analyzed with either analytical approximations or computer simulations.

Unfortunately, the analysis required to derive an approximate solution by these methods can be intractable.  One can resort to computer simulations when analysis fails, but singularly perturbed systems are notoriously difficult to solve by computer simulation.<br/><br/>In this project, we will create a collection of computer programs that avoid the computational difficulties of solving the full singularly perturbed system by instead solving the slow and fast phases separately.  The slow and fast solutions will be combined to create an approximate solution to the full system.  The approximations generated will not be as accurate as those found by solving the original system, but they will be faster to compute.  They will be accurate enough to answer many important questions, and they will also help researchers to determine where they should apply more sophisticated methods."

It is hard to overestimate the impact that mathematical understanding of waves has had on society over the last century, particularly in communications technology.  At high frequencies the wavelength becomes much smaller than the cavity size, and conventional numerical discretization methods become impractically slow, making the problem computationally challenging.

Second, the investigators develop new visualisation techniques to display the structural information found in the first step.<br/><br/>Internet chatrooms provide an interactive and public forum of communication for participants with diverse objectives. Two properties of chatrooms make them particularly vulnerable for exploitation by malicious parties.  First, the real identities of the participants are decoupled from their chatroom nicknames.

Although human-monitoring of each chatroom to determine ""who-is-chatting-with-whom"" is possible, it is very time consuming, hence not scalable.  Thus, it is very easy to conceal malicious behavior in Internet chatrooms and use them for covert communications (e.g., adversary using a teenager chatroom to plan a terrorist act).

This has, in turn, brought closer the promise of computational experiments as true surrogates for physical experiments.  The benefits of this development are very clear:  products can be designed to their smallest detail before expensive production begins; complex systems such as airplanes and chemical plants can be faithfully designed and certified while bypassing the very expensive ""physical testing"" phase; what-if scenarios involving hypothetical disasters such as terrorist attacks or meteor encounters can be preempted or at least be readied for.<br/><br/>An essential component towards fulfilling this promise of ""computational reality"" is the realization that reality is variable:  every time a wave is observed on the shore, every time an earthquake is measured, a soil specimen dug out from the earth, different and unique features are observed of the wave, the quake, or the soil, respectively.  Then, a challenge to ""computational reality"" is the ability to reproduce this real-world scatter.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses this very issue by modeling the unknown root cause of this variability using the mathematical theory of probabilities.  Thus, uncertainties that contribute to the observed variability in nature become an intrinsic part of the predictive model, endowing it with the ability to more realistically reproduce reality.  As significant contributions to this overarching problem, two issues are specifically addressed in the present research.  First, it is vital that the particular form of uncertainty with which the model is endowed does indeed correspond to that observed in reality.  Thus, in the first component of the present research, theory and algorithms for constructing models of stochastic processes that are consistent with experimental observations will be developed.  These models will be developed such that they can be efficiently embedded into computational algorithms currently in use by state-of-the-art predictive tools.  Stochastic representations pioneered by the PI will be used to that end.  Secondly, it must be noted that any effort at capturing the variability in nature is fraught with complexity, not the least of which is the burden of enumerating, in some sense, all possible states of nature.  The second component of the present research addresses this complexity through innovative computational algorithms that can efficiently and faithfully reproduce natural variability.  This will be done by capitalizing on a certain structure both in the underlying physics as well as in the mathematical form assumed to govern the physical behavior of interest.  Both new models and new algorithms will be developed to tackle this problem.<br/><br/>This research provides a significant contribution towards enabling rational risk management and resource allocation for complex systems whose accurate behavior requires the large-scale computational solution of complex mathematical equations."

A standard mathematical model <br/>for describing this type of problems is the nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLS). <br/>By now, this equation is relatively well studied. There are, however, indications <br/>that the NLS model may be oversimplified. An alternative is provided by a more <br/>comprehensive nonlinear Helmholtz equation (NLH), from which the NLS is, in fact, <br/>derived by employing the so-called paraxial approximation and neglecting the <br/>important phenomenon of backscattering. In contradistinction to the NLS, relatively <br/>little is known about the solvability of the NLH and uniqueness of its solutions.<br/>Moreover, this equation presents a considerable challenge for the numerical approach<br/>as well. Nonlinearity is a major hurdle, as it implies that the impinging and<br/>(back)scattered waves cannot be separated. Another key difficulty is the small <br/>magnitude of backscattering compared to that of the forward propagating wave.<br/>In the course of the project, the PI and his colleagues will develop, implement,<br/>and test an efficient numerical procedure for integrating the NLH. It will involve<br/>major modifications and improvements to the previously proposed methodology that<br/>has already proven successful and, in fact, unparalled in the literature. The <br/>methodology employs a high-order finite-difference approximation. Its central <br/>element is a special two-way nonlocal artificial boundary condition that makes the <br/>outer boundary transparent for all the outgoing waves and at the same time is capable <br/>of accurately prescribing the given impinging signal. It is expected that with the <br/>help of this methodology, a valuable new insight will be gained into a number of key <br/>outstanding questions in nonlinear optics, in particular, whether the nonparaxiality <br/>and backscattering may arrest the collapse (blow-up) of focusing nonlinear waves, and <br/>whether the NLH is capable of sustaining the so-called narrow spatial solitons, with <br/>the width on the order of only several wavelengths.<br/><br/>In the course of the project, a numerical methodology will be built to simulate the<br/>propagation of intense laser light through a variety of media and materials. This <br/>methodology has a solid mathematical foundation, and is expected to help address<br/>a number of challenging issues in the theoretical nonlinear optics. In addition<br/>to its potential theoretical merits, the methodology will be useful from the <br/>standpoint of applications as well. Indeed, the propagation of laser beams in <br/>materials is typically accompanied by the phenomena of nonlinear self-focusing and <br/>backscattering. The capability to quantitatively analyze and predict these key <br/>phenomena is extremely important for many of applications in modern science and <br/>engineering. The latter range from remote atmosphere sensing (when an earth-based <br/>powerful laser sends pulses to the sky, and backscattered radiation accounts for a <br/>substantial part of the detected signal), to laser surgery (propagation of laser beams <br/>in tissues), to transmitting information along optical fibers. There are other possible <br/>applications that involve, e.g., interactions between the co-propagating or counter-<br/>propagating laser beams. They may provide a vehicle for designing the so-called all-<br/>optical switches for the next generation of opto-electronic circuits. The proposed <br/>numerical methodology will yield a powerful tool for the accurate and robust analysis <br/>of the foregoing applications, along with many others.<br/>"

This interdisciplinary research and training program focuses on developing mathematical models and computational techniques to overcome the challenges of computationally studying surface defects in solids and coarsening in solid-solid and solid-liquid systems.  The mathematical impacts of the study will include accurate and fast numerical methods for microstructural evolution in three dimensions and for evolution of defects on solid surfaces, using boundary integral methods and incorporating both diffusional and elastic effects.  These techniques will be applied to (1) investigate coarsening in solid-solid and solid-liquid systems by performing two- and three-dimensional simulations, and (2) examine step flows (motion of atomic-height steps) on solid surfaces in three dimensions.  These investigations will provide insights into materials issues encountered in high-temperature alloys and semiconductor thin film growth.  Close collaborations with experimentalists will allow comparisons of the simulation and experimental results.  The equations governing the proposed material systems are closely related to a host of mathematical descriptions for pattern formation in moving boundary problems.

Fast accurate solvers for algebraically complete first-order formulations split Green functions into singular and global terms, and achieve optimal efficiency for elliptic/parabolic systems with complex interfaces.  The interface motion  and velocity evaluation components connect through new implicit time-stepping schemes which handle sensitive interface velocities stably.  The Frechet  derivatives incurred in the solution of implicit schemes are systematically decomposed into universal components, and computed by efficiently reusable computational modules.<br/><br/>Mathematical models of complex evolving material interfaces dominate technological processes ranging from semiconductor production to surgery planning, from computer animation to computer-controlled machine tooling.  Efficient general computational techniques are crucial in designing better models.  The investigators are developing efficient new modular computational tools for simulating technological processes in robust user-friendly ways.  This highly interdisciplinary enterprise combines mathematics and computer science to benefit scientific endeavors ranging from cartography to crystallography.  The research objectives intertwine with an interdisciplinary  educational program, training future scientists and engineers through web-enabled courses, math/science/engineering seminars and individual student research mentoring.<br/>"

EIT is a relatively new medical imaging technique in which electrodes are placed on the surface of the body, current is applied on the electrodes, and the resulting voltage is measured on the electrodes.  Since the various organs and tissues in the body frequently have different conductive properties, an image is formed from the reconstructed conductivity distribution.  In this research the D- bar reconstruction algorithm for 2-D EIT based on the paper by Nachman [Ann. Of Math. 143 (1996)] will be further developed through a study of the algorithm applied to discontinuous conductivities, a study of electrode effects on the algorithm, incorporating boundary reconstruction in the numerical algorithm, more accurate computations of the scattering transform, and adapting the algorithm to non-circular geometries.  This work is expected to improve the accuracy of the method and bring it to a clinically useful stage.  In addition, a 3-D D-bar algorithm will be developed for EIT data collected on planar electrode arrays.  The particular clinical application for the 3-D algorithm is breast cancer detection.<br/><br/>This work will provide further insight into the D-bar method in two and three dimensions.  The terminology ""D-bar method"" comes from the techniques in inverse scattering which result in a D-bar equation, which is a certain type of partial differential equation in complex variables, to be solved in the reconstruction process.  The 2-D D-bar algorithm is the only direct (non-iterative) method for EIT solving the full nonlinear conductivity problem to have been successfully implemented on experimental EIT data.  At present, no direct numerically implemented method exists for EIT in three dimensions.   The 2-D EIT problem has an important application as a method for monitoring patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  ARDS is a life-threatening condition in which inflammation of the lungs and fluid in the air sacs leads to low blood oxygen levels.  The treatment is mechanical ventilation, which has potential side-effects to the lungs.  By placing electrodes around the patient's thorax, EIT can be used to continually monitor ARDS patients, providing information about their condition and aiding in determining the proper ventilator settings to minimize side-effects.  A 3-D D-bar reconstruction algorithm with the main application of breast cancer detection has the potential to reconstruct the conductivity values with more accuracy than existing algorithms and thus may improve the specificity of EIT as a method of breast cancer detection.  EIT as a tool for breast cancer detection is in the early stages, and the development and study of a 3-D D-bar algorithm will provide a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of EIT for this application."

Platelets are micron-size cells - smaller than red blood cells - and when activated they become adhesive for other activated platelets and they adhere to the vessel wall. Their strong interaction with nano-size proteins at the sub-endothelium matrix activates and reshapes them from passively traveling discoids to active spiny spheres. The length and time scales characterizing such interactions as well as platelet-blood flow interactions span several orders of magnitude.<br/><br/>We propose a multiscale modeling methodology with focus on flow-modulated phenomena such as platelet adhesion and aggregation at the micron-scale, and including nanoscale effects representing the main protein interactions. We will develop an integrated approach by coupling multiscale representations of blood flow, ranging from a quasi 1D transient flow in compliant vessels at the largest scale, to unsteady 3D flows in curved and flexing vessels at the mm range, to multi micron-scale thrombus formation at a fissure in the lumen of such a vessel with an atherosclerotic plaque, to changes over short times (seconds and minutes) in the behavior of platelet structure, receptors and bonds in a developing thrombus-wall interaction. To this end, we will develop a new mesoscopic numerical method that bridges the gap between atomistic phenomena and large-scale phenomena to seamlessly connect length scales from 10 nm to a few mm. The new simulation approach will be validated systematically against experiments of varying biological and computational complexity.<br/><br/>We also propose to establish a virtual center for multiscale modeling in order to provide modelers and experimentalists with quantitative information about molecular and cellullar processes that can be incorporated into simplified models. To this end, we plan to organize a workshop on multiscale modeling of biological processes during the second year of the proposed project. In our outreach program, we plan to engage pre-college women from the Providence area in computer and computational sciences. This will involve lectures by our medical collaborators as well as interactive learning at Brown's virtual immersive visualization facility.<br/><br/>The potential impact of this work is great as it provides a new simulation capability for studying biomolecular interactions in blood vessels, organs and the entire arterial tree in a few hours instead of days or even weeks on a supercomputer. This, in turn, will allow fundamental studies at the molecular and cellular level and interaction with macroscales not currently possible with existing methodologies."

The foundation of this framework is<br/>a class of band-limited functions (that is, functions that have<br/>compactly supported Fourier transforms) which are also locally<br/>concentrated in the spatial domain.  Although images are seldom truly<br/>band-limited, they are generally considered piecewise smooth, and are<br/>frequently modeled so locally (or piecewisely) by smooth functions<br/>such as polynomials and trigonometric functions.  Since common images<br/>contain many features such as edges and textures that are usually<br/>locally compact in the Fourier domain and simultaneously limited in<br/>the spatial (or image) domain, functions of this type are an ideal<br/>choice of basis for image representations.  The PI will develop<br/>numerical methods for the construction of the band-limited basis<br/>functions, as well as efficient methods for the analysis and synthesis<br/>of images in such bases.

In many cases, however, there exists a much larger error associated with the fact that the physical parameters, the geometry, and the operating conditions of the simulated flow are not precisely known.  With the computational fluid dynamics field reaching now some degree of maturity, we naturally pose the more general question of how to model uncertainty and stochastic input mathematically, and how to develop new algorithms that will yield simulation results that reflect accurately the propagation of uncertainty.  To this end, the Monte Carlo approach can be employed but it is computationally expensive and it is only used as the last resort.<br/><br/>In this grant we develop a new approach similar to high-order finite element methods but instead decomposing the random domain.  Specifically, we extend the pioneering ideas of Norbert Wiener in generalized Fourier series -- the so-called polynomial chaos expansion -- and apply it locally to each random element.  The resulting system of governing equations forms a set of coupled modified flow equations, which are deterministic and thus can be solved with standard numerical methods.  Comparisons with the Monte Carlo method show that the new method is faster by a factor of 100 to 1000 on the average.  We propose to document systematically this method and use it to study in detail important problems in high-speed flows and in modeling blood flow in the human arterial tree. The proposed approach will affect fundamentally the way we design new experiments and the type of questions that we can address, while the interaction between simulation and experiment will become more meaningful and more dynamic.  This, in turn, will find its way into the design of flow systems equipment and will provide a rigorous reliability framework.<br/><br/>We plan to involve graduate and undergraduate students in the current research and we will develop a specific initiative to attract pre-college female students to mathematics and computational science."

Emphasis will be placed on three topics: (1) The N-vortex problem on a rotating sphere with applications to atmospheric flows; (2) Analysis and data acquisition of global weather patterns; (3) N-body numerical algorithm development. Each is designed to develop new analytical and computational techniques in dynamical systems theory, test current techniques on models that are physically well grounded, develop new numerical algorithms that conserve quantities we know should be conserved, and push the models closer towards applications mostly in oceanographic and atmospheric sciences, but also in molecular modeling where some of the same underlying issues pertain (albeit with Hamiltonians of a different form). In many cases, techniques that have been developed for N-body problems in the celestial mechanics context will be exploited and adapted for use on this class of discrete vortex problems. Tools developed fall under the general category of high-performance computing in the context of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanical systems and the topics will be relevant in the development and formulation of global circulation models for the atmosphere and oceans. The data acquisition portion of the project focuses on the understanding of global weather patterns and the connection between these patterns and the transport and mixing of passive and active scalars such as environmental pollutants, oceanographic biota, and atmospheric ozone."
