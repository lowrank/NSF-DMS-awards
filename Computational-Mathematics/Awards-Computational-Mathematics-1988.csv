The research in this project               centers on analogues of the hypergeometric functions in which the               argument is a matrix, rather than a real or complex number. The                 representation theory of the general linear group plays a major                 role in this investigation, because the generalized                             hypergeometric functions can be thought of as having for their                  domain of definition a certain quotient of that group.

Problems in the                       latter area stem from several sources.  One is the Littlewood                   conjecture which predicts the mean value of the spherical                       derivature of polynomials and rational functions.  The                          conjecture has been shown to be sharp for rational functions                    but not for polynomials.  Work will be done in obtaining                        sharp constants in the rational case and working out the                        correct power of the polynomial's degree in the other.  These                   results are expected to derive from better estimates for                        harmonic measure.  These should follow from recent work on                      the dimension of sets which can support harmonic measure.                            Work on elliptic partial differential equations will be                    concerned with measuring the growth of solutions to the                         biharmonic equation in terms of the Riesz capacity of set                       where the gradient vanishes.  Sharp results for lower                           dimensions have been obtained.  In the area of parabolic and                    heat equations, the question of absolute continuity of the                      parabolic measure with respect to Lebesgue measure will be                      taken up. That this is not always the case has already been                     established for two-dimensional domains.  In this context,                      good necessary and sufficient conditions on the boundary for                    absolute continuity have been established.  The present work                    looks to extend the theory to higher dimensions.                                     Applications to the representation theory for solutions                    of parabolic equations will follow."

The first one                      concerns Artin's conjecture for composite numbers.  That is, what               can one say about the elements of maximal order modulo a                        composite number.  The second problem concerns finding efficient                discrete logarithm algorithms and efficient algorithms for                      factoring large numbers.  The principal investigator and his                    colleagues have built a special purpose computer for implementing               his quadratic sieve algorithm for factoring large integers.  He                 will study the practical aspects of implementing on this and                    other computers linear and cubic sieve algorithms which are                     promising practical methods and he will also attempt to find new                methods, especially for the discrete logarithm problem.  The                    third problem concerns elliptic curves over finite fields and                   their applications to primality testing.  It is hoped that a                    polylog algorithm for constructing an elliptic curve with a                     prescribed order modulo a given prime can be found.  This is                    known from a result of the principal investigator to give a                     polylog primality test.                                                              This research is in the area of computational number theory                with a heavy concentration on algorithms for factoring integers                 and testing whether they are primes."

This is an area which is currently                      experiencing dramatic developments. Pitts will focus his                        attention primarily on minimal surfaces in three dimensional                    manifolds rather than Euclidean space. The computational aspects                of this research provide a new direction for Pitts' research.                   This is an exciting development which is very much in line with                 contemporary work of other researchers.                                              The study of minimal surfaces in three dimensional manifolds               is an important aspect of Thurston's geometrization conjecture.                 Here the investigations will concern the possibility of                         constructing metrics which admit infinitely many minimal spheres                and tori. Another part of the project will be aimed at finding                  conditions on a noncompact hyperbolic manifold which guarantee                  that it supports a compact minimal surface. Pitts is also                       developing numerical methods for approximating minimal surfaces.                He will implement these algorithms in software and produce                      graphics of the stereographic images of the surfaces. The ability               to visualize these surfaces is rapidly becoming an essential                    ingredient of current research into these variational problems."

There are two                  directions the work takes.  First one can begin with a measure on               the real line or unit circle and consider the corresponding                     orthogonal polynomials and their recurrence relations.                          Conversely, one may begin with a class of polynomials arising                   from a recurrence relation and ask for information about measures               against which they become orthogonal.  In this latter context,                  the existence of measures yielding the recurrence coefficients                  has been known for some time.  Work to be done here is that of                  determining the measure from the coefficients in a                              computationally efficient way.                                                       Another line of investigation will pursue the asymptotic                   behavior of the Christoffel function associated with a measure.                 Christoffel functions are related to statistical prediction                     theory.  They minimize polynomial integrals associated with                     families of orthogonal polynomials.  In addition, work will be                  done analyzing eigenvalues of infinite tri-diagonal matrices                    used in the study of Schrodinger equations in central force                     fields.  Specific goals include improving an inequality for the                 limits of Christoffel functions on the unit circle associated                   with measures of the Szego class and narrowing the gap between                  the theory of orthogonal polynomials and signal processing.                     Results are expected to play an increasing role in the processing               and transmission of electronic signals."

Two broad types of                   iterative methods are proposed.  The first type consists of                     special quasi-Newton methods.  They are designed to take                        advantage of the special structure of the log-likelihood                        function.  The second type consists of modifications of the                     popular EM algorithm.  They are intended to exhibit accelerated                 convergence while preserving many of the advantages of the EM                   algorithm."

The purpose of this meeting is to bring together experts                 in the field of complex analysis to present and discuss ways in                 which computers are affecting research in this field.                                The conference will be international in scope combining both               theoreticians and computational experts.  The need for this                     gathering has arisen, as in many other areas of mathematics,                    because of the sharp impact computing has made on attitudes of                  researchers and their approaches to solving long-standing                       problems.  Examples of phenomena in complex analysis which could                not be analyzed by hand have been worked out.  New insights,                    conjectures and, eventually, new theorems have resulted.  In                    addition, computers have created a demand for new methods which                 would have been of no use in precomputer days.                                       Intense activity in numerous locations has led to research                 aimed at solving similar problems from different computational                  points of view.  This is particularly noticeable in the area of                 conformal mapping where improved techniques lead to immediate                   application in grid approximations to problems in partial                       differential equations.  It is vital that groups such as these be               brought together to compare their accomplishments and to                        introduce others to computation as a valuable tool which can make               important contributions to their fundamental research."

( The basic physical problem is               to determine macroscopic properties of large systems of particles               with known short range interactions. )  Some of the work involves               a novel use of the computer to assist in finding proofs of                      theorems that require intricate schemes for estimating                          quantities.

Two approaches to confidence intervals are                to treat the bias of the estimate as a random variable or to                    replace the bias by an upper bound.  The first method yields                    short intervals that are accurate only in an average sense while                the second method gives longer conservative intervals.

The                 methods, algorithms, and software to be developed for                           parallel/distributed processing will be important in a wide                     variety of theoretical and practical Bayesian problems.  Areas of               application will include hierarchical Bayesian modeling,                        sensitivity and robustness, sequential analysis  with                           application in sequential process control, Bayesian methods for                 image reconstruction, and Bayesian inference for neural networks."

It has been conjectured by W.                          Thurston that all 3-manifolds can be decomposed into                            components, each of which has one of eight geometries.  He                      has already proven this conjecture for large classes of 3-                      manifolds.  A complete classification of the 3-manifolds with                   seven of those geometries has already been completed.  The                      largest and richest case corresponds to those manifolds with                    the eighth geometry, namely hyperbolic geometry.                                     A hyperbolic 3-manifold has a well-defined volume, which                   is an invariant for the topology of the manifold.  The set of                   volumes of all finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds is a                        well-ordered subset of the reals.  Hence it is of interest to                   determine some of the hyperbolic manifolds of low volume, a                     problem suggested by Thurston.                                                       A noncompact hyperbolic 3-manifold has additional                          invariants called cusp volumes.  They offer a means of                          determining manifolds of low volume.  This idea has already                     been utilized by the investigator to determine the smallest                     hyperbolic manifolds of one or two cusps.                                            The project will continue investigations along these                       lines both by extending current computer programs in order to                   create more examples for study and also by utilizing the                        examples to point the way to proofs that certain manifolds                      are the smallest manifolds in their classes.  In particular,                    a goal of the project is to prove that the figure-eight knot                    complement and its sister manifold are the noncompact                           orientable hyperbolic 3-manifolds of minimal volume, also a                     conjecture of Thurston's."

Classical numerical methods                  for the solutions of differential equations are difficult to                    employ in this problem because of the character of the governing                equations and the nature of the singularities.  Reliable                        numerical methods for viscoelastic flow simulation will be                      developed.

When orthogonal polynomials are given as                        eigenfunctions of Jacobi matrices, the corresponding measure is                 the spectral measure of the matrix.  The logarithmic                            integrability of the absolutely continuous component of the                     measure (Szego's condition) is not controllable.  A major goal of               this project is to find necessary and sufficient conditions on                  the matrix so that the integrability condition will be satisfied.               Examples of compact perturbations of constant Jacobi matrices                   having purely singular spectral measures have been discovered.                  Work is progressing on the relevant inverse question: to find                   conditions on any spectral measure to see if it arises from a                   compact perturbation of a constant Jacobi matrix.  Efforts will                 also be made in extending the classical Szego theory to take in                 the case of measures supported on curves in the complex plane, to               study the behavior of orthogonal polynomials in classical                       Lebesgue spaces (rather than pointwise) and to continue research                on relating coefficients in three-term recursive definitions of                 polynomials with the corresponding spectral measures.                                Applications to least square prediction theory of discrete-                time theory stationary stochastic processes and signal processing               are planned."

There is a highly developed, essentially combinatorial, theory of conformal classes of punctured Riemann surfaces. Some recent work at once suggests new approaches to old problems in the Teichmuller theory and in the theory of the mapping class group. Furthermore, there is a great deal of interplay between these new results and several central problems in the string theory of high energy physics. This second interface should probably be regarded as one of co- development rather than one of application."

An immediate application of such a procedure involves the optimal positioning of sensors and actuators, particularly for structures with a large number of identical sensor/actuator mechanism, such as large space antennas. A related question is whether co-locating actuators and sensors always leads to the best system performance. Aspects of a method for determining optimal changes, in either the underlying system or the weighing matrices of the performance index, are discussed, as well as extensions to infinite dimensional distributed parameter systems."

Preliminary tests suggest that the proposed algorithm will produce accurate results in a much shorter time than the standard QR algorithm for a dense eigensystem. For the most condensed form of a tridiagonal matrix, a divide-and-conquer algorithm will be developed for use in parallel computers. For a specialized Hamilton eigenvalue problem which requires the solution of an algebraic Riccati equation, our algorithm will be based on symplectic similarity transformations which preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the matrix."
