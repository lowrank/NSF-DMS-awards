Fast, accurate and parallelizable algorithms for                     solving these equations in simple and complicated regions will be               developed. Basic computational modules based on the theory of                   these algorithms will developed and implemented on serial and                   parallel computers. Emphasis will be placed on the use of vector                computers such as CRAY-YMP as well as parallel machines such as                 SEQUENT and NCUBE. These algorithms will be used to solve                       compressible flow problems and to generate quasiconformal                       mappings.

Multivariate splines are piecewise polynomial functions with  certain smoothness.  The pieces need not fit together as  smoothly as if they all were part of the same polynomial.   Roughly speaking, the higher the degree of the piecewise  polynomial relative to its smoothness, the more roughly the  pieces can fit together.  Because polynomial functions are the  easiest functions to manipulate and because almost all problems  in the real world are multivariable or multiparametric in nature,  multivariate splines are a good tool to model the target  functions.  Although the theory of bivariate splines with large  degree versus smoothness is available, bivariate splines have too  large a degree to be used in practice efficiently.  That is, only  bivariate splines with small degree versus smoothness can achieve  the efficiency and the accuracy required by computer aided  geometric design, numerical image processing, and numerical  solution of partial differential equations.

In solving these problems  numerically, it is very convenient to use a uniform Cartesian  grid in spite of the fact that the interface may cut between grid  points.  The investigator and his colleagues develop finite  difference methods that aim to give highly accurate solutions at  all grid points while maintaining the efficiency and ease of  implementation of uniform grid methods.  Several specific  problems are studied in depth.  One goal is to develop improved  versions of Peskin's ""immersed boundary method"" for  incompressible fluid dynamics in regions with complicated moving  boundaries, such as blood flow in a beating heart.  Hyperbolic  wave equations with discontinuous coefficients arise in modeling  the structure of the earth in seismic oil exploration.  Other  applications include porous media equations arising in oil  reservoir simulation and groundwater transport, and multi-phase  solidification problems.  In modeling fluid motion near rigid  boundaries, an additional problem arises in solving an  ill-conditioned system of equations for the strength of  discontinuities at the boundary.  Iterative methods for solving  such problems are studied.       Simulating the behavior of complicated structures in the  real world typically involves solving large systems of equations  that cannot be solved exactly.  Instead the solution must  be approximated by numerical methods on high performance  computers. The investigators study problems in which there is a  boundary or interface that has a complicated shape and may be  moving in time. Examples include the surface of a body of water  or a bubble surrounded by fluid, the surface of a beating heart,  or the boundary between oil and some fluid that is injected into  the earth to force oil out of an oil field.  In these examples  the equations being solved model the flow o f some fluid.   Another problem is to study the motion of the boundary between  melting ice and the surrounding water, or between different  phases of a substance more generally.  In this case the equations  model the conduction of heat.  In oil exploration it is necessary  to model the motion of seismic waves in the earth and the manner  in which they reflect off interfaces between different kinds of  rock deep within the earth.  The goal of the project is to  develop relatively simple methods that can be used to solve a  wide variety of such problems with complicated boundaries or  interfaces.  ***"

Solutions of such problems typically evolve on multiple scales,                 and to be useful, numerical results need to be uniformly accurate               for the physically meaningful range of the parameters. He is                    attempting to overcome these difficulties by constructing a                     theory of adaptive error control based on a posteriori and a                    priori error analyses. A posteriori results measure the error in                terms of the regularity of the approximation and the stability of               the solution and provide a basis for adapting the discretization.               A priori results bound the error in terms of the regularity of                  the solution and the stability of the scheme and guarantee                      convergence. Estep is also examining the dynamical properties of                numerical schemes in the context of producing approximations with               the correct dynamical behavior. Finally, he is studying the                     implementation of adaptive error control in finite element codes                for parallel computers. The ultimate goal of this project is the                public release of a parallel code that can solve systems of                     reaction-diffusion equations in two and three dimensions with                   minimal user interface.                                                            Many models in applied science result in nonlinear                           reaction-diffusion differential equations that contain source                   terms balanced against terms that diffuse energy. This balance is               usually delicate and difficult to handle mathematically,                        consequently numerical approximation is an important tool. Yet,                 solutions of such problems typically evolve on several scales,                  i.e. some interesting behavior occurs in very localized regions                 in space-time while other behavior evolves over long times and                  over larger regions in space. The use of a uniform numerical                    discretization for a real application results in huge                           computations that tax even the largest computers. Estep's goal is               to produce numerical schemes that adapt themselves to the                       localized behavior of the target solution so as to make the                     computations both as accurate as desired and as efficient as                    possible. Mathematically, he is trying to understand how to use                 the information provided by an approximation to adapt the                       discretization, that is, make the computations self-governing. He               is also working on the implementation of this theory into a                     parallel code that solves very general problems with minimum user               input. Success of this project will lead to the public release of               the code, to the great benefit of the engineering and scientific                communities."

Both  models involve interactions between the blood's fluid dynamics  and the mechanics and chemistry of developing aggregates.  For  the microscopic-scale model, the project involves: 1) completing  the development of the numerical tools needed to extend  simulations to three dimensions; 2) exploring and implementing  strategies for performing computationally intensive  three-dimensional calculations on high-performance parallel  computers; 3) constructing a computational analogue of the  experimental flow chamber of his collaborator J. Hubbell  (Chemical Engineering, University of Texas) and comparing  simulations with it to Hubbell's data on the dynamics of  aggregate growth; 4) modifying aspects of the model that concern  a platelet's response to pro-aggregating agents and the  efficiency of platelet-platelet cohesion; and 5) exploring the  range of behavior of the model and its sensitivity to parameter  variations.  For the continuum model, the project requires: 1)  developing numerical methods to study forms of the model that  allow strain-dependent aggregate breakup; 2) developing  techniques for incorporating into this model platelet  interactions with the blood vessel's wall or the reactive surface  of a prosthetic cardiac valve; and 3) studying the behavior of  the model when aggregation is initiated by exogenous stimuli in  bulk flow, or by contact with a reactive wall of  a coronary-artery-sized vessel.  In the latter context, it is  of particular interest to study how the interaction between flow  and vessel geometry affects aggregate formation.       Platelet aggregates form on blood vessel walls in response  to vascular injury; they are also major constituents of  the life-threatening blood clots associated with vascular diseas e  and with the use of cardiovascular prostheses.  The modeling and  simulations carried out in this project complement  traditional laboratory experimentation.  They provide detailed  information, of a type that is generally not attainable in the  laboratory, about the dynamic interactions among the components  of the aggregation response.  This additional information will  increase our insight into the physical and chemical controls on  the aggregation process.  These studies also lay the foundations  for further development of aggregation models and for their  application to clinically interesting questions, including how  flow and vessel geometry interact to influence aggregation within  natural vessels, such as the coronary arteries, or prosthetic  devices, such as vascular grafts or artificial hearts.  The  numerical tools developed in this project should also be valuable  in solving a broad range of biofluid dynamics and engineering  problems.  ***"

For the biological experiments an organism is  used that is easy to culture, has a short generation time (i.e.  yields long time series data) and allows an accurate census of  animal numbers: flour beetles of the genus Tribolium.  In the first  part of the study the objectives are model identification and  parameter estimation.  In the second part, the concern is to  document transitions in the qualitative behavior of the  demographic dynamics.  Rates of reproduction and adult mortality  are manipulated in order to cross boundaries in parameter space  from stable equilibria, to periodic cycles, to chaos.  In phase  three the objectives are to test hypotheses concerning the  existence of these unusual demographic dynamics and develop  methods for identifying these phenomena in experimental data.  A  major contribution of this project is an unequivocal example of  experimentally manipulated transitions between qualitatively  different dynamical behaviors of a biological population as  predicted by a mathematical model.       In the last ten years or so, the recognition that simple  equations can generate complex dynamics has led to an outpouring  of fascinating theoretical possibilities for the explanation of  population time series data.  Understanding the observed  fluctuations in animal population numbers is a central question in  population biology; it has far-reaching applications in areas  ranging from food production and pest control, to the management  of renewable resources, to the conservation of species diversity.  The hypothesis that fluctuations are the result of nonlinear  dynamic forces has proved to be elusive to test due to the  difficulties of gathering adequate ecological data, of  experimentall y manipulating ecological systems, and of evaluating  complex mathematical models with ecological data.  In this research  project the investigators' approach to testing nonlinear  population theory is to connect mathematical models rigorously  with experimental biological data by means of newly developed  statistical methods for nonlinear time series.  The project is  unique in its interdisciplinary approach because it involves both  theory and experimentation and utilizes the talents of the  biologist, statistician, and mathematician.  It is unusual in the  field of population biology to have an interdisciplinary effort in  which investigators from all of these disciplines are involved in  all aspects of the project, from experimental design and  implementation, through theoretical modeling and analysis, to  statistical testing and verification.  The ultimate goal is to  demonstrate the usefulness and importance of nonlinear mathematics  in gaining a rigorous understanding of the dynamics of animal  populations and in particular of fluctuations in population  numbers, be these fluctations regular or ""chaotic."""

When analyzing data, it is important  to combine all sources of information effectively.  Bayesian  statistical methods are tailored to this purpose.

This proposal deals with computational methods for parameter  estimation in distributed parameter systems.  Parameter  estimation is the process of determining coefficient functions,  typically for partial differential equations, from observations  of solutions.  The work of this project was made possible by  recent advances in scientific computing and image processing.  In  the field of image processing, the development of so-called  ``Total Variation'' based techniques enables the reconstruction  of much sharper images than was previously possible.  The  development of parallel computers allows the solution of complex  2- and 3-dimensional problems, which were previously intractable.   Direct applications of research in parameter estimation include  the improved reconstruction of images from electromagnetic,  thermal, and acoustic data.  Radar and sonar are perhaps the most  well-known examples.  Others include noninvasive medical imaging  techniques such as CAT scans, sonograms, and Magnetic Resonance  Imaging (MRI).  Seismic data processing, where recordings of  disturbances which have passed through the earth are used to  infer the internal structure of the earth, is yet another  important example.  Parameter estimation also plays a key role in  the development of mathematical models, i.e., mathematical  descriptions of physical phenomena.

The principal investigator  will develop techniques based on representations of the scaling  function in terms of an infinite matrix product expansion, which  can be used to establish an algorithm for constructing scaling  functions, and to analyze their regularity, integrability, and  dimensionality.  Thus far, in order to ensure convergence of the  infinite matrix product,a Contractivity Assumption has been  imposed.

This also leads to questions regarding  the structure of bounded semi-groups of matrices.  The PI has  also developed techniques to study self-similar lattice tilings,  which arises from multi-dimensional orthonormal wavelets.

Numerical  Approximation of Invariant Tori.

Luca Dieci intends also to continue studying numerical questions  connected to the integration of matrix equations whose solution  is a unitary matrix.  He plans to devote time and resources to  the approximation of Lyapunov exponents, an issue which provided  the motivation for studying matrix equations with a unitary  solution.

Such non-Newtonian materials can be modeled                          mathematically as viscoelastic fluids with fading memory, which                 exhibit behavior intermediate between the nonlinear hyperbolic                  response of purely elastic materials and the strongly diffusive,                parabolic response of viscous Newtonian fluids. In certain flow                 regimes, these fluids exhibit instabilities that severely disrupt               polymer processing. Laboratory observations have found ""spurt ""                 instabilities in pressure-gradient driven flows (Vinogradov et                  al., 1972), persistent oscillations in flow at fixed volumetric                 flow rate (Lim & Schowalter, 1989), and anomalies in step shear                 strain experiments (Morrison & Larson, 1991). Many researchers                  attribute the observations to ""slip"" or ""apparent slip, "" i.e.,                 loss of adhesion of the fluid to the wall. This project involves                the investigation of an alternative explanation for these                       phenomena. The hypothesis is that all three have a common origin                in bulk material properties, rather than adhesive properties.                        To test this hypothesis, the corresponding one-dimensional                 shear flows pressure-driven and piston-driven flow in a slit die,               and Couette flow are modeled. The characteristic feature of the                 fluid models employed is a non-monotone relation between steady                 shear stress and strain rate. Analysis and numerical simulations                show that the polymer system changes state in a thin layer near                 the wall, giving the appearance of a slip layer. The structure of               solutions of initial/boundary-value problems for non-monotone                   models is remarkably rich, and the development of numerical                     methods capable of simulating these flow problems has interest in               its own right. The same basic system of time-dependent,                         quasilinear partial differential equations is used to model all                 three experiments; different forcing terms, as well as boundary                 and initial conditions, are used in the three cases. The                        governing system is globally well-posed in time, in two senses:                 with respect to classical solutions arising from smooth initial                 data, and with respect to ""almost classical"" solutions,                         containing discontinuities in the stress and strain rate.                       Calculated solutions are in good qualitative agreement with the                 experiments, showing spurt in pressure-driven flow, persistent                  oscillations in piston-driven flow, and the development of                      anomalies in the relaxation modulus after a step strain. In terms               of a reduced approximating system, spurt and its related                        phenomena in pressure-driven flow can be analyzed by using                      phase-plane techniques. The analysis for piston-driven and step                 strain experiments is more difficult because the system is                      infinite-dimensional. For example, numerical simulations strongly               suggest that there is a Hopf bifurcation in piston-driven flow,                 leading to the observed persistent oscillations. In order to                    compare predictions to experiment, it is crucial to determine how               the amplitude and frequency of the limit cycle depends on                       physical parameters. This requires detailed analysis of the                     governing equations. This is required in each of the experiments,               and that is the central focus of this research. The theme of this               project has been and will continue to be the use of numerical                   simulation to guide analysis of the governing equations and                     approximations to them, in order to identify the time-scales,                   amplitudes, and other characteristic features of the predictions                of the model."

There are two classes of problems. The first               is the recognition of rigid objects positioned in a scene at                    arbitrary rotations, locations, and scales.  A large repertoire                 of shapes is assumed known in advance, and the problem is to then               devise computationally efficient algorithms for recognizing                     which, if any, of these objects are present in a given scene.

There are close connections to coding theory,                    sequential design of experiments, multi-armed bandit problems,                  the game of ""twenty questions,"" and, of course, previous work in                machine vision.                                                                      The second class of problems is the recognition of nonrigid,               or deformable, objects.  Examples include handwritten numerals                  and various biological shapes, such as leaves, hands, organelles,               etc. Here the issue of shape modeling appears to be central.  An                approach through  deformable templates is proposed.  Templates                  are prototypes which capture global characteristics, whereas                    deformations are random transformations, satisfying certain                     regularity constraints, that act upon templates to produce the                  possible presentations of an object.  The proposed shape models                 suggest certain recognition algorithms, and these will be                       explored in a variety of application areas."

In                         particular, they focus on the role of biased random motions in                  creating order at two levels of organization.  At the cell/tissue               level they investigate how apparently random cell motions can                   self organize into tissue geometries via boundary inhibitions and               intercellular communication.  At the molecular/cell level they                  examine several intracellular motility phenomena that appear to                 extract work from random thermal motions by employing chemical                  bond energy to ratchet molecular assembly and disassembly.                           This study aims at basic questions about how cells move                    and change shape during morphogenesis, and how macromolecules                   are transported across cell membranes.  The issues are important                for fundamental understanding, and also have implications for                   such problems as wound healing and the development of tissues.                  During and after protein synthesis on ribosomes the nascent                     polypeptide chains must be transported across internal membranes                into intracellular compartments such as endoplasmic reticula and                mitochondria.  How this is accomplished is a mystery, for                       it appears to proceed in the absence of a metabolic energy                      source such as nucleotide hydrolysis.  The investigators propose                a mechanism to explain this process based on the idea that                      the thermal motions of the amino acid chain can be biased by                    any process that makes it difficult for the chain to go                         backwards.  Examples of such processes are binding of                           chaperonins, glycosylation, and/or chain folding.  The propulsion               mechanism of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is               another example of a process that works, they believe, by                       ratcheted Brownian motion.  This bacterium drives itself by                     building a tail of cross-linked actin filaments.  They propose to               model this process by simulating the coupled dynamics of tail                   assembly and the Brownian motion of the bacterium."

Furthermore, since these  problems are extremely challenging ones to try to solve with  numerical methods, it is natural to first consider related   simpler model problems.  Recent research shows that the solutions  of the two-component Vlasov Poisson equations (2CVPE) for a  collisionless plasma of electrons and positively charged ions,  with the initial condition being an appropriate measure, have  many properties that are direct analogues of solutions of the 2-D  vorticity equation for an incompressible fluid with vortex sheet  initial data.  The 2CVPE is simpler to treat analytically and  easier to solve numerically.  It should be an extremely useful  and an important model problem for suggesting answers to the open  problems about vortex sheets.  The investigator conducts a  numerical investigation of the 2CVPE and its ""viscous""  regularization, the two-component Fokker-Planc equation.  The  goal is to determine properties of solutions to these systems of  equations when the initial data is a measure.  Recently  discovered exact solutions of the 2CVPE will focus this work.   The investigator also conducts a numerical investigation of the  2-D incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations with  appropriate vortex sheet initial data.  He uses the insight  gained from the study of related model problems from plasma  physics to motivate and guide this work.  This work is designed  to provide answers to many of the open problems about properties  of solutions of the Euler equations with vortex sheet initial  data.       Fluid dynamics is the study of continuous media like air and  water.  Scientists formulate problems in this field by applying   the fundamental laws of physics such as the conservation of mass,  momentum and energy.  For most probl ems this procedure leads to  sets of mathematical equations that are too complicated to solve.  Based on physical or mathematical intuition, the scientist then  tries to find a simplified formulation of the original problem  that is simple enough to solve, but sufficiently complicated to  describe the essential features of the original problem.  The  mixing process between layers of fluid that have different  densities, like air and water, or layers of fluid moving at  different velocities, is very complicated and occurs in a wide  variety of important applications.  The flow of air over an  airplane is also very complicated.  In order to predict the  trailing wake behind an airplane, or the mixing process in a  fluid, scientists often use a simplified model of the fluid  called a vortex sheet.  This is the simplest realistic  description of not only these problems, but many other large  Reynold's number flows.  Unfortunately, despite the wide-spread  use of vortex sheet models in many problems in fluid dynamics,  many mathematical properties of vortex sheets remain poorly  understood.  The goal of this proposal is to provide answers to  many of the fundamental questions about the mathematical  properties of vortex sheets.  Successful completion of the  proposed work will lead to an increased understanding of the  strengths and limitations when using vortex sheets to model  complicated fluid flows."
