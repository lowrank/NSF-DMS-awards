The first area concerns<br/> the additive multigrid convergence theory, which is effective in analyzing <br/> the asymptotic behavior of the contraction numbers of multigrid algorithms<br/> with respect to the number of smoothing steps for boundary value problems <br/> with less than full elliptic  regularity.  The seminal result obtained by <br/> the PI for V-cycle algorithm with Richardson relaxation as the smoother will <br/> be extended to general smoothers, nonconforming finite elements,  the mixed <br/> formulation and the F-cycle algorithm.  The second area involves multigrid <br/> methods for stress intensity factors and singular solutions.  These are <br/> methods that can take advantage of the form of the solution of the boundary <br/> value problem in the regions where it does not have full elliptic regularity. <br/> Using this approach, usual quasi-optimal convergence rates have been obtained <br/> for simple finite elements on simple grids for boundary value problems on <br/> two-dimensional domains with reentrant corners or cracks.  The technically <br/> more challenging interface problems and three dimensional problems will be <br/> investigated in this project.  The third area is the analysis of the Finite <br/> Element Tearing and Interconnecting (FETI) method, a nonoverlapping domain <br/> decomposition method in which the (pseudo) inverse of the Schur complement <br/> matrix has to be preconditioned.  The goal of this part of the project is to   <br/> carry out an  analysis of the FETI method and some of its variants within the<br/> framework of additive Schwarz preconditioners, and to investigate<br/> new mechanisms for the global communication among the subdomains. <br/><br/> The methods analyzed in this project are efficient algorithms for the <br/> numerical solution of partial differential equations.  Such equations<br/> are extremely important in science and engineering since they are the<br/> governing equations for most physical phenomena. Part of the research <br/> involves the fast computation of stress intensity factors, which are <br/> essential indicators in fracture mechanics.  The FETI method to be<br/> studied in this project has already been implemented for large scale <br/> engineering problems using parallel supercomputers with up to a thousand <br/> processors.  The advances resulting from this project will therefore <br/> have an impact on many areas of science and technology, such as aerospace  <br/> engineering, fracture prediction and fluid flow problems.<br/><br/>"

Vugular heterogeneities raise both practical and theoretical problems for understanding fluid flow through such rocks at the field scale.  For example, standard sampling methods are at a scale too small to resolve these heterogeneities.  Moreover it is nontrivial to identify the correct physical formalism for modeling flow or interpreting flow measurements, and it is not clear that traditional homogenization approaches are applicable.  In this project, the investigators tie microscopic (CT scan) and macroscopic measurements of a large sample (about 17,000 cubic cm) of Cretaceous carbonate rock containing centimeter-scale vugs directly to high-resolution computation of flow fields.  This framework allows the testing of different physical models for flow in the geometry of the sample.  The specific objectives are to: (1) Map CT scan pixels of the sample to permeability and porosity; (2) Simulate flow in the micro-scale system; (3) Determine the macro-scale governing relations for single phase flow; and (4) Determine the macroscopic model parameters in terms of the microscale characterization.  Research in algorithms and upscaling procedures is conducted to achieve the second and third objectives.  Subsequent numerical experiments determine the influence of alternative depositional environments and diagenetic histories by changing the connectivity of the vugs and the permeability distribution of the matrix material.  This results finally in the ability to more confidently predict flow in vugular media in full-field simulations.<br/><br/>     The flow of fluids through porous rock is of economic and environmental interest.  Examples include oil and gas production, obtaining adequate water supplies (groundwater accounts for about one third of the water used in the US, with many cities depending exclusively on wells), and remediating subsurface contamination at Superfund sites and many Department of Energy facilities.  The sedimentary rocks through which these flows occur sometimes contain relatively large holes or void regions called vugs.  The dissolution of fossil fragments is a common mechanism for creating vugs in carbonate rocks, which contain more than half the world's oil reserves and comprise many of the biggest aquifers in the US.  Vugs are more conducive to fluid flow than the much smaller pore space between the rock grains, and this raises both both practical and theoretical problems for understanding large-scale flows.  This project aims to construct models for this type of rock that predict the effective flow properties over hundreds of yards to several miles.  Because direct experimentation over these distances is not feasible, an essential component of the research is the integration of intermediate-scale physical and large-scale computational experiments.  This effort also relies on basic research in numerical algorithms and modeling techniques.  Establishing the correct relations governing the flow of fluids in such rocks enables more confident predictions from full-field simulations.<br/>"

The theme of research is on the development, application and analysis of multigrid methods.  The multigrid method is among the most powerful techniques for solving large scale linear and nonlinear systems arising from the discretization of partial differential equations.  But the method has not been used in practice as often as they should be (because it is often not easy to code and to use), nor as efficiently as they could be (because it is often not easy to get the method work correctly).  Our research is, on one hand, to develop special type of multigrid methods that are relatively easier to use for general users for some standard applications and is, on the other hand, to develop multigrid methods that are carefully tailored for some special class of practically interesting problems.  One major component of the proposed research is a systematical investigation on various fundamental theoretical issues related to multigrid methods in general and also theoretical questions related to the algorithms to be developed for several specific problems of practical interests.<br/><br/>The multigrid methods we propose to develop and study are expected to be applicable to a large class of practical problems including numerical simulations for electrochemical power devices (batteries) and advanced materials such as lattice block materials and liquid crystalline materials.  These multigrid methods are expected to make a major impact in these and related applications and in particular to make it possible to simulate these problems in three dimensions in such a way that other traditional approaches may not be feasible.  For example, the proposed study of advanced numerical methods for simulating electrochemical batteries has been and will be making a significant contribution to advanced battery technologies and manufactures that are vitally important in our everyday life, from the watch and the camera flash to electromobilies, modern space vehicles and wireless communications in information technology.  Because of the practical backgrounds of these problems, the proposers and their research associates and graduate students are expected to actively interact and collaborate with physicists, engineers, computational scientists and practitioners from industries.<br/>"

They are particularly effective for solving convection-dominated<br/>equations over long times and in relatively simple geometries. Both the<br/>algorithms themselves and the analysis of them have traditionally been<br/>closely tied to expansions in different classes of orthogonal functions.<br/>The recent book ""A Practical Guide to Pseudospectral Methods"" (by the<br/>present investigator) notes that a large body of generalizations,<br/>enhancements and insights can be gained by viewing PS methods instead as<br/>special cases of FD methods. Several such opportunities were explored under<br/>the grant DMS-9706916. Building on these experiences, we will now introduce<br/>radial basis functions (RBFs) as an additional component to be integrated<br/>with PS schemes. Although computationally quite costly, the spectral<br/>accuracy of RBFs, combined with their extreme geometric flexibility, would<br/>seem to make them ideally suited to complement PS methods in the vicinity<br/>of irregular boundaries. To realize this requires much research regarding<br/>the basic features of RBF approximations, as well as research on issues<br/>related to interfacing them with PS and FD methods. <br/><br/>Pseudospectral (PS) methods were first proposed in the early 1970's (in<br/>connection with meteorology and turbulence modeling). They have since been<br/>shown to be extraordinary effective for high-accuracy calculations in<br/>numerous other fields, such as computational electromagnetics and nonlinear<br/>waves. Strategically important application areas include simulating the<br/>radar scattering from airplanes, the electrical interference between<br/>components on computer chips, and the transmissions of signals in optical<br/>fibres. The main weakness with PS methods has been the difficulty to apply<br/>them in complex geometries. Some of this has been overcome in recent years<br/>(usually by splitting a complicated domain in simpler parts, and then<br/>applying some suitable computational means for coupling of the subdomains).<br/>A quite different and highly promising approach will be introduced and then<br/>explored under this grant. This involves combining 'classical' PS methods<br/>with the geometrically extremely flexible approach known as radial basis<br/>functions (RBFs). This has never been attempted, and the research falls in<br/>the 'high risk, high gain' category. Success is by no means certain, but if<br/>it happens, it could have a major impact, particularly on computational<br/>electromagnetics in applications such as simulation of radar scattering /<br/>stealth properties of objects. <br/>"

The standard approach, generating multiscale discretizations in parameter spaces and lifting them on the surface, is not efficient when a large number of parameter patches is required.  This project is concerned with an alternative approach to multiscale discretizations.  The basis is generated in a hierarchical decomposition of the three-space and subsequently restricted on the boundary surface.  This construction leads to a sparse representation of the integral operator even for complicated geometries.  It is planned to apply this approach to boundary integral formulations of general elliptic as well as time dependent parabolic problems.<br/><br/>The range of important engineering applications which the proposed research could impact is quite diverse.  Examples include the analysis of integrated circuit interconnect and micromechanical systems.  In these areas finding computationally efficient numerical methods for complex three dimensional structures is important in order to generate prototypes interactively on a computer.  In the past the major computational tool has been the Fast Multipole Method (FMM), because of its relative simplicity and its flexibility to geometry and integral operator.  We construct a multiscale basis by using a hierarchical decomposition of the three-space.  The same hierarchy of cubes is also used by the FMM, and therefore the proposed approach is able to combine the flexibility of the FMM with the strengths of multiscale methods.  Thus the planned research can lead to faster and more robust algorithms as well as to a better understanding of theoretical and practical issues of both approaches.<br/>"

Hou<br/><br/>Abstract:<br/><br/>We propose to develop an innovative numerical coarse grid model for two-phase flows in strongly heterogeneous media.  The development of this coarse grid model consists of two steps.  The first one is to develop a PDE-based adaptive mesh strategy to capture the dominating flow features using an adaptive coarse grid mesh. Using the adaptive mesh, the dominating flow features such as high velocity flow and strong shear flow can be accurately captured.  The second step is to use the multiscale finite element method to model the effect of small scale components.  The main idea of our multiple scale finite element method consists of the construction of finite element base functions which contain the small scale information within each element.  In fact, we construct the base functions from the leading order differential operator of the governing equation.  An important feature of the multiscale finite element method is that they can be used to reconstruct locally the small scale velocity within each coarse grid block.  Since the dominating flow structures are already well captured by the adaptive coarse grid solution, the remaining small scale components are relatively small in amplitude. And we can effectively model the effect of these small scales by incorporating averages of high order moments.  This gives rise to a robust coarse grid model for two-phase flows in strongly heterogeneous media.  Generalization of this idea to the Navier-Stokes equations will also be considered.<br/><br/>Many problems of fundamental and practical importance contain multiple scale solutions.  The direct numerical solution of the above multiple scale problems is difficult even with the advent of modern super computers.  The major difficulty of direct solutions is due to the scale of computation.  To get an accurate solution, all scales contained in the problem need to be resolved.  Therefore, tremendous amount of computer memory and CPU time are required.  The requirement can easily exceed the limit of today's computing resources.  On the other hand, from an engineering perspective, it is often sufficient to predict the macroscopic properties of the physical systems and to capture the averaged effect of small (and random) scales on the large ones.  Therefore, it is desirable to develop a method that can capture the small scale effect on the large scales using a relatively coarse grid.  If this can be done, this can lead to enormous economy saving. The factor of saving could be as high as ten thousands.  This would enable us to perform many simulations very efficiently.  The proposed research is to develop such a coarse grid model by incorporating the small scale features in the underlying physical problem to construct multiscale building blocks (bases).  These multiscale building blocks (bases) capture the effect of small scales on the large scales locally.  In order to increase the robustness of the multiscale modeling, we propose to introduce an automatic (PDE-based) adaptive mesh generator to generate the underlying coarse grid. The adaptivity is controlled by the local flow rate, using a finer mesh in high flow region.  The idea of combining adaptivity with multiscale modeling may have a significant impact on a number of applications which go beyond the scope of this proposed study.<br/> <br/>"

Recent research in the<br/>area known as ecological stoichiometry has highlighted the<br/>ecological importance of the relative abundance of chemical<br/>constituents, known to vary considerably among species and across<br/>trophic levels.  However, most theoeretical studies in ecology<br/>have until very recently ignored the sources and consequences of<br/>this chemical heterogeneity.  The investigator and his colleagues<br/>undertake theoretical investigations of ecological stoichiometry.<br/>They develop a relatively new theoretical framework for<br/>ecological dynamics that explicitly incorporates stoichiometric<br/>constraints.  This base model involves a stoichiometric<br/>counterpart of the familiar Rosenzweig-MacArthur equations in<br/>which the effective carrying capacity of the resource species and<br/>the transfer efficiency of the consumer species are constrained<br/>by stoichiometric principles.  Introduction of stoichiometric<br/>considerations in these equations (here, akin to ""food quality"")<br/>allows for a rich array of ecologically realistic dynamics,<br/>including deterministic extinction of the consumer species when<br/>resources are abundant but of poor quality.  They expand this<br/>model in five different directions, to explore ecological<br/>realities (i.e., complications) whose consideration has proved<br/>illuminating in other, non-stoichiometric settings.  Specifically,<br/>they analyze the dynamics of 1) a multi-nutrient model; 2)<br/>trophically complex models in which multiple consumer species<br/>share a resource; 3) time delays in nutrient recycling that are a<br/>realistic component of terrestrial ecosystems; 4) two patch<br/>models featuring habitat heterogeneity and dispersal of the<br/>consumer; and 5) age structured models in which juvenile and<br/>adult consumers differ in their nutrient requirements.  The<br/>project aims to provide an analytically rigorous foundation for<br/>burgeoning empirical research into ecological stoichiometry.<br/>     All living things, including humans, are constructed of<br/>approximately the same set of basic building blocks, chemical<br/>elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and<br/>several dozen more in smaller amounts.  However, different<br/>organisms contain different proportions of these key elements in<br/>their biomass and thus must extract these elements from their<br/>environment to differing degrees.  In many situations, the<br/>environment does not provide these key nutrient elements in the<br/>abundance and proportions that are optimal for organism growth<br/>and reproduction.  Thus, the chemical environment of life may set<br/>limits on the success of organisms in various situations.  In this<br/>project the investigators use mathematical models to simulate the<br/>flow of multiple chemical elements in natural food webs to better<br/>understand how the requirements of living things for multiple<br/>chemical elements establish key feedbacks between the living and<br/>non-living world.

Hence, these representations critically depend upon intersection algorithms.  To minimize data volume and improve algorithmic performance, the intersection sets are only approximated.  The consequences of these approximation errors may be far from trivial and can lead to `gaps' or `cracks' between surfaces that are understood to be adjoining.  Unfortunately, the prevalent practice is that intersection algorithms do not give any error bounds on these approximations.  This research focuses upon the central issue of the interdependencies between topology of a model and the approximations within numerical algorithms.  Any formal notion of topology for computational representations of geometric sets must specifically acknowledge the role of approximation and finite arithmetic.  This project will develop formal definitions and computational representations for needed approximation bounds.  Computational experiments will be performed to test the communication of the critical approximation information across programmatic interfaces.  The expected result is a formal framework for reasoning about the propagation of topological tolerances within large software systems.<br/><br/>Three recent workshops (OPAAL '97 in New Orleans, CAD/CFD '99 at Davis, and MSRI '99 at Berkeley) have directed attention to the need for rigorous mathematical foundations for computer-aided design.  Particularly troublesome are regions where surfaces should meet, as computational models are limited to only approximating such surface joinings.  A computational model of a coffee cup will necessarily have small cracks along its base and near its handle.  If fluid were to be placed in this cup in a computer simulation, the fluid would leak out of the cup.  Of course, similar cracks will exist in a computational model of an airplane; for example, where the wing joins the fuselage.  The performance characteristics of this joint during flight are crucial to aircraft safety.  Fluid dynamic simulations are performed on airplane models to verify critical engineering performance characteristics.  Even small errors in the geometric model can cause large errors in these engineering simulations.  These simulations hold the promise of significant cost savings by permitting creation of a reliable airplane directly from the electronic model.  However, to attain that goal, the interface between modeling and simulation must accept the inevitability of modeling `cracks' and still produce valid engineering analyses.  This project will create new mathematical formulations and computational representations as a necessary step for reliable engineering simulations.  Recent economic studies done for NIST indicate that these engineering problems cost about 1 billion dollars annually, for the automotive industry alone.  Hence, there is opportunity for significant practical economic impact from this new theory, as it will improve results from complex engineering simulations which must be executed within high-performance computing environments.  Utilization of these high performance computing resources will be improved and the more reliable engineering estimates will also lead to direct savings in material and manufacturing costs for major industries.<br/><br/>"

My approach is to actively force deflations, rather than passively waiting for them to occur.  This idea, called aggressive deflation, was developed by Braman, Byers and Mathias.  A very simple untuned implementation of the idea resulted in computational savings of up to a factor of 3. My project consists of two parts.  The first part is to perfect the details of the implementation of aggressive deflation, to extend it to other eigenvalue problems, and to write software implementing these ideas, so that others can use them easily -- like a black box.  This will provide a simple way to greatly increase the speed of eigenvalue computations.  In light of the results mentioned above I have little doubt about the utility and success of this first part of the project.  The second part is much more ambitious and more speculative. It is to repeatedly use the aggressive deflation idea, with carefully chosen parameters, so that one is able to force so many deflations that, in the case of the Hessenberg eigenvalue problem, the complexity is less than the now standard n-cubed, and is perhaps as low as  n-squared-log(n) for many families of problems.  I hope to make similar improvements in algorithms for other eigenvalue problems.<br/><br/>Many physical systems are modeled using matrices.  The eigenvalues of these matrices provide insight on how these systems behave.  Here are two well known examples of the utility of eigenvalues.  Firstly, the collapse of the Tacoma narrows bridge  could have been predicted by analyzing the eigenvalues of the associated matrix.  Secondly, each chemical element emits light of characteristic frequencies, which are the eigenvalues of an associated matrix.  One can deduce the make up of stars just by observing the frequencies of light they emit.  The larger the matrix used to model the system the more accurate the model.

Binary trees appear as parameters in: (1) Hierarchical clustering problems, for instance for micro-array data from contemporary genetics; (2) Methods that use decision trees such as the Classification and Regression trees (CART); (3) Estimation of phylogenetic trees built from DNA data for the taxonomy of species, but also for building `gene trees'.  The embedding of tree estimation in a statistical framework allows one to see trees as a special type of parameter to be estimated.  However the estimation procedures have been developed without the ability to construct confidence regions for these paramters or ways of comparing various estimators of these parameters.  Currently biologists validate the tree estimated by perturbing the data through a simple bootstrap of the DNA sequences and then summarizing the collection of trees obtained by associating p-values to the branches of a consensus tree.  This reduces the problem to a collection of binomial simulations, losing much of the multivariate information of which groups appear simultaneously.  This new constructive geometrical approach uses the tools available from topology and algebraic combinatorics.  Collaboration with a combinatorialist, Louis Billera, and a topologist, Karen Vogtmann, on a more mathematical understanding of tree space allows a more natural definition of distances between points in the `tree polytope'.  This topological study of tree space is crucial in the definition of a notion of neighborhood that then allows a definition of continuity of the estimation function.  The space of trees is a space with negative curvature.  It is also possible to define geodesics on this space and convex hulls.  The notion of confidence region can be defined, and it is possible to combine trees from built from different datasets or to combine trees obtained from different genes or even compare trees with other data (biogeographic, for instance).<br/><br/>Understanding the geometry of ""tree space"" helps understand how to combine and compare trees.  Whether they are hierarchical clustering trees built for micro-array DNA data or family trees built from DNA sequences, binary tree data are abundant in today's genome era.  The current proposal aims to consider trees as a whole, instead of breaking them down into just sibling relationships as is done currently.  This problem uses recent results from topology and the geometry of spaces with negative curvature, like the surface of a hyperboloid.  In these spaces notions of average and distance have to be redefined, the hardest being ways of representing what is not naturally representable in our usual euclidean space.

The project will pursue research  in this direction, <br/>examining the complexity of Knot Recognition,  Knot Genus, Homology Genus<br/>and related topological problems. The project also includes plans to <br/>investigate the generalized theory of normal surfaces. Normal surfaces<br/>are particularly  simple surfaces relative to a fixed triangulation of<br/>a 3-manifold. They are the analogs of minimal surfaces in the PL Category. <br/>The collection of such surfaces is discrete and well suited <br/>to computation, leading to applications in classification, complexity, <br/>enumeration and algorithmic recognition. Index-one, or almost normal <br/>surfaces, were applied with spectacular success in recent work <br/>on manifold recognition. A third focus of the project <br/>concerns multi-region isoperimetric problems, which ask what <br/>are the shortest boundaries enclosing multiple regions of a <br/>given size. The goal is to give a mathematical proof that <br/>the configurations assumed by soap bubbles are optimal. <br/>Questions such as finding the shortest curve enclosing three given areas <br/>in the plane remain open. Also missing is an understanding of general <br/>properties of stable soap-bubble-like configurations, such <br/>as whether the minimizing configurations always have connected <br/>regions.  Finally, the project examines questions of curve <br/>and surface evolution, using ideas based on normal surfaces. <br/>Such evolution methods have the potential <br/>for practical applications in many areas, similar to the many <br/>applications of mean curvature evolution. <br/><br/>"

One motivation for our research is the practical <br/>relevance of these problems.  For instance, solution of the eddy current <br/>equations arises in such varied areas as development of toroidal field <br/>magnets for fusion power, modeling of plasma physics phenomena, and design <br/>of tape heads, while transonic and high Re flows are relevant to design of <br/>aircraft and modeling of dispersion of pollutants.  At the same time <br/>numerical solution of these problems in realistic three-dimensional <br/>settings continues to be an outstanding and challenging computational<br/>task.

Algorithms for the<br/>solution of parabolic equations often involve marching in time, starting<br/>from an initial condition. In optimization, however, the values of the<br/>solution of the parabolic equation at later times feed into the<br/>optimization at early times. This coupling in time makes the practical<br/>solution of these very large-scale optimization problems challenging.<br/>To cope with storage and computer time demands required by an exact<br/>optimization of parabolic systems, so-called suboptimal control techniques, <br/>such as reduced bases techniques and instantaneous control have recently <br/>been proposed.

The resulting methods are applied to specific optimal <br/>control problems in or related to fluid mechanics.  <br/><br/>   Optimal control attempts to determine system parameters or inputs <br/>to increase the performance of the system. For example, micro electromechanical<br/>systems may be used to alter the flow characteristics on an aircraft wing <br/>to reduce drag, or heaters may be adjusted to achieve a desired temperature<br/>profile in a furnace while minimizing energy consumption. Many systems<br/>can be modeled by mathematical equations. In this case mathematical <br/>techniques can be used, at least in principle, to determine the optimal<br/>system inputs. For systems that can be adequately modeled by moderately<br/>complex mathematical equations this is done routinely and successfully.<br/>Detailed mathematical descriptions of other systems, including flow <br/>over an aircraft wing or the temperature distribution in a furnace, however,<br/>are so complex that present mathematical techniques for the determination<br/>of optimal control strategies require such large computer resources that<br/>render them impractical.

Moreover, domes often have a relatively low aspect ratio<br/>and evolve slowly.  These observations can be used as ingredients<br/>in building simple mathematical models of expanding and cooling<br/>fluid domes; this proposal surrounds the development of such<br/>models.  In particular, lava is considered as a solidifying,<br/>non-Newtonian fluid with strongly temperature-dependent material<br/>qualities and an intrinsic yield stress.  The wide array of<br/>physical ingredients to the problem make the mathematical<br/>modelling especially challenging.  The project exploits the simple<br/>geometry, slow evolution and low aspect ratio of the dome to<br/>asymptotically reduce the governing equations to a simpler form.<br/>The reduction furnishes ""shallow-lava equations,"" in much the<br/>same way that the ""shallow-ice equations"" are derived and<br/>extensively used to model ice sheets and glaciers.  Differences<br/>arise because of the viscoplastic nature of silicic lava, and<br/>because solidification creates a solid crust overlying the dome<br/>that can contribute significantly to the balance of forces,<br/>especially at the disk's edge.  The mathematical approach are<br/>complemented with an experimental one in which laboratory fluids<br/>are used as analogue models of the lava.  Both approaches are used<br/>to explore the structure and evolution of the dome, partly with<br/>the aim of learning more about how lava behaves as a fluid.  For<br/>example, some domes lose axisymmetry in what might be an<br/>intrinsic morphological instability; this pattern formation<br/>process is explored in that light.<br/>     Lava domes occur in many geological settings both on Earth<br/>and on many other planets and moons of the solar system.  These<br/>structures form when crystal-rich silicic magma is pushed up<br/>through vents onto roughly horizontal surfaces, and often occur<br/>inside the craters created by volcanic eruptions.  The shape of a<br/>lava dome is especially simple in comparison to most other lava<br/>flows.  Hence, a first step in understanding lava flows in general<br/>is to explore those domes.  Moreover, despite their slow growth,<br/>domes are natural hazards because they can be the setting of<br/>violent and dangerous events: domes can rupture and release<br/>confined gas in a pyroclastic outflow (an extremely hot and<br/>fast-moving current of air and ash), or collapse at their<br/>peripheries to create landslides and debris flows.  The proposal<br/>outlines a mathematical and experimental approach to the<br/>modelling of lava domes.  The purpose is to build models of the<br/>dome's structure and evolution, and compare these models with the<br/>real geological structures.  By modelling the domes in this way,<br/>more will be learned about how lava flows, and ultimately this<br/>may provide insight into the hazards associated with them.<br/>"

Because the earth's atmosphere and oceans are<br/>stratified fluids in a rotating frame, the work is highly<br/>relevant to geophysical applications.  Many aspects of<br/>wave-turbulence interactions are yet to be understood.  For<br/>example, it is not clear if, when and how small-scale 3D<br/>turbulence in the presence of waves can organize into large-scale<br/>coherent structures (as in 2D flows).  In purely rotating flow,<br/>the investigator previously showed that white-noise forcing at<br/>small scales leads to the generation of slow, large-scale,<br/>cyclonic vortical columns, if the Rossby number is below a<br/>critical value of order one.  This is surprising because recent<br/>work using multiple scales analysis shows, at first order,<br/>decoupling between fast, small-scale motions and slow,<br/>large-scale motions for a variety of wave-turbulence systems<br/>including rotating flow.  Several second-order mechanisms may be<br/>responsible for the upscale energy transfer to slow modes in<br/>rotating turbulence.  This project goes a step further towards<br/>understanding the large-scale dynamics in geophysical flows, by<br/>investigation of upscale energy transfer in 3D stratified and<br/>rotating, stratified turbulence.

This means that, on time<br/>scales of perhaps days in the atmosphere and weeks in the oceans,<br/>large-scale eddies and currents evolve independently from<br/>small-scale turbulence.  Another implication is that short-term<br/>climate change is independent from rapid fluctuations of the<br/>conditions in the atmosphere and oceans.

Bernoulli in the 18th century.  He completed Leibniz's original attempt at a general partial fraction decomposition of the function.  The main difficulty associated with this procedure is to obtain a complete factorization of the denominator.  In the middle of the 19th century Hermite and Ostrogradsky developed algorithms to compute the rational part of the primitive for the function without factoring its denominator.  More recently Horowitz rediscovered this method and discussed its complexity.  The problem of computing the transcendental part of the primitive was finally solved by Lazard and Rioboo.  This algorithm has been implemented in the current versions of the most widely used symbolic integrators such as MATLAB, Maple V and Mathematica 4.0.  Modern developments in the theory of integration of rational functions have been concentrated in the development of algorithms that reduce the cost of operations, thereby extending the range of problems that can be solved using realistic amounts of machine time.  In spite of the fact that the problem of integration of rational functions appears to be solved both from a theoretical and symbolic point of view, the reality is that much more work remains to be done.  Among the difficulties encountered in the use of symbolic integration packages is that the performance is dependent upon the way the rational function is entered into the algorithm.  The immediate goal of this project is twofold: to develop and implement an efficient and robust symbolic algorithm for the evaluation of definite integrals of rational functions; and to investigate the dynamical and geometrical properties of the rational Landen transformations.  The long term goal of this project is to develop a complete solution to the problem of definite integration in finite terms.  This will complement the work done by Lazard-Rioboo, Rioboo, Risch, and Trager in the case of indefinite integration.  Implementation of this solution will have a profound impact on<br/>the current symbolic integrators.<br/><br/>     Many problems in physics and engineering require the exact evaluation of integrals in terms of the parameters appearing in those integrals.  These integrals come up in the study of particle physics and classical mechanics.  While it is not always possible to find such an expression, an efficient and robust symbolic software package should give the result in closed form, or decide whether such an expression is achievable.  The goal of this project is to develop algorithms that will expand upon the capabilities of existing software packages that are widely used in industry and universities.<br/>"

The modeling and methods will be aimed at the more efficient use of fiber bandwidth.  It will include both single channel and Wavelength Division Multiplexing techniques.  The group will develop methods for the investigation of theoretical models of the main fiber optics technologies.  This includes the emerging techniques of dispersion compensation, distributed amplification, wavelength division multiplexing, and uses of the newly developed dispersion-profiled fiber.  Also to be investigated will be the influence of dispersion management on four-wave interactions and therefore on the stability of bit-patterns in multi-channel systems.  Each of these methods involves, in some way, the spatial management of dispersion and other physical effects.  In general, this leads to an inhomogeneous evolutionary partial differential equation with rapidly varying coefficients.  Much of the mathematical and computational theory will be aimed at a deeper understanding of these equations and their properties within the specific context of optical transmission.  An emphasis will be placed on the averaging theory, stabilization of pulses and pulse interactions. <br/><br/>Increasing the bit-rate in optical fiber communications is a challenge that is both scientifically exciting and technologically imperative.  An objective of this project will be to take the involvement of mathematical investigations in improving the efficacy of optical communications to a new level. We shall intertwine the development of the underlying mathematics, numerical techniques and the practical, experimental implementation of new scenarios through a group effort that involves representatives from academia, government laboratories and industry.  The development of new mathematical and computational techniques is crucial for the both the formulation of new strategies and their initial evaluation.  This effort will take the methods of modern applied mathematics into the fiber optics engineering community.  It will pave the road for further interactions between applied mathematicians and electrical engineers and promises to make the field of optical communications even more vigorous.  At the same time, the work will stimulate new areas of applied mathematics, such as the study of averaging methods for strongly inhomogeneous partial differential equations, stability and interaction of pulses, and development of effective computational methods for rapidly varying systems.<br/><br/>"

Chemotaxis - the ability to sense the direction of external chemical sources and respond by polarizing and migrating toward chemoattractants or away from chemorepellants - is crucial for proper functioning of single cell organisms, such as bacteria and amoebae, as well as multi-cellular systems.  In fact, chemotaxis occurs to some extent in almost every cell type at some time during its development. It is a major component of the inflammatory, and wound-healing responses, the mammalian reproductive systems (spermatozoa), the development of the nervous system as well as tumor metastasis. Despite of recent advances in the understanding of the biochemistry regulating chemotaxis in eukaryotic cells -specially of the slime mold D. discoideum, knowledge of the signaling network is far from complete.  Nevertheless, this signaling network serves as a particularly timely candidate for mathematical and computational modeling, as well as an ideal model organism for discovering how cells sense and respond to directional external stimuli. The introduction of control engineering and dynamical systems theory into this research is particularly appropriate as these fields focus on nonlinear phenomenon, particularly those involving feedback systems and thus provide a natural counterpoint to biochemical research.  Specifically, in this research we propose to 1) localize the signaling proteins in living cells undergoing chemotaxis; 2) account for the source and nature of signal amplification; 3) explore the mobility of signaling proteins during chemotaxis; 4) determine the roles that conflicting chemoattractants have on cell polarity; and 5) ascertain the robustness properties of this cell signaling mechanism. Our goal is to develop high-fidelity models of the regulatory network controlling eukaryotic chemotaxis.<br/><br/>Eukaryotic chemotaxis is a fascinating biological phenomenon.  A thorough understanding will represent a huge step forward in our knowledge of one of the basic properties of life, i.e. purposeful movement, and enable a logical approach to the treatment of many devastating human diseases that result when this process fails.  Moreover, the similarity of the chemotactic responses in mammalian cells to those of D. discoideum ensures that the proposed research will have far reaching impact beyond this organism.<br/>"

He develops algorithms for the computation of such optimal objects.  Criteria of optimality that are explored include minimization of the number of simplices, of the total sum of lengths or areas of simplices, and of the average volume of the simplices.  He also develops software for counting all lattice points inside a low-dimensional polytope and for computing their integer hulls.  The technique also allows the fast computation of volumes.  Specific problems are considered to assess efficiency of the software, for example the optimal arrangements of n points, in a sphere of fixed radius, that maximize the number of lattice points inside their convex hull.  Algorithms for the software are adaptations of new techniques, due to Barvinok, that are based on covering polyhedra with unimodular simplices.  This project also includes methods from convexity, combinatorics, integer and linear programming, commutative algebra, complexity, and intensive computer experimentation.  The results of this work should be of interest in integer programming, combinatorics, and symbolic-algebraic computing.<br/><br/>     Informally speaking, the first part of this project can be thought of as an attempt to understand how to break or decompose objects, such as cubes and polygons, into elementary blocks or pieces efficiently.  This is perhaps reminiscent of creating jigsaw puzzles.  The blocks used in the decomposition are, for instance, tetrahedra, triangles, or smaller cubes.  An example of efficient decomposition is to use the smallest number of pieces.  The second part of the project involves establishing practical computer software for counting regularly distributed points within regular boundaries.  Examples of regularly distributed points are arrangements of atoms or crystals.  Many of the theoretical questions under study are motivated by problems in computer graphics and computer visualization (via the design of economic meshes for modeling figures), data security and computation (in the context of RSA encryption, which is used in internet transactions), and operations research (via certain techniques for solving integer programs when levels of uncertainty are expected).

The relatively poor axial conductance of the branches<br/>is offset by the myriad of ion channels that perforate the cell<br/>membrane.  A nerve cell's salient physical, as opposed to<br/>geometrical, properties are then its axial conductance, its<br/>membrane's capacitance and permeability to one or more ionic<br/>species and the kinetics (rules that govern its open/closed<br/>state) of the underlying channels.  The predictive utility of a<br/>mathematical model of course hinges on the accuracy to which<br/>these physical properties are known.  Unfortunately, the<br/>experimental determination of each of these quantities is a<br/>formidable task that, in light of recent data suggesting that the<br/>permeabilities vary with position in the dendritic tree, requires<br/>great investment for all but the simplest geometries.  The<br/>investigator and his colleagues therefore determine the extent to<br/>which the neuron's physical properties may be inferred from more<br/>readily available indirect measurements.  These indirect<br/>measurements are recordings of somatic and distal membrane<br/>potential following a known current stimulus to the soma.<br/>Assuming current seals at the distal ends, these two potential<br/>recordings result in lateral overdetermination of the underlying<br/>degenerate-parabolic system of Hodgkin-Huxley equations.  The<br/>investigator and his colleagues deduce from this overdetermined<br/>system a number of well posed problems, and associated algorithms<br/>(based on moment, fixed-point and output least squares methods),<br/>for the recovery of one or more of the neuron's physical<br/>properties.  They test these algorithms on data recorded from<br/>pyramidal neurons drawn from the rat's hippocampus.<br/>     In order to repair or reproduce the brain one must have a<br/>parts list and a blueprint specifying how the parts are to be<br/>connected.  At the coarsest level there are but two types of<br/>parts, nerves (neurons) and nerve glue (glial cells).  Though the<br/>human brain has more of each than the Milky Way has stars, it is<br/>not their sheer number but rather a subtle combination of<br/>interconnectedness and variation in electrical properties that<br/>render the brain so powerful.  The term `variation' is meant to<br/>express the realization that a neuron is not simply a switch<br/>within a certain brain center or a wire connecting two such<br/>centers, but rather is a tree of wires with electrical properties<br/>varying along each of its branches.  It is this local variation in<br/>a neuron's ability to conduct the brain's principal ions that is<br/>thought to be responsible for an individual neuron's ability to<br/>perform tasks reminiscent of rudimentary computers.  Given however<br/>the minute size and variegated nature of a single neuron, the<br/>direct experimental determination of its electrical properties<br/>has yet to be achieved.  The investigator and his colleagues<br/>therefore pursue the mathematically challenging task of<br/>determining these properties from more readily available, though<br/>indirect, experimental measurements.  This process is akin to<br/>determining the size and location of a leak in a transatlantic<br/>telephone cable by comparing what the American said to what the<br/>Englishman heard.  The success of their endeavor, coupled with the<br/>increasingly fine resolution of images of neuronal<br/>interconnections, will permit the investigator and his colleagues<br/>to produce models of sufficient veracity to be of use by the<br/>medical community from construction of prosthetic neuronal<br/>circuits to the design and testing of drugs and better<br/>treatments.<br/>"
