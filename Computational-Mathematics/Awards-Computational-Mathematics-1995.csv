The first area is to  establish a unified   scheme for constructing wavelets based only on nested sequences  of   subspaces but not on any two-scale relation.  The second area is  the study of   multivariate wavelets and frames with matrix dilations.  The  third area is on   representation of discrete data by radial basis functions  (RBF's).  The fourth   area is the investigation of adaptive wavelets, based on spline  techniques.  A   particular interest is in modeling by spline and radial basis  functions and in   constructing and analyzing the corresponding wavelets.  In view  of the fact   that most modeling functions, including all the interesting  standard radial   basis functions, do not satisfy a two-scale (or refinement)  relation, a unified   scheme for the construction of wavelets that does not rely on  such a relation   is developed.  This constitutes the first area of the proposed  research.  The   second area is centered around multivariate wavelets, where the  main   concern is matrix dilation.  For instance, the boundedness of the  affine   operator and that of the corresponding Littlewood-Paley energy  functions,   for a finite family of square-integrable functions with zero  mean, will be   investigated and sufficient conditions that guarantee lower  bounds will be   established.  The third area is centered on the study of  localized cosine   Riesz bases and their corresponding duals.  The duals, or  bi-orthogonal   bases, must facilitate computational efficiency.  For this and  other reasons,   spline techniques, such as knot insertion and knot removal, will  be   investigated.  The final area concerns the  modeling of discrete  data.  For   high dimensions, radial basis functions seem to be the most  efficient tool,   and the emphasis will be on various linear and  nonlinear  problems   involving these functions.    The central theme of this rese arch proposal is the development of    mathematical  tools for analysis and synthesis of discrete data  in one or   higher dimensions, in an Euclidean space or on a closed manifold  such as   the unit ball.  This proposed research is a unified approach to  represent any   discrete data set in an effective way so that ""wavelet"" analysis  can be   readily performed. Both spline and radial basis functions will be  used for   data representation.  It is well known that spline functions  provide a very   powerful tool for data modeling due to their most desirable  properties such   as flexibility for adaptive implementation, computational  efficiency, and   localization capability.  On the other hand, radial basis  functions are more   powerful for handling higher-dimensional data sets, particularly  when the   data information is taken randomly.  Wavelets will be constructed   and   wavelet algorithms will be developed by using both spline  functions and   radial basis functions.  In addition, for analyzing nonstationary  data that   change in shape, the investigators will look into the use of  localized cosine   transforms by using splines or radial basis functions as  envelopes (or   windows).  Adaptive algorithms will also be developed.  One of  the main   reasons for wavelets to be considered as a very powerful tool for  data   analysis is their fast algorithms.  The research will be focused  on   constructing wavelets using both spline and radial basis  functions for   effective implementation and fast computation.  Software  development will   be  carried out concurrently, and one of the main goals is to  ensure that the   algorithms can also be implemented in hardware. Industrial  standards in the   hardware prototype development will also be kept in mind."

Lansing, MI 48824   Project Abstract  During the past few years, the investigator and  his colleagues have achieved significant progress in the  modeling, analysis, and computation of superconducting phenomena.  The proposed work of the   investigator and his collaborators  includes the further development and refinement of their previous  work on mezoscale models (in particular, the Ginzburg-Landau  model and its variants), as well as new computational and  analytical explorations into the macroscale (homogenized) models.  At the mezoscale level, the investigator continues the  development and implementation of efficient algorithms for  treating a variety of interesting phenomena involving the motion  of vortices in type-II superconductors, especially the high  critical temperature layered superconductors. At the macroscale,  the investigator proposes to develop enhancements of existing  models that can account for inhomogenieties and for applied  currents and voltages and to develop and implement discretization  and solution algorithms for determining approximate solutions for  these models. The types of phenomena the investigator and his  colleagues wish to simulate include vortex liquid and vortex  glass structures, pinning by normal impurities and thickness  variations, motion and de-pinning due to  thermal fluctuations  and applied currents and voltages, resistivity caused by motion,  and critical currents.      Superconductivity is one of the grand  challenges identified as being crucial to future economic  prosperity and scientific leadership. With the advent of modern  computational technology, scientists, engineers, and  mathematicians who wish to design superconducting devices and/or  who wish to study the physics of superconductivity are in need  robust and efficient algorithms and codes for the numerical  simulation of superconduc ting phenomena. The investigator and his  colleagues are aimed at meeting such a need. Useful tools will be  developed not only for the use of physicists and material  scientists interested in studying superconducting phenomena at  the vortex level, but also for those involved in the design of  superconducting devices."

However, since we have additional unknowns in the  model,  these introduce unknown parameters in the equations that have to  be  additionally solved for by means of further measurements.

Homotopy algorithms for solving sparse polynomial systems           Recently, it has been proved that modeling the sparse structure of a  polynomial system by its Newton polytopes leads to a major computational  breakthrough in solving polynomial systems by homotopy methods. The PI?s ""random product homotopy"" approach proposed in the project intends to construct a start system for the homotopy in random product form with its Newton polytopes  containing those of the target system. On the other hand, the ""polyhedral  homotopy"" based on an elegant formula for computing the mixed volume can find all zeros of a polynomial system by following much fewer, in most occasions  the exact amount of, homotopy curves.             Polynomial Systems occur everywhere in Mathematics, Science and  Technology. Very small systems are easily solved by hand, but larger systems cannot reliably be so solved, if at all. The project aims to implement a portable solver using the latest in polynomial system solving algorithms and  capable of being incorporated into applications programs. Research will be  carried out to advance the state of the art and our understanding of polynomial  systems; additionally, various application areas will be studied, such as  kinematics, control theory, geometric modelling, and biochemistry in  which problems reducible to polynomial system solving arise."

A variety  of inverse scattering problems are known to be uniquely solvable  when a complex valued function, known as the reflection  coefficient, is given as data.  In many interesting applications,  however, the reflection coefficient cannot be measured, but  instead only its amplitude can be determined experimentally.  The  phase problem in inverse scattering consists then in solving the  inverse scattering problem despite the lack of phase information  contained in the reflection coefficient.  In general these missing  data introduce genuine non-uniqueness into the problem, and one  must compensate by making use of other kinds of information.  For  example, one might restrict the class of admissible solutions in  some way consistent with the physics of the situation, or  alternatively one might have available some other kinds of data  related to the usual scattering data.  Aside from uniqueness  questions, there is also a need to develop accurate and reliable  computational techniques.  The model problem --- the  one-dimensional inverse scattering problem --- arises in neutr                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       on  and x-ray reflection studies of surface structure.  Related  problems in optics are also studied.  It is natural in such  applications to require the potential to vanish on a half line,  and this substantially, although not completely, removes the  ambiguity due to the missing phase information.  A main goal of  this project is to identify various types of further supplementary  information whose specification allows for unique recovery of the  potential.  Also, numerical methods are developed for computation  of the potential in each case.  An important aspect of the  numerical approach developed here is that ultimately it is only  necessary to solve an optimization problem over a relatively small  dimensional parameter space.       In a number of areas of science and engineering it is of  interest to characterize the chemical structure of surfaces and  interfaces on very small length scales.  Aside from its intrinsic  theoretical interest, this kind of capability has technological  applications, especially in materials science and biology.  One  experimental technique which has received considerable attention  in recent years is the use of so-called reflectivity data: a  carefully prepared beam of x-rays or neutrons is aimed at the  surface whose material properties are sought, and the reflected  beam is carefully measured.  Due to the interaction of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              the beam  with the surface, the reflected beam encodes a great deal of  information about the surface, and one is thus confronted with the  problem of properly interpreting such data.  The main goal of this  project is to investigate certain analytical and numerical methods  for making such inferences.  The reflected beam may be  characterized by amplitude and phase components, but conventional  measuring devices are sensitive only to the amplitude component.  It is well understood that considerable ambiguity in the  interpretation of reflectivity data is associated with the absence  of the phase component.  To compensate for this one hopes to use  various kinds of supplementary information which may be available.  In this project the investigator seeks to elucidate from a  mathematical point of view how it may be possible to incorporate  such extra information into automatic data processing techniques."

The public domain software package CLAWPACK  (Conservation LAWs PACKage) he has developed is extended to handle  a wider variety of problems on both Cartesian and curvilinear  grids in 1, 2, and 3 space dimensions.  Mosaic composite grids are  further developed to allow body-fitted grids near an irregular  boundary to be coupled with Cartesian grids away from the  boundary.  Immersed interface methods for handling discontinuities  in the solution or its derivatives are used in conjunction with  multi-dimensional conservation law methods to solve fluid dynamics  and wave propagation problems with material interfaces.  These  techniques achieve second order accuracy on uniform Cartesian  grids cut by irregular interfaces.  Similar techniques are applied  to problems with stiff source terms arising from chemical  reactions or combustion, giving rise to thin reaction zones that  behave macroscopically as interfaces.  Specific applications in a  number of areas are studied, including groundwater flow,  atmospheric flow, chemotaxis, and astrophysics.  The software being  developed is intended for teaching as well as research purposes,  and includes extensive documentation and applied examples.  An  accompanying textbook is being written.         The investigator develops computational methods and public  domain software for the solution of a class of mathematical  problems that arises in virtually every field of science and  engineering.  The partial differential equations considered can, in  various forms, model the motion of liquids or gas (e.g., air in  the atmosphere, water in the ocean, aerodynamic flow around  aircraft or through turbines, groundwater or oil beneath the  earth's surface), or the motion of waves in fluid or air (e.g.,  acoustic waves in the air or ocean or in ultrasonic explor ation of  the body, seismic waves in the earth originating from earthquakes  or artificially generated for oil exploration, radar waves).  Even  the motion of organisms in ecological modeling or cells in  developmental biology follows similar laws.  The methods are based  on extensive research over the past 20 years, primarily in the  aerodynamics and weapons development communities.  This technology  is slowly being transferred to other areas, but is hindered by the  complexity of most of the algorithms.  The software of this project  should help speed this process.  It is designed for general use as  both a teaching and research tool, with extensive examples  included in many applications areas.  Novel methods are also  developed to deal with phenomena occurring on different time  scales (e.g., fast chemical reactions coupled with slow  groundwater or atmospheric flow) and for problems in geometrically  complicated regions of space bounded by irregular boundaries or  containing interfaces where material properties change (e.g.,  between different types of rock in groundwater flow and  seismology, or between bone and tissue in ultrasound imaging).  Close collaboration is underway with researchers in many areas  (particularly groundwater flow and atmospheric modeling), both to  improve and generalize the software and to use it in the solution  of specific problems.  An application of great interest is  contaminant transfer in groundwater flow, where linear or  nonlinear advection in a porous medium with discontinuous  permeabilities and irregular geometries must often be coupled with  stiff source terms for adsorption and reactions.  Accurate models  are needed both as an aid to remediation of polluted sites and to  the study of proposed underground storage sites for nuclear waste.  Atmospheric modeling is crucial both in short-term weather  prediction and in long-range global modeling of climate, ozone  depletion, etc.  The investigator works with researchers in these  areas to incorporate this  software into standard models as well as  to develop new methods where needed."

Specifically, a new  technique of   analysis to study the convergence of two-dimensional models of  thin plates   will be used.  This technique gives the possibility of obtaining  sharp   convergence estimates for plate modeling errors both globally and  away   from the lateral boundary (where convergence may be higher).  It  is hoped   that this research will clarify in what situations the  Reissner-Mindlin plate   model affords better approximation than the classical Kirchhoff  model, an   important question that eluded resolution for decades.  A second  area of   emphasis will be on the  development, implementation, validation,  and   dissemination of a finite element code to simulate the collision  of black   holes.  This problem involves the solution of the Einstein field  equations on   an unbounded domain in four dimensional space-time and is  extremely   demanding computationally.  Work will focus, at least initially,  on the   solution of the initial data problem for black hole collisions,  i.e., the   determination of physical ly consistent and meaningful initial  data. The   initial data problem is a nonlinear elliptic system posed on an  unbounded   three-dimensional domain.  For this problem the computer code to  be   produced will involve a variety of sophisticated modern  techniques that   have not yet been applied in  computational relativity, including  adaptive   tetrahedral mesh generation and multigrid preconditioning.    The investigator's work is directly related to several critical  technological   issues.  It is generally agreed by practitioners that the current  state of the art   of numerical modeling of shells is inadequate, and this has been  implicated   in the failure of engineering structures such as stadium roofs  and airplane   fuselages.  The investigator's work in both the area of the  development and   analysis of finite element methods for plates and shells, and on  plate   modeling errors is directed at overcoming these problems.  The  work on the   simulation of black hole collisions is directly motivated by the  ongoing   construction of the LIGO gravitational wave observatory.  LIGO is  expected   to be able to detect radiation from black hole collisions early  in the next   decade.  Massive numerical simulations are needed to identify the    cosmological events which are the sources for the detected  radiation. It is   clear that these simulations push the limits of available  hardware and   software technology.  The investigator's work is directed at  improving the   speed and accuracy of these  simulations by employing and  adapting recent   advances in numerical algorithms.  The resulting computer codes  will be   adapted to parallel computer architectures and will provide an  excellent   opportunity for the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows  working   under the supervision of the investigator to learn high  performance   computing techniques."

In numerous practical contexts, researchers   are confronted with the inadequacy of standard statistical techniques  to handle the explosion in the size of current data sets, where the  number of observations can easily run into the giga- and even terabyte  ranges.   Statistical assumptions underlying many  of the most popular methods, such as ""homogeneity"" of the data,  may simply be wrong  in these cases, thus rendering common statistical  tools ineffective and even dangerous.   A corresponding problem is the growth in the  number of dimensions in many current problems.  Again standard  approaches, which were developed  in a different  era, even predating the computer in many cases, are not powerful  enough for these challenges.      The workshop on Statistics and Massive Datasets explores  the challenges  presented by massive data sets, and  does so in the context   of a variety of real world and currently pressing application areas, including  the atmospheric, biological and geo sciences, business and marketing,  ecology, and engineering and technology. With these areas as a backdrop,   specific over-arching multi-disciplinary research issues  on common needs,   including relevant statistical principles, computational aspects, data analysis, and  visualization of massive data sets are identified.   The workshop involves highly  animated discussions among scientists.  These discussions are not easily  captured in a traditional published proceedings format.  In contrast, the  activities are capture d and distributed via the preparation of a videotape  of the workshop followed by a World Wide Web (WWW) dissemination.   This new dissemination method brings the benefit   of the actual discussions to a wide audience in a timely fashion."

The investigator continues studies of  two-parameter families of maps of the plane that are generated by  periodically forced oscillator systems.  The broad goal is to  understand the qualitative behavior of these systems and how that  behavior changes, or ""bifurcates,"" as parameters in the models are  varied.  The project focuses on discrete dynamical systems rather  than differential equations.  It aims to explain parameter space  phenomena as projections of ""more natural"" objects in the  cartesian product of the phase and parameter spaces.  The project  includes further development of tools for ""local"" bifurcation  phenomena, such as the birth of periodic orbits, but concentrates  mostly on extending existing tools and results for local phenomena  to analogous tools and results for ""global"" phenomena, such as the  birth of homoclinic orbits.  Study involves software development,  numerical simulation, and analysis of both the numerics and the  mathematics of global bifurcations.

The goal of the project is to study changes,  or ""bifurcations,"" in the qualitative behavior of these systems as  parameters are changed.  For example, the number of hunting  licenses issued could be a parameter in a mathematical model of an  ecosystem.  There might be a critical number of licenses below  which deer would survive, and above which the deer would die out.  This critical number would  be called a bifurcation value of the  parameter.  An incredibly complex scenario of bifurcations is  possible, even for models that are described by very simple  mathematical formulas.  Hence, some level of numerical  investigation is absolutely necessary.  The project includes  software development, numerical simulation, and analysis of both  the numerics and the mathematics of the bifurcations involved.  The  project enables a more complete understanding of a wide variety of  models.  This leads to a better understanding the past and a better  chance of predicting the future of systems behaving like these  models, as well as for many other seemingly unrelated systems."

The main  target is systems of reaction-diffusion equations.  Such problems  are important in practical terms because they occur as  mathematical models in applied science and engineering, including  applications in genetics, material science, chemistry, and  biology, among others.  The challenge is to compute accurate  approximations of solutions that generically include multiple  scales in their space and time behavior and whose behavior depends  strongly on parameters prescribed as part of the model.  Moreover,  using computation as a scientific tool requires an estimate of the  accuracy of the approximation.  The approach to these problems is  based on developing a posteriori error estimates that bound the  error in terms of computable information obtained from the  approximation once a computation is completed.  The analysis takes  into account both the difficulty of solving the differential  equation over a small interval and the global accumulation of  errors.  In particular, the stability properties of the solution  being approximated are measured by auxilary computations performed  during the approximation.  The result is robust and reliable  computational error estimates.  In addition, the investigator  examines the dynamical properties of numerical schemes in the  context of obtaining schemes with improved accuracy for a  specified problem and obtaining more accurate error estimates for  such schemes.  The third component of the project is the  development and implementation into code of adaptive error control  algorithms based on the a posteriori error estimates.  The ultimate  goal of this project is the public release of a parallel code that  can solve systems of reaction-diffusion equations in two and three  dimensions reliably and efficiently.       Mathematical models in applied science, including genetic s,  material science, chemistry, and biology, are often expressed as  nonlinear reaction-diffusion differential equations that contain  source terms balanced against terms that diffuse energy.  The goal  of such modelling is to describe the physical situation in terms  of the solution of the differential equation.  However, the  nonlinear nature of most models makes it impossible to solve the  equations explicitly; consequently numerical approximation is an  important tool in science.  This approach has its own difficulties.  The balance between reaction and diffusion is usually delicate and  difficult to handle accurately.  Moreover, solutions of such  problems typically evolve on several scales, i.e. some interesting  behavior occurs in very localized regions in space and time while  other behavior evolves over long times or over larger regions in  space.  The use of a uniform numerical discretization for a real  application results in huge computations that tax even the largest  computers.  The investigator aims to produce numerical schemes that  adapt themselves to the localized behavior of the target solution  so as to make the computations both as accurate as desired and as  efficient as possible.  Another benefit is that the estimate of the  accuracy can then be reported, which increases the scientific  level of numerical analysis.  The mathematical approach is develop  estimates of the error that use information obtained from the  approximation, which can then be used to adapt the discretization,  that is make the computations self-governing.  The investigator  also is implementing this theory in a code for parallel computers  that can solve very general problems with minimum user input.  The  intent is to make the code publicly available, yielding a  scientific tool that benefits the engineering and scientific  infrastructure."

The  interaction between dynamical systems and numerical analysis has  grown in recent years as the limitations of classical quantitative  numerical analysis have become increasingly apparent.  In practice,  a common goal of computation is to obtain information about  solutions over moderate to long time intervals, yet classical  error analysis is generally not meaningful past a short initial  transient.  It is thus fundamental to the numerical analysis of  differential equations to address both the efficacy of existing  computational methods and the design of special methods for  computation over long time intervals.  Specific topics to be  covered include convergence of integration algorithms over long  time intervals (including long-time error bounds and convergence  of invariant sets), stability of integration algorithms over long  time intervals (including preservation of dynamical structure and  spurious solutions), new approaches to error analysis (including  shadowing results and backward error analysis), and design of  computational techniques for invariant sets such as algorithms to  compute invariant torii, inertial manifolds, heteroclinic orbits,  homoclinic orbits, and Lyapunov exponents.       Differential equations describe how one position in space of  a physical system at a particular time influences neighboring  positions in the immediate future.  It is this local nature of a  differential equation that makes it possible to model complicated  physical situations, because it means that the entire system does  not have to be described simultaneously.  But this also means that  obtaining the correct differential equation model of a system is  not the end of the story, because it is necessary to solve the  differential equation to obtain information about the original  system.  Accordingly, the study of solutions of differential  equations has grown int o one of the major areas of mathematics  while becoming centrally important in science and engineering.  The  introduction of the computer made it possible to approximately  solve differential equations on a wide scale for the first time.  Over the last thirty years, numerical mathematicians have made  great progress in devising methods to approximate a specific  solution of a differential equation and in analyzing the accuracy  of the approximate solution.  The classical approach to study  numerical methods for differential equations is very good at  describing the behavior of the approximation of a particular  solution in a small region of space over a short time interval.  But understanding the nature of nonlinear equations requires  knowledge about many solutions over relatively long time  intervals.  In response to this need, there is increasing interest  in using numerical methods to study structures and patterns in  solutions of differential equations, which is known as the  dynamical behavior of the equation.  This conference gathers  leading experts from the United States and from around the world,  representing nearly all aspects of the area, together with  interested students and other researchers, to discuss the current  state of the art and to stimulate new developments.  The conference  is expected to have a long-ranging impact on many applications in  science and engineering."

The emphasis is on iterative  methods, specifically, preconditioned Krylov subspace methods, for solving the  linear systems arising from discretization and linearization of the  steady-state Navier-Stokes equations subject to incompressibility constraints. Primary goals include the formulation and analysis of preconditioners that are  effective for large Reynolds numbers, the construction of efficient methods for parallel architectures, and the study of effects of linearization strategy on  performance and overall costs.  The investigator studies these issues for a  variety of stable finite element and finite difference discretization schemes  and considers the influence of discretization on the algebraic properties of  the discrete problems and on performance.  The methods are studied and compared using both analytic bounds on convergence rates and assessment of performance  in computational experiments with benchmark problems.   The equations to which these solution algorithms are applied are fundamental in computational fluid dynamics, for simulating the effects of flow (that is, estimating quantities such as velocities, pressures and temperatures) in a wide variety of physical settings.  Examples of areas where they can be applied  include vehicle aerodynamics and aerospace models, models of environmental  flows, biomedical models (blood flow), cooling models for nuclear reactors, and thin film coating (e.g., of adhesives or optical fibers).  Mathematical  models of such processes enable the study of the effects of different physical  parameters, for example, wing shape in an airplane or chemical content of a  thin film.  Determination of such effects using purely experimental techniques, i.e., through the construction of prototypes and scale models, is prohibitively expensive, time consuming  and subject to inaccuracies introduced by the presence of measuring devices.  Mathematical models do not replace experimental work but complement them and allow for efficient identification of promising prototypes.  Accurate solution of the mathematical models is only feasible, however, if reliable and fast computational algorithms are available.  The goal of the project is to develop such algorithms for use with these models."

Lyapunov exponents measure the average rates of linear  expansion or contraction of a dynamical system in different  directions; a system with N positive Lyapunov exponents is  expanding in N linearly independent directions, thus an attractor  of the system should be at least N-dimensional. However,  attractors and Lyapunov exponents can be very sensitive to  parameter changes, leading to ""windows"" in parameter space for  which the system exhibits lower-dimensional behavior.

Numerical methods for solving a differential equation  usually begin by imposing a grid on the region where the equation  holds.  From the differential equation, algebraic equations are then  developed;  their solution represents the qolution of the differential  equation.  The accuracy of the approximate solution commonly is measured by  the fineness  of the grid.  Multigrid methods are numerical methods for solving partial  differential equations that systematically exploit the  relationship  between approximate solutions on different grids  to arrive at a solution whose accuracy is consistent with the  finest grid  but for considerably less work.  The methods are often dramatically more efficient than others.  Research in the past dozen years has extended the methods  to a broad range of problems of considerable practical import  in engineerine, manufacturing, materials, physics, and fluid  dynamics."

Such problems arise in flows of  materials, for instance, and whenever the places where objects or  materials meet or end change with time.  These are common  situations throughout science and engineering.  The work is applied  to a number of areas.  In etching, deposition, and lithography in  the manufacture of microelectronic components, the work is used to  analyze process steps leading to higher yield and efficiency of  electronic devices.  In image enhancement, segmentation, and  recognition applied to medical imaging, the work leads towards  automatic software for recognizing cardiac data in CT and MRI  scans.  In grid generation, the techniques are used to develop new  techniques for building grids around complex bodies, as required  in aircraft and engine design.

The development of high performance computers  has made spectral and high order methods one of the most important  techniques in modern scientific and engineering computation.  Presentation of recent research concerning high order methods has  an increasingly important role in scientific computing.  Applications are being made in a variety of fields, including chip  design, fluid dynamics and others.  The first ICOSAHOM was held in  1989 in Italy, and the second ICOSAHOM was in June 1992 in  Montpelier, France.  With a long periodicity of 3 years, ICOSAHOM  plays the role of an ""international congress"" for the subject and  provides an opportunity to coordinate and stimulate research in  spectral and high order methods.       This conference focuses on numerical methods for the accurate  solution of partial differential equations.  Such equations arise  in simulating manufacturing processes and designing new products,  from automobiles and airplanes to computer chips.  Highly accurate  solutions are needed because current design and processes have  reached a refined state that requires extremely accurate and  efficient simulations to remain competitive.  This need has driven  the development and use of high-performance computers themselves,  as well as of specific algorithms for them.  The aim of this  conference is to bring together leading researchers, both  established and younger scientists, in this increasingly active  and highly interdisciplinary field to survey and review the  current state of research."

The primary objective of the special year is to train  graduate students and post-docs in the art and science of modeling  applied to biological problems.  Each quarter focuses on a specific  area of biology in which mathematics has had a significant impact  and in which there are significant new opportunities: Ecology and  Evolution (Fall 1995), Physiology and Cell Biology (Winter 1996),  and Cardiovascular Physiology and Biological Fluid Dynamics  (Spring 1996).  The educational program includes (i) a full year  course entitled `Mathematical Modeling in Biology' given by  visiting principal lecturers, who present a case study of applying  mathematical modeling to a biological problem in their area of  expertise, (ii) a weekly seminar series given by principal  lecturers, other visitors, and scientists from the University of  Utah, (iii) a quarterly minisymposium in an active research area  within the purview of that quarter, and (iv) a student/post-doc  seminar aimed at informal presentation of ideas, new results, and  open problems.  The notes from the course will be published.       The goal of the Special Year in Mathematical Biology at the  University of Utah is to train young scientists in mathematical  modeling of biological problems.  Graduate students and post-docs  are immersed in an interdisciplinary educational and collaborative  environment that brings them together with leading mathematicians  and scientists.  Although mathematics has long provided important  insights into biological processes, developments in biology and  mathematics have made the link more important.  Basic biological  research has increasing relevance to national priorities such as   health care and environmental protection, and powerful new  experimental techniques have made it possible to observe  previously inaccessible mechanisms in physiology, genetics, and  ecology.  Expanded access to powerful computers has enabled  researchers to simulate complex and realistic models of ecological  and physiological systems, establishing modeling and computation  as a new mode of experimentation in the life sciences.  Unfortunately, the training of most biologists and mathematicians  fails to prepare them for this type of research.  The Special Year  in Mathematical Biology prepares young researchers at the pre- and  junior post-doctoral level for these new demands.  The speakers and  researchers invited to this Special Year have established records  of successfully collaborating with both mathematicians and life  scientists.  The program focuses on three active areas of research  in the life sciences: ecology and evolution, physiology and cell  biology, and cardiovascular physiology and biological fluid  dynamics.  These areas have been fertile ground for successful  collaboration and modeling in the past.  The Special Year  introduces young researchers to these successes, involves them in  current research, and illustrates the conceptual connections  between the different fields.  These students, and those benefiting  from the book developed from the Special Year, will be the  catalysts for further development of this vital connection."

The aim of the  project is to develop and analyze new fast algorithms for  computing an estimate of an original image from a degraded image  that has been subjected to noise and blur.  Depending on the point  of view, two philosophically different approaches to image  restoration result: i) in algebraic restoration one views the  problem as a linear, possibly ill-conditioned, system of  equations, and ii) in stochastic restoration one regards it as a  problem of estimating a vector under random disturbances.  The  project develops numerical methods for both approaches.  Either  approach yields linear systems of equations that have a structure  that can be used in the development and analysis of efficient  algorithms for image restoration.  The structure depends on the  assumptions made on the image and the noise.  The matrices in these  systems are typically quite large; orders of a million are common.  The computational work, even with efficient methods, is therefore  quite demanding.  Because many applications require real-time image  restoration, the development of algorithms for parallel computers  is important.  The proposed research focuses on the development of  iterative methods that lend themselves well to implementation on  multiprocessors.       The central problem of image restoration is the estimation of  the original image, given a version of the image degraded by noise  and blur.  When the image is of a star observed from earth, the  blur may be due to the atmosphere and the noise can stem from  transmission of the signal.  Several different approaches to image  restoration are available.  They all give rise to large systems of  equations; a million equations are common.  The system of equations  has a structure, which depends on the assumptions made on the  image and on the statistical properties of the noise.  The purpose  of the project is to develop ne w algorithms for the restoration of  images.  These algorithms are designed so that they use the  structure of the system of equations in order to reduce the  computational work.  They are moreover suitable for use on parallel  computers.  The latter is important due to the large amount of  computations required."

In  the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, he studies the ends of  non-compact 3-manifolds, using least area laminations and least  length webs.  A conjecture is that these ends are tame.  This would  imply the Ahlfors conjecture.   The work on 4-manifolds leads to a  ""classification"" of the torsion-free nilpotent quotients of  3-manifold groups.

OPTIMIZATION OVER SPACES OF ANALYTIC FUNCTIONS    Qualitative theory, computer algorithms based on this theory,   analysis of such algorithms.  Connections of this work with other   branches of mathematics.The engineering motivation here is strong; these   are the key optimization problems which arise il design of   systems and amplifiers where there are competing constraints,   time as well as frequency domain constraints, or uncertainty  in the math model of the physical system one is trying to control.  2. NONLINEAR SYSTEMS The point here is to find canonical nonlinear operator   theory which extends the classical linear theory of   Nevanlinna-Pick and many followers. That theory is the   core of linear control theory. Many systems which people wish to control   are nonlinear (e.g., jet engines), so there is a big demand for an effective nonlinear theory.  Unfortunately, the mathematical theory is new and primitive.   More general problems need to be solved and   special cases need to be understood in greater detail.  3. COMPUTER OPERATOR ALGEBRA  Linear engineering systems theory and operator theory are   rife with calculations in a noncommuting algebra.   Thus it is likely that someday there will be a branch of these   subjects devoted to their symbolic computational aspects.       Helton's group have, support, and are upgrading extensive   software, called NCAlgebra, for performing noncommuting   calculations in Mathematica.  The software is currently   at the level of a very powerful `yellow pad'.  The main issue now is what `intelligence' should go in   noncommuting packages. For example,  calculations with energy conserving systems  produce polynomials in matrices satisfying certain relations.   Thus it is natural to find a list of rules for simplifying   such polynomials tailored to this particular situation.  The goal is to find and understand `complete' lists of   simplifying rules.

Microwave and  multi-species models, and the decisive role of friction, are  emphasized in the classical studies, and hysteresis,  bistable-state analysis, are emphasized in the quantum studies.  The rationale is to establish a way of dealing with various  aspects of hot electron effects in classical structures, and the  effects of tunneling and repulsion in heterogeneous structures, or  compound semiconductors.  The algorithms to be employed for the  simulations are shock capturing algorithms of finite difference  and finite element type.  The multi-species models permit  simulation of the circuit involving the Gunn diode, and its three  valley electron carriers, by new hydrodynamic models.  These are  compared with the computationally intensive results obtained by  the Urbana group, via Monte Carlo simulation of the Boltzmann  equation.       Mathematical and computer models of semiconductor devices  have increasingly necessitated the incorporation of two types of  effects: (1) energetics, often called the hot electron effect, and  (2) small scale, or quantum mechanical, effects.  This proposal  describes two important models, the first based upon classical,  and the second upon quantum, physics.  Although the basic physical  laws have been understood for at least seventy-five years, the  efforts to apply these laws to semiconductor devices in a way that  allows for reasonably efficient modeling and simulation represents  an enormous challenge to scientists, engineers, and  mathematicians.  An example of classical modeling is the Gunn  diode, which is acknowledged to be of critical importance in  microwave manufacturing applications; such devices appear in the  circuitry of the automobile, for example.  Its function depends  upon delicate oscillations of current and voltage, which must be  captured by computer  models if they are to be of any usefulness.  The principal investigator is open to any collaboration in the  manufacturing sector which might result from this work.  A possible  application of the quantum studies is the development (by others)  of logic gates in circuits that do not operate according to binary  ""off-on"" laws, but allow for multiple states of occupancy.  The  work described is highly collaborative and interdisciplinary,  including electrical engineers from the University of Illinois at  Urbana.  Computational mathematicians from Arizona State and Brown  Universities, and the University of Minnesota, and mathematical  analysts from the Courant Institute and from Stanford University,  are involved.  The results of past work have been regularly  presented at workshops on computational electronics, and published  in journals of electrical engineering and computational physics.  This practice is continued."

Underlying the approach are  a) the idea of oracles, which know perfectly well how to adapt representations   ideally,  b) the idea that the goal of adaptation in the presence of noisy data is to   quantify how closely realizable procedures (which do not have privileged   information about the object) can mimic an oracle,  and c) the design of   procedures coming as close as possible to the oracle.  The project  also develops  methods for comparing different adaptation schemes by comparing  oracles of different kinds, for example time-frequency oracles  and time-scale oracles.  This is an outgrowth of our earlier   results on wavelets, where this approach was used to show that wavelets  have a property of being nearly-ideally spatially adaptive.  In addition a  computational environment is being developed for   implementing and systematically testing such approaches.     As a further outgrowth of the proposers' earlier work on wavelets,  the project studies a number of improvements and extensions  of wavelet shrinkage, for example in the directions of classification,  confidence bands, correlated data and selection of orthogonal bases.    This research seeks to develop statistical theory  and computational tools in the general area of adaptive methods of  representing and analyzing signals, images and other objects.  On the one hand, this project is prompted by the extremely  high interest in adaptation on the part of people working  in fields of signal processing, image processing,   time-frequency analysis, speech processing analysis.  New signal representations appear in these fields almost daily,  along with new principles fo r selecting representations.  Such representations are useful for data compression, which is not  the main interest here; but they are also useful for noise removal and   signal interpretation, which are important areas for statisticians to consider.  On the other hand, this project is prompted by the goal  of developing statistical theory which can give clear understanding  of such adaptive schemes. Some of the most highly adaptive schemes  being suggested in signal processing pose a real challenge  to traditional statistical thinking.  For example, some adaptation schemes   search (either explicitly or implicitly) through thousands or millions of  representations of a signal in order to arrive at their final result.  A statistician,  when thinking about applying such methods to a noisy signal, is by training   forced to ask to what extent the result merely reflects the  effects of snooping through noise, detecting pseudo-structure which actually  due to noise, and due to the vigorous search.  The research seeks to develop  fundamental tools in theoretical statistics to aid understanding of  such adaptive procedures, and shows how to tune them so they are  noise-cognizant and stable.  This project may have two spin-offs.  First,  some of the results may be stimulating and/or useful to  the community of ``inventors of adaptive procedures'' in  signal, image, speech, and time/frequency, and related communities.  Second, the theoretical work may stimulate statisticians to take  more interest in making further contributions in such directions."

The primary point of view is topological.   Basic steps in the program are as follows. (1) Represent knotted   surfaces and isotopies of these surfaces as data sets. Traditional   topological constructions do not readily give rise to formulas, thus   calculations for coordinates of vertices is a non-trivial matter.   Computations based on the concept of an energy of a knot give rise to    interesting, useful, and in some sense, natural placements and   motions of knotted surfaces in four dimensional space.  A second   method is local in nature and is based on the investigator's methods   of higher dimensional knot moves.  A third method involves   interactive computer graphics.  (2)  Represent knotted surfaces in a   symbolic way.  To a surface in 4-space one can associate a   combinatorial object called a knot diagram. There is a calculus for   such diagrams similar to that which exists for classical knot   diagrams, a goal is to implement this.  From a knot diagram one can   determine some algebraic invariants of a knotted surface.  A   presentation of the knot group is one such example.  Using examples   (produced in part (1), above), higher dimensional diagrams will be   generated and analyzed with the hope of finding other combinatorially   defined invariants. (3)  Develop visualization techniques for the   search and verification of mathematical relationships between   examples.  It is not enough to ""see"" these objects, one wants to get   a mathematical understanding.  One such new visualization technique   uses a parameterized texture to provide natural visual cues for   higher dimensional information. Another involves interactive   manipulations objects in 4-space.  Currently, the investigator is   developing use of the CAVE in conjunction with parallel computation   as the best current tool for such a four-dimensional inte ractive   environment.            The basic question is: what is four dimensional space ?  One   is looking for mathematical answers with emphasis on computation and   visualization.  The study of four (and more) dimensions is not at all   esoteric.  Mathematically, a dimension is nothing more than a number.    Anything that needs to have four independent variables to describe it   can be considered to be a subset of four-dimensional space.  The most   well known example is an ""event"".  An event happens at a certain   place and a certain time.  Three numbers are needed to locate the   position of the event and the ""fourth dimension"" is time. The reason   that four-dimensions is very different than three is that it is   difficult to visualize.  This is a focus of this research.  The   things that we visualize best are surfaces, so it is natural to use   surfaces in four-dimensional space as a visualization tool. In   addition surfaces provide powerful mathematical probes into 4-space.   This investigation relies heavily on ""state of the art"" equipment.    To grapple with the complexities of the computation, use is made of   ""super-computers"".  To grapple with the complexities of visualization   and manipulation, use is made of a ""virtual reality"" system.  In   summary, the broad significance of this program is the extension of   frontiers of visual understanding for complex information using   modern computational tools."

Nonlinear waves in  hyperbolic   conservation laws commonly display sensitive dependence to the  problem   formulation and to numerical solution algorithms. A completed  theory of a   hyperbolic wave should contain the following ingredients: (1)  jump   conditions describing the influence of the wave on the flow in  which it is   embedded, (2) the width or growth rate of the layer, (3) a  complete theory of   the internal structure, and (4) a systematic unfolding of all  possible sensitive   dependencies for the wave. The mathematical tools and theories  used in the   analysis are varied, and include: partial differential equations  (hyperbolic   conservation laws), random fields, perturbation theory (ordinary  and   renormalized), renormalization group methods, traveling wave  analysis,   bifurcation theory, and the geometric theory of ordinary  differential   equations.    A representative mixing layer problem is acceleration driven  layers, arising   in instabilities of a fluid interface.  Such mixing layers arise  in many areas   of basic science and technology, including supernovae, inertial  confinement   fusion, and injection jets in carburetors for internal combustion  engines.   Detailed mathematical modeling and analysis will seek to modify  and refine   the defining mathematical equations describing such flows and  develop an   improved understanding of the structure of these equations.  This  analysis   will in turn be used to develop high resolution numerical methods  for the   solution of these equations. The nonlinear material wave patterns  we study   describe important metal forming processes such as punching and  cutting   (shear bands) and flow instabilities in forming plastic  components by   injection molding (viscoelastic materials). The analysis of waves  in   nonlinear materials uses a similar integrated approach: modeling,   theor y,   computations, and applications. Interactions with collaborators  will allow   transfer of this technology to appropriate applied physics and  engineering   communities."

Aggregation leads to  spatial complexity through feedback.  The feedback is nonlinear  when the cues individuals use to aggregate depend on the number of  individuals.  In a population model that allows for movement,  aggregative feedback causes nonlinear self-focussing, the  organization or `focussing' of population groups on small scales.  Decreases in the scale of spatial correlation make the dispersal  pattern more complex, leading to complicated spatial structure.  Mathematically, issues of pattern formation are related to the  structure of invasion waves or `fronts' between ecological states.  When the structure is known, stability analyses of states behind  the front or along the front determine how complexity is  generated.  A body of mathematical work has focussed on predicting  the speed and shape of invasion waves in biological problems.  Unfortunately, known techniques only address the invasion problem  in systems of low dimensionality (one or two dependent variables),  and do not lend themselves to general ecological application.  Techniques to predict front propagation in systems of many  variables are therefore at the center of the research.  Front  solutions, or waves of invasion, are the basis for stability  analyses at invasion boundaries, which predict how curvature  instabilities produce complexity at the invasion boundaries.  Results of these mathematical efforts are used to understand  complexity generation in the mountain pine beetle/pine system.  Results from the mathematical model are compared with data on  size, shape, and structure of known infestations.       In short, the idea is to determine how much focussing, or  clumping, of a species determines the natural formation of  patterns in ecosystems.  Aggregation, or clumping, of spec ies  occurs naturally, and can be predicted mathematically.  The  researchers examine how this mechanism creates complexity in  ecosystems, and study how to determine how much of ecological  complexity is self-generating, as opposed to being generated by  the complexity of the environment.  The Mountain Pine  Beetle/Lodgepole Pine ecosystem is studied because elements of the  spatial pattern (attacked and killed trees) are distinctive and  easy to measure.  Moreover, understanding the predictable aspects  of the course of pine beetle infestations is important to  understanding the role this pest plays in western forests,  including the relationship between beetle-killed pines and forest  fire."

Current and planned experiments include: (a) constitutive tests using a biaxial apparatus with the capability of measuring the speed of sound and of continuously monitoring the deformation with x-rays, (b) further study of porosity waves, (c) experiments directed toward isolating the causes of the instabilities of shaken granular material, and (d) experiments probing various aspects of fluctuations in granular flow, including stress chains and 1/f noise.  Based on the fact that the governing PDE of nonassociative plasticity become ill-posed at moderate strains, current analytical work seeks (a) to generalize previous one-dimensional work, driven by both mathematical considerations and the need to establish a sound theoretical framework for numerical simulations of two-and-three-dimensional phenomena and (b) to relate ill-posedness to various experimental phenomena such as porosity waves and shear banding.  Related problems in metal plasticity are also being studied analytically.  Numerical work includes both (a) continuum and (b) molecular-dynamics (MD) computations.  The key effort in the former is to complete a code for simulating shear-band formation and propagation, especially in the biaxial test; this code includes front tracking and mesh refinement at the shear band.  MD computations have the immediate goal of gathering quantitative information about fluctuations in granular flow, particularly the variation of such fluctuations with length scale.  In the long range, it is planned to develop a hybrid code that solves continuum equations in regions where the solution is smooth and invokes MD in regions of rapid change.         Many areas of applied engineer ing stand to benefit from progress on the fundamental questions addressed in this project, including (1) particle handling and transport, (2) soil mechanics, (3) materials forming, and (4) geotechnical engineering.  The following elaborates on area (1).  An estimated 40%, or $61 billion, of the value added by the chemical industry is linked to particle technology.  A study by the Rand Corporation found that, because of inability to accurately predict powder behavior, solids-producing manufacturing plants performed on average at 63% of design capacity, compared to 84% for liquids-producing plants.  In economic terms, this difference is staggering.  (Regarding future competitiveness, the U.S. should note that Germany and Japan lead the world in particle-technology research.)  Fundamental understanding of the flow of granular materials would help (a) in finding ways to control industrial problems and (b) in developing new, more efficient industrial processes.  To illustrate (a): one of the difficulties of granular flow is that quite different behavior may result from apparently identical circumstances, especially when scale-up is involved (e.g., from laboratory-scale experiments to an industrial silo).  Most existing theories attempt to describe the flow only in term of average quantities, ignoring deviations from these averages.  The focus in this project on fluctuations and length scales offers the possibility of being able to predict, and design for, the full range of behavior of real materials-handling systems.  To illustrate (b): the experiments in this project with shaken granular material have led to ideas for two planned applications for patents, one in obtaining uniform mixing of multi-sized particles and the other in exposing a large surface area to the surrounding gas (as in a fluidized bed but not requiring fluid flow).  These applications are being explored in concert with researchers in industry."

The project will involve developing a robust numerical scheme capable of simulating the Taylor-Couette flow over a wide range of parameter values, including all of the known flow regimes from Couette flow to the pre-turbulence flows.  The emphasis of this project is on the duplication of physical experiments.  In addition, the Taylor-Couette simulator will be used to investigate some of the mathematical results that have been obtained, especially those which do not agree with the experimental results.  The project will involve an efficient implementation of a three-dimensional scheme on a vector and/or parallel computer (using multigrid to speed convergence) along with a full graphical output package that will both imitate the available experimental outputs and give additional results (not generally obtainable in physical experiments) that will show more clearly some of the phenomena and mechanisms that are involved in these flows.  The data generated by the numerical computations will be analyzed using biologically motivated ``neural'' feature detectors which provide low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data sets.  Visualization techniques based on preprocessing the data using neural networks, self organizing feature maps, in addition to the more standard Karhunen-Loeve decomposition will be investigated.  This emphasis on pattern analysis will be directed towards validation of the model by directly comparing large and medium-scale coherent structures which appear both in the numerical simulator and laboratory experiments.    In many areas involving development and manufacturing, numerical simulation is becoming an integral part of the development and manufacturing processes. There has been a longstanding popular argument that one might  ``throw away the wind tunnels,.. and perform all of the experiments on the comp uter.''  However, there have not been many studies which  clearly demonstrate to what extent computer simulations can replace or augment information obtained experimentally.  Large computer codes are used to explain and predict complex phenomena (say in weather forecasting) that, due to the cost of running these codes, have never been carefully validated.  The instabilities and flow patterns exhibited by the Taylor-Couette flow have challenged experimenters and theorists for many years.  The results that have been obtained include a rich assortment of complex flow regimes encountered during the eventual transition to turbulence. Hence, the Taylor-Couette problem is an excellent candidate to assess how well a computer model can perform physical experiments.  The Taylor-Couette problem is such that the results are sufficiently complex to require an accurate numerical model, an efficient solver and a large number of grid points.  Because of these aspects of the problem, the results will illustrate how well a computer model can simulate a physical problem over a broad range of parameters, will indicate what numerical efficiencies are possible on large problems and will clearly illustrate many of the problems associated with long term numerical simulations that produce large amounts of data."

The first continues work on numerical  methods for the motion of inviscid fluid interfaces, such as water  waves.  In previous work, convergent methods of boundary integral  type have been developed, using a new approach for the analysis of  fluid interfaces.  In this project, methods of more general  applicability are designed that still maintain full numerical  stability.  In a related project, improved analytical understanding  is sought for existence and regularity in exact solutions of the  fully nonlinear equations of water waves.  Instabilities in exact  vortex rings with swirl are studied, comparing predictions from a  short-wave asymptotic analysis with direct simulation using vortex  methods, in which computational elements of vorticity move with  the flow.  These two very different approaches should allow  detailed treatment of this test case for time-dependent, inviscid  three-dimensional flow.  Finally, the approximation of the  Navier-Stokes equations of viscous flow by fractional time steps  are investigated, in which inviscid flow alternates with linear  viscosity, and artificial boundary layers are generated.       Fluid flow is important in diverse applications, including  aircraft design, industrial processes, and the motion of the  oceans and atmosphere.  Often quantitative prediction is difficult  because of the development of small scales in the flows -- for  instance, local disturbances in the general behavior of the flows.  One role for mathematical analysis is the design of improved  numerical methods.  For complicated equations, such as those of  inviscid fluid interfaces, numerical instabilities have been  difficult to avoid.  Carefully designed methods, such as those  developed here, could be used for better predictions of the  behavior of water waves.  Basic analytical understanding of  solutions is often closely related to the analysis of numerical  approximations.  The com parison of two methods for predicting  instabilities in fluid flow, short-wave analysis and direct  simulation by vortex methods, should help to establish the realm  of validity of each approach.  The use of the two together for a  quantitative study of exact solutions, such as vortex rings with  swirl, is advantageous for better understanding of nonlinear  dynamics in realistic three-dimensional flow.  The fractional step  approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations replaces the full  evolution by two parts of more special character.  Some numerical  methods take advantage of this dual structure.  Better  understanding of such approximations, especially the boundary  behavior, could suggest more accurate versions of these numerical  schemes."

Best Regards, David  ==========================================================================  Solution-adaptive Grid Partitioning and Variable Ordering for PDEs  Alex Pothen and David E. Keyes   The proposers consider grid partitioning and variable ordering problems that come to the fore in the parallel computation of problems modeled by partial differential equations discretized on unstructured grids. Partitioning algorithms that maintain load balance among the processors while incurring low communication costs for distributed memory parallelism have been developed in earlier work.  Here solution-adaptive partitioning methods are proposed that strive, in addition, to attain good convergence rates in such data parallel contexts.  Communication volume per iteration may rise, but only modestly for moderate-granularity parallelism, while the more important number of message-startups per iteration should not be strongly affected. Solution-adaptive ordering methods are also proposed for the fast solution of the problems on the local partitions.  Two recently developed classes of partitioning and ordering algorithms that have proved to be successful in non-adaptive contexts will feature prominently in both the partitioning and ordering phases of this proposal.  One class consists of spectral algorithms, (i.e., algorithms that make use of an approximation to a certain eigenvector of a Laplacian matrix derived from the grid and the discretization sche me), while the second class includes multilevel algorithms.  Both algorithms will be generalized to the solution-adaptive context.  Many computational problems in science and engineering can be modeled by partial differential equations, and subsequently solved as a system of algebraic equations defined on an unstructured grid.  The most natural form of parallelism for such problems requires the original domain to be decomposed into subdomains, which are mapped whole on to individual processors.  Iterative domain decomposition algorithms fit naturally into this framework, wherein a solution is assembled from subproblems whose boundary conditions are set by transmitting a limited amount of information between nearest neighbors.  The partitioning and ordering methods proposed herein will be useful for solution methods of such domain decomposition type, which are designed with respect for the high communication-to-computation cost ratio in contemporary distributed-memory computers.  The key opportunity to be exploited in this work is that of synergistically joining two ideas that have matured separately, and are usually used as ``black boxes''-- partitioning and ordering based on sparsity structure only, and domain-blocked iteration based on understanding the physical dependencies reflected in the coefficients.  The software tools developed in this work will be demonstrated for ``grand challenge'' problems in application areas such as aerodynamics and geophysics."

Micchelli and  Yuesheng Xu Abstract:   It is proposed to construct wavelets on  finite domains and use them to solve boundary integral equations  which are reformulations of boundary value problems of partial  differential equations in the plane or space.  Traditional  methods employed to solve the boundary integral  equations are  Galerkin methods, collocation methods, and product integration  methods by using a standard basis of piecewise polynomials,  B-splines or trigonometric polynomials. These methods usually  lead to full matrices for the discrete equations, which are   computationally expensive. Wavelet bases provide an alternative  approach for  the possibility of improving these methods. They  often form better bases in  the space of piecewise polynomials or  other function classes in the sense that the coefficient matrices  of the linear or nonlinear systems obtained from these bases are  sparse and well-conditioned. This leads to numerically fast    algorithms that preserve the nice features that the traditional  methods  possess and at the same time improve upon them. The  proposed projects include constructing orthogonal wavelets,  pre-wavelets and  biorthogonal wavelets on finite domains in  multidimensional spaces using the matrix refinement equations,  designing decomposition and reconstruction algorithms in terms of  the matrices in the refinement equations, and developing   numerically fast algorithms for the boundary integral equations  using the wavelet bases constructed.     Partial differential  equations have long been used to mathematically model a  wide  variety of physical phenomena that occur in fluid flows,  electro-chemistry, stress analysis in materials and a host of  similar practical problems.  Transforming these partial  differential equations into boundary integral  equations gives  rise to problems that can be analyzed both  theoretically and  nu merically. Since the nonlinear equations arising are difficult  if not impossible to completely solve theoretically, a numerical  method to these problems is necessary. Wavelet bases provide an  alternative approach to classical methods and result in  mathematical problems for which numerically fast algorithms can  be obtained. This alternative wavelet method preserves most nice  features of traditional methods and in many instances gives  substantial improvements."

In general these  problems exhibit one of two distinct traits; either the solutions  take on the character of a free boundary problem where the unknown  boundary separates the phases, or the phases are finely  interspersed.  The former are modeled by degenerate parabolic  equations.  While the theory for these equations is well developed,  this is not the case with the discrete theory for their numerical  approximation.  For example, the investigator in collaboration with  J. Rulla has only recently established optimal rates of  convergence of the classical Stefan problem in a dual Sobolev  space; however, rates of convergence of the energy in the space of  integrable functions is still an open question.  Even less is known  about approximations of the mean curvature equation that arises,  for example, when the interface between the phases has more  structure.  The investigator also studies the approximation of  problems that exhibit fine phase mixtures.  Because these problems  involve structures that are much finer than any feasible mesh, the  investigator utilizes the recent theory of Young measures to  characterize the fine scale behavior.  This theory shows that the  fine scale behavior is far from random and in many cases can be  characterized by a the (macroscopic) Young measure.  The  investigator studies and analyzes algorithms that approximate the  Young measure.       In this project, the investigator develops efficient ways to  computationally model problems arising in the environmental and  material sciences.  One interesting feature of these problems is  that they often exhibit interfaces where different materials meet.  For example, when modeling the spread of pollutants, the single  most important quantity is the location and motion of the  interface between the pollutant and the clean environment.  Problems in the material sciences often involve very fine scal e  phenomena involving interfaces between different phases of the  same material.  This phenomenon is ubiquitous, being observable,  for example, in most metals.  However, the fine scales also present  many obstacles when analyzing such materials.  The investigator  develops the computational tools to circumvent these problems,  providing another step towards the automation of the design and  development of modern (and traditional) materials."

It combines in a single program the support of quality research and education in the broadest sense and the full participating of those traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places on the development of full, balanced academic careers that include both research and education.  The research will focus on the development of computational techniques for dendritic solidification in three dimensions using two methods.  The first method is implementation of adaptive mesh refinement to simulate the phase field model of dendritic growth, which models the solid/liquid interface by a  thinviscous layer.  In addition to the coding complexity, the central issues are construction of stable and accurate time discretization formulas, specification of accurate criteria to guide the automatic refinement strategy, and possible permiting the interface thickness to depend on local velocity.  The second, more speculative, method is a lattice-based variational method, using an Ising-type model and simulated annealing to minimize a combination of bulk and surface energy at each time step.  The first approach is expected to be effective at large undercoolings or supersaturations, where kinetic effects are important; the second approach will be more efficient at small undercoolings, near local equilibrium.    The overall purpose of this project is to develop effective computational tools for predicting and controlling the microstructure  which develops almost every time a metal or other substance solidifies  from its melt, that is, in almost every casting process from horseshoes to jet turbine blades.  The details of this microstructure have a tremendous influence on the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the resulting material piece; if the processes which produce them could be understood and controlled, then dramatic improvements might be possible.  The teaching side of this project is construction of an applied mathematics component for the University of Chicago's SESAME program, which teaches mathematics to elementary teachers from the Chicago Public Schools.

In  preliminary decoding studies it has been found that the temporal  properties of long-term potentiation naturally cause a population  of neurons to predict a coded quantity after training.  This  suggests a novel mechanism for learning and generating sequences  of motor actions that is explored.       Reaching for an object, turning toward a visual or auditory  cue, and a variety of other tasks require motor responses that are  accurately guided by sensory information.  In addition, previous  experience can play an important role in shaping these responses.  Experiments have provided important information about how sensory  information is represented in the brain and how experience can  modify neural circuits.  Mathematical decoding techniques allow us  to relate motor responses, such as reaching, to the activity of  neurons in the motor cortex of the brain.  The goal of the project  is to construct a theoretical framework, based on these data, for  understanding sensory-guid ed motor tasks, including mechanisms for  learning and generating accurate responses and modifying them on  the basis of experience.  This work should provide new insights  into how we generate basic motor behaviors and may have  interesting applications to robotics."

While  these techniques are obviously successful, they have shortcomings;  one can only approximate orbits over finite time intervals and  these methods have difficulty detecting orbits which are unstable  in the sense of dynamics.  These unstable orbits can be extremely  important since they define the boundaries of basins of  attraction, and hence, determine the global dynamics of the  system.  In addition, there are many problems where the objects of  interest are precisely the unstable bounded orbits, e.g. traveling  waves.  In the second case, one needs to know a priori what types  of solutions should be looked for and in what regions of phase  space one should look for the solutions.  The investigator develops  complimentary methods for studying the global dynamics of ordinary  differential equations.  The theoretical basis for the project is  Conley's theory of dynamical systems.  The work is separated into  four tasks. (1) Given as an input an ordinary differential  equation and a region in phase space, develop efficient numerical  schemes to determine isolating neighborhoods and compute their  Conley indices. (2) Given a potential isolating neighborhood,  develop more efficient mechanisms for obtaining computer assisted  proofs to verify that the neighborhood is an isolating  neighborhood and to rigorously compute the Conley index of the  associated isolated invariant set. (3) Extend the abstract Conley  index theory, which allows one to draw conclusions concerning the  structure of the dynamics from knowledge of the index and the  isolating neighborhood. (4) Apply these techniques to ordinary  differential equations  for which the global dynamics is poorly  understood.  It should be emphasized that the end goal of these  four steps is to obtain a rough understanding of the global  dynamics of the ordinary differential equation.  In particular,  these procedures provide information about both the type and  structure of dynamics that occur, and the region of phase space in  which these dynamics take place.  A finer understanding of these  dynamics can then be more efficiently investigated using the more  classical methods mentioned at the beginning.       It is clear that most phenomena, whether physical, chemical  or biological in nature, need to be described by nonlinear models.  Thus, to describe the dynamics of these phenomena one is required  to solve problems in global analysis.  In practice, this usually  requires numerical computations, since our theoretical analytic  techniques are not yet adequate.  With the advent of high  performance computing considerable progress has been made in  understanding the behavior of a wide variety of nonlinear  dynamical systems.  However, there are many drawbacks to most  current numerical and computational techniques at our disposal.  This project is aimed at two of them.  The first arises from the  fact that the classical numerical techniques often provide bad  approximations over long time intervals (i.e. they are unreliable  for long range predictions) and also they have difficulty  detecting unstable dynamic structures (these unstable structures  determine the path by which the object being modelled reaches its  asymptotic state).  The second problem involves difficulty in  understanding the tremendous amounts of numerical data which the  computers are capable of generating.  Typically this problem is  overcome by graphically displaying the data.  Unfortunately, most  models involve more than three variables, and hence visualizing  the numerical results becomes a difficult task.  This project  develops theoretical techniques and efficient numerical methods  for  describing the global dynamics arising from nonlinear ordinary  differential equations, and then applies these techniques to a  wide range of biological and physical problems.  The theoretical  aspect involves translating algebraic information into dynamics  and the numerical side involves computing these algebraic  invariants by approximating the differential equations.  The  algebraic information works equally well for stable or unstable  dynamics and, of course, being algebraic, does not need to be  visualized in order to be understood."

Both the theory and the   practice of constructing a physical model, described mathematically in the form of a   matrix, from prescribed spectral data will be investigated.  This proposal continues and   extends previous studies.  In particular, a dynamical system for each inverse eigenvalue   problem will be formulated to ensure that a specific task is taking place continuously.  The   dynamics will then be explored using computer experiments, high resolution graphics and   symbolic manipulation, in conjunction with analysis. This study should lead to fundamental   advances in the understanding of inverse eigenvalue problems.

Inverse eigenvalue problems arise in many important applications, including control   design, vibration isolation, system identification, exploration and remote sensing, and   signal processing.  A significant common phenomenon in all these areas of application is   that the physical parameter of a certain system is to be reconstructed from knowledge or   expectation of its dynamical behavior, in particular its natural frequencies and/or normal   modes.  The advances obtained from this proposed work will contribute to the   understanding of issues that arise in several strategic areas, particularly in the areas of   global change, manufacturing, transportation, and environmental monitoring."

The aim of the  project is to develop and analyze new fast algorithms for  computing an estimate of an original image from a degraded image  that has been subjected to noise and blur.  Depending on the point  of view, two philosophically different approaches to image  restoration result: i) in algebraic restoration one views the  problem as a linear, possibly ill-conditioned, system of  equations, and ii) in stochastic restoration one regards it as a  problem of estimating a vector under random disturbances.  The  project develops numerical methods for both approaches.  Either  approach yields linear systems of equations that have a structure  that can be used in the development and analysis of efficient  algorithms for image restoration.  The structure depends on the  assumptions made on the image and the noise.  The matrices in these  systems are typically quite large; orders of a million are common.  The computational work, even with efficient methods, is therefore  quite demanding.  Because many applications require real-time image  restoration, the development of algorithms for parallel computers  is important.  The proposed research focuses on the development of  iterative methods that lend themselves well to implementation on  multiprocessors.       The central problem of image restoration is the estimation of  the original image, given a version of the image degraded by noise  and blur.  When the image is of a star observed from earth, the  blur may be due to the atmosphere and the noise can stem from  transmission of the signal.  Several different approaches to image  restoration are available.  They all give rise to large systems of  equations; a million equations are common.  The system of equations  has a structure, which depends on the assumptions made on the  image and on the statistical properties of the noise.  The purpose  of the project is to develop new  algorithms for the restoration of  images.  These algorithms are designed so that they use the  structure of the system of equations in order to reduce the  computational work.  They are moreover suitable for use on parallel  computers.  The latter is important due to the large amount of  computations required."

Many physical problems are most naturally initially described by a DAE.  DAEs arise in a variety of  physical problems including flight control, robotics, chemical process control, and contact or  constrained problems in mechanics.  In addition, DAEs occur in the solution of partial differential  equations by the method of lines and in many circuit models. Computer generated mathematical models  for physical processes are often DAEs.  Existing numerical codes, while very useful, require special  problem structure and do not handle many problems of interest.  In addition, many of these methods  require the  potential user not only to recognize the mathematical structure of the problem, but also  to explicitly exploit this structure.   This restricts both the number of users and the complexity of  the problems  that can be solved. This project will develop numerical methods for general  nonlinear  DAEs. Theoretical analysis, computational   implementation, and applications will all be  considered.  The long range goal of the proposed research is for scientists and engineers to be able to work  directly with the original implicit model thus reducing design and simulation time as well as  facilitating the consideration of more complex problems.  The building of physical prototypes is  time  consuming, expensive, and restricts the number of ideas that can be tried out.  Computer simulation is  becoming increasingly essential for both design and evaluation.  In  many areas of technology, the  equations that the computer must solve are most easily set up as a mixture of differential and  algebraic equations or a DAE.  DAEs are not the kinds of equations that classical numerical methods  and mathematical theory were designed for.  Converting a DAE into another type of mathematical problem is often difficult and time consuming.  Sometimes this conversion requires considering a simpler  mathematical equation which does not do as good a job of predicting what the real physical system will  do.  This has led to a world wide effort to develop numerical methods for solving DAEs.  There have  been notable successes and some of this effort has resulted in software, such as DASSL, that is used  in many industries and laboratories.  However, many important classes of DAEs are still difficult, or  impossible, to solve directly with existing software.  This project will develop numerical methods  that can be used to solve important additional types of DAEs.  While DAEs arise in many areas, this  project will focus on constrained mechanical systems including the simulation and control of robotic  manipulators, simulation and control of vehicular systems, and the simulation, control, and optimization of chemical manufacturing processes."

In such cases, a  study of algorithms for the limiting infinite-dimensional programs can predict the  behavior of standard computational schemes that are actually implemented in  approximating finite-dimensional spaces, and can also suggest new algorithms that  have no counterparts in the standard methodology for finite-dimensional  mathematical programs. In particular, recent studies have shown that standard  nonlinear programming algorithms are best suited to optimal control problems with  Hamiltonians that are uniformly convex in the control input vector, while other  optimal control problems may require strong variation methods based on the  inherently infinite-dimensional necessary condition of Pontryagin. The proposed  investigation has the following immediate objectives: (i) to establish the  convergence properties of Newtonian projection methods in Chebychev norm  neighborhoods and root-mean-square neighborhoods of control functions that  satisfy recently developed local optimality sufficient conditions for nonconvex  nonquadratic constrained input regulator problems; (ii) to extend the analysis in (i)  to hybrid algorithms that employ Newtonian projection and Lagrangian  augmentation techniques for regulator problems with control variable and state  variable constraints; (iii) to establish the convergence properties of strong variation  methods in root-mean-square neighborhoods of control functions satisfying sharp  local optimality sufficient conditions in the root-mean-square norm for optimal  control problems with Hamiltonians that are not convex in the control input vector;  (iv) to corroborate the predictions of the infinite dimensional convergence analyses  in (i)--(iii) for approximate finite dimensional computations on fixed and nested  grids.     Optimal control problems arise in aircraft and spacecraft trajectory calcula tions,  nuclear and chemical reactor control, structural and aerodynamic design,  management of ecological systems, and many other applications. In the generic  optimal control problem, a large number of control variables (forces, voltages,  temperatures, etc.) are chosen at various points in time and space to bring some  physical system into a desired state, and to accomplish this at the lowest possible  cost (manuever duration, fuel or power consumption, etc.). Control and state  variable values are also typically constrained by hardware or safety considerations,  and state transitions are often governed by complicated systems of ordinary or  partial differential equations. The associated optimization task is therefore  demanding, and requires algorithms that effectively exploit control problem  structure in the computation of their successive approximations, and also exhibit  good global and local convergence characteristics for the problems in question. In  broad terms, the goal of the proposed investigation is to understand which  algorithm types are most effective for a given problem structure in the context of  optimal control.  ***"

The equations of linear   elasticity are of special importance and interest.  The significance of a-  posteriori error estimates for these problems is balanced by the need for   deeper a-priori error estimates.  The difficulty in obtaining a-priori error   estimates stems from the explicit appearance of the divergence operator in   these problems.  Similar difficulties appear in the study of numerical   methods for the Stokes equations.      There are many important practical problems which arise in fluid flow and   elasticity which lead to problems which must be solved on the computer.    The solutions of these problems are then approximations to solutions of   elliptic boundary value problems.  Most of the research in this area has   emphasized finding a computer problem whose solution is indeed a very   good approximation to the solution of the elliptic problem.  Having done   that, one must still find efficient and relatively cheap methods to solve the   computer problem.  This last, very practical problem, is the focus of the   research in this project."

Efficient numerical computations of 3-D incompressible flow are currently far behind the practical needs. Indeed, even some very basic issues in formulating a numerical method are unsettled whenever boundaries are present, such as the correct numerical boundary conditions for the vorticity and efficient 3-D formulation.  Some connections between different types of vorticity boundary formulations, such as local via global and the MAC scheme via Thom's formula, have already been found by this investigator and his collaborator Weinan E.  With explicit treatment of the vorticity term and high-order (essentially) compact difference approach, they recently introduced a very efficient fourth order scheme in vorticity-stream function (vector) formulation, together with a complete convergence theory. The investigator proposes to continue developing efficient and accurate numerical methods for the three dimensional computation using both the vorticity-stream function and vorticity-velocity formulations.  The investigator also plans to conduct a systematic study of statistical behavior and coherent structure of some 2-D and 3-D wall-bounded turbulence flows such as the driven cavity flow, backward-facing step flow, etc.  and carry out a detailed numerical comparison with the homogeneous isotropic turbulence simulations. Extensive work has been done on direct simulation of isotropic turbulence in wall-free flows, much less work has involved wall-bounded turbulence.  However, most turbulence is generated at the walls.    Understanding turbulent flows is a grand challenge comp arable to other prominent scientific problems such as the large-scale structure of the universe and the nature of subatomic particles. In contrast to many of the other grand challenges, progress on the basic theory of turbulence translates nearly immediately into a wide range of engineering applications and technological advances that affect many aspects of everyday life. Direct numerical simulation for Navier-Stokes equation is an effective tool that complements experimental and theoretical investigation of turbulence.  The investigator proposes to study two problems in the field: (1) Developing efficient, robust and reliable numerical methods for viscous incompressible flows in domains with solid boundaries, especially in the cases with large Reynolds number. (2) Using these methods to study statistical behavior and coherent structure of two and three dimensional wall-bounded turbulence via direct numerical simulations."

Typically, in such a problem one uses certain given  information about the solution of a partial differential equation  to compute one or more of the coefficients in the equation.  Such  problems are invariably ill-posed (sometimes badly so) and, to  make matters worse, in processing the data in most practical  applications, one must contend not only with measurement error but  sometimes also with the fact that the readings may only be taken  at a rather sparse collection of measurement points.  In  consequence, in many areas, it is well documented that algorithms  for parameter identification that are sufficiently reliable to  engender widespread practical use are not yet available.  In this  project the investigator develops a new approach to a broad class  of parameter identification problems.  At the core of the approach  is the Dirichlet principle for elliptic boundary value problems,  that the solution may be obtained by the minimization of a certain  energy functional; that the same energy functional can also be  used to compute coefficients in the elliptic equation, if an  appropriate constrained minimization is employed, is the key  observation.  Recent experiments have shown that the same numerical  stability that is associated with the Dirichlet principle approach  to finding solutions is also present in the constrained  minimization, and furthermore the method appears to be quite  robust in the presence of noise in the data.  The class of  parameter identification problems to which the approach is  applicable is, roughly speaking, those that involve elliptic  equations that may be solved by means of a Dirichlet principle; as  is well known, this is a large class, having considerable  practical significance.  The bulk of the work in the project  involves applying these ideas to producing working algorithms for  the solution of the aquifer transmissivity problem (a crucial step  in the modeling of under ground water systems) and the problem of  imaging inside the human body with electrical impedance  tomography.       Inverse problems dealing with parameter identification in the  presence of data error are of fundamental practical importance in  a number of areas, including, but by no means limited to, medical  and industrial imaging, high energy physics, geophysics, and  hydrology.  Such problems are mathematically ill-posed in the sense  that small variations in the data (caused by measurement error for  example) can cause uncontrollably large errors to appear in the  calculated parameters.  In this proposal a new optimization  approach to a broad class of parameter identification problems is  presented that already shows significant promise for handling the  moderately ill-posed problems in this class, and there are  indications that such an approach may help solve the most  egregiously ill-posed examples.  The project concentrates on two  test cases, the aquifer transmissivity problem (a necessary and  crucial step in monitoring the flow of contaminants in underground  water systems, for example) and the problem of (noninvasive and  nondestructive) imaging inside the human body using electrical  impedance tomography.  If suitably effective algorithms can be  developed with these ideas in the test cases, similar algorithms  should be possible for a wide range of related applications in the  areas outlined above, and elsewhere."

The central thrust of the research addresses real-life, large-scale mixed-inter programming problems arising from important industrial application areas, such as manufacturing, telecommunications, and distribution.  These problems are of vast importance towards the nation s present and future economic and technological development.  The problems are also extremely intractable, both from the viewpoint of practical computation, as well as in terms of theoretical understanding, and they will only become larger and more difficult in future applications.  The computational and methodological technology for solving integer programming models has made steady advances over the last thirty years, often following improvements in computing machinery as much as new theoretical insights.  We are now at the starting point of a major quantum improvement in the technology.  Not only are there several new and promising methodological venues available, but we are witnessin g a revolution in the computing world, in particular involving parallel computing and operating systems, with profound implications for science and engineering.  It is almost certain that within a few years all computers will have multiple CPUs, and that all major scientific and engineering computing will be done on clusters of multiple-CPU machines.  As supercomputing becomes redefined, a push to parallelize algorithms is starting now, and the end result will be software of extraordinary complexity by today s standards.  However, it is fair to say that the field of parallel integer programming is, at best, in its infancy.  The research seeks to propel computational integer programming into the realm of parallel computing, with the objective of effectively handling difficult real-world problems.  The objective will require a multidisciplinary approach.  Our work will seek to extend and develop solution methodologies for integer programming, in particular involving cutting planes, column generation, and branch-and-cut techniques.  This will be integrated with computational theory techniques, especially the design of efficient data structures for parallel integer programming.  Finally, there will be a large component of software engineering, necessary for the implementation of efficient parallel programs.     This work combines the scientific and computational resources of three participating  organizations, Columbia University, Cornell University, and the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, to create a collaborative research environment to attain the goals outlined above. Among the many important advantages of such a close relationship between university  computing research groups and that of a major hardware producer is the focus on practical ends provided by the industrial component.

It involves the development and application of high order finite differences and finite element schemes as well as Spectral methods. The methods to be developed and applied are suitable for problems in several space dimensions with complicated geometries. A major consideration in developing and assessing high order methods for long term integrations is their scalability. Based on the experience gained already in parallelizing ENO codes, a further effort to parallelize spectral and finite element based ENO codes is proposed. The research has two components, theory and applications, those components are linked together.  The theory is motivated by the type of applications under investigation and the applications use the theoretical developments.  It has been shown that in order to numerically simulate complicated flows that change in time, high order methods are necessary. However those methods, because of their high accuracy, are less robust. The proposed research deals with the issue of the successful implementations of high order methods.  This involved theoretical issues (as solving the 100 years old Gibbs Phenomenon) as well as more applied issues. On the applied side, the problem of mixing enhancement by interactions of Shock waves and hydrogen jets will be studied. This entails the simulation of an air shock passing through an hydrogen jet in high Mach numbers. High order methods are mandatory here since the process of interest is the mixing and combustion inside the jets. The current codes, Spectral and ENO are to be modified to handle more general cases.  Parallel versions of ENO and spectral methods are being applied now and will be further modified."

From the sequence, simple geometric constraints are found on all interpolating curves that minimize oscillations subject to the general interpolation constraints and the associated theory allows for the removal of redundant constraints.  Computer algorithms incorporating the geometric constraints are used to find entire families of piecewise rational curves from which particular curves are selected subject to additional application specific constraints.   The study is motivated by applications that involve the design of paths along which objects are to move, such as robotics and animation. In these applications it is desirable to create motions that are smooth and free from unnecessary oscillations. This is important, for example, to reduce the energy used in controlling robots or to create accurate animations of images from measurements such as those taken to produce medical imaging data. For such applications, minimizing the number of unnecessary oscillations is accomplished by imposing the appropriate mathematical properties on a higher dimensional curve that governs the changes in certain important variables that dictate the motion. Algorithms for the automatic computer generation of these oscillation free higher dimensional curves can be used as  a basis for many different applications."

The  term spectral method as used here includes not only the  traditional applications involving differential equations, but  also the computation of integral transforms and special  functions.  The central theme is the optimization of the accuracy  of such expansion methods by judicious parameter selection.  This is accomplished either through theoretical asymptotic  analysis, or via numerical algorithms where the analytical  approach falls short.  Target applications include scattering  problems, the computation of integral transforms, and nonlinear  waves.    The first part of the project involves, among other things, the  computer solution of certain fundamental problems arising in  quantum mechanics.  The second part is devoted to the computation  of integral transforms.   These formulas arise ubiquitously in  science, in areas such as viscoplasticity, geophysics, and shock  waves in diatomic chains.  In industrial applications these  transforms can seldom be worked out by hand and efficient  computer codes are required for their computation.  Through the use of mathematical analysis the investigator aims to  optimize the efficiency of such codes.  The third part of the  project involves the computer simulation of waves arising in  areas such as laser optics and water.  The challenge here is to  ensure that the computer output is a true reflection of the  actual physics of the problem.  The project is expected to have an impact not only in numerical  mathematics, but also in various branches of technology and  engineering such as high-performance computing, materials  science, and optical science and engineering."

One common approach to resolving these problems is to  split the fast and slow dynamics into separate subproblems.  The  fast motions are essentially independent of depth, and it is  natural to try to model these motions with a two-dimensional  system of equations.  The slow motions would then be modeled with a  three-dimensional system.  However, if the splitting is inexact,  then the equations that supposedly model the slow motions may  actually admit fast motions, to some degree.  There then arises the  possibility that these fast motions might cause numerical  instabilities in the computational algorithm.  The main goal of  this project is to develop a stable, efficient, and accurate  operator splitting for the governing equations.  Secondary goals  are to develop open boundary conditions for limited-area models  and to examine higher-order difference methods for spatial  discretizations.       One of the major scientific challenges of the present day is  to obtain high-resolution computer simulations of global ocean  circulation over periods of many years.  Such simulations are of  great interest because the ocean is a crucial component of the  earth's climate system, so studies of possible global change must  include a careful examination of the role of the ocean.  For  example, the ocean has a great capacity to transport heat energy;  part of this transport is due to bulk transport by major current  systems, and part is due to mixing caused by smaller-scale eddies  that are shed from currents.  Comprehensive data on these processes  are difficult to collect, and it appears that an accurate   understanding of the earth's climate system will require numerical  simulations based on an eddy-resolving model of the general  circulation of the ocean.  Such simulations will present great  computational demands.  The goal of this project is to contribute  to the development of suitable numerical methods for these  computations.  This work is being performed in collaboration with  members of the physical oceanography modeling group in the College  of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Oregon State University."

McLaughlin and the investigator have shown that  the potential in a Schroedinger equation on a rectangular domain  can be uniquely determined (up to an additive constant) by the  nodal lines, i.e. the set of points where the eigenfunctions  vanish.  The present proof assumes that the potential is constant  near the boundaries of the rectangle.  This assumption excludes a  large class of potentials and one goal is to remove this  restrictive assumption.  In the field of Fluid Mechanics Buttke has  recently proposed a very interesting method for solving Euler's  equations for two and three dimensional flows.  Using a new  interpretation of the computed velocity kernels, the investigator  aims to establish the convergence of the method.       The properties of elastic materials (such as beams or plates)  can be described by elastic parameters.  In many problems the  elastic parameters are not available for direct observation.  For  example, one cannot see on the surface of the earth that the  density changes at the depth of two miles due to the presence of  oil.  Similarly, a crack deep inside a piece of metal may not be  observable on the outside.  In such cases one may probe the  material by sending waves through it, and study either the  reflections of the waves or the vibrations of the material.  One  important goal of the theory of inverse problems is to show that  the property of the elastic material can be inferred from the data  thus observed, and to develop efficient algorithms for estimating  the material properties.  In engineering, meteorology, and medicine  it is important to be able to compute the movement of a fluid  accurately.  Examples are: (1) water running through pipes, (2) the  movement of air in weather prediction, and (3) the flow of blood  through an artificial heart.  At present calculations of  two-dimensional flows are done routinely, but it is still a  challenge to calculate the mo vement of water in three dimensions,  especially when the water is turbulent.  It is a question of having  sufficiently powerful computers, and a very efficient way of  describing the flows.  The work of the investigator is focused on  numerical methods that are specially suited for studying the  movements of very complicated flows."

The unifying theme  is the  unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method: its implementation, data  structures,  and applicability to difficult sparse matrix problems in  semiconductor device  and process simulation.  The unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal  method  encompasses both the multifrontal technique and an approximate  degree update  algorithm that is much faster (asymptotically and in practice)  than computing  the true degrees.  Although this method uses upper bounds, the  ordering quality  for both the unsymmetric (Markowitz cost) and symmetric (minimum  degree)  algorithms does not suffer.  The investigator and his colleagues  develop parallel factorization and  ordering algorithms based on these approaches.  They also develop  parallel memory allocators (a fast-fits algorithm), a dynamic  task graph  (dynamic, since the pivot ordering determines the task dag), the  development of  both pessimistic and optimistic synchronization methods for  frontal matrix  ``collision'' in the combined uni/multifrontal approach, and  other distributed  data structures (such as a distributed priority queue for finding  pivots of  low approximate degree) required for these algorithms.  The  algorithms and  data structures they develop are applied to semiconductor device  and process simulation.  This is a challenging application,  placing a burden  not only on the numerical factorization, but on the symbolic  ``overhead'' as  well.   The problems in this domain are based on irregular,  adaptive grids  (both 2D and 3D).  Both direct methods and iterative methods are  used.  The  iterative method used is a preconditioned biconjugate gradient  algorithm, with  an incomplete LU factorization as the preconditioner.  The  investigators develop and  employ an incomplete multifrontal factorization algorithm, and a  multifrontal-based approach for computing the sparse inverse for  use as a prec onditioner.    The parallel methods the investigators develop are widely  applicable to many  computationally intensive problems, in particular the modeling of  complex physical phenomena:  structural stress and fluid-flow in  and around the  space shuttle, thunderstorms and tornados, circuits and  semiconductor devices,  the mixing and combustion of complex turbulent reacting flows,  the flow of oil  in a reservoir, the optimal distillation of gas and petroleum  products, and so  on.  Parallel sparse matrix algorithms and the data structures  they require can  help to solve these problems.  Where will a tornado hit?  How  fast can you  make a CPU chip run?  How can automobile emissions be reduced and  gas  efficiency be increased at the same time?  How do we get more gas  out of the  same amount of crude oil, and how do we get more crude oil out of  an oil  reservoir?  Answering these questions accurately requires a great  deal of  computation - and much of that computation involves large, sparse  matrices.  High-speed computation is required - it does no good to predict  where a  tornado will hit after it has already passed by and done its  destruction.  Thus the need for parallel algorithms and data structures.  The  methods  the investigators develop are made widely available to  researchers in these and other  areas.  To ensure that the methods are in fact useful for ``real  world''  problems, they are incorporated into a widely-used semiconductor  simulation  package, the Florida Object-Oriented Device/Process Simulator  (FLOODS/FLOOPS).  FLOODS/FLOOPS is in use in dozens of companies and universities,  and its  methods form the basis of many commercial semiconductor  simulation packages."

The state vector often approaches a low-dimensional invariant manifold that determines the dynamical behavior, except for an initial transient.  The investigator develops and analyszes methods for the  direct numerical computation of such invariant manifolds in a path-following process.  Also, we studies how to detect and classify potential bifurcations.  So far, well-developed algorithms for path following and for detection of bifurcations exist only when the invariant manifold is a fixed point or a periodic orbit.  The next interesting cases are branches of invariant 2-tori, corresponding typically to quasiperiodic motion with two frequencies.  In previous work the investigator and his collaborators have developed a reliable code to compute such  branches of 2-tori, but the numerical study of their bifurcations has just begun.  This project extends the previous work in several directions, the most important being the following.  First, indicators are added to the code that can tell if a bifurcation is possible, and -- ideally -- can tell the nature of the bifurcation.  Second, to represent the invariant manifold, local charts are used instead of one global chart.  This extension makes local mesh refinement practical and greatly enhances the performance and applicability of the existent code.                  During the last four centuries scientists have developed equations to determine the time evolution of a great variety of systems.  Newton wrote down the equations for planetary motion.  Euler, Navier, and Stokes developed equations to predict the flow of water and other fluids.  The equations governing meteorology, oceanography, or the phase changes of materials were developed  more recently.  Though the equations determine the evolution in principle, supercomputers are usually necessary to actually evaluate the predictions.  The reason is, of course, the great complexity of th e processes involved.  In fact, even the fastest computers are often insufficient for a full modeling.  Then it is necessary to ask for sensible simplifications.  These are possible if the state vector (which describes the state of the system at a given instant of time) settles to a low-dimensional object in state space as time progresses.  It is one aim of the proposed research to understand when such a behavior occurs.  There are many  known examples, ranging from applied mechanics to chemistry to material sciences.  Another aim is the direct numerical computation of the low-dimensional geometric object that is approached by the state vector.  The project helps understand dynamical systems better.  In turn, this leads to better algorithms for predicting evolutions and makes a wider range of processes and phenomena amenable to modeling by supercomputers."

In  particular, methods are developed for the efficient computation  of  stability information and global error estimation for large  systems of ordinary differential equations.  The research is  focused in two areas.  The first area is to determine methods for  accurately computing Lyapunov exponents and related quantities.  This includes analysis of methods and their errors and the  development of robust software to determine not only the Lyapunov  exponents but also an estimate of the error in their computation.  The second area is in the study of backward and shadowing error  analysis as a means for characterizing global error when solving  nonlinear differential equations numerically.  The investigator  applies these concepts to discrete in space, continuous in time  difderential equations that arise in the biological and physical  sciences.  The ultimate goal of this project is to analyze,  develop  and implement algorithms for the long-time, large-scale  computation of approximate trajectories for systems of lattice  differential equations.  While computing trajectories the codes  simultaneously obtain global error estimates and finite time  Lyapunov exponents or kinematic eigenvalues and the associated  growth/decay directions.  This research is expected to yield  contributions in the areas of dynamical systems, numerical  analysis and applied modeling.       The goal of this project is to provide improved accuracy in  simulations of models corresponding to large scale physical and  biological processes.  With more accurate simulations these  models  may be studied in greater detail and this should lead to  improvements in the models.  Because of the large scale nature of  the models the investigator employs distributed and parallel  computing environments.  The techniques to be used to increase  the  accuracy of the simulations rely on mathematical techniques  in  dynamical systems and numerical analysis.  In particular, the  investigator develops techniques that attempt to isolate the  potential for error.  He is particularly interested in  determining  the directions in which approximate solutions, obtained during  simulations, expand and contract.  Additionally, he wishes to  determine the rate at which this contraction and expansion takes  place.  This allows to determine which directions in the  approximate solution are susceptible to error growth (i.e. the  directions corresponding to expansion) and which directions are  less susceptible to error growth (i.e. the contracting  directions).  Ultimately, the contraction and expansion  information  is to be incorporated into the simulation software.  This  information is used to control the error in the simulation and  estimate the final error in the approximate solution.  The  methods  are aimed at showing that near the approximate solution there  exists an exact physical solution.  This may be an exact solution  of a slightly different model or an exact solution for the model  being studied but starting from a slightly different sample."

In order to obtain any practical solutions for crack propagation, the Finite Element Method (FEM) requires use of either graded discretizations (very small elements near the crack front, larger elements elsewhere) or special singular basis functions. The graded discretizations make the computation very expensive, while singular basis functions destroy the nice band structure of the FEM. Thus, the standard FEM is impractical for accurate numerical simulation of 3-D crack propagation. The accuracy of the FE solution depends on the regularity of the true solution. The investigator studies a new method, called Method of Auxiliary Mapping (MAM), to deal with three-dimensional singularities: vertex, edge, and edge-vertex. To remove the ineffectiveness of the FEM in the presence of singularities, MAM transforms a region where the stress functions are singular to a region where the transformed stress functions are of higher regularity. The investigator also studies three auxiliary mappings for these purposes. The annual cost of fracture-related damage in the United States (human injury and loss of life aside) has been estimated at more than $10 billion. Metal fatigue has been cited as the probable cause of several recent airline accidents, and the airworthiness of aging fleets is a national concern. Material failures are a major concern for other large engineering structures (ships, bridges, nuclear power plants, hydroelectric dams, and so on). Thus, for effective inspection and preventive maintenance programs, an accurate fracture analysis is demanded. However, because of the complicated geometry and nonlinearities that characterize fracture mechanics, the use of analytical techniques is very limited and in most cases not practical. Numerical methods seem to be the only feasible approach for such analysis. On the basis of very successful results o f the stress analysis for plane elasticity problems, the investigator studies a new method that should yield highly accurate numerical simulation of three-dimensional fracture analysis."
