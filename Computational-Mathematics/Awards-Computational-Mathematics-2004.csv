The Center target areas are nonlinear analysis, mechanics, scientific computation, and stochastic analysis.  Central issues in the CNA program are: modeling, analysis and computation to study the behavior of novel man-made materials, such as shape memory alloys, ferroelectric, electromagnetic and magnetostrictive (nano)materials, interfaces in heterogeneous materials, including polycrystals and foams, thin films, and more recently modeling and simulation areas of systemic and cellular biology.  Multiscale issues are prominent in the challenges of these areas.  Many of today's problems in advanced materials, for example, are related to the large range of length and time scales inherent in their fabrication and function. The multiscale aspect further implies that the applications range in dimension from bulk material through thin films and nanostructured materials. Bridging this multitude of scales requires examination of interconnected analytical and computational approaches, and this is where the CNA strength is realized.  Contributions of CNA members to the understanding of these issues are broadly recognized, and several methods standard in these fields nowadays were initiated by CNA researchers. CNA accomplishments in these arenas have led to participation in and the creation of projects with high institutional and cross-institutional impact, and including the CMU MRSEC (Materials Research Science and Engineering Center), an ITR, an NIH(pre-NPEBC) grant, a European network (RTN), and the Center for Computational Finance. This involvement is strongly exploited in the CNA itself by enhancing and broadening training opportunities for post-docs.<br/><br/>The Center for Nonlinear Analysis (CNA), founded in 1991 in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, is a center for research and advanced training in applied mathematics.  Central areas of activity concern:  the behavior of novel man-made materials, often referred to as 'smart materials,' the role of interfaces in the behavior of polycrystals and in foams, and a developing focus in cellular and systemic biology.  The Center seeks to identify and develop cutting-edge applications of mathematical sciences, to promote collaborations between applied mathematicians and allied scientists, and to respond to mathematical challenges in science and engineering.  Its special focus is materials and manufacturing, nanotechnology, and biotechnology. There are also environmental concerns. The Center will maintain its scientific leadership in these areas and its position as a worldwide asset in the training of young scientists at the interface between mathematics and science and engineering.  The CNA is more than the sum of its parts.  Combined expertise in nonlinear analysis and computation, the wealth of interdisciplinary activity and collaboration worldwide, and especially across Carnegie Mellon research units, renders this one of the strongest groups in applied mathematics in the US and on the globe.  The CNA serves as a vehicle to exploit these scientific resources with its training of postdoctoral fellows, its visitors program, summer schools and conferences.  Funding is dedicated exclusively to the promotion of these training missions.<br/><br/><br/>"

It will also develop black-box implementations for public distributions. In a previous work of PI, a method of this type has been developed for computing some extreme (smallest or largest) eigenvalue of the symmetric problems, which has also been implemented in a library-quality software called EIGIFP. The investigator proposes to develop a generalization of the existing method for computing interior eigenvalues for symmetric and nonsymmetric matrix problems. The resulting algorithms not only inherit desirable characteristics of the existing Krylov subspace methods, but also allow convergence acceleration through the use of a preconditioner (or approximate inverse) rather than the inverse of a shifted matrix.<br/><br/>Computations of interior eigenvalues for large matrices arise in many important applications such as electromagnetic field simulations in cavities for particle accelerator models and the Anderson model of localization in quantum mechanics. In spite of tremendous progresses made in developing iterative methods and software packages for large-scale eigenvalue problems, these applications pose a significant challenge. The proposed work shall advance the theory, algorithms and software toolboxes for the computation of interior eigenvalues.

The general FOSLS methodology is already a powerful tool for<br/>the solution of PDE-based problems in science and engineering. One of its<br/>main advantages is that it can be used to transform a given set of<br/>equations into a loosely coupled system of scalar equations that can be<br/>treated easily by multilevel finite elements. The reformulation is done<br/>by recasting the equations as a least-squares principle associated <br/>with a carefully derived first-order system.

A tremendous impact<br/>will be made if the performance of these sparse matrix solvers can be improved.<br/>A traditional approach to solving large sparse matrix equations is to use direct<br/>methods. This approach is often preferred in industry because direct solvers are<br/>robust and effective for moderate size problems. However, the unprecedented pace<br/>of the advance in technology has led to a dramatic growth in the size of the matrices<br/>to be handled. For example, the storage requirement for three-dimensional simulations makes<br/>direct methods prohibitively expensive. Iterative techniques are the only viable alternative.<br/>Unfortunately, iterative methods lack the robustness of direct methods. They often fail<br/>when the matrix is very ill-conditioned. This is the reason for the tremendous current<br/>interest in preconditioning techniques for large sparse matrix problems: preconditioners<br/>dramatically improve the robusteness and performance of iterative algorithms. <br/><br/>In spite of much progress on preconditioning techniques over the last few years,<br/>iterative solvers are still not always completely reliable and efficient. The proposed<br/>conference, the fourth in a series of biannual meetings on preconditioning, intends to<br/>address the complex issues related to the solution of general sparse matrix problems<br/>in large-scale real applications and in industrial settings. The issues related to <br/>sparse matrix software that are of interest to application scientists and industrial<br/>users are often fairly different from those on which the academic community is focused.<br/>For example, for an application scientist or an industrial user, improving robustness<br/>may be far more important than finding a method that would gain speed. Memory usage is<br/>also an important consideration, but is seldom accounted for in academic research on<br/>sparse matrix solvers. As a last example, linear systems solved in applications are<br/>almost always part of some nonlinear iteration (e.g., Newton) or optimization loop.<br/>It is important to consider the coupling between the linear and nonlinear parts, instead<br/>of focusing on the linear systems alone. The speakers of this conference will discuss<br/>some of the latest developments in the field of preconditioning techniques for sparse<br/>matrix problems.

We focus our efforts on the different difficulties raised by the application of the so-called discontinuous Galerkin method and the hybridized mixed methods to a variety of problems of practical interest.  The applications are to the evolution of surfaces and to navigation of robots in arbitrary terrains (Hamilton-Jacobi equations), incompressible fluid flow (Navier-Stokes equations), structural mechanics with special emphasis on shells (elasticity equations), to electromagnetic wave propagation (Maxwell equations), and to Darcy flow in porous media (second-order elliptic equations).<br/><br/>For all of the above problems, we consider the problem of how to obtain highly accurate computer simulations.  In many of these problems, the emphasis will be put on the suitable devising of the discontinuous Galerkin and hybridized methods so that they become more robust and efficient than previously known methods.  In others, the effort will be concentrated in the efficient control of the quality of the simulation.  Indeed, since the exact solution of these complex problems is not known, to guarantee a given accuracy of the simulation, special techniques have to be devised in order to assess its quality.  Moreover, these techniques can be employed to automatically let the computer know when and where to increase or decrease the computational effort to obtain the simulation; in this way, the efficiency of its computation is significantly enhanced.  Discontinuous Galerkin methods are particularly well suited for this approach."

For example, the response of a solid material to forces imposed on it can be modeled by the equations of elasticity.  Solutions of these equations can then be used for many purposes, such as to predict the behavior of a solid structure or improve its design.  The equations of elasticity are far too complex to solve exactly in realistic situations.  However, high performance computers with advanced algorithms may obtain accurate solutions.  A major goal of this work is to develop efficient and certifiably reliable solution algorithms for elasticity.  Following on recent breakthroughs which enabled the development and certification of such methods for problems involving two-dimensional deformations, the investigator and his collaborators will develop analogous methods for the much more difficult situation of full three-dimensional deformations.<br/><br/>The second area of investigation concerns the development of computer algorithms for solving Einstein's field equations of general relativity, which are the basis for the modern understanding of gravity.  Computation has recently joined theory and experiment as a third mode of inquiry into gravity, setting the stage for major new advances in understanding, but also bringing tremendous challenges.  The geometric and physical content of general relativity can be expressed in the language of PDEs, and thus, in principle, made amenable to numerical simulation.  But this is achieved only at the expense of extremely complex systems of PDEs, which have proven very difficult to solve numerically.  The emphasis here will be on understanding the fundamental issues relevant to the numerical solution of the Einstein equations in cases of physical interest.<br/><br/>This work has many broader impacts.  Robust and reliable methods for solving the equations of elasticity are needed in many challenging industrial and engineering applications, for example for aircraft, advanced buildings and bridges, and offshore oil platforms.  Recent design failures, some of them catastrophic, have been traced to inadequate numerical algorithms for elasticity.  Thus this project has the potential to contribute to public safety and prosperity.  Computational algorithms for general relativity are recognized as crucial to the success of the emerging fundamental science of gravitational astronomy, another large potential impact of this project.  The techniques developed in this work are expected to apply to other important systems of PDEs as well.  Moreover, the project will contribute to the infrastructure of science.  It will advance the development of an interdisciplinary community involving mathematicians in gravitational astrophysics, both through collaborations and through a workshop that the investigator will organize during the project period.  The investigator will disseminate the results of the research broadly through publication, conference and seminar presentations, and the world wide web.  Finally, the project will directly support the training and scientific breadth of young scientists by involving students and postdocs in important, cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research."

We focus on borderline cases, of interest in various applications, where intrinsic features of the solutions such as smoothness vs. generic finite-time breakdown, time decay, etc., hinge on a delicate balance between nonlinear convection and a variety of (possibly nonlinear) forcing mechanisms.  Often this balance is maintained by global invariants of the flow.  These include spectral invariants, which in turn lead to critical threshold phenomena, or borderline invariant regularity spaces.  A main focal topic of this project is the study of balance laws governed by Eulerian dynamics.  Such models show up in different contexts dictated by different forcing.  Previous research developed a precise framework for studying the critical threshold phenomena for such Eulerian dynamics.  Here we seek extensions to include more realistic models driven by global and non-isotropic forcing.  In particular, this project investigates global regularity for multidimensional Euler-Poisson equations with sub-critical initial data and persistence of minimal regularity for Euler and Navier-Stokes equations with initial configurations in borderline regularity spaces.<br/><br/>This research project pursues the development of mathematical tools for the understanding of fundamental properties of fluid flow and other dynamical processes.

The goal is to study anisotropic meshes and their quality measures based upon rigorous mathematical analysis of the interpolation error and ultimately to develop efficient and reliable algorithms and computer software for their generation in two and three dimensions. At the core of mathematical modeling in science and engineering is a system of partial differential equations. Numerical simulation has become an indispensable tool for solving partial differential equations and therefore simulating physical processes. Meshes and their adaptive generation play a vital role in improving the accuracy and efficiency of numerical simulations. The key to mesh adaptation is the ability to simultaneously control the shape and the size of mesh elements. Research has so far concentrated on traditional or isotropic mesh adaptation where the element size is adapted to some error estimate while the shape is kept close to being equilateral. It is known that isotropic meshes tend to concentrate too many nodes in the regions of large solution error. This drawback can be overcome and the efficiency and accuracy of numerical simulations can be dramatically enhanced by properly choosing an anisotropic mesh where the elements are allowed to have a large aspect ratio but aligned with the solution. The research of this project will focus on the development of general anisotropic estimates for interpolation error and the study of their use in construction of new algorithms and computer codes for generating adaptive anisotropic meshes in two and three dimensions. Mesh assessment strategies and quality measures in geometry, alignment, and adaptation will be developed. The methods will be applied to the numerical simulation of groundwater flow systems where chemical contamination and other substances can cause the flow density to vary considerably. The successful completion of this project will greatly improve our understanding of the mathematics within mesh adaptation, and the outcome will serve as building blocks for further studies and development of mesh adaptation algorithms and software. The developed meshing strategy can be combined with many existing numerical methods and computer codes in other areas of science and engineering to greatly enhance their efficiency and accuracy. Education will be important part of this project. Students will be actively involved and receive their professional and interdisciplinary training during the term of the project.<br/><br/>"

In case of pure simulation, i.e., without optimization, mesh adaptivity on the basis of efficient and reliable a posteriori error estimators for finite element discretized partial differential equations is a well-established tool. Residual type a posteriori error estimators rely on the appropriate evaluation of the residual with respect to an approximate solution of the problem and lead to cheaply computable, local error terms by means of element and face or edge residuals. The error is typically estimated in norms associated with the underlying function space. The dual approach involves the adjoint problem and allows one to derive sharp upper bounds for the error with respect to various error functionals ranging from global norms to local, even pointwise, quantities. The idea is to consider the target functional as the right hand side in the adjoint of the given differential equation which provides a multiplicative relation between the error in the original and the adjoint equation. The investigator will systematically study goal oriented mesh adaptivity for control and state constrained optimal control problems and structural optimization problems such as shape and topology optimization with equality and inequality constraints on the state and design variables.

Two modes will be considered, the first one in which a specific sector such as natural gas will be examined and the second one corresponding to the overall energy market where sectors (e.g., the coal market) will be modeled from a high-level perspective.  In the sector-specific approach, individual market players (e.g., natural gas producers, electric power generators) will be depicted as solving profit maximization problems subject to operational constraints as well as uncertain demand or other stochastic elements.   These market participants will either be modeled as Nash-Cournot players and thereby have the potential to assert market power, or perfectly competitive players that take market prices as given.  The simultaneous solution of each of these optimization problems along with market clearing conditions will lead to a nonlinear complementarity or variational inequality problem whose solution will be sought.  In the second mode considered, the overall energy sector will be modeled allowing for certain key elements (e.g., pipeline capacity) to be uncertain due to man-made or natural occurrences.  Existence and uniqueness issues for the related market equilibria also based on a nonlinear complementarity/variational inequality approach will be examined.   The project will also develop and analyze efficient algorithms to solve these stochastic market equilibrium problems making use of decomposition, matrix factorizations, or recourse approaches.  As such, the project will join the two important disciplines of stochastic optimization and equilibrium modeling.  Lastly, the project will analyze key energy policy scenarios using these models.<br/><br/>     Modern society depends heavily on many types of infrastructure to operate efficiently.  This infrastructure is in many forms such as the electric power grid, transportation networks, water treatment facilities, etc.  However, many of these infrastructure elements face risks that threaten to seriously degrade the societal benefits.  For example, recent energy market deregulation and restructuring have in some cases contributed to large volatility in energy prices which have adversely affected society.  The instability in certain aspects of the energy sector is troublesome since energy is vital to many parts of the economy.  Thus, risk management in energy can benefit many areas.  To combat these energy infrastructure problems, one can develop mathematical models to predict how the energy sector will function under a wide range of scenarios and then plan accordingly by building redundant systems, using financial instruments or other measures.  This project will both develop and analyze energy market equilibrium models as well as build and analyze efficient algorithms to solve such problems.  These models will directly take into account uncertain demand or other probabilistic elements to more accurately reflect the market players' actions when faced with uncertainty.  These models will then be used to analyze certain key energy policy scenarios in consultation with U.S. energy officials as well as those of other countries as appropriate. <br/>"

Model parameters are estimated or derived<br/>from real biological data and the mathematical analysis of the<br/>models covers all parameter regions. <br/><br/>Biologists recently have been able to genetically alter<br/>mosquitoes so that they are resistant to malaria infection or<br/>other mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever and West Nile<br/>virus.  These diseases are transmitted between humans by<br/>blood-feeding mosquitoes.  Their spread and control have been<br/>major concerns for public health.  The introduction of transgenic<br/>(genetically altered) mosquitoes into wild mosquito populations<br/>could be an effective measure in controlling mosquito-borne<br/>diseases.  To explore this possibility, the investigator in<br/>collaboration with biologists develops and analyzes mathematical<br/>models that represent the population dynamics of wild and<br/>transgenic mosquitoes.  The models account for the spread of<br/>transgenes through the mosquito population over multiple<br/>generations.  They help answer such questions as how effectively<br/>transgenic mosquitoes would be able to compete for partners with<br/>their wild counterparts, how long it would take for a new<br/>resistance gene to penetrate the mosquito population, and how<br/>effective it would be in mosquitoes that carry it.

However, if the Mathematics of Monge-Ampere equations and related models have motivated many investigators, and is at the origin of an abundant literature, the same can not be said of their Numerics; it is likely that the ""full nonlinearity"" of these equations is the dissuasive factor when considering their numerical solution. Taking these facts into account, the objectives of this project are: (i) Investigate computational methods for the solution of real Monge-Ampere equations, relying in particular on mixed finite element approximations. (ii) Investigate efficient iterative methods for the solution of the discrete problems derived from (i); on the basis of preliminary investigations one can expect fast Poisson solvers and properly preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithms to play an important role in the solution process. (iii) Use the resulting numerical methods to investigate the mathematical properties of Monge-Ampere type equations from the theory of fully nonlinear partial differential equations and from Differential Geometry, such as the Gaussian curvature equation. (iv)Apply the above methods to the numerical solution of problems from natural and engineering sciences involving Monge-Ampere related models (such problems take place in, e.g., Fluid Mechanics and Nonlinear Elasticity).<br/><br/>The Monge-Ampere equation and related models play an important role in various areas of Mathematics, such as Differential Geometry, Partial Differential Equations and Calculus of Variations. Actually, this type of equations occur also in more applied areas such as Fluid Mechanics, Nonlinear Elasticity, Material Sciences, Mathematical Finance, and from that point of view their numerical solution is an issue of practical importance. Surprisingly, and despite the above mentioned importance of these equations, they have motivated very little numerical work, compared to less fundamental models; the complexity of these equations may be the cause of this paradoxical situation. The main objective of this computationally oriented project is the construction of user friendly efficient numerical methods for the solution of the Monge-Ampere equation and related mathematical problems. There will be a systematic effort to derive a modular methodology, relying as much as possible on ""on the shelf"" existing methods. These investigations should be beneficial to both the theoretical and applied sciences; indeed, they should: (i) Create bridges and foster cooperation between the computational/applied mathematics and the ""more theoretical"" mathematics communities. (ii) Involve students (and faculties) in highly interdisciplinary investigations. (iii) Motivate numerical analysts and computational scientists to look at an important interdisciplinary field, which has been clearly under-investigated. (iv)Lead to the teaching of courses broadening the knowledge basis of students and introducing them to a highly multidisciplinary field. (v) Foster international cooperation, since collaborations on these topics, with European scientists in particular, are taking place already.

This research will utilize a combination of numerical and analytical methods to study Euler singularity formation, as well as examine the significance of these singularities for fluid dynamic turbulence.  A centerpiece of the project is a new method for constructing singular Euler solutions, starting from a semi-analytic approach using complex space-time and singularities in the complex plane.  The results should be amenable to rigorous analysis and direct numerical validation.

Due to its implications in turbulence theory, the question of Euler singularities has received intense attention over the last 20 years.  Successful construction of Euler singularities would solve a major problem of mathematics and would establish a new method for addressing singularity formation.  A fluid dynamic understanding of these singularities could lead to important insights on the structure of turbulence, one of the major open problems of classical physics.

As is well known, fine scale material interactions (including microscopic strains, stresses, thermal and plastic fields, etc.) play crucial roles in determining the overall behavior of materials.  While such microscopic interactions are well understood in many cases, certain fundamental issues in this context have remained elusive from both theoretical and experimental standpoints, and have still not been fully resolved.  The proposed efforts in these regards will seek to produce an improved theoretical understanding as well significantly more general rigorous solvers than previously available for problems involving three-dimensional fields of misfits in anisotropic and nonlinear materials.  Such solvers should allow significant improvements in our capability to investigate problems such as polycrystalline plasticity and magneto-rheology of elastomers.  Problems of direct and inverse scattering of electromagnetic and acoustic waves by inhomogeneous media will also be investigated as part of this research effort.  The work proposed here will build upon recent contributions by the investigator and his colleagues on fast high-order integral-equation solvers for penetrable and surface scattering problems.  These solvers can deal with complex scattering problems with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency; the proposed work will deal with special emphasis on recently developed O(1) algorithms - which can resolve problems of arbitrarily high frequency (which would usually require increasingly large discretization densities as frequencies increase) with a prescribed accuracy and within a fixed computational time-independent of frequency.<br/><br/>The proposed work impacts upon a variety of areas of societal interest, including the medical field (optical coherence tomography), automotive (magneto-rheological elastomers), materials design (actuators, strength of materials), military (radars); communications (aircraft- and spacecraft-mounted antennas, wireless communications); critical dimension metrology (optical monitoring of silicon wafers); modeling of electromagnetic induction in next-generation processors; etc.  As previous work by this PI, on the other hand, the present effort will result in training of students at both, graduate and undergraduate levels, as well as postdoctoral associates. In particular, over the last five years, fifteen different research efforts have been directed by this PI, each one for a period of ten summer weeks and each one centered around one undergraduate student. The undergraduate students included seven American citizens, three women, two black males, two Hispanic, and two students from a local community college.  These activities have been highly rewarding for all involved, including the graduate students and postdocs that collaborated with the undergraduate students and this PI, as well as some of the industrial and lab researchers who proposed specific engineering applications. As a result of this work, some of the participating graduate students and postdocs discovered a talent for teaching and advising in mathematics.  Most of the participating undergraduate students went on to graduate schools or four-year colleges, as appropriate, and have sought to pursue work on mathematically related fields. The efforts to integrate undergraduate students in research projects will continue as part of the proposed work.<br/><br/>The award is funded jointly by the Applied Mathematics and Computational Mathematics programs of the Division of Mathematical Sciences.<br/><br/><br/>"

The first project deals with the numerical analysis of optimal packing problems for curves with thickness.  The objective is to exploit the concept of global curvature to develop numerical methods for optimizing the energy of a curve in three-dimensional space (or a framed curved if twist is important) subject to an excluded-volume constraint in which the curve is the centerline of a flexible, solid tube of prescribed radius.  The second project deals with the relation between shape and speed in the sedimentation dynamics of thin, rigid (or nearly rigid) filaments.  The objective is to characterize how features of geometry (such as length, curvature, tubular neighborhood size) and topology (knot type) affect the possible speeds at which a filament can sediment in a viscous (Stokes) fluid.<br/><br/>An understanding of how material filaments may be optimally packed in confined geometries and how they may supercoil or wrap around themselves is of great interest in the study of macromolecules such as DNA and other systems in chemistry and biology.  While recent modeling advances have led to concise mathematical formulations of such problems, numerical techniques for studying them have received relatively little attention.  The first research project pursued by the investigator is focused on the development of provably convergent numerical methods for studying these and other related packing problems.  Sedimentation and gel electrophoresis are common laboratory techniques for analyzing DNA and other polymers.  These methods exploit the observation that small, relatively stiff polymer fragments of different shape typically travel at different speeds when forced through a viscous fluid or through a gel.  However, the general relation between shape and speed is at present not well understood.  The second research project pursued by the investigator is focused on the characterization of the shape-speed relation for sedimentation.  Results from this research may lead to improved laboratory techniques, and may enable more detailed structural information about polymers to be deduced from sedimentation data.<br/><br/>"

It remains a significant challenge to formulate correctly the nonreflecting boundary condition with high accuracy and efficiency for many important applications<br/>in computational sciences where the governing equations are nonlinear or have non-constant coefficients. The proposed research is aimed at developing accurate nonreflecting boundary conditions based on the<br/>Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) methodology that can be used to produce potentially reflectionless absorbing boundaries. In the past few years, considerable progresses have been made in constructing PML for the<br/>linearized Euler equations with constant coefficients. The proposed work will resolve a key issue in extending PML from constant to non-constant mean flows and lead to the development of PML for nonlinear Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. An essential element in this research is the understanding of phase and group velocities of waves supported by a bounded flow. The proposed approach is genuinely multi-dimensional and extendible to nonlinear problems. Issues about mathematical formulation, stability and well-posedness of the partial differential equations, numerical accuracy and computational advantages of the proposed method, in particular the role of dispersive waves, will be studied. Theoretical as well as computational results will be compared with existing methods. This project will also provide training of graduate students in which a more traditional applied math topic, dispersive wave analysis, is closely coupled with a core scientific computing issue. Due to ubiquitousness of nonreflecting boundaries in computational sciences, the findings of this research are expected to have a broad and significant impact on a wide range of interdisciplinary scientific and engineering applications, such as those in the study of turbulence and transition, turbulent mixing, boundary layer control, aeroacoustics, underwater acoustics and atmospheric wave modeling. The use of the proposed new method, when successful, will also improve the quality of existing computational fluid dynamics codes both in the academia and industry.<br/>"

Our goals cover physical channel modeling, experimental measurements, algorithm design and simulation of wireless communication systems in large delay spread environments.  Physical modeling will help understand large delay spread channels in wireless environments. Experimental measurements will use a new, specially designed by this research group, wireless time reversal sounder to verify theoretical time reversal predictions. Mathematical algorithm design will deal with equalization complexity, working with imperfect channel estimates, pre-coding, etc., that arise in such problems. Systems simulations will help understand overall performance of time reversal communications in different deployment scenarios.<br/><br/>In time reversal, signals transmitted with a time reversed filter back propagate and focus tightly in space-time near the intended receiver. The phenomena rely on large delay spread (rich multipath) channels. The space-time focusing is even more tight and robust when the propagation medium is randomly inhomogeneous. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have firmly established this remarkable effect and have motivated applications to detection, imaging and communications.  We believe that these space-time focusing properties of time reversal can lead to a new class of wireless communications systems with significant advantages over current approaches. This technique converts a problem in wireless posed by multipath (which induces fading) into an opportunity for improved performance. There are many potential applications of these ideas in commercial wireless as well as in specialized systems, such as communication systems that demand low probability of intercept.<br/><br/><br/>Companion Proposal: 0354658<br/>PI: Liliana Borcea<br/>Institution: Rice University<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The principal investigators are Gunnar E. Carlsson, Persi Diaconis, Leonidas J. Guibas, and Susan Holmes at Stanford University.  This project will develop topological tools for understanding qualitative properties of data sets.  We will use homology as applied to data sets directly and to derived complexes to define invariants or signatures that distinguish between the underlying geometric objects.  Important goals will include the identification, location, and classification of qualitative features of the data set, such as the presence of corners, edges, cone points, etc. and the use of homology applied to canonically defined blowups and tangent complexes to distinguish between two dimensional shapes in three dimensional Euclidean space.  We will use the recently developed techniques of persistence and landmarking to make homology a stable and readily computable invariant. We will also develop the theory of multidimensional persistence, in which one studies spaces that are equipped with several parameters, in order to better understand data sets in which there are several different parameters describing different geometric properties of the space.  The overall goal is to continue to develop and improve the available tools for studying qualitative information about geometric objects.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop tools for understanding data sets that are not easy to understand using standard methods of statistics and analysis. This kind of data might include singular points, or might be strongly curved. The data is also high dimensional, in the sense that each data point has many coordinates. For instance, we might have a data set whose points each of which is an image, which has one coordinate for each pixel. Many standard tools rely on linear approximations, which do not work well in strongly curved or singular problems. The kind of tools we have in mind are in part topological, in the sense that they measure more qualitative properties of the spaces involved, such as connectedness, or the number of holes in a space, and so on.  For example, the project takes the point of view that it is better to understand qualitative properties before attempting to do more precise quantitative analysis and better to distinguish shapes by understanding them qualitatively rather than doing data base comparisons.  Thus, methods will be developed to compute, in a timely, robust, and trustworthy manner, the fundamental geometric properties that any realistic mathematical model associated to a given data set must contain.  Then statistical and analytic techniques may be applied to the geometrically correct models in order to extract the detailed information desired by practitioners.  <br/>"

It took approximately 250  years from Euler's formulation of the partial differential equations governing the flow of compressible fluids to the proof that such flows  with arbitrarily prescribed initial states actually exist. This scientific breakthrough opened a new field in analysis and computation of the problem of multiphase fluid flow. The demonstration that the solutions can exist in weak form which include discontinuous structures poses a great challenge to mathematicians in designing numerical algorithms for the computation of the multiphase flow. The scientific progress in this field has always been an interplay between analysis and computation, by hard work and by mere luck. This conference brings scientists who have made important contribution to the field and those who are striving to find new solutions in more complicated systems and higher dimensions. The speakers will address the proof of existence and uniqueness of  the partial differential equations, numerical algorithms to solve such equations and computational examples emerged from scientific and  engineering problems which are governed by such partial differential equations. <br/><br/>The conference is to foster communication among theoreticians, numerical analysts and computational scientists from universities and national laboratories and between leaders and students in these fields. Theoreticians can predict the qualitative aspects of the solutions while computational scientists will demonstrate the details of the numerical solution which is unknown to the analysts. The PDE and its application to the multiphase flow problem has a large impact in national defense and industry. Such problems are brought from national laboratories to the academic community to seek better mathematical understanding and a better design for numerical algorithms.

For points near the source, evaluation is not routine because of large derivatives.  The approach of this work, developed in earlier NSF-funded research, is to regularize the integral in a systematic way, evaluate at grid points as for a standard integral, and then add local correction terms.  The corrections are derived analytically.  For surfaces, overlapping grids are used.  The work will be in several parts: A class of static problems for 3D potentials defined through surface integrals will be treated, extending earlier work.  In order to allow for boundaries that are not smooth, a method will be derived for computing integrals on curves with corners in 2D.  Application to the computation of moving boundaries in viscous, incompressible 2D fluid flow will be tested as a possible improvement in the immersed boundary method or immersed interface method.  Computations will be done for a moving boundary or interface between two different fluids in 3D without viscosity; water waves are one important case, and in other cases regularization will be used to control physical instabilities.<br/><br/>Scientific processes often involve moving boundaries, such as a drop of one fluid moving through another, or the motion of an elastic membrane in living tissue.  Numerical modeling of such phenomena involves special difficulties, and several approaches are in use.  Important quantities, such as a jump in pressure, can often be written as singular integrals like the ones described.  The techniques developed in this work could be used to incorporate integral calculations into numerical methods for viscous fluid flow with moving boundaries.  If this leads to improvement in these methods, they could be more widely useful for predictions of two-fluid systems or biological processes with moving membranes.  The application to flow without viscosity could improve understanding of fully nonlinear water waves and the onset of mixing in an unstable fluid layer.<br/>"

The goal of this project is to develop accurate, robust, and efficient adaptive finite element discretization methods, parallel iterative solution algorithms and computer codes for computing geometrical flows based on both level set and phase field formulations. The investigator aims to carry out a balanced numerical study for the geometrical flows by emphasizing both qualitative analysis and quantitative computation, and thus to provide reliable computational tools for discovering and analyzing fine properties such as dynamics of the singularities of the geometrical flows, which often are difficult and even may not be possible to predicate and characterize by analytical means. The methods and algorithms resulting from this research will have the following attractive features: high accuracy, strong stability, low cost, and high efficiency. In addition, the proposed methods are also capable of accurately and efficiently approximating the geometrical flows not only before but also beyond the onset of singularities.<br/><br/>As critical applications from fluid mechanics, cosmology, and materials science are directly tied to the solutions of geometrical flows, it is expected that successful completion of the proposed research has the potential to significantly impact these applied sciences not only by presenting new methods for solving underlying mathematical problems but also providing insights for the understanding of each of these <br/>applications.

The rationale of the positivity principle is stability, which is a very <br/>important requirement for numerical schemes.  The positivity principle is the <br/>1st stability principle for schemes for solving multi-dimensional hyperbolic <br/>systems.  In this proposal we have shown that the central scheme studied by Kurganov and Tadmor is positive.  By mixing upwind scheme and Lax-Wendroff scheme, we have made a positive scheme which costs only 30% of the original positive scheme. We have developed a scheme called Convex Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) scheme.  The Convex ENO scheme is a high order accurate central scheme.  We have developed a new multigrid method to solve hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. By doing multigrid, the cost of calculations is reduced significantly. In the proposal we also develop several schemes for solving elliptic problems with multi-fluids separated by the interfaces. Such problems arise from many real world applications. For example, incompressible multi-fluids Navier-Stokes equation. A new uniform 2nd order accurate scheme on non-body-fitting grids is developed for that. We have proposed a uniform 2nd order accurate level-set method using finite element method for solving elliptic problems with mixing boundary conditions. Such problems emerge from in simulating epitaxial thin film growth using the island dynamics model.  We have used some of those methods to do Direct Numerical Simulation on multi-phase turbulent flows.  We have developed a geometric multigrid method for such elliptic problems based on the Ghost Fluid Method, and plan to do more with the other methods. The PI and his collaborators are pursuing further development of positive schemes. In a series of research works they have introduced and established the positivity principle for schemes for solving hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The rationale of the positivity principle is stability. 1) They prove that the central scheme developed by Kurganov and Tadmor is positive scheme. 2) They continue to develop a new positive scheme, which is a mixture of upwind and Lax-Wendroff schemes. Hence two-stage Runge-Kutta is not required and for two-dimensions the computation cost could be cut by as much as 70%.<br/>3) They continue to work on a new scheme called weighted component-wise positive<br/>scheme. It is a mixture of Weighted ENO schemes and 2nd order component-wise version of Convex ENO scheme or high-resolution central scheme.  They use a convex combination of all candidates to do reconstruction, but use a new measurement called accurateness instead of smoothness to assign proper weights. The convex combination achieves almost optimal (one order lower than the optimal) order accuracy. This scheme can be also extended to solve Hamilton-Jacobi equations in multi-dimensions. 4) They are going to introduce a multigrid method for solving multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The novelty is to calculate the fluxes on coarse grid, then interpolates the differences of the fluxes or the fluxes to the finest grid. Such multigrid method is not only faster than a base scheme in each iteration, but also allows larger time step than that of the base scheme. Hence the multigrid method requires much less CPU time to advance solutions to the same stopping time compared to the base scheme. In other words, for the same CPU time, the multigrid method  advances solutions much further in time. This is particularly useful for computing stationary solutions. In the recent years, the PI and his collaborators have been pursuing further development of Ghost Fluid Method (GFM) for multi-phase fluids. 1) They propose a geometric multigrid method to solving linear systems arising from irregular boundary problems involving multiple interfaces in 2D and 3D. In this method, they adopt  a matrix-free approach i.e. they do not form the fine grid matrix explicitly and they never form nor store the coarse grid matrices. The main idea is to construct an accurate interpolation which captures the correct boundary conditions at the interfaces via a level set function. 2) They propose a 2nd order accurate level-set method using finite element method for solving elliptic equations with Robin interface conditions. They first study a weak formulation of it, and then prove that<br/>there exists a unique weak solution. At last, a finite element method on non-body-fitting uniform or arbitrary triangulations is used to solve such weak formulation. The novelty of this work is the incorporation of finite element methods and non-body-fitting triangulations. 3) They develop a new 2nd order accurate numerical method on non-body-fitting grids for solving the elliptic equations with interfaces. Instead of smooth, the boundary and the subdomains'<br/>boundaries and hence the interfaces, are only required to be Lipschitz continuous as submanifold. A weak formulation is developed and the numerical method is derived by discretizing the weak formulation by piece-wise linear functions. The method is 2nd order accurate in maximum norm if the interface is smooth or its discontinuities are proper handled, and convergent in maximum norm otherwise. 4) They use the boundary condition capturing method<br/>to do Direct Numerical Simulations on multi-phase turbulent<br/>flows. This is the first successful DNS of such problems.<br/>Because turbulence happens through a large range of scales, and hence very efficient methods are needed to capture all meaningful scales.<br/><br/>The proposal focus on the real world applications. For example, hyperbolic<br/>systems of conservation laws, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with interfaces, epitaxial thin film growth using the island dynamics model, Direct Numerical Simulation on multi-phase turbulent flows. The proposed numerical methods possess high order accuracy and high resolutions, hence they are very efficient.  Two multigrid methods are proposed to couple with those methods to further speeded up numerical simulations. The proposal should have broad impact, since the methods created can be easily adopted to many other application areas in the environmental, geophysical, biological, material science, and engineering sciences.<br/><br/>"

Healey plans to study various problems from nonlinear elasticity, with applications to multi-phase, shape-memory solids and nonlinearly elastic shells - especially bio-membranes or bio-shells.  For the first class of problems, coming from a field dominated by global-energy minimization techniques, the main goal of the work is provide new tools and results concerning meta-stable equilibria in the presence of loading and interfacial energy.  For shell problems the main goal is to understand non-axisymmetric equilibria of nominally spherical shells, which has recently become an important question for lipid-bilayer membranes or ""bio-shells"", which are ubiquitous in molecular-biological structures.  The nonlinear partial differential equations governing these models are essentially untouched - from the point of view of analysis.  The proposed work is interdisciplinary and challenging, requiring tools and perspectives from several different fields, e.g., nonlinear analysis and partial differential equations, bifurcation theory, nonlinear continuum physics, computational methods, symmetry ideas, materials science and bio-physics.<br/><br/>The proposed work will provide new mathematical models and predictive analysis for two seemingly different physical phenomena - phase transitions in shape-memory solids and in bio-membranes.  Of course the detailed mathematical models for the two phenomena are distinct, but the overall approach and philosophy of the project is the same.  As verified in experiments, there is a ""perfect"" or homogeneous state, which loses stability, after which more exotic patterns emerge.  The goal of the work is to provide new mathematical tools to predict and understand the emergence and persistence of such phenomena from a quantitative point of view.  The work has direct connections to technology:  Shape-memory alloys are important in applications as ""smart materials"" and can potentially provide actuation capabilities on the micro scale; the deformability and mechanical behavior of bio-membranes is closely related to cell function, which is of central importance in biology.<br/>"

Normally, a plane like this does not fly so fast but<br/>it is important to know what would happen if it did, and whether a<br/>simple controller could bring the plane under control.  Eigenvalues <br/>tell us about stability in the long term, but pseudospectra are far <br/>more informative, telling us about stability in the short term.  <br/>Optimizing the pseudospectra over the parameters of the <br/>controller may result in the design of a controller that is simple <br/>yet effective in avoiding the instability and preventing catastrophe.<br/>"

These arise in applications which require the modeling of complex fluid flows, such as combustion or ground water pollution.  They also arise in the design of novel fluidic Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), as well as solid-state semiconductor devices.  Over the last decade, IEMs have proven to be very successful and are now widely used in electromagnetic, elastic, and fluid dynamic modeling when the governing equation is of ""constant coefficient"" type.  In order to address more general, variable coefficient problems, we represent the solution as a volume integral using the Green's function for a simple, nearby problem convolved with an unknown density.  Inserting this representation into the original elliptic equation leads to a linear integral equation.  A principal advantage of this approach is that it avoids solving the sparse but poorly conditioned linear systems that result from direct discretization of the differential equation.  Discretization of the linear integral equation leads, instead, to a well conditioned dense linear system, for which Krylov subspace methods converge quickly.  Historically, the disadvantage of using iterative methods with integral equations was the cost of computing the dense matrix-vector multiplications which are needed at every step.  With the advent of the fast multipole method (FMM), however, these can be evaluated in optimal time.  Nevertheless, in order for the method to be robust and practical, several issues remain.  In particular, effective preconditioning strategies for problems with strong gradients in the material properties are not well developed.  Preliminary analysis of some multilevel approaches for model problems are promising.<br/><br/>Our planned research program combines classical mathematics (PDEs, integral equations, potential theory) with scientific computing research (fast summation, iterative solvers, adaptive mesh refinement, domain decomposition) and important applications (porous media and variable density flows).  The interdisciplinary nature of the work provides fertile ground for training graduate students as computational scientists. Experience gained in the application areas mentioned will have broad impact, since the techniques created can be transferred to many other application areas in the environmental, geophysical, biological, and engineering sciences."

The investigate will apply his results to chemical engineering, chemistry, environmental science, electrical engineering, nuclear engineering, and aeronautical engineering. Both phases of the project address a weakness of a conventional implementation of a globalized inexact Newton method, namely the inability to select among multiple solutions. Continuation methods use additional information, such as a physical parameter in the equation or the fact that the nonlinear equation is the steady state equation for a time-dependent problem, to guide the solver, and both improve the solver's robustness and increase the likelihood that the important solution or solutions will be found. The proposed research will analyze the robustness of these methods as computational grids are refined, how they perform if the nonlinearity is not differentiable, and how one can design fast algorithms for the corrector iteration which best exploit the functional analytic properties of the combination of the problem and the continuation method.<br/><br/>Nonlinearity is common across all of science and engineering. Therefore, algorithms for solving nonlinear equations are fundamental components of many simulators and engineering design tools.

As such parameters change, the nature of the solution can vary significantly, and the performance of the simulator can be affected as well. The PI's research is directed at improving the performance of the algorithms and making the solvers more robust.

To do so, we will bring<br/>in tools in the traditionally different fields such as boundary detection and <br/>delineation algorithms (computer vision), image compression and denoising <br/>schemes (image processing), elliptic boundary value problem solvers and <br/>potential function computations (scientific computing), and Fourier analysis and<br/>fast algorithms (computational harmonic analysis).  Our primary concern is <br/>analysis (e.g., extraction and characterization of spatial frequency features)<br/>and synthesis (e.g., reconstruction from the compressed representation of <br/>objects after their boundaries are detected and they are segmented either <br/>manually by a human interpreter using a pointing device or automatically by the<br/>algorithms proposed by other researchers.  On the one hand, the boundary of an<br/>object provides important information: geometry and shape of the object. On the<br/>other hand, it becomes a nuisance for other tasks such as the Fourier analysis<br/>of the internal information (e.g., textures) of the object because it creates<br/>spurious interference patterns due to the Gibbs phenomenon that masks the<br/>important internal information of the object.  We will decouple the geometry and<br/>internal information of the object by solving the elliptic boundary value <br/>problem on the domain where the object is supported.  More precisely, for the <br/>analysis of the object, we embed the detected and segmented object in an <br/>otherwise empty rectangular domain, and smoothly extend the object to the <br/>outside of the object boundary by solving the Poisson equation with the <br/>homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition at the edges of the covering rectangle.<br/>Since the values on the edges of the covering rectangle vanish, this smoothly<br/>extended component can be expanded into the Fourier sine series with quickly <br/>decaying coefficients, which enable us to effectively characterize and compress<br/>the internal information of the object.  Finally, we subtract this component<br/>from the original object on the supported domain to obtain the component <br/>responsible for geometric information of the object, which turns out to be a <br/>solution of the Laplace equation on that domain.  For the synthesis or <br/>reconstruction of the object, we need to store the Fourier sine coefficients of<br/>the extended component and the boundary coordinates and the original values of <br/>the object at those points in the analysis stage.  Then, the original object is <br/>recovered by adding the geometric component (which is recovered by evaluating <br/>the single and double layer potentials on the domain) and the smoothly extended<br/>component (which is easily recovered from the Fourier sine coefficients).  In <br/>order to solve the Laplace/Poisson equations, we will fully utilize the advanced<br/>Laplace/Poisson solvers based on Fast Multipole Methods.  We will also extend <br/>our analysis and synthesis paradigm to an object with holes (i.e., <br/>multiply-connected domains), investigate the effect of noise on the boundary <br/>shapes and values, and investigate the effect of compression of the boundary <br/>information to the quality of the reconstructed images.  Furthermore, we will<br/>develop a gradient and directional derivative estimation algorithm equipped with<br/>regularization (high-frequency attenuation) capabilities, which will provide <br/>good boundary conditions and consequently improve the performance of the <br/>boundary detection and delineation algorithms as well as the accuracy of the <br/>solutions of the Laplace/Poisson equations.<br/><br/>Potential applications of our methodology include biometrics and image-based <br/>diagnostics in medicine and other fields such as geology and material sciences.<br/>Biometrics has recently become a tremendously important subject for homeland <br/>security reasons.  Since our paradigm provides both geometric/shape information<br/>and internal texture information of an object of interest in an separate manner<br/>for images obtained by various sensors and imaging modalities, it may allow data<br/>examiners to characterize the features of the objects of interest much more <br/>reliably compared to the methods which solely use either shape or texture <br/>information.  For example, characterizing and diagnosing cancerous cells in <br/>various image modalities including Pap smear test images in gynecology may <br/>benefit from using the tools we will develop in our project (e.g., object-based <br/>storage, cataloging, compression, and analysis).

A second goal is to explore innovative techniques that simulate long-time molecular motions without sequentially stepping through billions of intermediate states, as would be necessary with standard approaches.  New algorithms for both dynamics and sampling are to be constructed using such techniques as modified energy functions that compensate for finite steps, stochastic stabilization, and optimization of method parameters, together with physical insight.  Promising algorithms are tested and compared using mathematical analyses and computer experiments.  Tools for mathematical analysis include the concept of effective accuracy, the method of modified equations, linear analysis, and KAM theory.  Computer experiments are performed on model problems chosen to reveal unambiguously the properties of interest.  Faster algorithms are to be implemented in molecular simulation software developed and distributed for public use in a project at the University of Illinois Beckman Institute.  Many of the techniques will apply not only to molecular simulations but also to simulations in astrophysics, structural mechanics, and fluids.<br/><br/>Computer simulations of atomic detail are heavily employed in physics, chemistry, materials science, and structural biology.  These calculations require the generation of sequences of atomic configurations either for the purpose of modeling actual motion or for the purpose of calculating averaged values and structures from a wide range of representative samples.  The computing time ranges from hours to months, so it can benefit tremendously from faster algorithms.  It is the objective of this research project to do this: to create much more efficient propagators for dynamics and sampling that reliably achieve acceptable levels of accuracy.  The construction of such algorithms employs ideas from mathematics and computer science together with physical insight.  Promising algorithms are tested and compared using mathematical analyses and computer experiments.  The successful ones are implemented in molecular modeling software being developed for widespread use in a project at the University of Illinois Beckman Institute.  These advances in methodology are also to be disseminated in articles targeted to practitioners.  Many of the techniques will apply not only to molecular simulations but also to simulations in astrophysics, structural mechanics, and fluids.  Potentially, the availability of accelerated propagation algorithms will lead to a variety of scientific results that otherwise would not be obtained.  The performance of the research will be a valuable interdisciplinary experience for a graduate student.<br/>"

A common means of incorporating these small scale effects in mathematical model equations involving larger scale quantities is through the use of stochasticity or randomness to represent the small scale quantities.  One increasingly important class of such random models are stochastic partial differential equations.  Such equations have proved to be difficult to solve using mathematical analysis; thus computational methods will be valuable tools in the study of stochastic partial differential  equations.  The main goal of this research is to develop new accurate and efficient spectral numerical schemes to study stochastic partial differential equations.  This new computational method will be applied to the class of stochastic partial differential equation models known as mesoscopic models for surface processes, with special emphasis on problems from engineering and biophysics.  In particular, a better understanding of the effect on a reaction of the distribution of a catalyst on a surface can lead to improvements in the overall efficiency of catalytic surface reactors.   The labeling of the positions and types of proteins on the surface of a biomaterial is important in determining the structure of subcellular components.  The application of the spectral scheme to the mesoscopic models for these problems will make possible numerical studies of a much greater size and scope than is currently feasible using existing numerical techniques.  Given the nature of these applications, the further growth and development of interdisciplinary collaborations is an important aspect of this research."

Importance sampling is a widely used Monte Carlo simulation technique for the estimation of quantities that are largely determined by rare events. With few exceptions, importance sampling algorithms are based on a change of measure that is not allowed to adapt in the course of generating a sample. Recent studies, however, indicate that these schemes may fail miserably in very common circumstances. These difficulties reflect the absence of a broad theoretical foundation for importance sampling. One contribution of the proposed research is to build such a foundation in a general setting. Roughly speaking, at the heart of any importance sampling problem is a stochastic game, and an understanding of this game is the key to designing and analyzing efficient importance sampling algorithms. This perspective motivates the concept of dynamic importance sampling, where the change of measure is allowed to vary depending on the simulation history. It can be shown that dynamic schemes, properly designed, are optimal in a suitable sense. The second topic, urn occupancy problems, is concerned with the distribution of multiple balls in multiple urns. This classical topic has found applications in many fields. The proposed research concerns large deviation approximations, new techniques for explicitly solving the associated variational problem, and the development of relations between equilibrium distributions for stochastic networks and occupancy problems.<br/><br/>If one were to ask an average person whether unlikely events are important, their first response might be that an event with very little chance of happening could not be significant.  After a moment's reflection, however, they would realize that such events have a profound impact in many circumstances. For example, measuring credit risk is very important to those who manage portfolios of loans, corporate bonds, and other financial instruments that are subject to default risk. Often the problem reduces to estimating the probability of default, which is usually very small, especially for highly rated obligors. However, an accurate estimation is crucial for risk management because these rare defaults can induce significant losses.  Similar considerations apply in many other circumstances, especially when performance standards are stringent.  The dominant technique for estimating small probabilities has been a simulation algorithm called importance sampling. However, the traditional design methodology for importance sampling has very limited applications and has been observed to break down in very common situations. Part of the proposed research is concerned with the most basic question, that is, how to build a broad theoretical foundation for importance sampling, upon which efficient algorithms can be designed for very general problems. A new concept of design is introduced in the proposal and the resulting importance sampling algorithms work well in practice. The other part of the proposal is concerned with a class of urn occupancy models. These models are very useful in the design and analysis of large-scale networks, biological systems, and physics. However, due to the complexity of the models, approximation becomes exceedingly important. The proposed research will develop an asymptotic method that can yield good approximations with only a modest computation effort.   <br/>"

Campbell will perform research on optimization, numerical methods for constrained differential equations, and constrained optimal control.  This research will result in improved algorithms and new theoretical understanding of numerical methods for differential algebraic equations (DAEs) and the solution of inequality constrained optimal control problems by direct transcription approaches.  More specifically, a DAE is an implicit differential equation.  An integer quantity called the index is one measure of how different a DAE is from being an explicit ordinary differential equation.  Many problems are most naturally initially modeled as a DAE particularly those that are analyzed and simulated using computer generated mathematical models.  DAEs occur in optimization when the original problem is a DAE, because of the activation of constraints, and when partial differential equations are numerically solved using the method of lines.  Because of the importance of DAEs in applications, a variety of numerical techniques have been developed in recent years to simulate and analyze DAEs although most of these methods only work on specific classes of problems with special structure and low index.  The development of more general DAE integrators is one focus of this proposal.  Direct transcription methods are a popular approach for the solution of optimal control problems. Recently it has been shown that the usual theory of DAE integrators needs to be substantially modified when DAEs occur during the numerical solution by direct transcription methods of inequality constrained optimal control problems.  A second primary focus of this proposal is the numerical solution of inequality constrained optimal control problems using direct transcription methods.  <br/><br/>Throughout industry there is a need for the development of more efficient processes and systems.  This is essential for improved performance, conserving of resources, and industrial and military competitiveness.  This increased performance requires working with complex mathematical models of the systems in question.  In many areas it is becoming necessary to utilize larger, more complex, and more complete models of the physical process or system.  Two important parts of systems design are simulation and optimization.  In applications there are many constraints.  These constraints range from mission constraints (such as flying within certain flight corridors or intercepting specific targets) to physical constraints (such as contact between a robotic arm and a tool) to financial or cost constraints.  These constraints pose both theoretical and computational challenges which increase with the model's complexity.  This project is to develop both mathematical theory and numerical algorithms for the numerical simulation and optimal control of complex systems with constraints.  The proposer has ongoing collaborations with developers of software used in a number of industries including the aerospace industry.  The results of this research will both be incorporated into production computer codes as part of collaborations of the Principal Investigator and also shared with others developing numerical software.

In addition to such challenges posed by the disparity in scales  within the same model, in many instances we are faced with an additional disparity in models: for example  in phenomena with detailed fluid/surface or boundary layer interactions it is necessary to couple microscopic, possibly stochastic models describing the  dynamics of atoms or molecules on a surface, along with continuum PDE for  species, fluid and thermodynamic variables on the overlying to the surface gas phase. It is therefore inevitable that  features of the microscopic model will  essentially enter as a subgrid effect in the coupling with the coarse computational grid of the macroscopic PDE models. In this case,  the proper incorporation and simulation of stochastic effects from the subgrid microscale is a critical element in the modeling and simulations. The proposed projects focus on aspects of the aforementioned   issues by putting forward a combination of interconnected modeling, computational and analysis questions,  roughly divided in two categories: (i) Mathematical strategies for the coarse-graining of microscopic  models and the corresponding<br/> simulators, addressing problems which are currently  intractable with conventional MD/MC  due to scale limitations. Here, it is not   directly attempted to speed up microscopic simulation algorithms; instead, a hierarchy  of new coarse-grained  stochastic models (referred to as Coarse Grained Monte Carlo methods) is derived, ordered by the magnitude of space/time scales. This new set of models involves  a reduced set of observables over the original  microscopic models incorporating microscopic details and noise, as well as<br/>the interaction of the unresolved degrees of freedom. (ii)   Hybrid    stochastic/deterministic systems describing detailed fluid-surface interactions arise in applications that range from deposition process and catalysis to fuel cell design and microreactors, to  biology and  atmosphere and ocean science. Here two such applications are addressed, namely catalytic reactors and stochastic parametrizations of tropical convection.<br/>Due to their inherent complexity it is also necessary to develop simpler,  test bed problems that capture significant features of  the multi-scale nature of the physical models, but  are still amenable to asymptotics, mathematical analysis and  tractable computations.<br/><br/>The modeling and simulation of problems with multiple interrelating length and time scales is one of the preeminent issues in essentially all timely scientific and engineering challenges, ranging from the design of  nanodevices, to biomolecular  dynamics, to the spread of epidemics  and  climate modeling. In spite of  a continuously increasing  computing power many of these problems remain  intractable, at least in realistic conditions, and new modeling and  simulation  strategies  need to be developed. As several paradigms<br/>have recently demonstrated, the critical step in this process is the use of (the limited in number and flexibility) existing multiscale mathematical and statistical tools as well as the development of  new ones, that enable the creation of new algorithms for complex systems. In the proposed work an array of such novel multiscale mathematics and computing methods is developed. The research is motivated by and targeted  to a<br/>number of the aforementioned applications. Two such particular examples  are, (i) the surface processes  in catalytic reactors and fuel cells, and  (ii) the  tropical and open ocean  convection.<br/>"

Our goals cover physical channel modeling, experimental measurements, algorithm design and simulation of wireless communication systems in large delay spread environments.  Physical modeling will help understand large delay spread channels in wireless environments. Experimental measurements will use a new, specially designed by this research group, wireless time reversal sounder to verify theoretical time reversal predictions. Mathematical algorithm design will deal with equalization complexity, working with imperfect channel estimates, pre-coding, etc., that arise in such problems. Systems simulations will help understand overall performance of time reversal communications in different deployment scenarios.<br/><br/>In time reversal, signals transmitted with a time reversed filter back propagate and focus tightly in space-time near the intended receiver. The phenomena rely on large delay spread (rich multipath) channels. The space-time focusing is even more tight and robust when the propagation medium is randomly inhomogeneous. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have firmly established this remarkable effect and have motivated applications to detection, imaging and communications.  We believe that these space-time focusing properties of time reversal can lead to a new class of wireless communications systems with significant advantages over current approaches. This technique converts a problem in wireless posed by multipath (which induces fading) into an opportunity for improved performance.
