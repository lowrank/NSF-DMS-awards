Immersed  interface methods are a class of methods for solving partial  differential equations whose solutions have discontinuities or  nonsmoothness across some interface(s).  The idea is to use a  uniform Cartesian grid in spite of the fact that the interface  may cut between grid points.  The goal of this work is to develop  finite difference methods in two and three space dimensions that  give highly accurate solutions at all grid points while  maintaining the efficiency and ease of implementation of uniform  grid methods.  Pointwise second order accurate methods have  already been developed for several classes of problems, including  certain elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations with  discontinuous coefficients across fixed interfaces.  Stokes flow  and solidification problems with moving interfaces have also been  solved.  Extensions to a number of other problems are currently  underway.  Many important practical problems lead to differential equations  in regions of 2- or 3-dimensional space that are geometrically  complicated, and that contain interfaces across which the nature  of the solution changes.  These equations can rarely be solved  exactly, and large-scale computation is required to obtain  well-resolved solutions over multi-dimensional regions.  The goal  of this work is to develop efficient computational methods to  approximate solutions of such problems.  Several specific  problems are studied in depth:  (1) One goal is to develop  improved methods for incompressible fluid dynamics in regions  with complicated moving elastic boundaries, based on a method of  Peskin's that is widely used in biophysical and physiological  modelling, e.g., of the heart, blood vesssels, the inner ear,  etc.  (2) Wave equations in heterogeneous materials arise in  numerous applications, including ultrasound imaging and therapy,  ocean acoustics, and seismic p ropagation in the earth.  The  ""forward problem"" consists of solving the equations forward in  time given the material properties and locations of interfaces.   The harder ""inverse problem"" requires determining the material  properties and locations of interfaces from measurements made at  the surface.  Ultrasound imaging requires solving the inverse  problem for acoustics equations.  Seismic exploration of the  earth, heavily used in the search for oil, for example, requires  solving inverse problems for elastic wave equations or for  simplified travel-time equations.  The methods developed in this  work are applied to both forward and inverse problems.  (3) In  electrical impedance tomography, an inverse problem is solved for  the electrical conductivity of an object.  This technique is used  in medical imaging and is being studied for the purpose of  locating unexploded land mines, a major health risk in many  countries today.  Inverse problems of this type are being studied  in this work.  (4) Porous media equations arising in oil  reservoir simulation and groundwater transport requiremodeling  discontinuities in permeability and porosity at geological  interfaces, as well as moving front representing interfaces  between oil and water, for example.  Accurate modeling of  groundwater flow is important in studying contamination by toxic  wastes and remediation of contaminated sites.  (5) Multi-phase  solidification problems involve moving interfaces between the two  phases (e.g. ice and water) and may be coupled with fluid  dynamics effects as well as heat transfer.  Practical  applications include studying the effect of ocean currents on ice  shelves, injection molding in manufacturing processes, and  chemical etching."

These algorithms are codified in a language, under  development, which facilitates the mechanical verification of  proofs about binary linear codes. One method is to take a  generalized weight enumerator, and use it to generate a linear  programming problem, as Delsarte did with the ordinary weight   enumerator.  Thse linear programming problems tend to be large,  and thus are not generally amenable to hand calculation.  One  particularly promising weight enumerator is the split weight  enumerator arising from a partition of n, where n is the length  of the code.  Using this method and others, many new specific  results about binary linear codes will be proved.  In turn, these  may suggest new algorithms and closed-form general statements.  This research is about error-correcting codes, a fundamental  topic in mathematical combinatorics, computer science, and  electrical engineering.  Such codes are indispensable whenever  information must be transferred across noisy channels from one  place to another.  For example,they are used in compact disk  players to get digitized music from the surface of the CD to the  inside of the player, and in communications between the earth and   orbiting satellites.  Error-correcting codes work by creatively  incorporating redundancy into the transmitted message, to permit  the receiver to detect and correct those errors introduced in  transit, which were caused  by (for instance) dust on the surface  of the CD or cosmic rays. A code is  good if it allows the  detection and correction of many errors without incurring the  expense of excessive redundancy.  This award funds both a search  for good codes and an investigation into the mathematical  limitations of how good they can be."

The emphasis  is on the development of new accurate, robust and efficient  computational techniques.  Approximation strategies involving  standard Galerkin finite element methods, novel least-squares  methods, and mixed finite element methods are studied especially  from the standpoint of their accuracy and stability.  The solution  techniques that are developed emphasize preconditioning via  domain decomposition or multigrid/multilevel methods.       The broad objective of this program is to use the full power  of rigorous mathematics both to analyze the behavior of numerical  methods currently used in scientific computation and to develop  new algorithms exhibiting improved accuracy, stability and  performance.  More efficient and scalable algorithms can have a  significant impact on the development of effective simulators for  understanding physical processes of national importance.  For  example, computer modeling of ground water processes involve the  solution of large complex systems of nonlinear partial  differential equations.  The results of these simulations provide  important predictive information that can influence decisions  with regard to ground water remediation strategies and national  conservation programs.  Due to the complexity in the geometry and  the physical processes, meaningful simulations overwhelm today's  most powerful parallel computers and hence the need for more  effective numerical techniques.  The techniques developed are  applicable as well to problems such as simulation of smart  materials, heat and mass transfer, and high  performance  computing."

By combining the  techniques of nonconforming elements, macro elements, singular  functions and mixed formulations, robust finite element methods  that employ relatively few numbers of unknowns can be developed  to overcome these difficulties.  The  investigator develops  multigrid and domain decomposition algorithms for such finite  element methods.       Multigrid algorithms compute the solutions of systems of  equations at a cost proportional to the number of unknowns and  therefore are the most efficient methods for solving large  systems.  Domain decomposition algorithms distribute the  computation over different parts of the physical domain and hence  are very suitable for parallel computers.  They are currently two  of the major ideas in high performance computing.  The results  from this project can lead to fast solvers for problems in  elasticity, plasticity, plates, beams, shells, and fluid  mechanics.  In particular, a new multigrid method is developed for  the computation of stress intensity factors, which are important  quantities in the study of the macroscopic phenomena of materials  such as fatigues and fractures.  These problems arise in the  design of structures such as buildings, bridges, planes, and  ships, and in the analysis of how structures perform.  Hence the  project provides tools for solving problems of manufacturing and  of monitoring and renewing civil infrastructure."

The first main area involves  the question of whether it is possible, even in principle, for  long-term computer simulations of typical nonhyperbolic chaotic  systems to approximately match true system behavior.  Part of this  research involves developing quantitative laws of the expected  waiting time between breakdowns, or mismatches, between computer  simulation trajectories and the trajectories of computer models.  The second major area is ongoing work by the investigator on the  interpretation of physical and biological experiments that  generate aperiodic time series.  Using univariate or multivariate  time series or inter-event time intervals produced by a  deterministic physical process, the phase space of the process  can be faithfully reconstructed as the basis for applications  such as system identification, filtering, prediction and control.  Topological and diffeomorphic embedding theorems guaranteeing  this in various physically verifiable contexts have been the  results of previous and ongoing research by the investigator and  coworkers.       Computer simulations are a staple of modern science.  National policy decisions are being made which rely partially on  the interpretation of long-term computer simulations of nonlinear  models.  The questions explored in the proposal are critical to  the analysis of simulations of nonlinear processes.  One goal of  this proposal is to explore these questions in physically  relevant models, and in particular to isolate and quantify the  limitations of these representations, especially for the purpose  of long-term modeling.  The second focus of this research is the  interpretation of data collected from chaotic systems in  experiments and nature.  Complex deterministic time series are  being identified in physical, chemical, engineering and  biological/medical setti ngs.  As an example, hippocampal slices  from mammals and other small neural systems are studied by the  investigator, in conjunction with a group of medical researchers  headed by a neurosurgeon specializing in epilepsy, with the  purpose of detecting deterministic information processing in the  brain.  The investigator has done previous work on expanding these  conceptual foundations and developing related computational  implementations, and works to widen their areas of validity and  increase their power for the study of complex systems in natural,  experimental, and engineering-related contexts.  New techniques  for these applications are developed in this project, involving  methods from numerical analysis used in conjunction with existing  signal processing methods."

The numerical simulation of  incompressible flows, which plays an important role in numerous  scientific and industrial applications of current interest, is a  challenging task for both numerical analysts and computational  dynamicists.  The proposed fast algorithms are based on the  spectral discretization for the space variables and high-order  projection schemes for the time variable.  The proposed algorithms  allow accurate numerical simulation of incompressible flows with  significantly less computational effort than the traditional  lower-order methods.       Fast and accurate numerical solution of partial differential  equations is of major importance in many fields of science and  engineering, including among others high performance computing,  turbulence modeling and numerical weather prediction.  A main  objective of this project is to develop fast algorithms with  optimal computational complexity for a large class of elliptic  equations, and to implement them in a high performance software  package that is made available to the public through anonymous  ftp and World Wide Web.

The main thrust of this  collaborative effort between the areas of computational  mathematics, fluid dynamics and geophysics is investigating a  class of challenging problems in mantle dynamics, which involves  the application of several modern mathematical and computational  techniques to large-scale numerical simulation, data-processing,  and scientific visualization.  The geophysical problems they  investigate entail the exploration of convection in the high  Rayleigh number regime.  Particular interest is in the  investigation of various transitions the flow undergoes under  non-equilibrium conditions as the system evolves from its initial  state of very high Rayleigh number and as the convective vigor of  the system decreases over time due to cooling.  Among these  transitions are (1) the flush instabilities induced by phase  transitions, and (2) the appearance of enhanced toroidal surface  velocity fields in variable viscosity three-dimensional  convection.  A large eddy simulation methodology is developed and  implemented to accurately simulate the very high Rayleigh number  complex dynamics of the young Earth.  Mathematical tools that the  investigators develop, adapt and employ in these problems include  iterative techniques based on Krylov subspace for treating the  variable viscosity convection in the context of spectral  transform method, domain decomposition methodology for efficient  spatial resolution, and proper orthogonal decomposition and  wavelet transform techniques for efficient post-processing of the  results.       An important question that has arisen in the last few years  is the possibility of global gravitational instability that  develops in the Earth's interior due to internal phase  transition.  This instability results in episodic eruption of  superplumes from the lower mantle and associated intense volcanic  activity at the surface.  Th ere are increasing evidences from  correlation between past trench sites and cold anomalies in the  lower mantle, inferred from seismic tomography, that such  instabilities on global scale could have occurred in the past 100  million years.  This provides a possible explanation for the  extinction of the dinosaurs, but there are many aspects of this  gravitational instability still needs to be explored.  Recent  large-scale high performance simulations have also revealed that  localized patches of concentrated shear and rotation about a  vertical axis can be generated with variable viscosity under  vigorous convection.  This is an important step towards a  self-consistent explanation of the interaction between the  surface plates and mantle.  This project extends these recent  findings under idealized equilibrium conditions to more realistic  non-equilibrium conditions, as the vigorously convecting young  Earth cools over time.  Incorporation of modern numerical  techniques and recent developments in mathematical methods are  essential for the successful investigation of these complex  phenomena.  Finally, it is of interest to investigate what the  effects of these instabilities are on the long-term thermal  evolution of the Earth and Earth-like planets."

Efforts are directed toward the  study of bubbly fluids.  A goal is to develop effective equations  for such fluids.  The first step is to derive the equations of  motion for a finite collection of interacting bubbles.  The  behavior for an infinite number of bubbles is deduced from kinetic  theory, which gives rise to a kinetic equation that is a  coarse-grained description of the mixture.  This procedure has been  implemented to derive two sets of effective equations that  describe concentration and sound waves in an ideal bubbly flow.  In both situations it is observed that the spatially homogeneous  solution may be unstable.  In the first case the instability  results in the bubbles clustering and in the later case it  indicates the bubble oscillations will synchronize to each other.  A damping mechanism similar to Landau damping is found in the  stable case.  This is connected to the spectral theory of linear  operators with a continuous spectrum and has no finite-dimensional  analogue.  The investigator extends this work to investigate the  interaction of acoustic modes with convective modes.  The theory  will also be broadened to include the effects of gravity, liquid  viscosity and bubble size distribution.  With a view towards a more  general theory of bubbly flow, the investigator examines the  effects of a small, slowing varying vorticity field on an ideal  bubbly flow.  It is anticipated that the studies will be performed  in collaboration with a graduate student.  In addition to its  relevance to engineering problems, this project contains  substantial educational aspects.  The student will be exposed to  fluid mechanics, potential theory, Hamiltonian mechanics, kinetic  theory, spectral theory of linear operators, and numerical  methods.  A new graduate level mathematics class is also developed  on the numerical solution of interface problems with level sets.  The advantage of this  approach is that it handles topology changes  naturally and easily.  This class is expected to attract not only  mathematics students but science and engineering students as well,  because interface problems have wide-spread interest.       An important emphasis of this project is to further enhance  the applied mathematics program in the mathematics department at  the University of Michigan and promote education at the interface  between mathematics and engineering.  One aspect of this project is  to develop effective equations for bubbly fluids.  A bubbly fluid  is a dispersion of gas bubbles in a liquid and can be found in a  variety natural and industrial settings.  The effective equations  will give a bulk or coarse-grained description of this mixture.  At  the present time computer resources do not exist to numerically  simulate directly a bubbly fluid.  For this reason considerable  effort has been made in the development of models for bubbly  fluids.  The other aspect of the project is to incorporate  applications of mathematics in a significant portion of  mathematics classes.  At the undergraduate level, the investigator  plans to develop an enriched calculus course that focuses on  applications for engineering students.  The investigator plans to  continue redesigning a senior level partial differential equations  class to include more physics, applications, and computer-related  assignments."

The   workshops will focus on the following topics:  (1) Microstructure  and Thin   Films and (2) ""Smart"" Sensing and Control of Thin Films.  The  first   workshop will concentrate on thin films.  Computational  approaches to   modeling thin films have generally focused either on the  atomistic scale or   on the continuum scale.  However, because of the drastically  different time   and length scales involved in these disparate models, they are  not currently   linked.  This limits the ability of either model to describe the  process   adequately for industrial materials manufacturing.  Increased  computational   power will not solve this problem because strategies for scaling  up or   scaling down from these models do not yet exist.  Although  computational   power might allow scaling up in size, more sophisticated  techniques must   be developed for dealing with time scale issues.  The workshop  will bring   together mathematicians working in materials science and  materials   scientists who use modeling and simulation in order to jointly  address the   micro-macro linkage needed to understand microstructure evolution  in thin   films.  A series of talks and discussions are expected to lead to  a set of   suggestions on how to develop models using multiscaling  techniques.  The   eventual goals in realizing these suggestions are:  (1)  high-fidelity   simulations of thin-film processes which link ab initio,  calculations to   continuum microstructure/property models, and (2) approaches to  extracting   physical non-empirical models from these full simulations that  are suitable   for real-time process control.  The second workshop will also  focus on thin   films, but from a different perspective.  Controllers operate at  the macro   level.  At this  level the models are at the continuum scale and  their   evolution is dictated by partial differential equations (PDE).   Solution   techniques for PDE require the most powerful computers currently   available.  Models at this level of detail are unsuitable for  real-time process   control.  The workshop will explore research ideas on  mathematical   approaches for extracting the dominant parameters from the full  model.    Understanding the micro-macro linkage will be essential for  success in   using feedback control.  A topic of special interest of the  second workshop   is ""smart"" sensors, that is, sensors that ""understand"" the  process models and   are able to determine process parameters either directly or  indirectly using   these models.  It will emphasize algorithms which allow sensors  to infer   parameters of interest from other parameters for cases where one  cannot   directly sense a parameter that the physicochemical models  indicates is   critical to the control of the process."

Gabai indicates that certain fundamentally  important open problems in 3-manifold theory will be solved if an  appropriate understanding of solid tube neighborhoods around short  geodesics in hyperbolic 3-manifolds can be developed.  For example, if  it can be shown that sufficiently large solid tube neighborhoods can  be found in any hyperbolic 3-manifold, then it would follow that  closed (irreducible) 3-manifolds that are homotopy equivalent to  closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds are themselves hyperbolic.  This project  has as its goal to gain a deep understanding of solid tubes in  hyperbolic 3-manifolds and to apply this understanding to fundamental  problems in 3-manifold theory.  The methods employed involve  parametrizing the possible ways that shortest geodesics can sit in  hyperbolic 3-manifolds and then analyzing the resulting parameter  space by means of rigorous computer programs.  This work is joint with  D. Gabai and N. Thurston.       In the late 18th century, Henri Poincare pioneered the study of  3-manifolds.  One of his best methods was to analyze all loops in the  3-manifold in question; in particular, he studied the so-called   fundamental group of the 3-manifold.  Poincare's general question was,   if I understand the fundamental group, do I thereby understand the  3-manifold completely?  (The infamous Poincare Conjecture is a  specific instance of this general question.)  In the late 1970's and  early 1980's, William Thurston revolutionized the study of 3-manifolds  by showing that most 3-manifolds have hyperbolic structures  (hyperbolic geometry is the most important non-Euclidean geometry).  This leads to a natural and important Poincare type question: If a  compact (irreducible) 3-manifold has the same fundamental group as a  compact hyperbolic 3-manifold, must it be a hyperbolic 3-manifold as  well?  The goal of this project is to answer this question in the  affirmative.  The method is to reduce the question to an analysis of a   certain region in a 6-dimensional space that is related to solid tubes  around shortest geodesics in hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  The plan is to  break this region up into about a billion sub-boxes and to deal with  each of these sub-boxes separately.  Naturally, this involves the use  of a (rigorous!) computer program.  ***"

These methods include  parallel computation, graphical visualization, problem mapping,  memory management and data restructuring on massively parallel  and massive memory processors to solve large dimensional problems  that could not be solved by ordinary methods.  The objective is  develop fast algorithms for the optimal feedback control of  large, general, continuous time, nonlinear, stochastic dynamical  systems, perturbed by both Gaussian and distributed Poisson white  noise.  The treatment of the random jumps of Poisson processes  for modeling rare, disastrous events is a special and challenging  feature of this research.  The main application of this research  is to optimal remediation for groundwater quality in an uncertain  environment.  Other applications are to parameter uncertainty in  partially observed control systems, i.e., the dual control  problem, and to just-in-time manufacturing systems.  The  numerical approach of the investigators directly treats the  partial differential equation of stochastic dynamic programming.  New algorithms, such as spatial and state finite elements, are  used to alleviate both memory and computational demands.  Purely  parallel algorithms based on intelligent state space search are  also being developed.  The development of graphical visualization  and data management tools are essential for analyzing massive  amounts of output in many dimensions.       The investigator and associates are developing optimal  solutions to environmental and manufacturing problems when there  is some uncertainty involved.  Examples of the cause of  uncertainty in the problem are the unexpected introduction of  pollution and unknown parameters in the case of the environment,  while in the case of manufacturing an example would be the random  failure of machines.  The reason for seeking optimal solutio ns is  to minimize costs or wasting precious materials or resources.  A  large and important application that the investigator studies is  the cleanup of groundwater resources where the source of the  pollution or the underground state is uncertain.  Since polluted  groundwater sites can costs from millions to billions and more  (there are some sites for which cleanup procedures are unknown),  optimal solutions could save millions over existing sub-optimal  procedures.  Similar savings can be obtained for just-in-time  manufacturing systems that are optimally managed, enhancing our  globally competitive capabilities.  The investigator and  associates develop advanced computing techniques to compute the  optimal solutions using high performance computing, which is  essential when uncertain environments or parameters make the  amount of computation for the solution very large.  The high  performance computing involves using massive computers for fast  optimal solutions and graphical visualization to make the immense  amount of output understandable, for instance to the  environmental resource or manufacturing plant manager who would  be the prime user."

The primary research activity centers upon the continued  theoretical and practical development of generalized fast Fourier  transforms (FFTs).  Among the generalizations pursued are the  efficient computation of Fourier transforms on finite and compact  Lie groups and efficient polynomial transforms.  Current approaches  to these sorts of problems draw on the areas of group  representation theory, the theory of operator algebras and  sampling theory.  Practical considerations and goals demand that  implementational aspects such as numerical stability and  computational overhead be addressed as well, and in so doing  require the tools and techniques of numerical analysis, as well as  some knowledge of the targeted applications areas.  This sort of  interdisciplinary paradigm also informs the educational approach.  Under development are several interdisciplinary courses, intended  to increase mathematics interest and awareness among  undergraduates by highlighting the connections of mathematics to  other disciplines.       Arguably, the ``classical'' FFT is one of the most important  computational techniques ever developed.  It is the fundamental  tool behind most of digital signal processing and as such impacts  society in all aspects, playing a key role in areas such as  medical imaging, defense, telecommunications, high performance  computing, and entertainment.  The utility of the classical FFT  indicates that perhaps similar success may be obtained from  applying these newly developed generalized FFTs, and a large part  of this proposal is directed towards this end.  To date,  applications of these new computational methods have been  identified in areas such as climate modeling, image processing,  medical imaging, astronomy and statistics.  These are being pursued  actively.   The connection that this work evinces between pure  research and ``real-world'' application is tremendously useful as  an educational model.

Particular themes are  nonsymmetric linear systems, globally convergent algorithms for  nonlinear systems, algorithms of optimal order of work, and  applications on multiprocessor computer architectures.       The mathematical description of real-world problems leads  inevitably to equations to solve.  Many times the equations are  nonlinear ones, arising because the underlying problem is  nonlinear.

A consistent, fully time-dependent, nonlinear lumped  parameter model describing interactions between pressures,  volumes, and flows in intracranial space is refined, validated,  and expanded to include additional physiology, such as  cerebrovascular autoregulation and links to the spinal  cerebrospinal fluid space.  First order processes and relevant  time scales are identified using scaling and asymptotic  techniques.  To achieve the higher resolution necessary to  consider focal events, dynamic modeling within compartments and  consistent linkage of sub-models with the rest of the lumped  parameter system is explored.  Computational methods and  strategies for efficient numerical solution of the nonlinear  model equations are developed.  In particular, results obtained  using hybrid asymptotic-numerical methods show great promise in  the present context where processes occur on disparate time  scales.       This project seeks to develop a realistic yet tractable  mathematical model for pressures and fluid flows in the human  brain.  Toward this end, the current model formulation is extended  to include additional human physiology, such as cerebrovascular  autoregulation, the mechanism which maintains the blood flow in  the brain necessary for adequate oxygen transfer in the face of  fluctuating blood pressure.  New hybrid solution techniques are  developed to carry out efficient and accurate computer  simulations of pressures and flows based on the model equations.  The enhanced model is also validated by comparing its  mathematical predictions with physiological data.  Situations  involving both normal and pathophysiology are studied.  This  research is part of an interdisciplinary effort involving both  applied mathema ticians and neurosurgeons.

The focus is entirely on  increasing our basic understanding of pressures and flows in the  brain.  Once developed and validated, the enhanced mathematical  model will be useful to researchers studying applications  associated with biotechnology.  For example, regulation of the  vascular system in the brain plays a crucial role in conditions  such as trauma and stroke.  Currently, nitric oxide is emerging as  a key factor in adjusting brain blood flow.  The enhanced  mathematical model, which includes a vascular regulation  equation, can be used to study the effect of nitric oxide  synthase (NOS) inhibitors on the brain.  The development of NOS  inhibitors is a subject of great current interest to U.S.  biotechnology companies."

So far the stationary solutions have received  most attention of researchers.  However, in recent years the  importance of non-stationary patterns in brain became clear.  The  investigator studies networks which admit periodic orbits and  addresses the apparent discrepancy between discrete and  continuous time networks of this type.  While in continuous  networks one expects generally a convergence to a periodic orbit,  in discrete time networks there are stable stationary solutions.  The project investigates chaotic behaviour of a class of networks  with step-function nonlinearities.  These can be viewed as a  limiting case of a steep sigmoid nonlinearities and are easier to  handle analytically.  The delay in synaptic response of a neuron  is a recognized fact; if one wants to account for its affect the  appropriate model must be expressed in terms of delay  differential equation.  The investigator studies the  discretization of this equation and shows that this  finite-dimensional approximation captures the essential features  of the dynamics of the delay equation.       Artificial neural networks is an area on a crossroads  between artificial inteligence and neurobiology.  Mathematical  models play an important role in this area.  Neural networks try  to model some basic functions of brain (learning, recognizing  trained patterns) without trying to understand the intricate  details of how the neurons work on a chemical or physiological  level.  Neural networks are used today in many areas of apllied  science and engineering.  The network can be trained to recognize  a certain pattern, given slightly perturbed data.  This pattern  must be stationary, i.e. fixed in time.  On the other hand, there  is hardly any process in the brain which is stationary, and most  processes are periodic.  The investigator studies networks that  admit periodic patterns, to understand the relationship between  differen t models and see which one is the most suitable for  applications.  If one were able to train the networks to recognize  complicated patterns (in space and time), that would have an  immediate impact on robotics and artificial inteligence."

He collaborates with Leah  Edelstein-Keshet on models for distribution of the lengths of  actin filaments and their spatial variation within the cell.       This work attempts to apply mathematical methods to aid in  the understanding of physiological rhythms.  Many human  biological processes are governed by waxing and waning of  different quantities.  Some examples are the voltage of the heart  pacemaker, the regular drifting in and out of different brain  states during sleep and the control of oxygen flow in muscles by  rhythmic contractions of small arteries during periods of  exercise.  The approach of this work is to use computer and  mathematical models.  Computing tools and tools for the  visualization of simulations are developed as part of this work.  The main goal is to use the models to bridge the gap between  details about the microscopic workings of cells and their  consequences for behavior.   For example, when muscles work hard,  they consume oxygen and thus need more oxygen from the arteries.  Within the cells that form the arteries are special gates that  sense the amount of ""fuel"" so that as this fuel decreases, the  gates tell the artery to open up.  This feedback loop provides a  way to dynamically alter the rhythm of the artery in order to  insure that the tissue is evenly oxygenated.  Thus, by starting  at the microscopic level of these gates or channels, a model is  built that can explain how the consumption of oxygen is regulated  in tissues.  Another example occurs in the nervous system.  Information from different parts of the brain is transmitted  through special connections between nerve cells called synapses.  Reaction times and cognitive abilities depend on the speed of  this propagation as well as the prevention of propagation into  other regions of the brain.  Much is known about the reactions of  individual nerve cells to stimuli.  Models provide a way of  coupling many such cells  together in order to understand the  behavioral consequences of the individual cell properties.  Is  the whole greater than the sum of the parts?  The goal of this  proposal is to try to answer this question for a variety of  rhythmically controlled physiological processes."

Mathematical models have been limited primarily to  one-dimensional  models because of the difficulty in handling the collapsing tube,  whose shape is unknown and changing.  A three-dimensional  nonlinear viscous mathematical model with free moving boundaries  is introduced and a novel numerical method is developed to solve  the model.

The study of nonlinear dynamics has opened the way to a  new phase of population research in which experiments are focused  directly on phenomena such as equilibria, periodic and aperiodic  cycles, and chaos.  The investigators undertake a spectrum of  activities essential to the testing of nonlinear population  theory: from the translation of biology into the formal language  of mathematics, to the analysis of mathematical models, to the  development and application of statistical techniques for the  analysis of data, to the design and implementation of biological  experiments.  Laboratory populations of flour beetles of the genus  Tribolium are used in the experiments.  By means of their studies  the investigators provide rigorous experimental tests of  nonlinear population phenomena and behavior.  These include: (1)  dynamical transitions from stable equilibria, to invariant loops  (aperiodicities), to period locking, to strange attractors and  chaos; (2) transient and intermittent dynamics with aims towards  defining practical concepts of intermittency for use with  stochastic population models and the testing of some of the  unusual transient behaviors forecast by stochastic nonlinear  models; (3) the dynamics of meta-populations using beetle  populations linked by migration; and (4) the dynamical behaviors  that can be produced by the interaction of environmental  periodicities with nonlinear demographic effects.       The investigators study how biological populations (in  particular, populations of insects) fluctuate in time and how  different circumstances can lead to drastically different, and  sometimes unexpected, changes in these fluctuations.  This study  is carried out by means of an interdisciplinary program that  integrates the use of sophisticated mathematical models and  statistical analysis with the design and implementation of  l aboratory experiments using species of beetles that are  economically important insect pests.  The investigators seek to  describe and explain a variety of patterns in population  fluctuations, ranging from those that are regular and predictable  to those that are irregular and ""chaotic."" They seek to  understand the environmental conditions that give rise to these  various kinds of population behavior.  This understanding is  essential if the impact on biological populations of  environmental perturbations and manipulations (by Man or by  Nature) is to be predicted.  These impacts have far-reaching  consequences, ranging from food production and pest control to  wildlife management and the conservation of species diversity."

First-Order System Least Squares  (FOSLS) formulates the original problem as an equivalent  minimization problem by applying a least-squares principle to an  equivalent first-order system.  Hence, it represents a general  methodology that can produce a variety of algorithms, depending  on such choices as the first-order system and the least-squares  norm, and that can lead to formulations that have substantially  different numerical properties (accuracy, adaptivity, and  complexity).  The project seeks a proper first-order system and a  proper least-squares norm for formulating the original problem so  well that the numerical process (discretization and multigrid  solution) becomes straightforward and optimal.

It is now generally recognized that the prevalence of NAPLs at contaminated sites is a significant impediment to aquifer restoration.  Based upon the perceived limitations of conventional pump-and-treat methods for aquifer remediation, considerable interest is currently focused on the development of alternative remediation strategies. One of these alternative strategies is surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR).  There are three outstanding problems related to the design of successful SEAR projects.  First, relatively little attention has been focused on the mathematical modeling of fluid flow in SEAR.  Secondly, because of the limited sampling over the spatial extent of an aquifer, fluid flow and transport models will necessarily have large uncertainty in the presence of heterogeneity.  Thirdly, the very large computations involved in simulation of the SEAR process require algorithms that are both reliable and efficient.    Because of the complexities involved in the SEAR process, the proposed research will bring together the expertise from several disciplines, namely geosciences research, petroleum engineering and applied mathematics.  The investigators propose to develop models and numerical algorithms to simulate the initial dispersal of organic contaminants and later cleanup by means of' surfactant floods. These numerical algorithms will employ complex multi-phase flow models, state-of-the-art geostatistical methods and modem numerical techniques such as adaptive mesh refinement, dynamic upscaling of physical properties and object-oriented programming.  The computations will be performed on workstations, and on supercomputers employing parallel processing.  Graphical user interfaces and interactive visualization techniques will be developed."

One studies dynamical systems to explain and make  predictions about a vast range of phenomena, from the motions of  the stars and planets, to the circulation of the Earth's  atmosphere, to the behavior of machinery such as drilling rigs  and human hearts, to the self-propulsion of bacteria.  In  describing such phenomena, which are repetitive in character,  models in the form of iterated maps from some space to itself  frequently have great explanatory and predictive power.  Perhaps  the simplest class of realistic models is that of continuous maps  of two-dimensional surfaces.  Even simple members of this class  can exhibit a bewildering complexity of behavior, and many  questions about these systems have yet to be answered.  Maps of  punctured surfaces are of interest because of their bearing on  the relationships among periodic orbits and on long-standing  problems of the theory of knots.  The purpose of this project is  to develop a software tool for experimentation in the topological  properties of maps of punctured surfaces.  Topological properties,  those that ar e persistent under distortions of the surface or  map, are the most fundamental.  The software is made available via  the World Wide Web."

The first component of the project is  concerned with studying this question in the context of the  complicated algorithms used by software codes; this is primarily  an analytical study requiring an understanding of the  discontinuous dynamical systems generated by these algorithms.

The study of nonlinear dynamics has opened the way to a  new phase of population research in which experiments are focused  directly on phenomena such as equilibria, periodic and aperiodic  cycles, and chaos.  The investigators undertake a spectrum of  activities essential to the testing of nonlinear population  theory: from the translation of biology into the formal language  of mathematics, to the analysis of mathematical models, to the  development and application of statistical techniques for the  analysis of data, to the design and implementation of biological  experiments.  Laboratory populations of flour beetles of the genus  Tribolium are used in the experiments.

Archetypal analysis is a new statistical  method for extracting relevant features from experimental data sets that  has been developed by Cutler and Breiman (Technometrics 1995).  Archetypes characterize extreme data values (those lying on the convex  hull of the data set), and can be thought of as a variation of principal  component analysis, which is also called the proper orthogonal or  Karhunen-Loeve (KL) decomposition by the dynamical systems community.  One of the goals of this project is to compare and  contrast the two  methods, the KL decomposition and Archetypes, in their application to  several experimental dynamical systems, both physical and numerical.  Data sets possessing traveling structures present a special problem to  those hoping to reduce them using the KL decomposition. If the traveling  structure is sufficiently regular the eigenfunctions will be sines  and cosines, since the decomposition produces a Fourier basis from data  that are translationally invariant. Therefore, in situations where the  traveling structure itself is the feature to be extracted, a straight  application the KL decomposition will not suffice.  The proposers are  developing a method that builds on Archetypal analysis to analyze data  with translating coherent structures, by finding, in an objective manner,  archetypes that move with the traveling structure.  The shape of the  structure itself is extracted (or possibly shapes, if the structure  itself is varying as well as translating) along with information on how  the structure is moving across the spatial domain.  Finally, along with  the pattern recognition  problems mentioned above, the third goal of the  proposed research is determining the feasibility of using archetypes as  a basis upon which to do a Galerkin projection of the governing  equations of the dynamical system (when they exist), for modeling  purposes.  %%%  Understan ding, predicting and modeling complex dynamical systems is one  of the preoccupations of the dynamical systems community today.  The  family of techniques dubbed ""dynamical systems theory"" utilized in  this effort is expanding rapidly and in many directions, incorporating  ideas from such diverse fields as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  With the advent of high-speed, large capacity computers, more complex  methods from statistics have become practical in the analysis of data  from dynamical systems.  One such method is archetypal analysis, a new  statistical technique which models the state of the system at a given  time as a mixture of extreme states. The proposers study the application  of archetypal analysis to dynamical systems.  They are comparing  archetypal analysis with other statistical procedures for dynamical  systems, and are developing a new variant of archetypal analysis to  handle moving waves.  The research is interdisciplinary in nature,  involving ideas from statistics, mathematics, and physics.    ***"

One aspect of the project is the  study of the application of threshold partitioning algorithms for  sparse matrices.  The emphasis of the project is on singular  systems.       Singular systems of equations arise in many applications,  including certain types of differential equations modeling  physical phenomena, Markov chains, and queuing models.  Markov  chains are used, e.g., to evaluate the performance of computer  systems, while queuing models in particular simulate traffic in  telecommunication networks.  This project develops fast methods  for solving linear systems of equations, particularly singular  systems.  The methods are iterative: starting from an initial  guess at the solution of a system, the method produces a sequence  of approximate solutions that approaches the actual solution.  Asynchronous methods for parallel computers refer to methods in  which part of the computation is performed in each processor in  an asynchronous way, i.e., without synchronization between the  processors.  In other words, each processor proceeds with its  tasks, using the information available at any given moment  without waiting for the other processors to finish their tasks.  Processors do not wait: they keep active computing better  approximations to the solutions.  Therefore the overall solution  time can be greatly reduced.  The variables of the differential  equations, of the Markov chains, or of the queuing models, may be  partitioned naturally into sets of variables, e.g., by the  near-connectivity of the nodes of a network or graph.  This  partition induces a particular block structure in the matrix  representing the linear system to be solved.  Asynchronous  parallel methods are well suited to deal with these blocks.  New  partitioning algorithms that take into account the values of the  matrix are explored.  The discre tizations of many differential  equations, such as certain convection-diffusion equations, give  rise to matrices with coefficients varying over a wide range of  values, i.e., some large and some very small.  These problems are  very hard to solve in practice, and most modern iterative methods  fail to converge.  The methods that do converge are very expensive  or very slow.  Partitioning algorithms that take into account  these values can be used to permute these matrices so that the  large coefficients lie along the diagonal of the matrix.  Parts of  this permuted matrix, e.g., its blocks along the diagonal, can be  used as an effective preconditioner.  Preliminary experiments  indicate that this approach leads to fast convergence.  Thus, the  project can provide a method to efficiently solve a class of  important problems in science and engineering."

Outstanding conjectures have fallen, one  after the other, with the application of hyperbolic techniques.  There has  been a shift in the entire approach to low dimensional topology, as  researchers now use rigid geometric arguments to prove topological  theorems.  The investigators intend to continue their research, both   individually and jointly, on the theory and computation of hyperbolic   3-manifolds.  Through a set of projects, many relying heavily on their   ability to compute examples on the computer, the researchers plan to further   the understanding of the connections between hyperbolic 3-manifolds, the   invariants that come out of hyperbolic 3-manifold theory, and the traditional   topological invariants in 3-manifold theory.       A sphere, a torus and a 2-holed torus are examples of topologically  distinct 2-dimensional surfaces.  For about 100 years mathematicians have  known that the only possible (finite) surfaces are the n-holed tori and a  corresponding family of nonorientable surfaces (e.g., the nonorientable  surface corresponding to a 1-holed torus is a Klein bottle).  In contrast,  the topological possibilities for a 3-dimensional space are vastly richer.  The beautiful relationships among the possible 3-dimensional spaces have  been greatly clarified since 1978, when William Thurston discovered that  the best way to understand the topology of the spaces was to give them  shapes of constant curvature.  The present project continues to explore the  relationships between the curvature and the topology.  Because  the shapes can be computed by hand only in a very few cases, the  project also continues to develop and support computer software for  creating the spaces and studying their properties.  This NSF funded  software is freely available, and it is used not only by mathematicians, but  also by cosmologists seeking to model the shape of the real  universe, and  by physicists modelling the behavior of various dynamical systems.  ***"

In particular, it is   proposed to analyze the effects of the small scale dissipation or relaxation   processes on large scale physical quantities and their motions. Other   questions such as global existence of both strong and weak solutions,   nonlinear stability of basic wave patterns, uniqueness of weak entropy   solutions, layer behavior of solutions, numerical methods for the computation   of discontinuous flows, and fluid-dynamic limit for kinetic models are also   to be explored. It is planned to continue the current effort to expand the   existing techniques and to develop new tools for studying some of these   problems. One of the main idea is to refine the conventional methods designed   to study smooth flows or unrelaxed systems by taking into account more   internal structures of the underlying discontinuous flows, and study these   problems both theoretically and numerically.    %%%   Nonlinear evolution of partial differential equations arising from   physical balance laws govern many of the most widely encountered phenomena in   nature. Solutions to these nonlinear systems remain a central topic in the   study of wave propagations and are fundamental to the understanding of basic    physical phenomena ranging from compressible and incompressible fluids,   acoustic waves and electromagnetic scattering to wave propagations in   nonlinear composite materials, in reactive gas mixtures, in fiber optics,  as well as in magnetohydrodynamics and general relativity. In this project,   It is proposed to study some of the basic questions for these nonlinear   systems, which are motivated directly by important applications to many fields   such as image processing, aeronautics, composite material, sonar, radar,   medical imaging, geophysical exploration, weather prediction, oil reservoir   simulations etc.. For example, the proposed study of design of high resolution   multi-dimensional numerical methods for calculating sharp fronts for mixed   type partial differential equations is extremely important for the oil   reservoir simulations, design of composite materials, imaging processing,   and propagation of pollutants such as oil in water and air; the proposed   study of boundary layer theory is one of the key ingredients in the   understanding of turbulence, and the design of supersonic aircrafts, etc..   Thus the accomplishment of this project should be of considerable importance   in the improvement and new development of technologies in the above mentioned   fields.  ***"

Preliminary work done by the  investigator finds a family of stable mixed elements on some  macro-element type grids.   This result indicates the possibility  of finding the minimal polynomial degree of continuous piecewise  polynomials for the velocity where one degree less piecewise  polynomials are employed to approximate the pressure and the  mixed elements are stable; this has been an open problem for more  than a decade.

The difficulty in the design of  both the mixed elements and the iterative methods is to treat the  incompressible condition.  The investigator develops computer algorithms for some  well-known equations in incompressible fluid dynamics.  Problems  of incompressible computational fluid dynamics arise throughout  industry and science.  There are difficult challenges in  developing these methods involving limits of computer memory and  speed,  as well as accuracy and robustness of the method itself.

Often in soldering and other processes involving spreading, the drop may   become very thin which indicates the presence of multiple length scales.    Based on the author's previous research, the first approach proposed is a   multi-scale asymptotic analysis (lubrication theory) to derive nonlinear   diffusion equations for the free surfaces; those nonlinear diffusion equations   will be  solved using a spectrally-accurate implementation of the method of   lines.  All quantities of interest may be computed in this approximation   once the required free surfaces have been found. A second approach is also   proposed, via boundary integral equations, under the approximation of   Stokes flow in the drop and film.  This approach relaxes the  requirement   that the drop and film be thin, but still requires that the flow be slow.  We   propose making a direct comparison between the two approaches in order to   evaluate the utility of each in various situations.  The work proposed will   develop models only for the fluid dynamics, and inclusion of reactive   effects will be proposed in a subsequent project.    Important processes in manufacturing involve the spreading of a fluid   droplet in the presence of another fluid; one example is soldering, where, in   many instances, the presence of a thin layer of a second fluid, the flux, is   required for the process to work at all.  Because the use of lead-based solder   is no longer allowed, understanding of this droplet spreading process for   other kind of solder materials would be very helpful in understanding   alternative solder materials. The work proposed in the project is developing   some preliminary models necessary for the development of a complete   model for a spreading solder drop. The proposed program  is to develop   theory for the spreading of a droplet on a flat plate that is covered by a thin   film of a different fluid. Computer codes will be developed that predict how   fast the drop spreads, and the shapes of the drop and the film that covers the   drop. In summary, sophisticated mathematical techniques will be applied to   a problem of technological importance.  The computer codes resulting from   this project are expected to be applicable to related wetting problems in   different technological areas (e.g. coating processes) subsequent to the   completion of this project."

It is now generally recognized that the prevalence of NAPLs at contaminated sites is a significant impediment to aquifer restoration.  Based upon the perceived limitations of conventional pump-and-treat methods for aquifer remediation, considerable interest is currently focused on the development of alternative remediation strategies. One of these alternative strategies is surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR).  There are three outstanding problems related to the design of successful SEAR projects.  First, relatively little attention has been focused on the mathematical modeling of fluid flow in SEAR.  Secondly, because of the limited sampling over the spatial extent of an aquifer, fluid flow and transport models will necessarily have large uncertainty in the presence of heterogeneity.  Thirdly, the very large computations involved in simulation of the SEAR process require algorithms that are both reliable and efficient.    Because of the complexities involved in the SEAR process, the proposed research will bring together the expertise from several disciplines, namely geosciences research, petroleum engineering and applied mathematics.  The investigators propose to develop models and numerical algorithms to simulate the initial dispersal of organic contaminants and later cleanup by means of' surfactant floods. These numerical algorithms will employ complex multi-phase flow models, state-of-the-art geostatistical methods and modem numerical techniques such as adaptive mesh refinement, dynamic upscaling of physical properties and object-oriented programming.  The computations will be performed on workstations, and on supercomputers employing parallel processing.  Graphical user interfaces and interactive visualization techniques will be developed."

This proposal focuses on one problem that is of fundamental importance in nonlinear dynamics, and is potentially of great importance in ecological systems: the phenomenon of supertransients in spatially-extended chaotic systems.  Specifically, we will investigate the origin of supertransients, and develop a quantitative scaling theory to explain how and why the lifetime of supertransients increases with system size.  This theory will be developed first for a simple, analyzable model, then to test this theory on a number of model spatiotempral chaotic systems.  We will investigate supertransients in several realistic ecological model systems, and focus on the potential for supertransiency to promote the long term (though not indefinite) coexistence of competing species, and how such coexistence is influenced by system size.  'Me models involve competition among species in patches, with localized dispersal among patches.  This work will contribute to a long-standing debate in ecology about the importance of nonequilibrial dynamics in understanding patterns in species diversity, and the influence of spatial scale on species coexistence.    A full understanding of the dynamics of physical and biological systems requires a consideration of transient dynamics away from equilibrium.  Recently, it has become recognized that realistic models of spatially-distributed ecological systems can exhibit superlong 'chaotic' transients before equilibrium is reached, wherein for all practical purposes a system never reaches its ultimate equilibrium.  Our research focuses on characterizing quantitatively the phenomenon of supertransient behaviors in mathematical models, using both mathematical analyses and extensive numerical simulations, and on ascertaining the potential relevance of supertransients for import ant, unresolved questions in ecology, in particular the long-term coexistence of species competing for limiting resources, but able to disperse in space in heterogeneous, patchy landscapes."

The   development of efficient numerical techniques for the large-scale simulation   is extremely important in understanding these porous media flows.  Due to   wave-like or traveling front problems and highly localized natures in the   coupled differential systems and the enormous size of many reservoir   simulation problems, an important goal of efficient numerical modeling is   the ability to effectively model these effects and the utilization of new   supercomputer architectures.  This project will  concentrate on the   development of finite element methods, computational codes, and   supporting mathematical analysis for underground contamination flows.    The numerical methods will be designed to simulate such complex features   of the flows as shock-line saturation fronts and steep composition gradients,   to produce accurate fluid velocities, to conserve mass locally, and to take   advantage of new parallel supercomputers. Self-adaptive local grid-  refinement methods and efficient implementation techniques for iterative   solution of large linear systems are also studied.    A three-year program of research is proposed into the development of   accurate numerical techniques, efficient computational codes, and   supporting mathematical analysis for  modeling of multiphase flows and   transport in groundwater hydrology which has applications in design of   remediation and cleanup technologies.  The development of improved   methods for assessing groundwater contamination by hazardous wastes  has become increasingly important.  Indeed, groundwater supplies are   increasingly threatened by organic, inorganic, and radioactive contaminants   introduced into the environment by improper disposal or acci dental release.    Estimates of remediation costs at U.S. government sites alone range into the   hundreds of billions of dollars. Protecting the quality of groundwater   supplies is a grand challenge problem of broad societal importance.  There   are also a number of industrial applications of the proposed research.  The   production and management of oil reservoirs are governed by equations and  technologies that are nearly identical to those exploited in groundwater   hydrology.  The manufacture of high quality fiber reinforced plastic   composites for automotive and aerospace applications is controlled by   technology similar to that studied in this project.  Design of semiconductors   uses equations very analogous to those for groundwater transport.  In these   areas, technology transfer can be easily carried out: use of the codes   developed for, industrial collaboration with the researchers of, and   employment of students trained on this project."

This is motivated by the desire to improve the   performance of computer programs that simulate the dynamics of   biomolecules, with particular attention to the MDScope simulation program   NAMD/SIgMA.  Much of the proposed work is general and applies directly   to a variety of applications modeled by Hamiltonian systems, such as   astrophysics, some structural dynamics problems, and wave propagation.    Some of the work is less general but can be adapted to other applications.    Typically, the complicated dynamics of Hamiltonian systems is a combined   effect of many simple interactions, often having a range of time scales.  A   key emphasis of the research is the development of sound ""long-timestep""   methods, which exploit the slowness present in many components of the   motion and the possible regularity present in other components.  More   specifically, such methods evaluate some interactions at time increments   that well exceed half the period of the fast modes of the system.  Another   emphasis is the design of time stepping schemes that can compute long   trajectories having the right qualities.  A specific goal is the construction of   a multiple time stepping scheme that can be used both with long timesteps   and for long-time simulations--existing schemes fail in one respect or the   other.  Another specific goal is to reduce the cost of certain calculations,   such as inverse-square-law forces, by reducing their accuracy without   sacrificing qualitative properties.    Mathematical formulas are being devised that can predict typical motions of   large molecules such as proteins and DNA.  The aim is find shortcuts that   enable very fast calculations on large computers.  These ideas are tested for   accuracy and speed, and the more useful ones are put into the software that   biologis ts and other scientists use to study the action of molecules.    Computer simulations can help the scientist to understand how molecules   perform biological functions, which can be very difficult to observe   experimentally. Such studies are also useful in the design of molecules for   agricultural and medical purposes.  Much of the proposed work is general   and extends to other applications in which dissipation is negligible, such as   astrophysics, some structural dynamics problems, and wave propagation."

Basic analyses of the governing systems of nonlinear partial   differential equations will also be undertaken.    Multiple scales problems are difficult because the uniform resolution of the   smallest scales present would lead to a prohibitively large computational   problem, even for the fastest machines likely to be available in the coming   decades. They are also a common feature of scientifically and   technologically important phenomena in a number of distinct physical   settings.

In   the latter case they are generally associated with singular perturbations of   the governing equations. Singular perturbations may be thought of as small   changes in the equations which can lead to large qualitative and quantitative   changes in the solutions.

The following topics are studied: (1)  computation and bifurcations of invariant tori, (2) computation  of Lyapunov exponents and applications, (3) orthogonal  factorizations for time-dependent matrices and applications, (4)  Riccati equations, (5) logarithms of matrices and matrix  interpolation.  In each case the project combines theoretical  analysis and extensive computational testing, and develops  working codes.  Several aspects of this research are being carried  out in collaboration with Timo Eirola, Jens Lorenz, Erik Van  Vleck, Alessandra Papini, Aldo Pasquali, and Ph.D. students  Michael Keeve and Benedetta Morini.  The investigator analyzes and  implements algorithms to compute invariant tori of  parameter-dependent dynamical systems and to study their  bifurcations.  He studies ways to monitor Lyapunov type numbers on  the tori in order to detect their smoothness and understand and  classify their bifurcations and breakdown mechanisms.  The whole  issue of computation of Lyapunov type numbers (or Lyapunov  exponents) is also considered.  Quantitative information on these  numbers is needed in order to obtain a reliable stability picture  for time-dependent linear systems and nonlinear systems.  He  examines applications of this tool to error control.  Efficient  and reliable techniques for computation of Lyapunov exponents  require study of orthogonal factorizations of time-dependent  matrices.  The investigator works on numerical solution of Riccati  equations, and develops an integration code based on Gauss  Runge-Kutta schemes.  He studies techniques for computation of  logarithms of matrices, emphasisizing the case of a sequence of  slowly varying matrices and its application to interpolants of  matrices.  Finally, he is writing a book on numerical dynamical  systems with emphasis on direct approximation techniques .       Differential equations are one of the most powerful models  to describe physical phenomena.  They provide a compact  description of a system by giving a continuous description of how  a given position in (phase) space of a system at a particular  time influences neighboring positions in the immediate future.  The price for such a compact description is that we then need to  solve the differential equation in order to obtain information  about the system.  Solving the differential equation, except in  trivial cases, cannot be done exactly, and we must resort to  numerical techniques.  The investigator devises numerical  techniques for differential equations, motivated by the following  question: What should we approximate, what should we monitor?  Existing techniques are typically very reliable at tracking a  specific solution (a trajectory) of the equation over a short  time interval, but they are inadequate to provide a complete  description of the system, which would need knowledge about many  solutions over long time intervals.  This need is particularly  true for models of complicated phenomena, which may take the form  of systems of coupled oscillators and coupled nonlinear  differential equations, or high-dimensional time-varying matrix  equations.  These cases are of interest in this project and find  applications in almost all applied sciences: from the study of  complicated biological and chemical interactions, to the optimal  control of time-dependent manufacturing processes, to stability  assessment for time-dependent phenomena in general.  In concrete,  the following issues are studied. (1) For many systems, all  solutions eventually approach a finite region of phase space, and  then stay there afterwards.  The investigator devises techniques  that target directly such eventual finite regions, to avoid  transient behavior. (2) A differential equation, because it  mimics a given physical system, usually has built in some key  properties.  For example, in modeling a rigid rotat ion, the  solutions of the differential equation should be rigid rotations.  Unfortunately, most numerical techniques will fail at preserving  even such a seemingly simple characteristic.  The failure of a  numerical method to preserve essential characteristics might have  very unpleasant effects.  The investigator works on techniques  that maintain the relevant geometrical properties of the  solutions. (3) For a given model, the fundamental question is the  one of stability.  How robust is the model? How sensitive are  solutions to small changes in the model? Or, in a deceivingly  different but mathematically equivalent way, how fast is a system  approaching its eventual state? The investigator studies ways to  monitor indicators in order to answer these questions, and also  applies this study to assess error propagation during  discretization."

These problems give rise to challenging   nonlinear initial boundary value problems, the mathematical statements of   which involve one or more nonlinear parabolic equations, governing  the   diffusion of heat and the diffusion of a chemical concentration, and the time   harmonic version of Maxwell's equations.  These equations are coupled   together in a nonlinear fashion and, in addition, nonlinear heat balances are   required in certain applications where surface temperatures produce  significant thermal radiation.  It is proposed to develop and use asymptotic   methods, dictated by certain physical limits, to simplify the mathematical   systems and to develop and use numerical methods to solve the reduced   problems.    The goals of the project are twofold.  The first is the mathematical   understanding of the basic physical mechanisms which make the processes   work.  Such an understanding would give scientists and engineers involved   in microwave processing of ceramics the basic scientific underpinnings to   judge and interpret their experimental findings. The second is the   development and application of asymptotic, numerical, and other    approximate methods required to obtain an accurate description of more   realistic and complicated processes. The successful completion of the   proposed research would allow engineers and scientists to design more   efficient sintering and joining processes for ceramics which would produce   higher quality materials.  It would also help in the design and   implementation of microwave assisted vapor deposition processes which are   highly promising in the construction of composite ceramic materials."

Griffeath exploits this ""symbiosis"" in his theoretical and empirical studies of cellular automaton dynamics and other nonlinear spatial interactions. On the theoretical side, this work is giving rise to an increasingly rich and illuminating rigorous theory of Threshold Growth, a new paradigm for discrete-time parallel updating of lattice configurations. On the empirical side, Griffeath is developing effective, interactive simulation tools for the study of complex spatial systems, designing two platforms in parallel: (a) a high-end simulator based on the new CAM8 cellular automaton machine from MIT, of which he has one of the first few prototypes in the world; and (b) a low-end 32-bit Windows 95 simulator and graphical front end called WinCA. Over the next three years, among the types of dynamical system Griffeath intends to study using this hybrid methodology are various cellular automata, interacting particle systems, and individual-based models that serve as prototypes for such complex phenomena as nucleation, spiral formation in excitable media, the shape theory of crystal growth, flocking, host-parasite interactions, dendritic growth, and phase separation by surface tension.    Mathematical models for growth and competition have played a key role in the development of spatial complex systems theory since the mid 1950's. An extensive body of theory and applications, for both random and deterministic systems, has been developed, especially over the past twenty years. Modeling of such fundamental phenomena as aggregation, emergence of shape, interfacial competition, and droplet interaction sheds new light on many areas of applied science. Griffeath's work during the next funding period will be motivated especially by problems elicited from the spatial mathematical ecology community, as identi fied during an interdisciplinary conference that he organized at the Santa Fe Institute during January, 1996. He expects that the various simulation tools he is developing will be able to provide new insights into questions of genuine interest to that clientele, and that a substantial body of interesting new pure mathematics will result as well."

Unlike classical schemes,  such schemes have the advantage that the errors do not depend on  an inverse power of the small parameter epsilon, and hence do not  become unbounded as epsilon approaches zero.  The aim of this  project is to develop methods for a number of nonlinear ordinary  differential equations, and linear and nonlinear partial  differential equations of elliptic and parabolic type, using  meshes that are condensed (refined) in the boundary layers.   These meshes usually involve at least one free parameter.  They  investigate the influence of these parameters on the accuracy of  the approximation and the speed of convergence of linear and  nonlinear solvers.  The investigator implements these methods on  parallel (shared memory) and distributed computers.  This  involves theoretical work on convergence of Schwarz type methods  of domain decomposition and their parallel variants, as well as  comparisons of the efficiency of various parallel and sequential  methods.  They also study efficient solvers for the linear  systems arising from these problems, which can be highly  nonsymmetric for small epsilon.    Singularly perturbed differential equations are pervasive in  applications of mathematics to problems in the sciences and  engineering.  Among these are the Navier-Stokes equations of  fluid flow at high Reynolds number, the drift-diffusion equations  of semiconductor device physics, the Michaelis-Menten theory for  enzyme reactions, and mathematical models of liquid crystal  materials and of chemical reactions.  The development of  efficient generalizable methods for such equations, which yield  guaranteed bounds on the error independent of the value of the  small perturbation parameter, is thus of considerable  significance in a number of important areas."

They propose to investigate a broad range of areas in harmonic analysis, operator theory, function theory, and differential equations.  Specific areas of research include analysis of Bergman and Hardy spaces and the operators which act on them, the relationship between the geometry of complex domains and the associated function theory and operator theory,   the theory of wavelets and related constructions and the applications of those tools and ideas in theoretical and computational problems, and harmonic analysis on trees and the exploration of the analogies between analysis on trees and continuous harmonic analysis.     The principal investigators propose research programs in harmonic analysis (in the broad sense).  One of the basic unifying viewpoints in harmonic analysis is the development of systematic techniques to decompose complicated objects into simple, well understood, pieces put together in a straightforward way.  In many cases these same techniques, which were first developed to understand theoretical mathematical constructs, can also be   adapted productively to the analysis and manipulation of data and images.  An important recent example of this is the development of new waveform technologies which have provided important new tools in signal processing.  The detailed research proposed includes both theoretical and applied components.  The latter center on expanding the range of applicability of the new adapted waveforms techniques such as wavelets. Those techniques, originally developed for use in theoretical mathematics, have already   provided important new tools in signal processing.  It appears that they these ideas have great potential for further development as tools for computation and for data analysis.  That development is one of the themes of the proposed research."

This model replaces the usual finite linear  system with an integral equation in which the unknown is a Borel  measure. The research includes an analysis of the convergence  properties of this algorithm, numerical methods of implementation by  spline and wavelet bases, and an analysis of the smoothing effects of  these bases.  The convergence results provide mathematical reasons in  terms of the regularity properties of Borel measures, for the  seeming divergence of the numerical implementations of the finite  dimensional EM-ML algorithm. Also, since the EM-ML algorithm has been  recently extended to linear integral equations in which the kernel and  the unknown function are nonnegative, these results provide important  insight into the open problem of convergence of this algorithm. In  addition, the research introduces, analyzes, and develops novel  algorithms for dealing with data errors due to accidental coincidences  and attenuation. The proposers also investigate the mathematical  properties of the probability functions which link the emissions to  the detector geometry in both PET and single photon emission computed  tomography (SPECT). Preliminary work for SPECT links these functions  to the classical Poisson kernel. This study is important for  developing accurate, efficient, fast, alternatives to the EM-ML  reconstruction algorithm.  %%%  The mathematical realization of many problems in science, engineering,  and medicine, give rise to inverse problems which are ill-posed in the  sense of Hadamard, and in which positivity plays an important role.  This proposal deals mainly with the particular example of such a  problem occuring in the nuclear imaging procedure of PET. In this  procedure, a patient is given a radiopharmaceutical which is absorbed  disprop ortionately by various regions of the organ of interest and  emits positrons according to the amount absorbed. These emissions are  collected by PET scanners which surround the region of interest and  then used in reconstruction algorithms which generate images  containing important information about the metabolism of an organ or  region of interest. This information is extremely useful for blood  flow and metabolic activity studies. For instance, it is a valuable  tool in the diagnosis of tumors, in determining their rates of growth;  in psychological studies for mapping activation areas of the brain to  cognitive tasks, in determining the effects of various drugs on the  brain, and in quantitative measures of the health of the human heart.  The proposers develop a refined mathematical model for the PET process  and introduce novel mathematical and numerical methods for the  reconstruction of PET images. These reconstruction algorithms are  sufficiently flexible to deal with significant errors in the PET data,  caused by anatomical obstructions which prevent some of the emitted  photons from being registered in the appropriate detector. An  important component of this work is the development and evaluation of  efficient, reliable, accurate algorithms for reconstructing PET  images.  Although primarily directed to PET studies, the  results obtained in this reserach are also applicable to other medical  and engineering problems, such as those which occur in liver biopsies,  nondestructive evaluation of manufactured items, and the restoration  of blurred images from outer space.    ***"

The project  concentrates on parallel domain decomposition methods for  incompressible viscous flow, implemented in a distributed  environment and applying the methods to problems of significant  interest.  The investigator runs a domain decomposition code in a  distributed computing environment using message passing.  The  code uses the finite difference method with the incompressible  Navier-Stokes equations to solve for flow in nonsimple  geometries.  He analyzes the solution of linear systems by  distributed relaxation methods and other methods suitable for  distributed computing environments.  He analyzes further recent  convergence results for the GMRES(m) algorithm, a very robust  method with wide applicability.  The investigator has recently  analyzed parallel computing methods and shown that synchronous  methods are faster than asynchronous methods for a significant  class of methods.  He extends this work to a wider class of  methods and use more powerful analytical methods to analyze  parallel computations.  The current code uses the PVM library to  pass boundary values between domains.       This project studies how best to solve some large numerical  problems using parallel computation.  For many of these  computations, algorithms can be devised so that the total effort  is split into several large pieces that are linked together.  For  example, determining the flow pattern of water past a submarine  can be split into the flow near the front, middle, and rear, as  well as the flow farther away from the submarine.  For these four  regions, if the solution is known in any three of the regions,  the flow in the fourth region can be determined.  This leads to  an iterative method for computing the flow: assuming that the  flow is correct in three regions, a flow in the other region can  be computed.  This resulting total flow can then be used to  com pute a new flow in each region, and this process can be  continued until it converges to the correct answer.  The  computations can be greatly speeded up if they are done for each  region simultaneously, that is in parallel.  There are a number  of issues related to this sort of computation.  The computation  can proceed in a synchronous fashion, with a new round of updates  beginning only after all have finished, or the updates could be  done asynchronously, with a new update for a region beginning as  soon as the previous update for that region is completed.  For  some problems it can be shown that the synchronous computations  are faster.  Some other iterative methods, in particular one  called GMRES, are usually faster than the simple iteration  described above.  GMRES uses past information to guide the  computation of the next update toward a better result.  The  investigator implements this in parallel and studies the gain in  efficiency that results.  One of the project's goals is to  determine how to best decompose certain large problems to better  utilize high performance computing environments."

Mathematically, interface problems usually lead to  differential equations whose input data and solutions have  discontinuities or non-smoothness across interfaces.  Many  numerical methods designed for smooth solutions do not work  efficiently for interface problems.  The investigator's colleague  Zhilin Li combines the immersed interface method, a second order  method for solving differential equations involving interfaces,  with the level set approach, an efficient method  for capturing  moving fronts, to develop high order accurate and efficient  numerical methods for interface problems.  The project develops  convergence and stability theory to provide theoretical  justification for the proposed methods.  Several specific  interface problems, including elliptic and parabolic equations  with fixed or moving interfaces, Hele-Shaw flow, and other  applications, are studied in depth.       Many important practical problems lead to differential  equations in regions of 2- or 3-dimensional space that are  geometrically complicated, and that contain interfaces across  which the nature of the solution changes.  These equations can  rarely be solved exactly, and large-scale computation is required  to obtain well-resolved solutions over multi-dimensional regions.  The goal of this work is to develop efficient computational  methods to approximate solutions of such problems.  The approach  is to combine two different methods with complementary strengths.  To test the new method, it is applied to several problems  representative of those with arising in practical applications."

With this approach,  an MMPDE is formulated explicitly based upon the heat flow  equation and the theory of harmonic maps.  The MMPDE is employed  to move the mesh, to concentrate nodes in regions where the  physical solution has large variations, and to control certain  mesh qualities, in particular the skewness.  Techniques are  investigated to discretize and solve efficiently the extended  system consisting of the underlying physical PDE and the MMPDE.  A  number of related issues are considered - e.g., the computation  of a reference mesh for an arbitrary connected domain, the use of  flow directional control, the study of preconditioning  techniques, the examination of the space-time finite element  method, and the investigation of robustness and reliability of  the method.  Moreover, the method is applied to problems in  airfoil analysis and wing design, moving boundary problems, and  problems involving blow-up solutions.  The new algorithms and  computational techniques are simultaneously implemented in  mathematical software that could find widespread usage among  scientists and engineers.       This project is concerned with the development of new  computational methods that are essential to enhance the ability  of scientists and engineers to solve large scale computational  problems that are crucial to our economy, environment, and  security.  The research is focused on development of so-called  adaptive numerical techniques, where the special features of the  particular problem being solved are adapted to.  More  specifically, the places (mesh points) where the solution to the  scientific problem is being approximated are moved with time to  adapt to the changes in the solu tion.  Mesh adaptation has  recently played an indispensable role in the numerical solution  of the problems, as, supercomputers notwithstanding, such  problems can generally not otherwise be solved satisfactorily.  This is because in many problems of science and engineering,  there is a small portion of the physical domain where large  changes in the solution occur over very small separations in the  mesh.  Numerical solution of these problems using fixed uniform  meshes is formidable because millions of mesh points are required  to resolve the physical phenomena.  On the other hand, use of  adaptive mesh methods can significantly reduce the number of mesh  points and thus economies can be gained.  Unlike other adaptive  mesh methods, the moving mesh method under study changes the mesh  smoothly in time to adapt to the key solution features.  It is  suitable for parallel computing.  The moving mesh method should be  very useful in the numerical simulation of many industrial  manufacturing problems.  A particular area is airfoil analysis and  wing design.  For example, in the airfoil and wing design the  airfoil or wing shape is computed when a pressure distribution is  specified.  It will save computing resources tremendously if the  flow solution and the computational mesh, and hence the airfoil  shape, can be updated simultaneously, as these methods do.  This  advantage holds for a variety of other applications as well, such  as the problem of studying how and why industrial and house fires  start.  The investigator believes that a `moving mesh' approach is  the best way to reduce computing time and improve accuracy, and  that the actual technology transfer for these methods is close at  hand."

Specific instances that  arise in various application areas, such as the approximation of  polytopes by smaller polytopes, are given special attention.  Extensions, such as approximation under various metrics, also are  considered. (2) Application of high performance computing to  solve or to advance toward the solution of a number of  long-standing problems in convex geometry.  An important example  is Mahler's conjecture on the volume-product of a convex body and  its polar body.

The investigator seeks to understand  vision from the perspective of Bayesian statistics, as one of  modeling and learning the `priors' of visual signals and of  finding algorithms for efficiently sampling the posterior  probability distribution on the unobserved 3D world variables.  More specifically, he constructs a larger, more inclusive,  probability model for vision based on a pyramid architecture that  combines low-level texture segmentation with high-level object  recognition.  He seeks more effective algorithms for sampling the  posterior or making `near-MAP (maximum a posteriori probability)'  estimates by combining region growing and genetic algorithm  ideas.

The ability to see, to transform raw measurements  of light in a camera or on the retina into a symbolic description  of the world being seen, is an extremely challenging problem for  these methods.  Vision is the perfect test case, especially, for  massively parallel computation because of the huge size of its  data.  In the last 5 years, the technology for processing the data  streams produced by video cameras in real time has become  available and the challenge of building general purpose computer  vision systems may now be within reach.  On the theoretical side,  the understanding of human and animal vision systems has   complemented the engineering of artificial vision systems in a  remarkable synergy.  In neurophysiology, the possibility of  massively parallel neural recordings is now available and may  lead to understanding how mammalian cortex uses parallelism so  successfully.  This project seeks to attack the problem of vision  from these two perspectives."

A major part of the computational burden in FEA  is the solution of the assembled system of equations.  Current  practical problems, particularly those in three (or higher)  dimensions, may require the determination of hundreds of  thousands, even millions of unknowns.  Such problems cannot be  solved on serial computers because of excessive computation time  and memory requirements.  Implementation on parallel processors  is indispensable because of time requirements.  Iterative methods  are indispensable because of memory requirements.  Whereas  iterative methods for the h-version of FEA have long been the  object of much investigation (e.g. domain decomposition,  multi-grid), relatively little is known about iterative schemes  for the p-version.  This research addresses that problem.  Multi-p methods can be used independently as smoothers, or as  preconditioners for other iterations such as conjugate gradient.  The term multi-p processes includes both approaches.  This  research develops multi-p V cycle methods with particular  emphasis on problems in 3D.  Parallelization with respect to both  computation costs, costs of communication among processors, and  costs of using auxiliary memory are considered.  The use of  multi-p algorithms as preconditioners, which currently shows  great promise for 2D problems, is a major area of study.  The  ultimate objective of the research is to make the p-version of  FEA a practical tool for large scale problems.       Modern engineering design relies heavily on computer  simulations, and specifically on high-performance computing.  For  example, in structural elastic analysis, it is necessary to solve  (sometimes nonlinear) partial differential equations on  complicated geometries.  To solve such partial differential  equations numerically on computers, discretization techniques are  used.  Such discr etizations may involve thousands or hundreds of  thousands unknowns and efficient numerical methods are  indispensable.

(3) Motors  driven by polymerization free energy, including the microtubule  depolymerization process that moves chromosomes during anaphase  mitosis, and the polymerization motors which drive the motion of  certain pathogenic bacteria and viruses, such as Listeria and  Vaccinia.  The approach in each case is to begin by formulating  analytical stochastic models consisting of Langevin mechanical  equations or Fokker-Planck diffusion equations that describe the  mechanochemical and statistical behavior of the molecular  machinery.  These models then are analyzed mathematically where  possible and by numerical simulation in all cases.  The mean  mechanical properties of these protein motors are derived, such  as force-velocity curves, along with their stochastic properties  such as trajectory variances.  Results are presented in a visual  format that facilitates comprehension by biologists and  comparison with experimental data.       The most striking feature of biological cells, and indeed  the hallmark of life itself, is their constant motion.  These  motions are of two kinds: those that move the cell from one place  to another, and those that move vital material from one place to  another within the cell.  Both kinds of motions are driven by  specialized protein molecules that function as ti ny robotic  motors, powered by chemical energy.  The world in which these  protein machines operate is dominated by Brownian motion, which  gives their movements a statistical character.  Although these  molecular machines operate on a length scale of nanometers and a  force scale of piconewtons, they are absolutely essential to the  life of the cell.  Recent advances in instrumentation have made it  possible to measure the mechanical properties of individual  protein motors, and recent advances in high-performance computing  have enabled their simulation in realistic detail, including the  effects of thermal fluctuations.  Taken together, these advances  provide an unprecedented opportunity to deduce how biomolecular  motors work.  This is done through the formulation of mathematical  models, and through the careful comparison of model predictions  with experimental data."

Such beams are of interest in several  fields; the application motivating the parameter choices in this  project is radiation therapy using electron beams.  Mathematically, the problem is modeled by a linear Boltzmann  equation with inflow boundary conditions.  The linear Boltzmann  equation resembles a convection-diffusion equation in  six-dimensional position/velocity space.  Particles are convected,  while their direction vector undergoes a process resembling  diffusion on the unit sphere, and their energy undergoes a  process resembling convection-diffusion.  The boundary data in a  beam problem have singularities corresponding to sharp beam edges  and monodirectionality of incident beams.  The first half of the  project concerns accurate ways of dealing with these  singularities.  Difference schemes designed for convection  problems with discontinuous solutions are used to resolve beam  edges.  Explicit-implicit schemes with implicit treatment of the  directional diffusion are used to deal with the  monodirectionality of incident beams.  The second half of the  project concerns the treatment plan optimization problem in  radiation therapy.  Specifically, the investigator studies the  application of methods using second derivatives and of multilevel  methods.  At its present stage, the project focuses on model  problems in two space dimensions with one additional independent  variable denoting particle direction.

These problems are computationally intensive and  accurate and efficient methods are needed.  Traditionally, the  standard methods involve computation in the frequency domain,  facilitated by efficient FFT and wavelet algorithms.  Recently,  there has been a new movement towards a partial differential  equation (PDE) based approach, which is motivated by a more  systematic approach to restoring images with sharp edges, as well  as for image segmentation.  The image is diffused (denoised)  according to a nonlinear anisotropic diffusion PDE, designed to  diffuse less near edges.  Moreover, the PDEs are designed to  possess certain desirable geometrical properties such as affine  invariance and causality.  From a computational standpoint, the  PDE formulations call for new computational techniques that are  different from the traditional frequency domain and algebraic  approaches.  As yet, the nonlinear diffusion models are considered  somewhat expensive compared to traditional methods, and it is one  of the goals of this project to make them more efficient while  retaining their desirable geometric properties.  Additionally,  attempts are made to improve and extend these methods to color  and other vector-valued images.  Specific computational algorithms  being studied include primal-dual minimization methods,  preconditioning techniques, and wavelet algorithms.       Image processing has many important applications in both the  physical and the medical sciences.  In the current revolution in  communication and the advent of the information highway, more  and more images are being transmitted and better mathematical  algorithms are needed to compress and remove noise and other  distortions occurring in the transmission.  Applications in the  medical sciences and biotechnology field range from computer  topography to processing of microscopic images of  molecular  structures.  In the environmental area, satellite imaging has been  used to map natural resources as well as environmental pollution.  In the area of manufacturing, imaging systems are used to detect  defects automatically.  In all of these applications, a key  process is that of image restoration, namely, cleaning up an  image polluted by noise and blurring.  This is the main subject of  this project.  These problems are very computationally intensive  due to the large number of pixels and the possibility of  sequences of images (e.g. videos), solving them requires clever  mathematical algorithms as well as high performance computers."

Therefore, this system is   the starting point for any prediction about the microscopic properties of a   plasma.  The Vlasov-Poisson equations also play another very important   role. Recent research which involved the proposer demonstrated a close   relationship between the Vlasov-Poisson equations and the two dimensional   Euler equations in vorticity form.  The Vlasov-Poisson equations have a   simpler mathematical structure than the Euler equations which makes the   Vlasov-Poisson equations easier to analyze and solve numerically, and leads   to many explicit solutions.  Consequently, the Vlasov-Poisson equations   form an excellent system of model equations to study before considering   any open problems for the two dimensional Euler equations.  The proposer   will consider some fundamental problems for the Vlasov-Poisson equations   pertaining to the lack of uniqueness and singularity formation for weak   solutions and to the theory of statistical equilibrium solutions.  Many (but   not all) of these problems are related to unsolved problems for the Euler   equations.  The proposer will also study some fundamental open problems   for the Euler equations with vortex sheet initial data, using Vlasov-Poisson   results to motivate and guide this work.  Finally, the proposer will study   some interesting issues regarding the numerical solution of both the Vlasov-  Poisson and Euler equations.    Fluid dynamics is the study of continuous media like air and water.    Scientists formulate problems in this field by applying the fundamental laws   of physics such as the conservation of mass, momentum and energy.  For   most problems this procedure leads to sets of mathematical equations which   are too complicated to solve.  Based on physical  and/or mathematical   intuition the scientist then tries to find a simplified formulation of the   original problem  which is simple enough to solve and sufficiently   complicated to  describe the essential features of the original problem.  The   mixing process between layers of fluid which have different densities, like   air and water, or layers of fluid moving at different velocities is very   complicated and occurs in a wide variety of important applications in fields   including aerodynamics, meteorology and oceanography.  For example, the   flow of air over an airplane is very complicated.  In order to predict the   trailing wake behind an airplane, or the mixing process in a fluid, scientists   often use a simplified model of a fluid called a vortex sheet.  This is the   simplest realistic description of this and many other problems.    Unfortunately, despite the wide-spread use of vortex sheet models in many   problems in fluid dynamics, many mathematical properties of vortex sheets   remain poorly understood.  The goal of this proposal is to provide  answers   to many of the fundamental questions about the mathematical properties of   vortex sheets.  Successful completion of the proposed work will lead to an   increased understanding of the strengths and limitations when using vortex   sheets to model complicated flows.  The starting point for this work is the   simplest set of equations which describe a plasma, a fluid in which the   microscopic properties of charged particles are modeled.  Therefore, this   study should also lead to an increased understanding of the properties of a   plasma containing a concentrated beam of electrons."

This approach to  programming expresses optimization algorithms in terms of their  natural abstract components (vector addition, inner product, and  so forth), without imposing unnecessary constraints on data  structure and representation.  Application software, on the other  hand, can be written using the most suitable data structures,  algorithms, and languages (various dialects of Fortran, for  instance).  The programming environment provides a flexible and  largely automatic interface between the generic optimization code  and the application-specific code.  In addition to the  elaboration of the basic class library, objectives of this  proposal include the implementation of several modern algorithms  for large-scale optimization, the design of a software toolkit  that allows application programmers and numerical optimizers easy  access to the HCL programming environment, and testing on a  variety of realistic problems.  For example, research in seismic  data processing methods provided the original motivation for this  project, and remains a principal target.    Reuse of software is a long-standing goal of software engineering  research, as software development and maintenance represents the  bulk of the cost of computation.  Object oriented programming  designates an approach to software design that elevates  reusability to the status of guiding principle.  Traditional  (""procedural"") programming style embeds the internal details of  data and algorithms in the interfaces between program parts.   Object oriented programming hides or encapsulates these details,  which permits program parts to be interchanged with considerably  great er ease.  For this and other reasons, object orientation has  become the dominant methodology in commercial programming,  especially for graphics applications.  It has not up to now had  much impact on scientific computation, which has an equally great  need for reusable software.  Many scientists do not use freely  available high quality numerical programs, simply because the  procedural style in which these programs are written makes them  incompatible with natural data representations in such fields as  computer aided design and manufacturing, materials science, and  biotechnology.  An object oriented framework for basic scientific  computations, as proposed here, could lead to greatly enhanced  interchange of software between numerical analysts and other  scientists, and so improve the efficiency of computational  research."

The underlying principle is the evolution of  a simple closed curve whose points move in the direction of the  normal with a prescribed velocity.  A fundamental limitation of  the method as it stands is that it cannot deal with important  image features such as triple points.  The method also requires a  choice of an ""edge-strength"" function, defined over the image  domain, indicating the likelihood of an object boundary being  present at any point in the image domain.  This implies a separate  preprocessing step that is in essence precomputing approximate  boundaries in the presence of noise.  The initial curve also has  to be preselected.  The investigator demonstrates that the  different versions of curve evolution used in Computer Vision  together with the preprocessing step and the choice of the  initial curve can be integrated in the form of a new segmentation  functional that unifies and extends curve evolution models.  Moreover, the numerical solutions obtained retain sharp  discontinuities or ""shocks,"" thus providing sharp demarcation of  object boundaries.  The new functional described provides a  unified approach to the segmentation problem and shape analysis.  The principal objective of the proposed research is to carry out  a mathematical analysis of the new functional, apply it to real  images, and study its possible extensions.       This project is in the field of machine vision, with  applications especially in medical imaging.  The underlying  mathematical theory proposed here is potentially applicable also  to seemingly unrelated fields such as liquid crystal technology,  metallurgy, flame propagation and combustion.  A computer receives  visual information through a camera in the form of millions of  numbers per picture frame, each number describing th e intensity  and the color of light at a point in the scene.  The sheer volume  of the visual information makes the task of its interpretation by  the computer extremely difficult.  The first processing task for  the computer before it can begin to recognize an object in a  scene is to find the object's outline.  This is what is called the  segmentation problem.  The fundamental difficulty here is how to  separate the object's outline from the rest of a cluttered scene.  Even when the computer has successfully located the object  outline, it is difficult to identify the object because its  appearance changes depending on its orientation as the object and  the camera move.  Worse, the object might be partially obscured.  Therefore, characteristic features that distinguish one object  from another and that remain unchanged as the appearance of the  object changes must be defined and calculated.  This is the  problem of shape analysis.  This project formulates a new unified  approach to the fundamental mathematical questions underlying the  two problems.  It develops new mathematical tools based upon this  approach and applies them to specific classes of practical  problems, in particular to analysis of biomedical images."

In particular, they develop algorithms for the determination of periodic orbits and their Lyapunov exponents. Given the significant role the stable and unstable manifolds of periodic orbits play in determining the global dynamics, a method to compute these manifolds reliably is developed. Moreover, they develop a method of establishing chaotic behavior just from finite computed orbits and an algorithm for measuring sensitivity to initial data, which is the hallmark of chaos. All the computational algorithms are developed in the context of autonomous ordinary differential equations. Despite the recent major advances in dynamical systems theory, analysis of specific equations arising in applications must still largely rely on numerical computations. Therefore, it is important to devise computational techniques whose reliability can be verified. Indispensability of rigor is particularly acute in the numerical studies of chaotic systems, which naturally amplify even small computational errors. Chaotic systems possess, in the mist of bewildering complexity, many unstable periodic orbits. The main goal of the project is to develop computational methods for locating such periodic orbits and their associated structures.

Many problems that arise in diverse mathematical disciplines can be distilled into related problems about finitely presented groups. One of the major developments of the decade beginning in the mid 1950s has been the proof that almost all questions about such finitely presented groups are algorithmically undecidable. Nevertheless, the very importance of these groups makes it essential to try to obtain at least partial information about them. In particular, although problems about finitely presented groups are unsolvable in general, it may be possible in a number of specific instances to solve such problems. In order to gain some insight into these problems, it is often necessary to try to carry out some experiments and computations with finitely presented groups. Such experiments and computations are very time-consuming and usually impossible to carry out by hand. This project aims to make such experiments and computations possible by using very fast computers. enabling one to gather enough information together about many important problems to facilitate their solution. The project creates and implements a package of group-theoretical algorithms and procedures, which can be run by means of a graphical user interface and which is easily accessible by a widevariety of users. Groups are mathematical entities that encapsulate, among other things, the intrinsic meaning of symmetry. This explains,in part, why they turn out to be a very important tool in physics, chemistry, biology and other mathematical disciplines. The understanding of these ""groups"" provide insight into these disciplines, as well as a means for studying them. For example, groups play an essential role in quantum mechanics and particle physics and they also provide a means for studying the space people live in. Many of these groups have seemingly simple descriptions, even though t hey themselves can be very complicated. This complexity helps to explain why, for example, certain important parts of chemistry and biology are so difficult. They also give rise to new problems and provide for solutions to problems in theoretical computer science, cryptography and other fields.

In the past few years a number of significant advances have taken place in several different branches of computational algebra and number theory. Because of the growing interdependence between the different branches, an algorithmic advance in one area often has a major impact on the performance of algorithms in other areas. Consequently, the meeting brings together workers from some of the key areas, including researchers working on software development as well as those using these tools. The conference is intended to inform algorithm designers and users of recent developments in cognate areas of computational algebra, number theory, and geometry and inform key theoretical mathematicians of the possibilities offered by the computational algebra tools that are now becoming available. It is also expected to identify desirable algorithm and software developments that would result in significant new applications in the near future. The conference promotes the use of the techniques of computational algebra in application areas such as digital signal processing, complex system design, network design, cryptography, coding theory and applied combinatorics. Algebra studies basic questions about discrete structure and symmetry in the world. Theoretical results from this branch of mathematics help chemists understand the spectra of organic molecules, physicists organize families of elementary particles, and engineers solve systems of equations. Algebraic invariants are used to answer biochemists' questions about knotting in DNA and anthropologists have even used algebraic classifications to organize native artifacts in the southwestern U.S. For many years mathematicians have studied algebra with little more than their imaginations and a pencil and paper. But now, computers allow researchers to work with larger and more complicated situations tha n were possible in the past. Computational algebra is the general title given to these research efforts. However, to use a computer in mathematical research requires the development of specialized software -- a task that can be time-consuming for the typical researcher. One way to address this need is through systems such as Magma which provide easy access to state-of-the-art algorithms in a number of fields of study. Another important process is to encourage researchers to share their experiences (and even software) through conferences such as this; the interaction at a conference often leads to adaptation of ideas and development of new directions. These tools enable theoretical researchers to explore more complicated situations, to gain insight in unfamiliar settings, and to compute answers to larger problems. Computer-based work on primality testing and factoring of large numbers is showing direct application to cryptography and security. Work in finite geometries and designs are providing improved techniques for error-detection and data compression. These have a large impact on everyone's use of computers and communications."
