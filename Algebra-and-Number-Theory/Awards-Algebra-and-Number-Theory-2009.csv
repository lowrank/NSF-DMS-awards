"0902296","Degenerations of algebraic varieties, with applications to combinatorics and representation theory","DMS","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM, Combinatorics","08/01/2009","06/01/2012","Allen Knutson","NY","Cornell University","Continuing Grant","Tie Luo","07/31/2013","$351,320.00","","allenknutson@gmail.com","341 PINE TREE RD","ITHACA","NY","148502820","6072555014","MPS","1264, 7970","0000, OTHR","$0.00","Knutson's proposal makes use of degeneration of algebraic varieties to study algebraic combinatorics, particularly combinatorial representation theory. Littelmann's path model in representation theory already has such an interpretation: Chirivi gave a degeneration of each flag manifold G/P (plus ample line bundle) to a reduced, seminormal union of toric varieties. Unfortunately, this used properties of Lusztig's canonical basis, so was specific to representation theory applications. Knutson hopes to replace these properties with Samuel-Rees-Nagata degenerations, to achieve similar reducedness results for degenerations of much more general varieties.<br/>One specific application is in computing branching rules from a group G to a symmetric subgroup K, using a K-equivariant degeneration of G/P, and Knutson, jointly with Jiang-Hua Liu, states a conjectural rule based on this.<br/><br/>Many interesting numbers and polynomials are associated to irreducible algebraic sets, where ""irreducible"" essentially means ""not glued from smaller pieces in a nontrivial way"". A circle x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 is such an example, as its equation does not factor, and one can associate the degree 2 to this equation. But if we degenerate it to x^2 + y^2 - 0 = 0, then the equation does factor (over the complex numbers), giving the union of two lines x = +/- iy. Those two equations are degree 1, and from the degenerative geometry we obtain the combinatorial result 2 = 1 + 1. Knutson uses this technique to study much more interesting irreducible sets, e.g. the space of all maximal nested chains of subspaces in a vector space; degenerating them to highly reducible unions of simple pieces replaces their geometric complexity with combinatorial complexity, and gives much more interesting formulae for their degrees (and generalizations thereof). In some of the work proposed, he specifically plans to pursue this technique to understand how quantum-mechanical systems with noncompact symmetry (e.g. under special relativity transformations, which allow boosts by speeds up to but not including light-speed) decompose when one only considers their compact symmetries (e.g. under rotation, by angles that are trapped on a circle and cannot run off to infinity). This is the same sort of problem (though the hoped-for results would be wholly complementary) as studied recently by the ATLAS team in the study of the representations of E_8.<br/>"

The research focuses both on qualitative aspects of the derived category (for example, support varieties) and on quantitative aspects (for dimension, in the sense of Rouquier). The Hochschild cohomology algebra emerges as a critical player in these investigations, for it acts on the derived category and to capture significant homological information about it, especially over complete intersection rings.<br/><br/>In studying a topological space (or other geometric objects) it is often useful to consider how it can be built out of simpler objects, like discs or spheres. One can then attach numerical invariants to the building process (for example, how many steps are required?) to obtain a measure of the complexity of the object. Surprisingly, similar considerations turn out to be extremely fruitful also in the more discrete world of algebraic structures. The questions addressed in the proposal seek to investigate algebraic gadgets called commutative rings, which arise naturally in various branches of mathematics and physics, from this perspective.<br/>"

KUMUNU is an annual weekend conference anchored by the Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri-Columbia (MU) and Nebraska-Lincoln (NU), promoting interaction among researchers, post docs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines (such as algebraic geometry, K-theory and coding theory) at regional schools (which in 2008 included 16 different institutions). Although the KUMUNU triad has significant strength in these areas, geographic separation raises a hurdle to taking the most advantage of this strength. Fortunately, the distances are small enough to allow scheduling in such a way that regional participants can inexpensively gather at a central location for a weekend conference. The KUMUNU conference series thus provides a cost-effective annual venue for regional researchers at various stages of their careers, including graduate students, recent Ph.D.s and faculty at nonPh.D. granting institutions, to interact with each other and with experienced researchers based at KU, MU, NU and a limited number of invited experts from outside the region.<br/><br/>Travel and lodging support to facilitate participation, especially for graduate students, is a key element for KUMUNU to achieve its main goals. These include: playing a strong regional mentoring role at all levels by showcasing the research of post docs and young faculty and by helping recent Ph.D.s and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines enrich their research programs by meeting senior researchers based at KU, MU, NU and elsewhere; and promoting research in commutative algebra by providing a venue for discussion of the latest developments in the field, for exchanging ideas and for setting the basis for future research collaborations. The conference design also furthers these goals:  KUMUNU comprises a limited number of talks, which are encouraged to be accessible to graduate students, by speakers representing a geographically diverse mix of senior researchers, young faculty and post docs, with plenty of time reserved outside of talks for additional interaction. The relatively small size of the meeting and its geographic and disciplinary focus also encourage participants to establish productive collaborative relationships. In addition to the stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of the students and early career participants, participants from nonPh.D. granting institutions will take ideas from the conference back to their colleagues and students, stimulating further research and mathematical enrichment at their home institutions."

It focuses on a series of problems in classification theory that are connected by the use of similar tools coming from singularity theory and the minimal model program. The project has three main objectives:<br/>(1) Investigate abstract properties of numerical invariants of singularities and their impact in birational geometry, and thus address longstanding open problems of  primary importance in the field such as Shokurov's ACC Conjectures and the Termination of Flips Conjecture. (2) Determine rigidity properties of the birational geometric structure of certain class of projective Fano hypersurfaces, and use variations of these properties to introduce a new point of view in measuring various degrees of non-rationality. (3) Study different aspects concerning the behavior of curves on Fano varieties, especially in  connection to the deformations of the variety and within the context of the minimal model program: expected deformation properties, if satisfied, would bring to light a rather surprising rigidity nature of Fano varieties. Other more speculative projects, notably one regarding a possible connections between Shokurov's ACC Conjecture and resolution of singularities via normalized Nash blow-ups, and one on the behavior of the Cox ring in families of Fano varieties, are outlined throughout the proposal.<br/><br/>The minimal model program, the main program geared towards the birational classification of algebraic varieties, is the general framework of the proposed research. Designed over the model of classification of surfaces (one of the main achievements of the Italian school at the beginning of the 20th century), the minimal model program has become one of the major trends in algebraic geometry, earning S. Mori the Fields Medal for is work on three dimensional varieties. Several leading mathematicians have deeply contributed to the program throughout the years, and very recently there has been some spectacular progress which is bringing us very close to a complete program in all dimensions. There are however many fundamental questions that still remain open, and some of these constitute the main objectives of the proposed research. A series of educational activities are also proposed: the range of such activities covers a large spectrum, from of high school students to peer researchers, passing through undergraduate students, graduate students, and young researchers.<br/>"

One aspect is the interpretation of Langlands duality of reductive groups in terms of homotopy theory (in the framework of Derived Algebraic Geometry). Another aspect is a continuation of the work on developing a particular geometric Koszul duality (``Linear Koszul Duality'') and applying it to representation theory. In relation to physics, the project envisions a mathematical formalism of t'Hooft operators and a construction of a certain extended topological field theory in four dimensions, with applications to knot theory. The project also contains a speculation on the relation of number theory and physics. Here, a geometrization of number theory is expected to arise through a connection to quantum field theory. <br/><br/>The project aims towards relating and unifying developments in mathematics and theoretical particle physics. The origin of these developments in mathematics is the so called Langlands program, which is the modern view on a classical discipline of number theory. In time this program incorporated a number of central disciplines of mathematics, starting with representation theory, then algebraic geometry and currently the homotopy theory. The relation to physics is a part of the current melting of barriers  between mathematics and physics which arose in a period when the two subjects developed separately. The central impact on mathematics in the last quarter century was the import of the ideas from quantum field theory (in particular string theory), which is the part of physics that studies elementary particles. Recently, Witten, Kapustin and Gukov established a long sought bridge between Langlands program and quantum field theory (in particular gauge theory and string theory). The proposed work attempts to work in both directions by applying ideas from physics to mathematics and mathematical constructions  to physics. It also aims towards deeper understanding of the relation between quantum field theory and number theory. The proposal also contains more standard topics within representation theory and Langlands program.<br/>"

While algebraic geometry has contributed applications in coding, industrial control, and computation, the topics of this project are more closely related to applications in theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as components of the fine structure of our universe. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli theory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often manifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own right. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of ""organisms"" as itself being an ""organism"" is not a just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. Sometimes a collection of algebraic varieties manifests itself as a slightly more general object, called a stack, rather than a variety. Such stacks are a central object of study of this project. The other topic studied in this project is birational geometry, which is devoted to a certain abstract relationship, called birational equivalence, among algebraic varieties, which lies at the foundation of algebraic geometry.<br/>"

The University of Kentucky is hosting this event.  The twenty-four student research and expository talks and twenty-five posters at the poster sessions are a representative sampling of current trends in algebraic, geometric and topological combinatorics.  The talk topics include: tropical oriented matroids, Coxeter graphs, k-Schur polynomials, permutation enumeration, Hopf algebras, non-crossing partition lattices, sporadic groups, the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, Hamiltonian decompositions of multigraphs, free and non-free hyperplane arrangements, energy of graphs and digraphs, the Monotone Column Permanent conjecture and k-parabolic subspace arrangments.  The participants hail from leading combinatorics graduate programs in the United States and Canada.  The results intersect work of researchers from a wide variety of areas of combinatorics, including Ardila and Develin, Babson and Steingrimsson, Barcelo, Billera and Brenti, Bressoud, Ehrenborg and Readdy, Fukuyama, Goulden and Jackson, Haglund, Knutson and Miller, and Stanley.<br/><br/><br/>This conference serves to give young researchers in combinatorics a welcoming medium to present their results, an opportunity to make new professional contacts, and a forum to showcase new results and trends in combinatorics. The field of combinatorics is a growing, vibrant and interdisciplinary area of mathematics.  Combinatorialists use techniques from algebra, topology, geometry, and more recently, harmonic analysis and algebraic statistics to understand discrete structures.  Combinatorial methods are applied to questions in the sciences, including those stemming from genetics, biology and physics. The GSCC will expose the participants to many of the new ideas, leading developments and techniques in combinatorics, will augment the mathematics they are currently seeing at their home institutions, and will continue to foster the interdisciplinary nature of the field of combinatorics.  Additionally, the poster session will encourage greater networking and interaction among the participants and these new professional contacts may very likely result in future research projects."

Such degenerations are usually very destructive of the geometry, but the original and limiting schemes may define the same (equivariant) cohomology class in some ambient space. The degenerations I intend to study are (1) of moduli spaces of representations of quivers, where the type A case has become well understood in the last three years but types D,E are totally open; (2) of nilpotent orbits in Lie algebras, to the normal cones of their upper triangular part. The homology of the upper triangular part carries a (Springer) representation of the corresponding Weyl group; the normal cone I study has more components and, in the example I can compute so far, carries a representation of a richer algebra; (3) of subvarieties of projective space to reduced schemes with finite maps to projective space, where the degree of the map carries the information more usually seen in the nonreduced structure of the limit subscheme.<br/><br/>If we replace a polynomial equation, like xy = zw, by one of its monomials, like xy = 0, the locus of solutions can often be made to retain the same volume even as it breaks into pieces.

In the general setup, we have many polynomial conditions to begin with, and each is degenerated"" to a simpler polynomial containing only some of the original monomials; a complicated condition guarantees that the dimension and volume of the solution set remains constant.  In my work I study these degenerations where the ambient space is a space of (lists of) matrices, and the original equations are natural matrix conditions like ""matrices whose square is zero"". The difficulty comes in finding degenerations that preserve the dimension and volume, and then studying the resulting equations to understand the simpler pieces into which the degenerate locus factors. The resulting discrete structure is then of great interest combinatorially, and sheds light on the (topologically important) volume of the original locus."

This proposal considers both channel coding, i.e., reliable transmission of data across a noisy channel, and network coding, i.e., reliable transmission of data through a network.  Channel coding is the appropriate model for most traditional applications, such as the transmission of satellite pictures from outer space, the storage (and retrieval) of computer data on a disk drive, and the transmission of a voice (or data) signal for a land line telephone.  In each of these situations, information can be thought of as being put into a channel so that the (possibly corrupted) information comes out of the other end of the channel.  Network coding, on the other hand, involves more complicated relaying, and possibly combining, of information.  This is the correct model for a variety of more modern applications, such as cellular telephone networks (with their system of towers), sensor networks, camera surveillance networks, and peer-to-peer networks.  In both (modern) channel coding and network coding, graph theory plays a crucial role.<br/><br/>This proposal considers two types of channel codes based on graphs: codes defined by Tanner graphs and codes defined by tail-biting trellises.  In each case, the codes come equipped with an iterative message-passing decoding algorithm that operates on the associated graph, that is extremely efficient, and that corrects, with high probability, many more error patterns than are guaranteed by the code's minimum Hamming distance.  However, in both cases, the relevant algorithm's performance is hindered by the existence of pseudocodewords, which are objects that arise in similar ways as do codewords and which compromise the decoder.  Thus to understand the performance of the algorithms, one must understand the pseudocodewords; most of the problems described in this proposal relating to channel coding stem from this observation.  In network coding, the network over which we want to send information is modeled by a network, in the graph theory sense of the word. This proposal concerns both lossless networks, where one assumes any information transmitted is received without errors, and lossy networks, where one assumes that errors and/or erasures can occur.  The problem in the lossless case is therefore not how to encode the information, but rather, given a network with its sources and sinks and given a desire to simultaneously transmit certain pieces of information from the sources to the sinks, how does one designate what information should be carried across each of the edges of the network?  In the lossy case, one must consider this question along with the questions of how to ensure low error rates and how to guarantee robustness of the network.<br/>"

Number theory has to do with such objects as prime numbers and diophantine equations. Other than being perhaps the oldest branch of mathematics, it is of great significance in today's world, since many cryptographic protocols (needed for secure transmissions over the internet) and error correcting codes (needed for compact discs, hard discs and the like) are based on number theoretic methods. These practical applications in fact involve rather sophisticated geometrical objects such as elliptic curves. Over the last half-century, we have realized that one can gain a better understanding of these geometric objects by studying certain functions, called L-functions. Conjecturally one expects that very interesting information about the geometric object is encoded in the behavior of the associated L-function at certain special points. The investigator hopes to deepen our understanding of this connection through the work to be done in the current proposal.

Further, such equalities of mathematical objects defined in a priori different ways are not just of theoretical interest but tend to have extremely concrete applications, the most striking recent ones being the resolution of Fermat's last theorem and the Sato-Tate conjecture. The workshops, the final conference, and the graduate and post-doctoral advising will have an important impact on the formation of new researchers in the field and on the promotion of new collaborations."

The conference is committed to bring researchers of national and international stature to Texas to discuss research in algebraic geometry and to interact with mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states. A principal area of mathematics, algebraic geometry is also the source of algorithms behind much of modern technology. For example, a thorough technical understanding of cryptography, coding theory, or quantum computing is impossible without the language of algebraic geometry. <br/> <br/>The conference makes it possible for the community of algebraic geometers from Texas and surrounding states (a large geographic region) to meet and share new results on a regular basis. This both stimulates individual research and generates productive cooperative efforts between schools. Also, the conference is dedicated to the development of graduate students and young faculty in algebraic geometry. Finally, the unique environment at Texas A&M, where classically trained algebraic geometers work on applied problems with impact in areas such as signal processing and computer science, insures that the conference will have an impact that goes well beyond mathematics. <br/>"

The new methods developed in each of group theory and semigroup theory have great potential for further <br/>applications in both areas.  The conference will highlight recent developments in these fields, with a focus on asymptotic and algorithmic properties.  In addition to the dissemination of recent ideas on topics in group theory and semigroup theory, the conference will provide a setting for the participants to collaborate and establish connections with each other, bridging group theory and semigroup theory.  The conference will also help recent Ph.D.'s and graduate students to interact with leading researchers in the area and gain a broader knowledge of their research field.<br/><br/>"

One main thrust is to explore several notions of closure in rings that do not contain a field, such as finitely generated algebras over the integers, with the hope of extending tight closure theory to such rings, thereby solving many open questions. Approaches to the problem of proving existence of big Cohen-Macaulay modules in mixed characteristic are also given.  A new theory of quasi-length and content related to certain local cohomology modules will be studied. This theory has raised some difficult, central problems, and is one of several methods proposed to attack the long standing and important question of whether regular rings are direct summands of their module-finite extensions. <br/><br/>The proposed research deals with commutative rings, which are <br/>abstract systems in which one has what might be thought of as artificial numbers. One can add, subtract, and multiply these artificial numbers:  call them ring elements. The integers and real numbers are examples, but there are many other examples, including rings that contain only finitely many elements. In one example, one has only 0 and 1, and 1+1 = 0 (like the properties of even and odd integers:  odd + odd =even).  In studying systems of many equations in many unknowns, one can force the equations to hold in an abstract ring.  The study of the properties of this ring gives information about the solutions. One can also study instead a sort of graph of the solutions, that exists in a high dimensional space.  It is of great benefit to go back and forth between these algebraic and geometric points of view.  A third method, which will be used frequently in the proposed research, is to study solutions  that are somewhat like integers (but more general), but to do so while ignoring multiples of a prime number: elements are considered equivalent if they differ by a multiple of this prime.  Doing this  for many different prime numbers, possibly all prime numbers, can provide a huge amount of information about the solutions of the equations.  The proposed research deals with a systematic method, called tight closure, for using this idea, as well as its extensions into new contexts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Together with co-workers, the PI will also develop a theory of total positivity for loop groups, and for their flag varieties.

Furthermore, new combinatorics for Coxeter groups occurs, including a weak order for the limiting elements of a Coxeter group.  In another direction, the PI with collaborators will study the convex geometry of the affine Coxeter arrangement, and in particular, certain polytopes which occur in the study of affine Schubert varieties and total positivity of the affine Grassmannian.<br/><br/>The PI's research is in the area of combinatorics, which studies how to count discrete objects. The PI studies combinatorial problems which arise from geometry (studying shapes of objects in space) and algebraic structures (studying solutions to polynomial equations).  One of the on-going themes of the PI's work is the study of (positive) numbers which arise in mathematics.  These numbers may occur when counting the ways geometrical objects interact in space, or by couting certain solutions to polynomial equations.  In particular, the PI aims to understand the ""positive"" part of a geometrical figure in the same way the positive real axis is the ""positive"" part of the real line.  The PI's work will have a significant impact on the understanding of the relationships between geometry, algebra, and combinatorics.<br/>"

The conjectures offer an explanation for why the representation theories of real and p-adic, and even of adelic, groups are so similar. The price of this uniformity is that, often, one may no longer speak of individual representations, but rather of finite collections of them (called L-packets). These are expected to encode both number-theoretic (via Galois groups) and algebro-geometric (via many avenues---for example, the theory of stable distributions) information. For some families of representations, the investigators already have clear expectations for what the L-packets should be, but they cannot yet prove that their expectations are correct. For other families, there is not even a reasonable conjecture for what the answer should be. The theory of real groups suggests yet another rewarding perspective, from the point of view of symmetric spaces. For p-adic groups, the serious study of harmonic analysis on such spaces is just beginning to be developed, in large part by the investigators, and the analogues in this setting of the local Langlands conjectures are far from clear. The part of the local Langlands conjectures dealing with functoriality also suggests that the investigators should be able to transfer representation-theoretic information between different matrix groups. A classical realization of this is the theory of lifting, where representations of matrix groups over a large field are related to those of the same group, but with coefficients taken in a smaller field. Most progress in this area has been via somewhat ad hoc methods, but the answers have invariably turned out to be related to natural constructions arising in the symmetric-space setting.<br/><br/><br/>Representation theory, broadly understood, has its origins in two classical problems. The first, investigated by Fourier in the 19th century, was an attempt to understand complicated physical processes, such as heat diffusion, by representing them as combinations of simpler processes. The second, initially studied by Frobenius, Schur, and others, was an attempt to understand the structure of a finite collection of symmetries via an associated polynomial known as its group determinant. The surprising fact that the solutions to these two problems are related has turned out to be just the earliest instance of a family of deep and far-reaching connections that have been formalized in a collection of conjectures known collectively as the (local) Langlands conjectures. The depth and broad reach of these conjectures---for example, they encompass a large part of the celebrated recent proof of the centuries-old Fermat's Last Theorem---has meant that progress has so far been relatively slow. This project brings together a group of mathematicians from a broad variety of related backgrounds, whose combined expertise can be expected to allow significant progress both on these conjectures and on related results in representation theory and harmonic analysis."

The first project is to expand results about the strong Bruhat graph of Coxeter systems to the more general setting of balanced graphs.  The PI has recently extended Billera and Brenti's work on the cd-index of Bruhat graphs to balanced graphs and showed the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, an important topological and representation theoretic invariant, also extend to this setting.  The second project is a study of the face incidence data of regular subdivisions of manifolds via the cd-index.  The PI will investigate manifold analogues of classical results for convex polytopes, including to determine inequalities for the coefficients of the cd-index, to develop a theory of regular manifold arrangements in the spirit of Zaslavsky's seminal work on hyperplane arrangements, and to extend Stanley's notion of spherical shellability to manifolds. Motivated by Wachs' work on the d-divisible partition lattice, the third project is to examine the restricted partition lattice from the standpoint of poset homology, shellability and representation theory.<br/>The fourth project is a classical enumerative study of Dowling analogues of the Stirling numbers of the second kind and the Bell numbers.  The fifth project is to investigate combinatorial permutation statistics, such as excedances, descents and the major index, for the group of affine permutations.<br/><br/><br/>Combinatorics is inherently an interdisciplinary field of study linking many areas of mathematics and the sciences.  This proposal further expands the range of combinatorics.  For example, the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials are a deep invariant originally defined in topology.  In this project they will be analyzed from a combinatorial perspective to further enhance our understanding of them.  Theories that apply to polytopes, which are sphere-like objects, will be extended to other manifolds which have more complicated topological structure.  Developing our topological perspective is important since a large part of modern-day physics is focused on studying the topology of space.  Deepening our understanding of permutation statistics and basic combinatorial enumeration may help us to analyze and recognize patterns in vast genome data, as well as to improve communications, including the internet."

The second part of the project attempts to prove or disprove a conjecture of King on the existence of tilting bundles for Fano toric varieties and stacks.

His particular area of expertise is toric geometry which is an area of mathematics that studies higher-dimensional spaces known as toric varieties.  Toric geometry was developed in 1970s for purely mathematical purposes as a tool for constructing explicit examples of spaces. It came to prominence in the early 1990s when it was realized that toric varieties play an important role in superstring theory, and it has been developing rapidly ever since.  Borisov hopes to apply his expertise in toric geometry to several mathematical problems that appear in superstring theory. In particular, he hopes to establish that the currently known constructions of possible target spaces in which superstrings are supposed to move can produce at most a finite (albeit very large) number of different families."

Root numbers are important fundamental invariants that arise in connection with several influential conjectures of number theory and representation theory, such as Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer and parity conjectures, conjectural functional equations for L-functions, and Langlands program. In studying root numbers attached to abelian varieties over extensions of the base field arise the so-called twists of the root numbers by Galois representations, or twisted root numbers for short. Twisted root numbers attached to elliptic curves have been studied extensively. The main objective of this proposal is to extend the results obtained in that direction to abelian varieties. The methods to be employed come from the combination of representation theory with the theory of Serre and Tate of abelian varieties with potential good reduction and the uniformization theory of abelian varieties. Another part of the project is devoted to studying questions arising naturally in the context of the stratification theory of reductive groups over the field of formal Laurent series with complex coefficients. This theory developed by Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson is important in connection with the affine Springer fibers studied by Kazhdan, Luzstig, Bezrukavnikov, Spaltenstein and others.<br/><br/>The theory of L-functions is a generalization of the classical theory of the well-known Riemann and Dedekind zeta-functions that originated in works by Hecke and Hasse at the first half of the last century. As zeta-functions have been used to study the distribution of prime numbers, L-functions were introduced to study the distribution of prime ideals in number fields, i.e., finite extensions of the field of rational numbers. One of the main themes in arithmetic algebraic geometry is to study L-functions attached to algebraic varieties, in particular to abelian varieties, which are higher-dimensional analogues of elliptic curves. Inseparable from the theory of L-functions is the notion of a root number--the sign in the conjectural functional equations for L-functions. The importance of studying root numbers lies in the fact that according to several famous conjectures in number theory they are believed to have deep connections to the arithmetic of the subject in question; for example, they may predict the existence of rational solutions to systems of algebraic equations or, in other words, the existence of rational points. Studying rational points on algebraic varieties in turn has its applications to cryptography: some public key cryptosystems are based on rational points of elliptic curves. One of the goals of this project is to study root numbers attached to abelian varieties."

We describe several open problem of this flavor related both to dense and sparse graphs, an area with many intriguing open problems, like the size of the smallest non-planar subgraph in a graph that is far from being planar.

One project involves studying the connection between the Hasse principle for geometrically rational varieties over global fields and the period-index problem for Brauer groups of function fields.  This is analogous to the connection between Artin's conjecture on the finiteness of the Brauer group for schemes proper over the integers and the Tate-Shafarevich conjecture, and builds on earlier work by the PI on the moduli of twisted sheaves.  A second project will continue the joint work carried out by the PI and Kovcs on higher-dimensional generalizations of the Shafarevich conjecture on non-isotrivial families of curves.  Crucial to this project will be a greater understanding of stacks parametrizing morphisms between stacks, whose systematic study was only recently begun.  A third project aims to deepen the understanding of stacks and their intrinsic geometry.  The PI and his collaborators will study the nature of birational modifications and analytification of stacks, and the categorical information content of stacks.  The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to broaden the applications of algebro-geometric and stack-theoretic methods in pure algebra and related fields.  Broadly speaking, algebraic geometry is the study of the geometry associated to algebraic objects.  One of the most fruitful historical examples is the equation for a circle; the quadratic nature of the equation is closely related to the fact that a line generally intersects a circle in two points. Over the last several millennia, mathematicians have come to understand that the connections between algebra and geometry run far deeper than one might imagine, and this has led to the gradual encroachment of geometric methods into far-flung areas of pure algebra and a profound unification of several seemingly-different subjects.  Each new advance in algebraic geometry ultimately finds applications to other areas of mathematics; several abstract areas of the field have turned out to be very computer-friendly, and modern cryptography would be impossible without algebraic geometry.  The theory of stacks is relatively young, but it has been the focus of recent attention and is rapidly maturing.  The PI's research will be directed toward applying the theory of stacks to a wide range of problems in algebra and geometry, bringing new tools to the geometric analysis of algebraic problems."

To what degree is a given substructure unavoidable? Ramsey theory states that certain substructures are always unavoidable in large enough systems. Others could be avoided by local modifications such as, in graphs, edge deletion and addition. This proposal deals, in part, with the efficient modification of graphs, referred to as graph editing. Finding the edit distance from a graph to a hereditary property provides insight into the general structure of such properties and has many applications, such as property testing. The techniques proposed to address this problem include pseudorandom graphs, regular partitions, colored homomorphisms and optimization -- all of which promise to be useful in other facets of graph theory. In the study of unavoidable combinatorial structures, this proposal addresses a generalized Ramsey problem in which the substructures are not given explicitly but rather are determined by a set of parameters.  For example, such a parameter  can be the  number of colors that are present on a given subgraph of an edge-colored graph.  This explores, in particular, the balance between classical Ramsey and anti-Ramsey problems.<br/><br/>The PIs' research belongs to the discipline of graph theory, which is the study of networks and their properties and which has  applications in a wide variety of other disciplines, including computer science, bioinformatics, operations research and economics.   Graduate students and collaboration are integral parts of the PIs' research.   The main objective of this proposal is to address two fundamental questions: ""Which structures are unavoidable in large systems, such as networks?"" and ""How can one modify (edit) a network efficiently in order to satisfy desired properties?""  Answers to these questions will bring a better understanding of networks, specifically those arising from scientific applications.<br/>"

This an open problem whose solution is crucial to many applications in the field.  Another project, pursued jointly by Kollr and the PI, will provide crucial results for the above projects. The main theme of the project is to understand deformations of singularities that appear on stable log varieties.  In a related project the PI is planning to prove various generalizations of the classical Kodaira vanishing theorem. In another project the PI is going to work on the refined Viehweg conjecture regarding subvarieties of moduli stacks of canonically polarized smooth projective varieties.  This conjecture evolved from a landmark conjecture of Shafarevich, and its solution by Arakelov and Parshin, which played an important role in Faltings' proof of the Mordell Conjecture. Part of this project is joint work with Kebekus.  In another project the PI and Hacon are going to study the impact of the existence of nowhere vanishing differential forms on the geometry of the underlying variety. Their goal is to prove several outstanding conjectures in the area.  In another project the PI is planning to prove a a characterization of the projective space and quadric hypersurfaces that will give a far reaching common generalization of Mori's theorem (earlier known as Hartshorne's conjecture) and Beauville's conjecture. The latter was settled by Araujo, Druel and the PI recently.  In yet another project the PI hopes to prove a strong rational resolution theorem. One application of this result would be that varieties with rational singularities admit a compactification with only rational singularities themselves.<br/><br/>This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one that blossomed to the point where it has solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, and still in its simplest form it treats figures defined in the plane by polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics. A central problem in algebraic geometry is the classification of all geometric objects. In turn, an important part of classification theory is the theory of moduli. The latter's core idea is that one does not only want to understand these objects, but also understand the way they can be deformed. Moduli spaces play a very important role in theoretical physics.  Studying curves on moduli spaces provides information on how an object is changing in space-time. One of the focuses of this project is on compact moduli spaces. Those are extensions of moduli spaces in general and they give additional information about singular deformations, ones that are essentially different from others. Other goals of the project involve a better understanding of certain higher dimensional varieties."

However, in the theory of moduli of surfaces, more complicated degenerations naturally arise for which there are no vanishing cycles. In some of these cases Hacking has described a rigid holomorphic vector bundle on the smooth fibre which is analogous to a vanishing cycle. Hacking will use this construction to study the boundary of the moduli space of surfaces and the classification of stable vector bundles on surfaces.<br/><br/>In nature, the shape of a space can vary continuously with time; a good example is the surface of a large soap bubble.

Previous work on this problem used the notion of a ?vanishing cycle?  - a subset of the given space which shrinks to a point in the degeneration. Hacking will use bundles of linear spaces over the given space whose structure becomes simpler under the degeneration.

He also will work on a book which aims to make the modern Schubert calculus and its various extensions and applications more accessible to beginners in the area.<br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with enumerative algebraic geometry and its interaction with other parts of mathematics such as Lie theory and combinatorics. The calculus invented by Schubert is a fundamental example of enumerative techniques in geometry which predate the cohomology and intersection theories of the twentieth century. An example of the kind of question considered by Schubert is: given 4 lines in Euclidean 3-space in general position, how many lines intersect all 4 of the given lines? Schubert calculus provides a general method to answer similar questions involving linear conditions in higher dimensions. The more recent definition of the quantum cohomology ring of a manifold incorporates invariants that count the number of rational curves in the space which satisfy natural incidence conditions. This theory has its origin in quantum physics, where it has applications to string theory and the predictions of mirror symmetry. The homogeneous spaces of Lie groups and their Schubert varieties provide a rich source of examples where explicit computations of quantum cohomology rings are possible. The resulting modern Schubert calculus is the focus of this research project. Besides the many applications to related areas such as equivariant cohomology and quiver varieties, it introduces fresh new ways of looking at rather classical objects, and leads to important combinatorial and computational challenges.<br/>"

The conjectures offer an explanation for why the representation theories of real and p-adic, and even of adelic, groups are so similar.  The price of this uniformity is that, often, one may no longer speak of individual representations, but rather of finite collections of them (called L-packets).  These are expected to encode both number-theoretic (via Galois groups) and algebro-geometric (via many avenues---for example, the theory of stable distributions) information.  For some families of representations, the investigators already have clear expectations for what the L-packets should be, but they cannot yet prove that their expectations are correct.  For other families, there is not even a reasonable conjecture for what the answer should be.  The theory of real groups suggests yet another rewarding perspective, from the point of view of symmetric spaces.  For p-adic groups, the serious study of harmonic analysis on such spaces is just beginning to be developed, in large part by the investigators, and the analogues in this setting of the local Langlands conjectures are far from clear.  The part of the local Langlands conjectures dealing with functoriality also suggests that the investigators should be able to transfer representation-theoretic  information between different matrix groups.  A classical realization of this is the theory of lifting, where representations of matrix groups over a large field are related to those of the same group, but with coefficients taken in a smaller field.  Most progress in this area has been via somewhat ad hoc methods, but the answers have invariably turned out to be related to natural constructions arising in the symmetric-space setting.<br/><br/><br/>Representation theory, broadly understood, has its origins in two classical problems. The first, investigated by Fourier in the 19th century, was an attempt to understand complicated physical processes, such as heat diffusion, by representing them as combinations of simpler processes.  The second, initially studied by Frobenius, Schur, and others, was an attempt to understand the structure of a finite collection of symmetries via an associated polynomial known as its group determinant.  The surprising fact that the solutions to these two problems are related has turned out to be just the earliest instance of a family of deep and far-reaching connections that have been formalized in a collection of conjectures known collectively as the (local) Langlands conjectures. The depth and broad reach of these conjectures---for example, they encompass a large part of the celebrated recent proof of the centuries-old Fermat's Last Theorem---has meant that progress has so far been relatively slow.  This project brings together a group of mathematicians from a broad variety of related  backgrounds, whose combined expertise can be expected to allow significant progress both on these conjectures and on related results in representation theory and harmonic analysis.<br/>"

Laza's work exploits the existence of multiple birational models for a moduli space (e.g. obtained by using different compactification methods, such as Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) or Hodge theory) to extract useful geometric information about a given moduli space. The principal investigator plans to apply this type of ideas to various projects involving moduli spaces. A first question that the PI proposes to investigate is the problem of finding a geometric compactification for the moduli of polarized K3 surfaces. The methods of the variation of GIT quotients and ideas coming from the minimal model program offer a promising approach to the low degree cases. A second project addresses various questions about the moduli of compact hyperkaehler manifolds, higher dimensional analogues of the K3 surfaces. In particular, the PI plans to investigate from an arithmetic and geometric point of view the case of moduli space of double EPW sextics (introduced by O'Grady).  A third project is concerned with some concrete questions about the birational geometry of moduli spaces of genus 4 curves and cubic threefolds. <br/><br/>The general area of the proposal is algebraic geometry, the branch of mathematics that is concerned with the geometric properties of algebraic varieties (geometric objects defined by polynomial equations). A simple example of algebraic variety is the complex torus, that has the shape of a doughnut. While in other branches of mathematics (such as topology) all doughnuts have the same shape, in algebraic geometry the precise shape (in this case the ratio between the diameter and width) is very important. In fact, the precise quantification of the shape of the geometric objects within a given topological class is the subject of the moduli theory.

Such products can be interpreted as the number of points in an intersection in general Schubert varieties, and therefore provide an essential tool in enumerative algebraic geometry. While this ring contains information about the components of an intersection of Schubert varieties, the K-theory ring also provides information about how these components intersect. The equivariant cohomology ring refines the ring structure by taking a group action into account. And the quantum cohomology ring encodes the Gromov-Witten invariants, which give the number of curves of fixed degree that meet general Schubert varieties. All these rings can be combined to one single equivariant quantum K-theory ring (to rule them all).  Until recently, not much has been known about the structure of this ring, since the Gromov-Witten invariants used to define it have been hard to compute. The investigator will attempt to overcome this problem and uncover the ring structure in as many cases as possible.  He will also seek answers to some important open questions concerning the orbit closures of quiver representations.  These objects from representation theory generalize many interesting degeneracy loci, including Schubert varieties and determinantal varieties, and their classes generalize important polynomials from geometry and combinatorics, including Schur, Schubert, and Grothendieck polynomials.  Studies of orbit closures for relatively simple quivers have in the past resulted in many beautiful formulas, constructions, and positivity results. The proposer hopes to generalize these results to more general quivers.<br/><br/>The investigator will attack problems in the broad area of enumerative geometry, especially problems concerning quantum rings and quiver cycles.  Enumerative geometry aims to provide the tools required to count the number of geometric objects of given type that satisfy specified conditions. A typical example is the fact that exactly two lines (possibly with complex coordinates) meet 4 randomly chosen fixed lines in 3-space.  Enumerative problems are often approached by constructing a moduli space, which has one point for each geometric object of the given type, and then translating the specified conditions into polynomial equations on the moduli space.  This transforms the problem into one of counting the solutions to such equations. Quiver cycles can be understood as a way to organize equations that arise in many important situations, and knowledge about geometric invariants of quiver cycles adds to their utility for counting solutions.  Ideas from string theory in physics led to the definition of the quantum cohomology ring of a homogeneous space, which provides an efficient tool for counting the number of curves of given degree that meet fixed subvarieties in the space, at least when this number is finite.  When the number of solution curves is infinite, the set of these curves form a space called a Gromov-Witten variety, and geometric invariants of this space can tell us much about the problem.  For example, if the Gromov-Witten variety has non-zero Euler characteristic, then solution curves do exist.  Quantum K-theory is a generalization of quantum cohomology that encodes the Euler characteristic of Gromov-Witten varieties.  The investigator plans to study these topics with a combination of geometric and combinatorial methods."

For example, as far as random graphs are concerned, he will be focusing on the problem of finding sharp thresholds for the existence of factors in random graphs and hypergraphs, a special case of which is  the sharp version of Shamir's conjecture on perfect matching in random hypergraphs. He will also study expansion in random lifts and the sandwiching conjecture concerning Erd\""os-R\'enyi random graphs and random regular graphs. For random matrices, he proposes to study many problems concerning random Bernoulli matrices, such as probability of singularity, distributions of determinants and permanents, and properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Several of these problems have strong connection to problems in theoretical computer science. The PI will also continue his study of structural theorems in additive combinatorics, in particular those which have strong links to other fields, such as number theory and probability.<br/><br/>For a long time, randomness has been used by scientists to model huge and difficult structures that occur in nature. One famous example is Wigner's use of the spectra of random matrices to model energy levels of atoms.  Another is the use of random graphs to model real life graphs such as the Internet. The PI plan is to make a systematic study of random matrices and random graphs, together with some problems in number theory, which, quite surprisingly, have turned out to be related. He strongly  believes  that a systematic study of the proposed problems will eventually lead to the developments of new ideas and tools, which can be useful in many other topics, and to a deeper understanding of the relations between various fields of mathematics."

The main objective is the study of algebraic structures--a ring, an ideal, or even a module--as they undergo smoothing processes. These transformations enable them to support new constructions, including analytic ones. In the case of algebras, divisors acquire a group structure, cohomology tends to slim down, and it is an essential step in the desingularization of singular varieties. At its core is the inherent interest in those processes that add to the structure the solutions of collections of equations of integral dependence. Finding these equations, determining the properties of the assemblage of solutions and understanding the complexity costs of these tasks is a central region of research for commutative algebra. The assignments of measures of size, via multiplicity theories recently discovered by the proposer and his students, to the algebras and to the construction itself are key aspects of the project. As applications, the proposer seeks to predict how delicate techniques associated to smoothing processes will perform when applied to the solution of several problems of interest, and thereby suggest which mix of methods offer higher performance.  They will also be employed to derive ordinary complexity counts for several of these problems without previously known classical counts.<br/><br/>Commutative algebra, the subject area of the proposal, is foremost the study of systems of polynomial equations, and of its generalizations. It has elucidated several structures that occur among such systems, particularly those tagged as of Cohen-Macaulay type. These encode theoretical efficiencies in the derivation/prediction of its properties and offer superb computational economies. Often the full natural set of equations is not known at the outset so that methods and processes must be developed to find and analyze it.  This proposal is focused on one central process, that of smoothing transformation.  It will develop methods, grounded on the Cohen-Macaulay case, to predict properties of the closure, devise algorithms to find it and examine the limits of the behavior of arbitrary (even unknown) algorithms.  The results and methods developed will be used for interaction where the subject meets algebraic geometry, combinatorics, geometric modeling, number theory and robotics.<br/>"

The PI and Schmid have developed an alternative method for proving the holomorphy of Langlands L-functions, which establishes their holomorphy in new cases.  It also has been used to develop Voronoi-style summation formulas, which were later applied to obtain the first subconvexity results for GL(3) L-functions.

Such information can be used, as in the second project, to give explicit bounds and parameter estimates for cryptosystems.

The first class of cycles represent abelian surfaces having  complex multiplication by  a fixed order in a quartic CM field.  The second class of cycles are the Hirzebruch-Zagier cycles which represent abelian surfaces having quaternionic multiplication by a fixed order in an indefinite quaternion algebra over the rationals.  The cycles of complex multiplication points lie in codimension two, while the Hirzebruch-Zagier cycles lie in codimension one.  Hilbert modular surfaces are known to admit integral models which are regular of dimension three, hence one can compute the intersection multiplicity of a codimension two cycle of complex multiplication points with a codimension one Hirzebruch-Zagier cycle.  The principal investigator will prove that if the codimension two cycle is held fixed while the Hirzebruch-Zagier cycle varies, then the resulting intersection multiplicities are the Fourier coefficients of a particular weight two modular form.  Of particular interest is the case in which the two cycles intersect improperly.  This modular form is defined by restricting a parallel weight one Hilbert modular Eisenstein series  on a totally real field, viewed as a function on the product of two upper half planes, to the diagonally embedded upper half plane.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Elliptic curves and their higher dimensional variants, called abelian varieties, play an increasingly important role in modern cryptology, and the construction of secure encryption algorithms can sometimes be reduced to the problem of constructing abelian varieties with prescribed properties.  The principal investigator will count the number of  abelian varieties of dimension two (abelian surfaces) which possess a prescribed collection of symmetries.  As the precise collection of symmetries is allowed to vary, the resulting counting formulae are expected to agree with a known sequence of numbers appearing in the theory of modular forms. This latter sequence is readily computable, and thus the resulting formulae will provide an effective method to count the number of abelian surfaces with prescribed properties.<br/>"

Though Poisson algebras are very closely interconnected with these algebras, at present there is no systematic algebraic theory of Poisson algebras. This is rather surprising if one takes in account how important (and popular) Poisson algebras are in many branches of mathematics and physics. It is important to study Poisson algebras from an algebraic point of view. An algebraic theory of Poisson algebras will be useful for understanding the geometry of Poisson structures. Purely algebraic study of Poisson algebras should also give new approaches to many problems of commutative algebras, Lie algebras, and associative algebras. It is clear as well that the study of Poisson structures will bring a better understanding of their deformation quantization.<br/><br/>Simon-Denis Poisson (1781 ?1840) was one of the most prolific mathematicians of all times. Among his numerous contributions, he introduced Poisson brackets as a tool for classical dynamics.  Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (1804 ? 1851) realized the importance of these brackets and discovered their algebraic properties. Marius Sophus Lie  (17 December 1842 - 18 February 1899) began the study of their geometry. During the past 40 years Poisson geometry has become an active field of research stimulated by connections with a number of areas, including non-commutative, geometry, harmonic analysis on Lie groups, infinite dimensional Lie algebras, mechanics of particles and continua, singularity theory,  and completely integrable systems.<br/>Systematic algebraic approach to the Poisson structures and development of appropriate algebraic theory and tools has potentially the same value for the scientist working with these structures (primarily physicists and geometers) as commutative algebra has for algebraic geometers. This approach should bring better clarity to the subject and allow obtaining more detailed and understandable results.<br/>"

Shimura varieties form one of the main testing grounds for conjectures of Langlands on the calculation of Hasse-Weil zeta functions of algebraic varieties over number fields in terms of automorphic L-functions.  The zeta function is defined as a product of local zeta functions, over all prime ideals in the field of definition. <br/>At primes of good reduction, the approach of Langlands and Kottwitz has been completed, thanks in part to the recent proof of the Langlands-Shelstad conjecture (""fundamental lemma"") due to Ngo, Laumon, Waldspurger, and others.  When singularities exist in the reduction modulo a prime ideal, geometric and representation-theoretic difficulties arise, which the PI will investigate.  An important role will be played by some new ""fundamental lemmas"" which were not predicted by Langlands and which are formulated using Bernstein's decomposition of the category of smooth representations of a p-adic group.  Another ingredient will be a decomposition of nearby cycles in a manner parallel to Bernstein's decomposition, and geometric arguments showing these nearby cycles give rise to test functions in the Bernstein center of the associated p-adic group.<br/><br/>Many deep results in number theory involve the expression of a purely arithmetic object (such as a zeta function) in terms of a purely analytic object (such as an L-function).  The latter are functions of a complex variable originating in the classical theory of modular forms, which are functions on the complex upper-half plane satisfying very stringent symmetry conditions.  Several famous conjectures (e.g. the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, a Clay Math foundation Millennium Problem) postulate relations between values of zeta functions and arithmetic invariants.  Shimura varieties form an important class of objects where links between arithmetic and analysis can be fully carried out.  Progress in their study often has impact on other central questions in automorphic forms: a recent example is the proof due to M. Harris and R. Taylor of the local Langlands conjecture for general linear groups over p-adic fields. The PI will seek to further our understanding of Shimura varieties and other aspects of the Langlands program.<br/>"

The idea stems from a successful description of rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type, which flourished in the mid 1980s. Results about finite-dimensional algebras are generalized to rings of higher dimension. Such a description was recently extended to rings with a finite Gorenstein type. The PI?s main goal is to understand which categories of modules have the right properties to provide a description of the ring  when finiteness conditions are available. To do so, the PI proposes to investigate further the relationship between the properties of the category of totally reflexive modules and those of the base ring. For example, the PI proposes to understand the long standing open problem to characterize which properties of the ring force every totally reflexive module to be free. As totally reflexive modules come from infinite complexes, the investigation naturally includes methods from homological algebra, where the properties of modules are linearized by a  possibly infinite approximation.<br/><br/>The project is devoted to investigating problems in commutative algebra with the main goal being to understand the set of solutions of polynomial equations in many variables. In the effort to describe such a set of solutions, algebraists study the set of functions defined on the set of solution when a visual intuition is not available. As functions can be added and multiplied, the set of functions has the structure of a commutative ring, of which the most familiar example is the ring of polynomials.  It is well established that understanding a ring is tantamount to understanding the category of its modules, which are  generalization of vector spaces over fields.<br/><br/>"

The PI proposes a p-adic study of such L-functions using techniques inspired by Dwork, Adolphson, Sperber, Robba, Wan, et al.. This would be a general study including many common archetypes, such as the generalized Airy family, the hyper-Kloosterman family, and the Dwork family.

Galois representations are frequently studied by their associated L-function. This is simply a function which encodes much, if not essentially all, of the Galois representation. Even the most elementary questions about these L-functions are still largely unknown. For instance, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture describing the precise location of the zeros of the L-function attached to a specific Galois representation. In this proposal, the PI plans to study Galois representations which arise from geometric situations using, and extending, tools from p-adic analysis. <br/>"

Further, the PI plans to push and apply the techniques that they have developed to Gromov-Witten theory, to Mirror Symmetry, and possibly also to<br/>birational geometry. In addition to the above, the PI has introduced a modular compactification of the space of n points in general linear position on the projective plane; this potentially has significant consequences on singularity theory. Lastly, he is also working toward the weighted strong factorization for projective varieties with at worst finite quotient singularities through GIT approach.<br/><br/><br/>The field of mirror symmetry of physics has exploded onto the mathematical scene in 1990's. This is a part of extremely rich interaction between mathematics and physics, or more specifically between geometry/analysis and quantum filed theory. Physicists, based on their physical intuition and experiments, proposed that there is a deep duality relation, the mirror symmetry, between two different physical models. Based on this duality, they discovered several astonishing mathematical formulas and statements. The challenge for mathematicians was to understand the mathematics behind the physical theories and prove some of the predications made by the physicists. The moduli spaces of stable maps are the main mathematical devices that play key roles in linking physicists' predications to mathematical proofs. These spaces all together can be quite arbitrary. One of the PI's main goal is to provide local structures of each of these spaces so that some important<br/>geometric tools can be applied. All the mathematical spaces investigated in the project are connected to different branches of mathematics and are also directly related to the active research in super string theory of theoretical physics.

The PI has conjectured an explicit relationship between the values of a cup product on cyclotomic p-units and p-adic L-values, taken modulo p, of newforms that satisfy congruences with Eisenstein series at a prime above p.  The proposed research relates to this through a number of distinct but intertwined sub-projects, including an algebraic study of the structure of the Selmer groups of the associated modular representations, the exploration of relationships with Kato's Euler system and classical main conjectures, and the precise formulation of certain generalizations.<br/><br/>A remarkable aspect of algebraic number theory lies in the connections it finds between objects that appear to be of entirely different natures.  These objects can roughly be described as falling into two classes: those that are algebraic, and those that are analytic.  The algebraic objects are typically found by considering numbers that can be formed by applying the standard operations of arithmetic to the roots of polynomial equations, or by considering the symmetries of those roots.  The analytic objects are often functions on interesting spaces with values that are complex numbers.  The project concerns an unexpected direct comparison between the algebraic values of a function on pairs of numbers and the analytic power series attached to highly symmetrical complex-valued functions known as modular forms.  The PI is exploring this and its many consequences in arithmetic."

The main activity of the Southwest Center is the Arizona Winter School (AWS), an annual meeting which has become a prominent national event, and which provides high-level training and research experience for graduate students in arithmetic geometry. The AWS is an intensive five-day meeting, organized around a different central topic each year, which features a set of courses by leading and emerging experts. The AWS is not a traditional conference: the speakers organize courses of four lectures, with lecture notes provided in advance, and propose projects for graduate students to work on during the meeting. Each speaker hosts working sessions nightly during the meeting, and on the last day the students present their findings to the entire group.  The result is a particularly intense and focused five days of mathematical activity for both students and speakers. Recent Winter School topics have included non-archimedean geometry, transcendence theory, and quadratic forms.  Upcoming AWS topics will be guided by future mathematical developments and the availability of key speakers.<br/><br/>At the Winter School, connections among peers are formed, and mentoring relationships between students and senior researchers are developed. As has been the case at previous Winter Schools, subsequent collaborations between participants at all levels are the norm. Experienced researchers develop new interests and see new connections that lead to important published results; students make concrete strides toward becoming research mathematicians; and post-doctoral assistants gain valuable mentoring experience, which helps to develop their academic careers. The Southwest Center website shares reusable content from the Winter Schools, including lecture notes, project descriptions, and audio and video of lectures.  Since our site will contain a thorough record of each Winter School, the dialogues begun at the Winter School will be extended to the greater mathematical community, and the efforts of the Winter School participants will be available to all mathematicians indefinitely.<br/>"

Two famous results that can be phrased in this language are Dirac's Theorem on the existence of Hamiltonian cycles and the Hajnal-Szemerdi Theorem on equitable coloring.  Both are special cases of another important graph packing problem known as Seymour's Conjecture.  This conjecture has been proved for extremely large graphs by  Komls, Srkzy and Szemerdi using their own Blow-Up Lemma and Szemerdi's Regularity Lemma, but is still open for ordinary sized graphs. A final example is the Bollobs-Eldridge-Catalin Graph Packing Conjecture, for which only very special cases have been solved. Each of these problems requests a packing of certain graphs with bounded maximal degree.  Many versions and special cases of these problems have been investigated by researches hoping to gain insight into the Graph Packing Conjecture, as well as other areas of graph theory. So far these efforts have met with only partial success.  This project aims to advance these investigations, paying particular attention to variations in which the maximum degree condition is replaced by a weaker condition such as maximum Ore-degree, coloring number, or two coloring number.<br/><br/>Graph theory is used to model many practical problems.  This project addresses questions of the following form.  Given a graph that satisfies some local density condition such as having large minimal degree, e.g., every employee in a company works well with 2/3 of the other employees, can we always find a sparse, but highly uniform, subgraph, e.g., a circular ordering of the employees so that every employee works well with each of the two preceding employees and each of the two succeeding employees? This example is essentially Psa's Conjecture (1960).  In the early years of graph theory many elementary techniques were introduced for answering such questions.  One example is the proof of Dirac's Theorem (1950).  However many natural questions remained unanswerable. Over the last thirty years deep and powerful techniques have been developed for attacking many of these questions, but generally they can only be applied to unrealistically large graphs. For example, Psa's conjecture has only been proved for such enormous graphs. On the other hand, elementary, but complicated, methods can be used to show an open-ended (path) version of Psa's Conjecture for all graphs.  One of the challenges for this project is to prove the full Psa Conjecture for all graphs.<br/>"

This program  plans to investigate, with the organization of several mini-courses, lecture series, seminars, a proceedings book and a final conference on March 2009 a number of topics pertaining to the rich interconnection between the fields of Noncommutative Geometry, Number Theory and Mathematical Physics. The interaction between the aforementioned fields is a quite new area of mathematics, which has matured rapidly in the past few years and has produced very exciting results. It seems very timely at this point to organize an extended program on these topics with the aim to pursue a wider exploration of this area of research and also with the goal to analyze the major advances that have been obtained in Noncommutative Geometry in the recent past. In view of very recent developments obtained as a joint project by the PI's, particular attention will be given, during the whole program and at the final conference, to the topic ``Noncommutative geometry, the Riemann zeta-function, motives and the field with one element.'' In the weekly NCGA seminars (noncommutative geometry and arithmetic seminars) and at the final conference main emphasis will be given to describe the link that has recently emerged connecting a well-known quantum statistical dynamical system in noncommutative geometry (the BC-system), the corresponding noncommutative motive (BC-endomotive) and a newly developed algebraic-geometric theory of schemes  over the absolute point.<br/><br/>The direct impact of NSF funding is that of supporting and training  a significant number of junior U.S. researchers (junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students), who will gain the opportunity to participate in the program. Mentoring and training of junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students is a central part of every JAMI program, as is helping these individuals develop networks that include the world's leading researchers. To accomplish this, the PI's have  recruited a broad and diverse participant group, paying particular attention to women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. In light of several very recent results, which reveal surprising new connections between the fields of Number Theory and Noncommutative Geometry,  the PIs  expect that the research broadcast by this program will have a major impact on the development of these fields, under a unified methodology. The rapidly increasing interest in the area of ``Noncommutative Arithmetic Geometry'' has led the PI's to the organization of several recent workshops, which generated collaborative work between theoretical mathematicians and physicists and have attracted the interest of an impressive number of  graduate students and young researchers across different fields.<br/>"

The second component of the project is concerned with decomposition of tensors.<br/><br/>In many applications, it is natural to represent a collection of data as a multi-indexed list. Alternatively, one can think of the data as a multidimensional array (sometimes called a multi-way array). For example, a digital grayscale picture can be stored as a matrix of numbers where each pixel location in the picture corresponds to a location in the matrix and the number in the matrix corresponds to the darkness of the pixel. In a similar manner, a digital color picture can be stored as a three dimensional array of numbers. A mathematical framework that includes the study of multi-way arrays, and their representations as sums of more basic objects, is through parameter spaces of tensors. This project explores problems related to tensors, tensor decomposition, tensor rank and tensor border rank from an algebro-geometric point viewpoint. These subjects have significant applications in fields as diverse as signal processing, data analysis, computational biology, combinatorics, algebraic geometry and statistics. It is the expectation, therefore, that techniques developed through this research will advance our knowledge and understanding across multiple disciplines."

The hope is that (near its boundary) the associated toric variety carries a canonical universal family of pairs of K3 surface with divisor. The existence of such a family would  naturally generalize the mirror symmetry programs of Kontsevich-Soibelman and Gross-Siebert, and at the same time unifying this work with Thurston's work on triangulations of the 2-sphere, and Looijenga's conjecture on smoothings of cusp singularities.<br/><br/>According to quantum field theory the physical universe is controlled by a so called Calabi-Yau manifold -- a certain kind of geometric object. As a result it is important to understand the set of such objects -- the so called Moduli space of Calabi-Yau manifolds, and in particular to understand the behavior of this space at infinity, i.e. near its boundary, or equivalently, to understand how Calabi-Yau manifolds can degenerate. One case is well understood: A complex 1-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold is the surface of a doughnut, and as one moves to the boundary of the moduli space, one loop on the doughnut shrinks, the limiting point on the boundary of the moduli space corresponds to crushing this loop to a point -- which yields the space you obtain by taking a real 2 dimensional sphere and bending it until two points touch each other. The goal of the project is to understand what happens in the next higher dimension, complex dimension two, and thus to describe the boundary behavior of the moduli space of so called K3 surfaces."

The conjectures offer an explanation for why the representation theories of real and p-adic, and even of adelic, groups are so similar. The price of this uniformity is that, often, one may no longer speak of individual representations, but rather of finite collections of them (called L-packets). These are expected to encode both number-theoretic (via Galois groups) and algebro-geometric (via many avenues---for example, the theory of stable distributions) information. For some families of representations, the investigators already have clear expectations for what the L-packets should be, but they cannot yet prove that their expectations are correct. For other families, there is not even a reasonable conjecture for what the answer should be. The theory of real groups suggests yet another rewarding perspective, from the point of view of symmetric spaces. For p-adic groups, the serious study of harmonic analysis on such spaces is just beginning to be developed, in large part by the investigators, and the analogues in this setting of the local Langlands conjectures are far from clear. The part of the local Langlands conjectures dealing with functoriality also suggests that the investigators should be able to transfer representation-theoretic information between different matrix groups. A classical realization of this is the theory of lifting, where representations of matrix groups over a large field are related to those of the same group, but with coefficients taken in a smaller field. Most progress in this area has been via somewhat ad hoc methods, but the answers have invariably turned out to be related to natural constructions arising in the symmetric-space setting.<br/><br/><br/>Representation theory, broadly understood, has its origins in two classical problems. The first, investigated by Fourier in the 19th century, was an attempt to understand complicated physical processes, such as heat diffusion, by representing them as combinations of simpler processes. The second, initially studied by Frobenius, Schur, and others, was an attempt to understand the structure of a finite collection of symmetries via an associated polynomial known as its group determinant. The surprising fact that the solutions to these two problems are related has turned out to be just the earliest instance of a family of deep and far-reaching connections that have been formalized in a collection of conjectures known collectively as the (local) Langlands conjectures. The depth and broad reach of these conjectures---for example, they encompass a large part of the celebrated recent proof of the centuries-old Fermat's Last Theorem---has meant that progress has so far been relatively slow. This project brings together a group of mathematicians from a broad variety of related backgrounds, whose combined expertise can be expected to allow significant progress both on these conjectures and on related results in representation theory and harmonic analysis."

The workshop will provide a very important opportunity to new researchers (including graduate students) to work with experts from the two fields. The workshop will be followed by the 12th annual International Conference on Ordered Algebraic Structures which will run from the 15th of June through the 19th of June. The theory of lattice-ordered groups has a long history and has many applications to other branches of mathematics: lattice theory, permutation groups, commutative integral domains, vector lattices, positivity, algebraic K-theory, and general topology. MV-algebras (or ?many-valued algebras?) were introduced in the 1950s by C.C. Chang to form the algebraic semantics of Lukasiewicz many-valued logic. The theory of MV-algebras has applications to logic, toric varieties, algebraic K-theory, functional analysis, and C*-algebras. In 1986, D. Mundici proved that the category of abelian lattice-ordered groups with strong order unit and their unit-preserving homomorphisms is naturally equivalent to the category of MV-algebras. In 2002 this result was extended to a natural equivalence between the category of lattice-ordered groups with strong order unit and their unit-preserving homomorphisms and the category of generalized MV-algebras (a.k.a. pseudo MV-algebras).<br/><br/>The workshop aims to inform its participants on the recent breakthroughs of how the two branches of mathematics interact with each other. It is hoped that the workshop will lead to further developments and connections between the two fields. One of the main goals of the workshop is to expose new faculty and graduate students, including members of under represented groups, to the two branches of mathematics and have them interact with experts in the fields. The participants will also be afforded the opportunity to participate in the 12th annual International Conference on Ordered Algebraic Structures which immediately follows the workshop.

The use of Feynman diagrams as computational devices makes it possible to obtain high precision computations of physical processes involving elementary particles and quantum fields. Despite its long history of successful applications to the world of particle physics, the mathematics of quantum field theory is still mysterious and full of beautiful challenges and open problems. Numerical evidence suggests that the procedure of extracting finite values from divergent Feynman integrals gives rise to a class of numbers, multiple zeta values, that are of great significance to number theory and algebraic geometry. This suggests a mysterious relation between quantum field theory and an important research topic of current interest in pure mathematics: Grothendieck's theory of motives of algebraic varieties. The purpose of this research proposal is to understand the nature of this relation and investigate what results can be derived from it, both in terms of gaining some better understanding of the very difficult multi-loop computations of Feynman integrals using tools from algebraic geometry, and conversely of understanding how we can extend our current knowledge of motives using quantum field theory.<br/><br/>One of the main questions under investigation is when, possibly after a subtraction of divergences, the computation of a Feynman integral for a scalar quantum field theory results in a period of a mixed Tate motive. Using the Feynman parametric form, this question reflects the motivic nature of a relative cohomology of an affine hypersurface constructed out of the data of the Feynman integral. The subtraction of divergences is encoded in a Hopf algebra structure, which is itself related to Hopf algebras and dual groups that appear naturally in the theory of motives.<br/>One of the main steps that are needed to further understand the relation between quantum field theory and motives is combining the more concrete approach via the algebraic geometry of hypersurfaces of Feynman graphs with the more abstract approach via Tannakian categories and Hopf algebras.<br/>"

Some of these, such as the homological conjectures, are old problems for which recent advances have provided the hope of a solution; the problems on tight closure and finiteness properties of local cohomology modules are a continuation of the PI's long-term projects. Hochster's monomial conjecture is unresolved for rings that do not contain a field, such as those arising in number theory. Two approaches to this will be pursued: the first is a natural extension of Heitmann's work; another is via local cohomology theory. Brenner and Monsky recently proved that tight closure need not commute with localization. However, it appears likely that weak F-regularity---the property that all ideals of a ring are tightly closed---does localize. This will be approached via the notion of splinter rings. It is also proposed to attack Lyubeznik's conjecture that local cohomology modules of regular rings have finitely many associated prime ideals. This is now known in various cases, but remains unresolved for polynomial rings over the integers.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with questions in commutative algebra. This is a field closely related to algebraic geometry: while algebraic geometry focuses on the geometry of solution sets of polynomial equations, the point of view in commutative algebra is to study the ring of polynomial functions on a solution set. Most of the questions that will be investigated may be viewed as questions about the existence of solutions for families of equations, and about the nature of the solution sets. Commutative algebra continues to develop a fascinating interaction with several branches of mathematics, and is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in engineering, coding theory, cryptography, and other applications of strategic interest.<br/>"

They are the natural extension of vector bundles to a category that is closed under kernels and cokernels. Their naturality and usefulness was first explored in Serre's landmark paper (FAC). Traditionally, the coherent sheaves on a smooth projective variety are broken down in terms of dimension of support and ``stability'' (Geometric Invariant Theory). However, recent work in string theory points to an entire manifold of stability conditions on categories of complexes of vector bundles (D-branes in the physics literature). These resemble perverse sheaves, and like perverse sheaves seem to have extremely nice properties. In joint work with Daniele Arcara, the PI put stability conditions on a rigorous mathematical footing for all complex surfaces, and in the current proposal he will explore the applications of this new theory to ``classical'' problems in algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is the study of the shapes of solution sets of systems of polynomial equations in many variables. One crucial tool in this study is the construction of invariants, i.e. auxiliary structures that allow one to distinguish among the different shapes. Rather surprisingly, string theorists have made very significant contributions to algebraic geometry in recent years. In work relevant to this project, they have proposed the existence of a ``stability manifold'' for ``D-branes,'' which seems to be a very powerful new tool for both distinguishing different shapes and for answering classical questions in algebraic geometry (e.g. How many variables does one need in order to embed a particular shape?) The PI will develop this new tool, building on his previous work explaining the two-dimensional case."

The conjectures offer an explanation for why the representation theories of real and p-adic, and even of adelic, groups are so similar. The price of this uniformity is that, often, one may no longer speak of individual representations, but rather of finite collections of them (called L-packets). These are expected to encode both number-theoretic (via Galois groups) and algebro-geometric (via many avenues---for example, the theory of stable distributions) information. For some families of representations, the investigators already have clear expectations for what the L-packets should be, but they cannot yet prove that their expectations are correct. For other families, there is not even a reasonable conjecture for what the answer should be. The theory of real groups suggests yet another rewarding perspective, from the point of view of symmetric spaces. For p-adic groups, the serious study of harmonic analysis on such spaces is just beginning to be developed, in large part by the investigators, and the analogues in this setting of the local Langlands conjectures are far from clear. The part of the local Langlands conjectures dealing with functoriality also suggests that the investigators should be able to transfer representation-theoretic information between different matrix groups. A classical realization of this is the theory of lifting, where representations of matrix groups over a large field are related to those of the same group, but with coefficients taken in a smaller field. Most progress in this area has been via somewhat ad hoc methods, but the answers have invariably turned out to be related to natural constructions arising in the symmetric-space setting.<br/><br/><br/>Representation theory, broadly understood, has its origins in two classical problems. The first, investigated by Fourier in the 19th century, was an attempt to understand complicated physical processes, such as heat diffusion, by representing them as combinations of simpler processes. The second, initially studied by Frobenius, Schur, and others, was an attempt to understand the structure of a finite collection of symmetries via an associated polynomial known as its group determinant. The surprising fact that the solutions to these two problems are related has turned out to be just the earliest instance of a family of deep and far-reaching connections that have been formalized in a collection of conjectures known collectively as the (local) Langlands conjectures. The depth and broad reach of these conjectures---for example, they encompass a large part of the celebrated recent proof of the centuries-old Fermat's Last Theorem---has meant that progress has so far been relatively slow. This project brings together a group of mathematicians from a broad variety of related backgrounds, whose combined expertise can be expected to allow significant progress both on these conjectures and on related results in representation theory and harmonic analysis."

If S is a discrete semigroup, then its Stone-Cech compactification is, in a natural way, a compact Hausdorff right topological semigroup. As is true of any compact Hausdorff right topological semigroup, this Stone-Cech compactification has a smallest two sided ideal, and this ideal usually has elaborate algebraic structure. This project involves the study of the algebraic structure of the Stone-Cech compactification and its smallest ideal and investigation of the combinatorial applications of that structure, primarily to Ramsey Theory.<br/><br/>Ramsey Theory is that part of combinatorics that deals with the question of what sort of homogeneous structures one can expect to find in some one cell of a finite partition (or ""coloring"") of specified sets. For example, the simplest nontrivial instance of the infinite version of Ramsey's Theorem says that whenever the two element subsets of the set N of positive integers are finitely colored, there must be some infinite subset of N all of whose two element subsets are the same color. The principal investigator gained some fame many years ago when he proved that whenever N is finitely colored, there must exist in one color an infinite sequence together with all of its finite sums of distinct terms without repetition. The original proof was elementary, but very complicated. But in 1975, Fred Galvin and Steven Glazer showed that this ""Finite Sums Theorem"" is a completely trivial consequence of the fact that the Stone-Cech compactification of N can be given an algebraic structure extending ordinary addition which is a compact right topological semigroup, and therefore has idempotents, that is elements such that p + p = p. Since then, numerous other applications of the algebraic structure of Stone-Cech compactifications to Ramsey Theory have been found.<br/><br/>"

As the name suggests,<br/>these closures, which coincide with tight closure in equicharacteristic<br/>p, are based upon the plus closure of an ideal, the set of elements<br/>which are in the extension of the ideal in some integral extension of<br/>the original ring.

As a natural byproduct, it has<br/>led to the discovery of new properties. Understanding of local rings<br/>which do not contain a field has always lagged behind. The principal<br/>investigator has proposed several closely related and promising<br/>candidates to play the role of tight closure in the alternate setting.<br/>These candidates have already led to one significant new result.

Generalizations of Serre's conjecture have been put forth for other reductive groups by various mathematicians, including the PI. One main goal is to prove strong new results towards the weight parts of such conjectures.

A major innovation in the investigator's recent research is the use of non-commutative Iwasawa theory to study p-adically completed cohomology associated to automorphic forms of cohomological type, in particular, those forms that are not necessarily associated to Shimura varieties. One such class of automorphic forms are modular forms over an imaginary quadratic field. In this case, the associated symmetric space quotients are hyperbolic manifolds of real dimension 3, and thus, the study of such forms is not amenable to the usual techniques of algebraic geometry.  Modular forms over imaginary quadratic fields can be thought of geometrically as cohomology classes of certain local systems on arithmetic 3-manifolds. <br/>From a topological viewpoint, the cohomology of arithmetic 3-manifolds continues to be a subject of intense study. The tension between the number theoretical and topological perspectives makes this a fertile area for interdisciplinary research.

A more specific goal is to establish conditional modularity theorems over imaginary quadratic fields, adapting the method of Taylor--Wiles.<br/><br/><br/>The Langlands reciprocity conjecture predicts a one-to-one correspondence between two classes of disparate objects: Galois representations, which describe certain symmetries of algebraic numbers, and automorphic forms. <br/>Associated to each Galois representation is an automorphic form, which is like the DNA of the corresponding Galois representation: many properties of the Galois representation can be determined directly from the automorphic form. One strategy for establishing this correspondence is a counting argument: show that the number of automorphic forms (of any fixed<br/>type) equals the number of corresponding Galois representations. Wiles used this strategy to prove a special case of the Langlands reciprocity conjecture, from which Fermat's Last Theorem follows. Wiles' proof relies on certain auxiliary geometric constructions (Shimura varieties) that are not always available, and hence, any general argument requires a more robust method for counting automorphic forms. The investigator proposes such a method: by decomposing automorphic forms into their (mod-p) constituents and then gluing the pieces back together. This process (p-adic completion) relates the old counting problem to questions in topology, in particular, to well-known conjectures of Thurston. The investigator's research along these lines is helping to foster new collaborations between number theorists and low-dimensional topologists, which may lead to advances in several open questions in both fields. The investigator plans to organize several workshops for graduate students and postdocs designed to train young number theorists in this rapidly changing interdisciplinary field.<br/><br/>"

NSF funds will be used for travel and lodging for 20 participants including plenary speakers and students.  The Riemann zeta function has gained enormous importance in the eyes of number theorists since its properties (expressed in terms easily understandable to a modern undergraduate studying complex analysis) were developed by Riemann in a renowned lecture in Berlin in 1859. Since then, the function has been used to prove the fundamental theorem on the distribution of prime numbers, and many other important results in number theory. The Dirichlet L-functions, and other zeta functions and L-functions invented since that time by Dedekind, Hecke, Artin and others, have vastly extended the range of application of Riemann's ideas, yet many conundrums remain about their properties.  The workshop will have three sets of lectures by experts in the field: Brian Conrey, Ram Murty and Steve Gonek. Also, there will be about 16 talks by junior mathematicians and senior researchers. The three principal lecturers will discuss the ideas of zeta functions and L-functions beginning with the Riemann zeta function and Dirichlet L-functions, Dedekind zeta functions, and L-functions of number fields. They will also introduce automorphic L-functions, Artin L-functions and L-functions of varieties. Introductory concepts and results will be given in some detail. Modern topics such as the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the random matrix approach to results and conjectures concerning zeta functions and L-functions will also be outlined. <br/><br/>It is highly desirable to give graduate students working in number theory a broad picture of the state of the art in this subject area. The major component of the conference is the involvement of graduate students. This includes a certain number of talks reserved for graduate students who have results in the area to report. In addition, the conference will provide an opportunity for graduate students to interact with established researchers. This interaction will be promoted by scheduling breaks in which the participants will be encouraged to break up into groups to discuss research ideas. At the end of the workshop there will be a round table discussion on open problems and directions for future research. This will help stimulate the interest of graduate students and new PhDs.<br/>"

The study of maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over such rings has grown out of the theory of representations of Artin algebras, which has developed sophisticated theoretical techniques for classifying and characterizing module theories of non-commutative Artinian rings.  Classical problems from the non-commutative theory can often be stated directly in the commutative higher-dimensional framework, and this framework comes equipped with its own unique problems, specialized machinery, and deep, powerful connections with algebraic geometry.  The interplay between the two areas has been exceptionally productive for both. However, many of the most powerful tools of the Artinian arsenal are essentially noncommutative, in that they produce noncommutative rings even from commutative input, restricting their use in commutative algebra.  Recent theoretical advances in non-commutative algebraic geometry have begun to provide methods, including the notion of a non-commutative resolution of singularities, similar to those provided by classical algebraic geometry. Describing these non-commutative resolutions in terms of tools from the Artinian theory will allow the powerful tools of that area to be brought to bear on fundamental conjectures about the maximal Cohen--Macaulay modules over Cohen--Macaulay local rings.<br/><br/>This project lies at the intersection of the areas of commutative and non-commutative algebra, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry.  The classical aim of commutative algebra is to describe the solution sets of systems of polynomial equations by associating to them algebraic gadgets known as rings.  Non-commutative algebra, on the other hand, has developed theory for associating rings to directed graphs, also called quivers.  The synergy among these topics has enriched all four subjects, and has led to applications in such varied fields as robotics, statistics, cryptography, and particularly theoretical physics, where non-commutative methods are central to such subjects as quantum mechanics, string theory and the study of fundamental particles.<br/>"

Some of the specific goals detailed in this proposal are related to well-known open problems in the subject, including Ih's conjecture on integral preperiodic points, a function field analogue of Morton-Silverman's uniform boundedness conjecture, and the formulation of a dynamical analogue of Szpiro's conjecture for elliptic curves.  The proposed techniques include the use of Berkovich analytic spaces, canonical height functions, equidistribution, classical and non-archimedean Fatou-Julia theory, moduli spaces of endomorphisms, adelic capacity theory, and Diophantine inequalities.  Broadly, the majority of the ideas in this proposal can be viewed as reflections of two general themes: the first is the strong parallel between number fields and function fields of curves, and the second is the unified treatment of archimedean and non-archimedean algebraic dynamics, through the use of Berkovich analytic spaces. <br/><br/>Algebraic dynamics is a subject which combines elements of classical dynamical systems with algebraic geometry.  Its basic object of study is a set X representing the solutions to certain algebraic equations, together with a function f from X into itself.  To say that these objects are defined over global and local fields means essentially that they are of special interest to number theorists and arithmetic geometers.  The dynamical aspect of the subject comes into play when one repeatedly iterates the function f.  For example, if x is a point of the set X for which the infinite sequence f(x), f(f(x)), f(f(f(x))), f(f(f(f(x)))), ..., eventually falls into a finite loop, then x is called a preperiodic point with respect to f.  Many of the most fundamental questions in algebraic dynamics involve the nature of preperiodic points, and yet they are still not very well understood.  Some examples of natural open questions which this research proposal aims to address include the following: 1. How many preperiodic points are algebraic integers?  2.  Given two different functions f and g from X into itself, how many points are preperiodic with respect to both functions? 3.  How rapidly can a sequence of preperiodic points approach a given non-preperiodic point?"

There are some sufficient conditions for this optimal solution which involve the geometry of the solution set for a general choice of the parameters.

A second project addresses various questions about the moduli of compact hyperkaehler manifolds, higher dimensional analogues of the K3 surfaces. In particular, the PI plans to investigate from an arithmetic and geometric point of view the case of moduli space of double EPW sextics (introduced by O'Grady).  A third project is concerned with some concrete questions about the birational geometry of moduli spaces of genus 4 curves and cubic threefolds. <br/><br/>The general area of the proposal is algebraic geometry, the branch of mathematics that is concerned with the geometric properties of algebraic varieties (geometric objects defined by polynomial equations). A simple example of algebraic variety is the complex torus, that has the shape of a doughnut.

In fact, the precise quantification of the shape of the geometric objects within a given topological class is the subject of the moduli theory.

As an example, in one part of the project the PI proposes to study the existence of non-crossed product division algebras as well as indecomposable division algebras over the function field of a p-adic curve.  The general technique that the PI proposes is to study the division algebras that exist over completions of the function field and use a splitting map from the Brauer group of the completed function field to the Brauer group of the function field to lift the division algebras.  In another part of the project the PI proposes to continue to study the connection between degeneracy of a matrix defining an abelian crossed product and decomposability of the abelian crossed product.  The PI will follow up on an observation which she made which shows a not yet fully understood connection between degeneracy of the matrix, decomposability of the abelian crossed product and torsion in the 2nd Chow group of the associated Severi-Brauer variety.  Lastly, the PI proposes to study fields for which division algebras of small degree over that field can be distinguished by their splitting fields. In particular, the PI will consider this question over function fields of K3 surfaces.<br/><br/>The origins of division algebras can be traced back to Hamilton's discovery of the quaternions in 1843. Hamilton constructed his quaternion algebra to generalize the complex numbers and apply it to mechanics in three dimensional space. Since this discovery, quaternion algebras have been generalized to finite dimensional division algebras over a field, Azumaya algebras over a ring, and even sheaves of Azumaya algebras over a scheme. In each case the isomorphism classes of the objects are in 1-1 correspondence with a group, the Brauer group. Along the way the study of these algebras has involved many mathematical tools including Galois cohomology, valuation theory, number theory and algebraic geometry, just to name a few.  The types of division algebras that exist over a given field  can be seen as a measure of complexity or robustness of the field.   In this project the PI proposes to study this complexity by considering the types of division algebras that exist over particular fields.<br/>"

B. Rao. Rao's conjecture itself concerns degree sequences of graphs, and remains open, although in joint work with Maria Chudnovsky, the PI has made substantial progress, and believes they are near a complete proof. Rao's conjecture is a statement about well-quasi-ordering; that given infinitely many degree sequences, one of them must ""contain"" another in a sense. The work with Robertson gave rise to a number of offshoots, in complexity theory and in pure graph theory, and similarly Rao's conjecture suggests a number of side questions.<br/><br/>The PI, in joint work with Neil Robertson, already settled two major questions about well-quasi-ordering: Wagner's conjecture, that given infinitely many graphs, one must be a minor of another, and Nash-Williams' conjecture, that given infinitely many graphs, one must be contained in another as an ""immersion."" It seems that the methods they developed for these two conjectures can also be applied to Rao's conjecture. In addition, they have come across several new and interesting questions about graphs, as by-products of their work on Rao's conjecture, and plan to work on a number of these. These side questions would be excellent problems for graduate student theses, and the PI expects to work with students to answer them.<br/>"

The main points of interest are Bethe algebras for integrable models associated with the Lie algebra gl_N, such as the Gaudin model and the XXX-type model. Recent developments show a close connection of those Bethe algebras to algebras of functions on the Calogero-Moser space and intersections of Schubert cycles in Grassmannians. One of the intended goals is to understand deeper this important connection and to expand it to other algebras of geometric nature. Another goal is to establish direct links of the Bethe algebras in question with Cherednik algebras and double affine Hecke algebras. The existence of such links is very plausible because the latter algebras are closely related to the same geometric objects as Bethe algebras. One more direction of the project is to employ ideas of quasiclassical quantization to obtain asymptotics of large eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of Bethe algebras. Hopefully, those asymptotics can be formulated in terms of solutions of classical integrable systems.<br/><br/>The main question in the theory of quantum integrable systems is to find joint eigenvalues and eigenvectors of commuting integrals of motion. The Bethe ansatz originated as a set of clever technical tricks to perform this task. Eventually, it has developed into a variety of tools connecting this problem to many areas such as separation of variables for PDEs, Fuchsian differential equations, difference equations, Schubert calculus. This interaction turned out to be very extremely fruitful and yielded many important results for all the subjects involved. The project will contribute to further development of this area."

The proposed research naturally falls into two<br/>projects, according to the type of cohomology theory that is considered. The  rst project<br/>is concerned with the de Rham cohomology of the p-adic symmetric spaces de ned by<br/>Drinfeld. These can be considered as the special  bers of formal schemes, and these formal<br/>schemes represent deformation functors for certain p-divisible formal groups (with extra<br/>structures). It was shown by P. Schneider and U. Stuhler that the (compactly supported)<br/>de Rham cohomology groups of these spaces realize generalized Steinberg representations<br/>(of general linear groups). Torsion points on the universal formal group give rise to etale<br/>coverings of the symmetric spaces, and global arguments (relying on the use of Shimura<br/>varieties) show that their cohomology groups realize supercuspidal representations. Be-<br/>cause these spaces are Stein spaces, their cohomology groups can be computed by means<br/>of rigid-analytic di^erential forms. Using the relation to di^erential forms, the project<br/>aims at constructing lattices in these supercuspidal representations which then give rise<br/>to Banach space representations. Furthermore, the PI seeks to relate these Banach space<br/>representations to certain families of potentially crystalline Galois representations, at least<br/>when the spaces are one-dimensional (in which case the Galois representations are of di-<br/>mension two), and when the covering is 'tame'. The second project is concerned with the<br/>etale l-adic cohomology of deformation spaces of one-dimensional formal groups. These<br/>cohomology groups are known to realize the local Langlands correspondence between n-<br/>dimensional Weil group representations and representations of the p-adic GL(n). Again,<br/>the only known proofs for this fact, due to M. Harris and R. Taylor (respectively P. Boyer<br/>in the equal characteristic case) depend on global arguments. The PI proposes to investi-<br/>gate the equality between epsilon constants of representations which correspond to each<br/>other, in the case when the base  eld is of positive characteristic, by using local methods<br/>from rigid-analytic geometry. For the Galois representation a formula due to G. Laumon<br/>describes the epsilon constant in terms of a local Fourier transform, and this Fourier<br/>transform in turn has a rigid-analytic description. Analyzing this description the PI seeks<br/>to relate Laumon's formula to a formula of Bushnell and Frohlich for the corresponding<br/>representation of GL(n).<br/><br/><br/>The proposal is about investigating solutions of algebraic equations with special emphasis<br/>on methods involving congruences with respect to a  xed prime number p. For instance,<br/>even though a polynomial in general may have no roots which are rational numbers, there<br/>may well be integers which are roots up to multiples of (arbitrary) high powers of p. This<br/>can be considered as an approximate solution with respect to p, and these approximate<br/>solutions give rise to a solution which is no longer an ordinary number, but a so-called p-<br/>adic number. The arithmetic of p-adic numbers is considerably easier than the arithmetic<br/>of rational numbers, yet complex enough to reveal lots of information about algebraic<br/>equations (with rational coefficients). Moreover, it is possible to do analysis with p-adic<br/>numbers. The local Langlands correspondence describes the arithmetic of p-adic numbers<br/>in terms of actions of certain groups of matrices on linear spaces. These linear spaces are<br/>derived from non-linear or 'curved' spaces by 'taking homology', which is a process of<br/>converting geometric information into linear spaces. The curved spaces in turn, which<br/>are like surfaces in spaces of p-adic numbers, are accessible to analytic methods, with<br/>functions depending on p-adic numbers as arguments. The PI proposes to use these<br/>available analytic methods to investigate the curved spaces (and subsequently the linear<br/>spaces they give rise to) with the goal of getting a better understanding of the local<br/>Langlands correspondence and extending it beyond its classical domain."

Further, such equalities of mathematical objects defined in a priori different ways are not just of theoretical interest but tend to have extremely concrete applications, the most striking recent ones being the resolution of Fermat's last theorem and the Sato-Tate conjecture. The workshops, the final conference, and the graduate and post-doctoral advising will have an important impact on the formation of new researchers in the field and on the promotion of new collaborations."

The conjectures offer an explanation for why the representation theories of real and p-adic, and even of adelic, groups are so similar. The price of this uniformity is that, often, one may no longer speak of individual representations, but rather of finite collections of them (called L-packets). These are expected to encode both number-theoretic (via Galois groups) and algebro-geometric (via many avenues---for example, the theory of stable distributions) information. For some families of representations, the investigators already have clear expectations for what the L-packets should be, but they cannot yet prove that their expectations are correct. For other families, there is not even a reasonable conjecture for what the answer should be. The theory of real groups suggests yet another rewarding perspective, from the point of view of symmetric spaces. For p-adic groups, the serious study of harmonic analysis on such spaces is just beginning to be developed, in large part by the investigators, and the analogues in this setting of the local Langlands conjectures are far from clear. The part of the local Langlands conjectures dealing with functoriality also suggests that the investigators should be able to transfer representation-theoretic information between different matrix groups. A classical realization of this is the theory of lifting, where representations of matrix groups over a large field are related to those of the same group, but with coefficients taken in a smaller field. Most progress in this area has been via somewhat ad hoc methods, but the answers have invariably turned out to be related to natural constructions arising in the symmetric-space setting.<br/><br/><br/>Representation theory, broadly understood, has its origins in two classical problems. The first, investigated by Fourier in the 19th century, was an attempt to understand complicated physical processes, such as heat diffusion, by representing them as combinations of simpler processes. The second, initially studied by Frobenius, Schur, and others, was an attempt to understand the structure of a finite collection of symmetries via an associated polynomial known as its group determinant. The surprising fact that the solutions to these two problems are related has turned out to be just the earliest instance of a family of deep and far-reaching connections that have been formalized in a collection of conjectures known collectively as the (local) Langlands conjectures. The depth and broad reach of these conjectures---for example, they encompass a large part of the celebrated recent proof of the centuries-old Fermat's Last Theorem---has meant that progress has so far been relatively slow. This project brings together a group of mathematicians from a broad variety of related backgrounds, whose combined expertise can be expected to allow significant progress both on these conjectures and on related results in representation theory and harmonic analysis."

One example is the GL(2) Fourier trace formula of Kuznetsov, which has become ubiquitous in analytic number theory with applications to such diverse important problems as bounding sums of Kloosterman sums, moments of the Riemann zeta function, and subconvexity for modular L-functions.

An important part of Ramanujan's  legacy concerns the large quantity of aesthetic formulas he discovered involving functions called q-series.  Toward the end of his life, he discovered a particular family of q-series which he called ""mock theta functions"".    Though these functions share many properties with modular forms, a class of functions central to modern number theory, the mock theta functions are not modular forms.  Recent works of Bringmann, Ono, and Zwegers finally settled the question, as to the precise relationship between the mock theta functions and the theory of automorphic forms, a theory which subsumes the theory of modular forms.  This question had been outstanding for roughly eighty years.  We now know that a mock theta function is ""part"" or ""half"" of a  certain automorphic form called a harmonic weak Maass form.  This discovery motivates the study of a broader class of functions, called mock modular forms, which arise as ""parts"" of harmonic weak Maass forms.  These functions have applications not only <br/>to number theory, but to other areas of mathematics such as geometry, topology, and probability, and <br/>to mathematical physics.  <br/><br/>"

In the area of permutation enumeration, the PI will continue a study of the joint distribution of the major index and the excedance number on conjugacy classes of permutations, which was initiated in her work with Shareshian on the topology of a partially ordered set arising from commutative algebra considerations.  The major index and excedance number are two of four fundamental permutation statistics introduced by MacMahon at the beginning of the last century.  Although the joint distribution of other combinations of the four fundamental permutation statistics have been extensively studied in the literature, surprisingly the joint distribution of the major index and excedance number had not been considered until the work of the PI and Shareshian. In this work it is shown that this joint distribution has many remarkable properties, one of which is a new q-analog of the classical formula for the exponential generating function of the Eulerian polynomials. In order to prove this formula, the PI and Shareshian introduced an intriguing class of symmetric functions called cycle-type Eulerian quasisymmetric functions, which refine symmetric functions that have occurred in various representation theoretic and enumerative contexts such as in Askey and Ismail's refinement of MacMahon's enumerator of multiset derangements, in work of Procesi and Stanley on toric varieties of Coxeter complexes, and in Stanley's work on symmetric chromatic polynomials. There are many interesting properties that the cycle type q-Eulerian polynomials and the cycle-type Eulerian quasisymmetric functions seem to possess, but have yet to be proved. The second part of the project includes a continuation of the research in poset topology that led to the work on the joint distribution of major index and excedance number.  A poset operation, called Rees product introduced by Bjorner and Welker as a combinatorial analog of the Rees construction in commutative algebra, is central to this work, as is the notion of q-analog of a poset.   While the work of the PI and Shareshian represents a novel development in permutation enumeration, what makes it even more interesting is that it has arisen from, and has found intimate connections to work outside of permutation enumeration i.e., topological combinatorics, commutative algebra, toric varieties in algebraic geometry. It is an intriguing problem to understand at a deeper level the basis for all these connections. These deeper underpinnings may help to explain the ongoing discovery of new results on the joint distribution of major index and excedance number.<br/><br/>The research supported by this grant is in algebraic combinatorics, which is an area of mathematics that seeks to develop connections between combinatorics (the science of counting, arranging and analyzing concrete discrete configurations) and fields of pure mathematics that involve sophisticated abstract algebraic structures. The idea is to use these connections to gain deeper insights and solve problems in combinatorics and in the other fields.    The discrete configurations that are studied in combinatorics arise in various fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, biology and engineering; DNA sequences, phylogenetic trees, and communications networks are all examples of discrete configurations. Combinatorial methods are playing an increasing role in these fields."

The aim of the project is to study the Hitchin connection, and to have techniques from conformal field theory  bear upon open problems in invariant theory such as the saturation conjecture for the even orthogonal groups. A study of the Hitchin connection will be carried out with potential applications to strange duality questions (that is, relations between non-abelian theta functions for different groups) in their most general formulation.

The project aims to deepen the links between theta functions and representation theory. It is hoped that the project will lead to better algorithms in various combinatorial questions.

The first of these concerns branched polymers; the second, hard-core gases; the third, coordinate percolation.   Branched polymers are connected configurations of spheres in space; their partition functions can be computed combinatorially in dimensions 2 and 3.  Hard-core gases are random sets of non-overlapping spheres in space; here the PI has some ideas for discrete versions which may help in proving the existence of a solid-state phase.  Finally, combinatorial techniques applied to coordinate percolation, in which the life of a site depends on events associated with the lines that cross there, has already yielded an exact expression for percolation probability.<br/><br/>The three models are connected to applications in biochemistry, physics and computer science.  Complex tree-like forms of proteins, hemoglobins, and molecules involved in photosynthesis can be compared with random mathematical ``branched polymers'' to help discern the presence of unsuspected forces or constraints.  Formation of crystal structures should, in theory, resemble what happens to collections of hard spheres when they are compressed on the plane or in space---but this simple mathematical model is not yet fully understood.  Finally, scheduling processes (such as computer programs) to avoid conflict is modeled by avoiding collisions in random walks, one of several applications of coordinate percolation.  The PI's approach is to use combinatorial methods---rougly speaking, sophisticated means of counting and manipulating discrete objects---to better understand all three models.<br/>"

She is interested in the graded-module category viewed as a geometric space, with certain graded modules playing the role of geometric objects. The linear geometric modules (point modules, line modules, etc) are parametrized by so-called linear schemes. Vancliff plans to study how the structure and role of higher-dimensional linear schemes generalize the structure and role of point schemes. Under prior NSF support, in work with T. Cassidy, Vancliff produced algebro-geometric techniques that allow the easy construction of certain regular algebras (that generalize graded Clifford algebras) of any finite global dimension; naming such algebras graded skew Clifford algebras. Vancliff intends to study such regular algebras of global dimension four that have finitely many points and a one-parameter family of line modules as a step towards classifying the line schemes that arise for ``generic''  quadratic regular algebras of global dimension four. Her initial research with B. Shelton (under prior NSF support) suggests that such an algebra should have a line scheme that consists of exactly six elliptic curves, so if this is found to hold in general, then it would mimic the point scheme of generic quadratic regular algebras of global dimension three (where it is one elliptic curve).<br/><br/>Systems of polynomial-style equations and their solutions play a critical role in almost every scientific field, such as statistical mechanics, elementary particle physics, quantum mechanics, robotics, crystallography, networking, etc. Often, the solutions cannot be found by experimentation, and often they are not numbers but are functions (e.g., differential operators or matrices), and so, in general, they do not commute. The science of seeking methods that find all solutions to any system of polynomial-style equations in non-commuting variables is called non-commutative algebra. To find the solutions, the main idea is as follows. One associates to such a system of equations an entity, called an ``algebra'', that encodes all the properties of the original equations. Associated to this algebra are ``modules'', and these encode all the properties of the solutions to the equations.  So, in order to find all the solutions, one should find all the modules for the associated algebra.  In many of the applications, the algebras that arise in this way tend to share certain properties satisfied by the polynomial ring; such algebras are called regular algebras and are the main focus of Vancliff's projects. One of the goals of non-commutative algebraic geometry, the subfield in which Vancliff works, is to use geometric techniques to find certain modules (point modules, line modules, etc) of the regular algebra, and then to use those modules to find the modules giving the solutions to the original system of equations. Vancliff's underlying goal is to improve on these geometric techniques and to understand better how they relate to the structure of the category of modules.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The team will run a collaborative undergraduate research laboratory in which undergraduates work together with graduate students in the focus areas with the goal of producing publishable research and easing the transition to graduate school.  For US undergraduates outside our program who are admitted to UW for Ph.D. study, we will offer a Summer Enhancement Program, in order to prepare the students for qualifiying exams as quickly as possible so that their research can begin without delay.

In addition, we will run annual graduate student conferences, focusing on number theory and algebraic geometry in alternate years, where students from UW and other schools will get up to speed with currrent developments in all aspects of this rapidly changing subject in a collaborative environment, and gain professional skills in lecturing and presentation.  Taken together, these programs will enable us to enhance our already strong record of producing very strong Ph.D. graduates in number theory and algebraic geometry.

But with the revolutionary work of Alexander Grothendieck and his collaborators in the 1960s, a magnficent unity between these two seemingly unrelated subjects was exposed.  This new paradigm has become so central to modern mathematics that the boundary between number theory and algebraic geometry has been almost entirely erased.  The University of Wisconsin is a center of cutting-edge research in this new hybrid subject.  The RTG will allow us to leverage our research strength to create a completely integrated training program for new researchers in the area, starting at the undergraduate level and continuing all the way up to young Ph.D.s in the pre-tenure phase of their career"

The second question is trivial in semi-simple case; however, since finite-dimensional representations of a simple algebraic supergroup are not completely reducible, both questions turns out to be very difficult: naive constructions give representations which are not irreducible, and irreducibles allow nontrivial extensions.  (The situation is similar to one for modular representations.) In the last 25 years works of many mathematicians brought a lot of progress. Now, the characters of irreducible representations are known for general linear and orthosymplectic supergroups. The proposal suggests to adopt the geometric ideas of localization and support variety for supergroups to address the question of extensions. In particular, the proposal constructs a graph which conjecturally encodes a lot of information about extensions and characters. This graph appears naturally in calculation of cohomology groups of invertible sheaves on flag supervarieties and in attempt to generalize a Borel--Weil--Bott theory for supervarieties.  A complementary geometric approach is via a functor associating to each module over a Lie superalgebra a quasicoherent sheaf on the cone of selfcommuting odd elements.  The support of this sheaf has two counterparts in other branches of representation theory: the associated varieties of Harish-Chandra modules and the rank varieties in modular case.  The conjecture is that the complexity of a simple module grows with the dimension of the support of the corresponding sheaf, in particular, one can prove the Kac-Wakimoto conjecture on superdimension this way. The proposal also suggests first steps for ""odd"" geometric quantization of the self-commuting cone.  Recently, supersymmetric spaces became very popular in relation to sigma models; several physical papers develop particular examples of harmonic analysis on such spaces.  The proposal contains a conjecture about the structure of modules of regular functions on supersymmetric spaces. The final part of the proposal concerns infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebras; character formulae for affine superalgebras were conjectured by Kac and Wakimoto.  The aim here is to single out the cases when the conjectures hold, and to prove them in these cases.<br/><br/>In modern particle physics, the principle of supersymmetry plays a very important role already for decades.  A relatively new development is that, during the last decade, physicists realized that using supergroup symmetries makes feasible solutions of certain problems in the theory of condensed matter as well, e.g., in (super)conductivity. The methods of supersymmetry factor the questions interesting for physicists through the theory of representations of supergroups and superalgebras. The proposal puts forward several geometric methods, which, when developed, would answer a lot of currently  pending concrete questions needed by physicists."

The conjectures offer an explanation for why the representation theories of real and p-adic, and even of adelic, groups are so similar. The price of this uniformity is that, often, one may no longer speak of individual representations, but rather of finite collections of them (called L-packets). These are expected to encode both number-theoretic (via Galois groups) and algebro-geometric (via many avenues---for example, the theory of stable distributions) information. For some families of representations, the investigators already have clear expectations for what the L-packets should be, but they cannot yet prove that their expectations are correct. For other families, there is not even a reasonable conjecture for what the answer should be. The theory of real groups suggests yet another rewarding perspective, from the point of view of symmetric spaces. For p-adic groups, the serious study of harmonic analysis on such spaces is just beginning to be developed, in large part by the investigators, and the analogues in this setting of the local Langlands conjectures are far from clear. The part of the local Langlands conjectures dealing with functoriality also suggests that the investigators should be able to transfer representation-theoretic information between different matrix groups. A classical realization of this is the theory of lifting, where representations of matrix groups over a large field are related to those of the same group, but with coefficients taken in a smaller field. Most progress in this area has been via somewhat ad hoc methods, but the answers have invariably turned out to be related to natural constructions arising in the symmetric-space setting.<br/><br/><br/>Representation theory, broadly understood, has its origins in two classical problems. The first, investigated by Fourier in the 19th century, was an attempt to understand complicated physical processes, such as heat diffusion, by representing them as combinations of simpler processes. The second, initially studied by Frobenius, Schur, and others, was an attempt to understand the structure of a finite collection of symmetries via an associated polynomial known as its group determinant. The surprising fact that the solutions to these two problems are related has turned out to be just the earliest instance of a family of deep and far-reaching connections that have been formalized in a collection of conjectures known collectively as the (local) Langlands conjectures. The depth and broad reach of these conjectures---for example, they encompass a large part of the celebrated recent proof of the centuries-old Fermat's Last Theorem---has meant that progress has so far been relatively slow. This project brings together a group of mathematicians from a broad variety of related backgrounds, whose combined expertise can be expected to allow significant progress both on these conjectures and on related results in representation theory and harmonic analysis."

This will establish a basic tool for studying the representation theory for vertex operator algebras and lead to solving well known conjectures in orbifold conformal field theory.(2) Modular invariance: The PI expects to prove that twisted trace functions or partition functions are modular functions over congruence subgroups of the modular group for a rational vertex operator algebra. In particular, the graded dimension of any irreducible twisted module or twisted sector is a modular function.  It is also expected to obtain that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the graded dimensions of the irreducible modules is invariant under the full modular group. This will have immediate applications in classification of vertex operator algebras. (3) Classification of rational vertex operator algebras with small central charges: Rational vertex operator algebras which play the fundamental roles in rational conformal field theory form the most important class of vertex operator algebras. The PI will classify the rational vertex operator algebras with the central charge less than or equal to 1. This can be regarded as the first step in classification of rational vertex operator algebras.<br/><br/>Vertex operator algebra theory is a new area of mathematics. It provides an algebraic foundation for the 2 dimensional quantum conformal field theory in physics and is also deeply related to many important areas of mathematics such as representation theory, group theory, modular forms, topology invariants, and C*-algebras.

Root numbers are important fundamental invariants that arise in connection with several influential conjectures of number theory and representation theory, such as Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer and parity conjectures, conjectural functional equations for L-functions, and Langlands program. In studying root numbers attached to abelian varieties over extensions of the base field arise the so-called twists of the root numbers by Galois representations, or twisted root numbers for short. Twisted root numbers attached to elliptic curves have been studied extensively. The main objective of this proposal is to extend the results obtained in that direction to abelian varieties. The methods to be employed come from the combination of representation theory with the theory of Serre and Tate of abelian varieties with potential good reduction and the uniformization theory of abelian varieties. Another part of the project is devoted to studying questions arising naturally in the context of the stratification theory of reductive groups over the field of formal Laurent series with complex coefficients. This theory developed by Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson is important in connection with the affine Springer fibers studied by Kazhdan, Luzstig, Bezrukavnikov, Spaltenstein and others.<br/><br/>The theory of L-functions is a generalization of the classical theory of the well-known Riemann and Dedekind zeta-functions that originated in works by Hecke and Hasse at the first half of the last century. As zeta-functions have been used to study the distribution of prime numbers, L-functions were introduced to study the distribution of prime ideals in number fields, i.e., finite extensions of the field of rational numbers. One of the main themes in arithmetic algebraic geometry is to study L-functions attached to algebraic varieties, in particular to abelian varieties, which are higher-dimensional analogues of elliptic curves. Inseparable from the theory of L-functions is the notion of a root number--the sign in the conjectural functional equations for L-functions. The importance of studying root numbers lies in the fact that according to several famous conjectures in number theory they are believed to have deep connections to the arithmetic of the subject in question; for example, they may predict the existence of rational solutions to systems of algebraic equations or, in other words, the existence of rational points. Studying rational points on algebraic varieties in turn has its applications to cryptography: some public key cryptosystems are based on rational points of elliptic curves. One of the goals of this project is to study root numbers attached to abelian varieties."

Four areas  will receive special emphasis: triangulations of compact manifolds and closely related spaces, Cohen-Macaulay complexes,  finite linear quotients of spheres, and matroids.   In the last century a tremendous amount of research has been directed toward unlocking the topology and geometry of manifolds.  However, questions of a combinatorial character have remained largely unanswered. What is the minimum number of  facets  required to triangulate a given manifold?  What methods are there to construct manifolds with particular combinatorial properties?  Given limits on the combinatorics of a triangulation, what does that imply about the possible geometries on the manifold?   Similar questions, where even less is known, apply to spaces with singularities which include algebraic varieties, quotients of group actions, or limits of Riemannian manifolds.  Cohen-Macaulay complexes and posets are one of the fundamental structures of algebraic combinatorics with applications ranging from partitions to network reliability.  Their enumerative properties were worked out in the 1970's by the ground breaking work of Hochster, Reisner and Stanley.  What happens if further constraints are put on these spaces?  As previously shown by the PI, complexes with more structure, such as finite buildings, geometric lattices and matroid complexes, have strong restrictions on their f-vectors.  How common are these additional structures and constraints?   Finite linear quotients of spheres lie at the intersection of representation theory, topology, geometry and combinatorics.   How are the topology and geometry of the quotient space related to the combinatorics and algebra of the representation theoretic data?  <br/><br/>How does one study  complicated spaces and structures?  One approach is to approximate them with simpler objects.  For instance, an n-dimensional space might be represented as a collection of n-simplices - the higher dimensional analogues of triangles and tetrahedrons.  How complicated are these representations? How many of the smaller pieces are needed?   How is this reflected in the  shape and geometry of the original object?  Are there computationally practical ways of producing these models?  These are types of questions addressed in this research.<br/><br/>"

SERMON is a two-day combinatorics and number theory meeting held annually each spring semester at rotating institutions; it is attended by faculty and students from various colleges and universities in the southeast. SERMON originates from UNCG where the first conference was held in 1988. Since then it has taken place every year at various universities in the southeast including University of Georgia, University of South Carolina, Citadel, College of Charleston, Wake Forest, Virginia Tech, Furman, and Clemson University. This yearly conference features 20 minute talks by students and faculty as well as one hour talks by one or more noted mathematicians. This year, SERMON will host Professor Paul Gunnells from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and Professor David Ford from Concordia University, Montreal.<br/><br/>One goal is to encourage collaborative efforts among number theorists and combinatorialists in the southeast by providing a friendly, informal setting where they can come together and hear about recent research in number theory and combinatorics.  In addition to plenary and contributed talks, there will be a session devoted to discussion of open problems in the area. It is also an opportunity for graduate students in the region to meet, interact, and speak about their work with senior researchers. SERMON has a unique familiar atmosphere. The social gathering in the evening traditionally takes place at the home of one of the faculty members. These activities help strengthen bonds between graduate students and senior researchers to facilitate future joint projects.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Together with F. Morel, he will investigate the problem of classifying such varieties using recently introduced techniques inspired by the celebrated Browder-Novikov-Sullivan-Wall classification of manifolds.  Together with B. Doran, he will continue to investigate invariant theory for unipotent group actions, its relationship to construction of A^1-contractible varieties, and the problem of characterizing affine space as an algebraic variety.  By their very nature, these problems draw together several branches of mathematics and thus illustrate the fundamental unity of the subject.  <br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, one of the oldest branches of mathematics, is at its core concerned with the study of algebraic varieties, i.e., solutions to systems of polynomial equations in many variables.  Algebraic topology studies the problem of attaching invariants, e.g., numbers or, more generally, so-called abstract algebraic structures to spaces; the most important property of such invariants is that they do not change as the underlying geometric object is pulled and twisted, so long as it is not torn in the process.  A fundamental problem in algebraic geometry is classification of algebraic varieties, i.e., explicit determination and taxonomy of the possible configurations of solutions.  When solutions to systems of equations have topological structure (think of the equation defining a sphere), one can try to distinguish them by means of invariants.  However, solutions to systems of polynomial equations arising in arithmetic do not always have obvious topological structure (think of the integer solutions to the equation defining a unit sphere).  Nevertheless, the relatively recently introduced subject of A^1-homotopy theory provides a framework in which one may apply the full power of techniques of algebraic topology to algebraic varieties--spaces having deep arithmetic (but a priori limited geometric) structure are, from the standpoint of invariants, put on equal footing with those that are more inherently geometric.  The aim of this project is to further amalgamate ideas of arithmetic, topology, and algebraic geometry by transplanting the fantastically successful method of classifying topological spaces via surgery, a cutting and pasting procedure very carefully controlled by appropriate invariants, into algebraic geometry by means of A^1-homotopy theory."

The recent breakthrough in producing a Heterotic Standard Model is a perfect illustration of the power of algebraic geometry at the service of physics. Using techniques for construction of non simply connected Calabi-Yau threefolds and of bundles on them satisfying various constraints on their chern classes and cohomology, the PI produced the only known example of a heterotic string compactification which has exactly the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) spectrum of particles and forces, with no unwanted exotic matter. A systematic study is proposed of the High Country region of the string Landscape, where the Heterotic Standard Models live. This includes investigation of all known non simply connected Calabi-Yau threefolds, incorporating a classification of all Standard Model bundles on them and analysis of their mathematical and phenomenological properties. The apparent great scarcity of these Heterotic Standard Models motivates attempts to determine the rough size of the string High Country. The recent phenomenological breakthroughs based on F-theory underlie the urgency of constructing global, geometric models realizing the various known local models. The construction, at all genera, of the superstring measure is an important foundational issue in string theory. Recent proposals have converted this to a question in classical algebraic geometry, closely related to modular forms, the Schottky problem, and theta identities. The existing proposals do not quite work. Fortunately, it seems likely that the addition of some algebro-geometric ingredients may overcome the obstruction.<br/><br/>The Geometric Langlands Conjecture is an old and central open problem in algebraic geometry and representation theory. In recent years it has also been of great interest to physicists, who have embedded it into the context of quantum field theory.

Previous work on this problem used the notion of a ?vanishing cycle?  - a subset of the given space which shrinks to a point in the degeneration.

Finding necessary and sufficient conditions for two ideals to belong to the same linkage class is the central, though wide open, problem in the theory. The investigator suggests an answer to this question for zero-dimensional monomial ideals. The local-algebraic and the projective-geometric branch of linkage theory have proceeded in parallel, with only few implications known between them. The proposer plans to investigate this subtle interplay by studying the differences between local linkage and homogeneous linkage. Since the equivalence relation generated by classical linkage might be too restrictive for some purposes, the more inclusive notion of Gorenstein linkage has become a welcome alternative. The investigator has the broader goal of showing that in a given regular local ring all Cohen-Macaulay ideals of a fixed codimension belong to the same Gorenstein linkage class. The proposer plans to exploit recent advances on the topic of j-multiplicities to address some long standing problems in equisingularity theory. Equisingularity theory strives to find numerical conditions for when the members of a family of analytic sets are `equivalent' to one another. The investigator seeks to provide such a criterion by proving a general `principle of specialization of integral dependence' based on j-multiplicities. The investigator also proposes an intersection theoretic expression for the j-multiplicity of a module that would yield a recursive formula for computing this multiplicity. The core of an ideal is a subideal that encodes information about all possible reductions of the ideal, while being closely related to Briancon-Skoda type theorems and a conjecture of Kawamata about sections of line bundles. The investigator wishes to explore the connection between cores and multiplier ideals, a notion from complex algebraic geometry. He expects that a better understanding of this interplay will shed new light on both concepts and may lead to a combinatorial description of the core in the monomial case. Having worked out an algorithm for computing the core of zero-dimensional monomial ideals, the investigator now wishes to find such an algorithm for monomial ideals of arbitrary dimension. The known results about cores of ideals require restrictions on the local numbers of generators of the ideal as well as residual or depth conditions, assumptions that are satisfied by any zero-dimensional ideal. The investigator proposes to advance the theory beyond the class of ideals satisfying these conditions, using the monomial case as a testing ground.<br/><br/>The proposer works in Commutative Algebra, an area concerned with the qualitative study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Such systems arise in algebraic geometry, but also in numerous applications outside of mathematics. Over the past two decades commutative algebraists have become increasingly interested in computational aspects, thereby establishing connections to applied areas such as computer algebra, robotics, cryptography, coding theory, statistics, and biology. This investigator's research too has a strong computational component, and his work on equisingularity theory in particular encompasses concrete geometric applications.<br/><br/>"

This project focuses on iterative decoding algorithms for codes defined by parity check matrices, especially low-density parity check codes which are defined by sparse matrices.  While such codes paired with iterative message-passing algorithms for decoding may achieve near-capacity performance, these observations are based primarily on simulations and randomization.  An algebraic understanding of this performance would circumvent the need for randomization, a process which invites the possibility of poor error-correcting capability and impedes the encoding process.  This project aims to explain and then exploit the performance capabilities of codes based on sparse matrices.  In particular, the investigator aims to identify algebraic structures that lead to decoding failure and characterize those most likely to do so.  Desirable outgrowths of this line of inquiry are how to best represent a linear code and how to select a parity check matrix for a given code and decoding algorithm.  Even though the (current) practical implementation of parity check codes is reasonable only for those codes defined by sparse matrices, the theoretical study applies to any linear code and may provide insight beyond low-density parity check codes.<br/><br/>Error-correcting codes ensure reliable transfer and storage of information.  With a wide range of application, from PC's and data storage media to wireless communication and deep-space telecommunication to high-definition television and smart phones, efficient error-correcting codes with reliable error-correcting capability are increasingly important in daily life.  Codes defined using sparse matrices, known as low-density parity check codes, are appealing to such applications due to low-complexity decoding algorithms.  Moreover, codes based on randomly-generated sparse matrices tend to perform well in simulations.  However, this remarkable performance lacks theoretical underpinning and, hence, is not guaranteed in general.  In this proposal, the investigator examines parity check codes paired with iterative decoding algorithms from an algebraic standpoint with the specific goal of characterizing decoder failure.<br/>"

A main goal is to prove that various stratified spaces whose closure posets are thin and shellable are in fact regular CW complexes.  She also aims to construct boundary maps on important classes of posets such as geometric lattices, motivated by potential applications e.g. in theoretical computer science.  She will also study representations of simple Lie algebras via an analysis of local structure within the poset that indicates which weight space generators appear with nonzero coefficient upon application of a raising or lowering operator to other weight space generators.<br/><br/>In computer science, there is a strong interest both in finding effective algorithms when this is possible, and also in understanding when this is not theoretically possible.  It is often difficult to know how to even begin to obtain these impossibility results, but topology combined with combinatorics does have the potential to yield such results, and there have been some striking successes in the past.  One of the proposed projects is somewhat in this vein -- to prove impossibility results for the question of which graphs (i.e. which models for networks of computers) admit data sorting algorithms by greedily swapping pieces of neighboring data that are out of order.  In another direction, geometric structures such as the Schubert varieties of representation theory/algebraic geometry often have combinatorial data associated to them which is organized into what is called a partially ordered set.  Much is known about how properties of the geometric structure force properties on the partially ordered set.  The PI seeks a better understanding of how much can be said in the other direction, perhaps allowing some manageable extra data such as information about how edges are attached to 2-dimensional faces, how 2-dimensional faces are attached to 3-dimensional faces, and so on.

Now Mathematics has become increasingly important to business, finance, biology, and social studies too. Basic research in mathematics, which is usually `pure' mathematics (without application), has increasingly found unexpected and deep application in unexpected areas. For example, the number theory I studies used to call the queen of<br/>Mathematics, meaning that it is very beautiful and very attractive but useless in practice. But now it is extremely important in coding theory and cryptosystem, both are essential<br/>to our electric communication and electronic business transaction as well as our national security. Arithmetic and algebraic geometry which is also in part of my proposed research has now applications in engineering such as face recognition and economics. My proposed research contributes to basic and deep understanding of some arithmetic and geometric subjects in number theory and arithmetic geometry, and will in turn contribute to our society's well-being.

The conjectures offer an explanation for why the representation theories of real and p-adic, and even of adelic, groups are so similar. The price of this uniformity is that, often, one may no longer speak of individual representations, but rather of finite collections of them (called L-packets). These are expected to encode both number-theoretic (via Galois groups) and algebro-geometric (via many avenues---for example, the theory of stable distributions) information. For some families of representations, the investigators already have clear expectations for what the L-packets should be, but they cannot yet prove that their expectations are correct. For other families, there is not even a reasonable conjecture for what the answer should be. The theory of real groups suggests yet another rewarding perspective, from the point of view of symmetric spaces. For p-adic groups, the serious study of harmonic analysis on such spaces is just beginning to be developed, in large part by the investigators, and the analogues in this setting of the local Langlands conjectures are far from clear. The part of the local Langlands conjectures dealing with functoriality also suggests that the investigators should be able to transfer representation-theoretic information between different matrix groups. A classical realization of this is the theory of lifting, where representations of matrix groups over a large field are related to those of the same group, but with coefficients taken in a smaller field. Most progress in this area has been via somewhat ad hoc methods, but the answers have invariably turned out to be related to natural constructions arising in the symmetric-space setting.<br/><br/><br/>Representation theory, broadly understood, has its origins in two classical problems. The first, investigated by Fourier in the 19th century, was an attempt to understand complicated physical processes, such as heat diffusion, by representing them as combinations of simpler processes. The second, initially studied by Frobenius, Schur, and others, was an attempt to understand the structure of a finite collection of symmetries via an associated polynomial known as its group determinant. The surprising fact that the solutions to these two problems are related has turned out to be just the earliest instance of a family of deep and far-reaching connections that have been formalized in a collection of conjectures known collectively as the (local) Langlands conjectures. The depth and broad reach of these conjectures---for example, they encompass a large part of the celebrated recent proof of the centuries-old Fermat's Last Theorem---has meant that progress has so far been relatively slow. This project brings together a group of mathematicians from a broad variety of related backgrounds, whose combined expertise can be expected to allow significant progress both on these conjectures and on related results in representation theory and harmonic analysis."

If the ring and the module are graded then there exists a minimal free resolution; it is unique up to an isomorphism and is contained in any free resolution. The minimal free resolution is graded, and its properties are closely related to the invariants of the module. From another point of view: in essence constructing a free resolution consists of repeatedly solving systems of linear equations.

WAGS is a weekend conference held twice a year at various institutions in the western part of the United States and Canada, including the University of Utah, Stanford University, the University of British Columbia, the University of California at Berkeley, Colorado State University, the University of Washington and now the University of Colorado and the University of Arizona.  The seminar traces its roots back to the Utah-UCLA Algebraic Geometry Seminar started in 1989 by H. Clemens, D. Gieseker, M. Green, J. Kollar, and R. Lazarsfeld.  In its current form WAGS has run since 2002, and every WAGS has had over 50 participants. For the UCLA-WAGS, currently there have been<br/>55 registered graduate students, and there are about 30 faculty participants.<br/>WAGS has been instrumental in building a vibrant algebraic geometry community in the western part of US.  It provides an important way for researchers to connect to one another in the broader geographical area.  This is especially important in the west since many algebraic geometers there are the only members of their department in the &#64257;eld, and the geographical distance between the research institutions in the western United States means they can be relatively isolated.  A crucial feature of WAGS is that it provides an opportunity for them to come together and hear a semesters worth of seminars, and equally importantly, meet at length with each other and with younger researchers.  Graduate students get the opportunity to meet senior faculty, and to  get a broader sense of the &#64257;eld than they would get from speaking only with their advisor.  The success of WAGS is underscored by the fact that many people around the world currently leading the &#64257;eld of algebraic geometry have come up through the WAGS system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The speakers this fall will discuss their research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry concerns the solution sets of algebraic equations, and has long been a central subject in mathematics with deep and substantial connections to almost every aspect of modern mathematics.  Beyond the natural interactions with ?neighboring? mathematical &#64257;elds such as number theory, symplectic geometry, topology, and commutative algebra, exciting connections have recently emerged between algebraic geometry and apparently ?foreign? fields including mathematical physics, biology, digital communications, and robotics. There are numerous di&#64256;erent approaches to the study of algebraic geometry, utilizing a wide variety of technical tools; commutative algebra, complex analysis, sheaf theory, cohomological methods, and combinatorial techniques all play important roles. Algebraic geometry continues to be a very active area of research. The recent year has been particularly exciting, as signi&#64257;cant progress was made on ?classical? problems with roots going back to the 19th century (such as the minimal model program), as well as on the development of new tools and techniques (for example the extension of Givental?s formalism to the world of stacks).  This broad and active &#64257;eld is widely represented in the Western United States.  The speakers at WAGS this fall represent a broad spectrum of research in the field and a good mix of established figures and young active researchers. The organizers expect that the conference at UCLA will continue to facilitate the development of the algebraic geometry community in the Western United States.<br/><br/>"

The main focus of this proposal is the study of singularities. To a singularity (defined by the vanishing of a set of polynomials) one may attach several invariants; these may be of discrete type (such as the number of branches of a curve meeting in a point) or of continuous nature (such as the space of all vector fields tangent to the singularity). If one considers a family of singularities, such invariants behave in interesting ways: on one side, at special members of the family they ""jump"" (i.e., get larger in some sense), while on the other side, near typical members of the family, they deform according to so-called ""hypergeometric""<br/>differential equations. One component of this project investigates, using homological and combinatorial methods, jumps and solutions of the hypergeometric differential equations. The other part of the proposal is concerned with the study of specific invariants of singularities derived through either calculus (the Gauss--Manin connection and Bernstein--Sato polynomial), counting techniques (the Igusa zeta function), or deformations (cohomology of the Milnor fiber), and their interplay.<br/><br/>This research falls into the broad category of algebraic geometry, one of the most variegated areas of today's mathematics. Fundamentally, algebraic geometry is the study of geometric objects described by algebraic data through artful manipulation of the input data using an incredibly wide array of mathematical tools. Because of its diversity, algebraic geometry permeates such different branches of science as robotics, cosmology, and computer encryption. The origins of algebraic geometry can be traced to the works of Euclid and Pythagoras. In its modern form, the focus of algebraic geometry is on singularities. These include cusps, foldings, and self-intersections, and are generally comprised of points that are unusual when compared to their neighbors.<br/>"

In particular, the use of the derivative of a holomorphic function in Nevanlinna theory stands out as something with no known counterpart in number theory.  The recent ""tautological inequality"" of M. McQuillan, however, is of a form that can be translated into number theory, leading to a conjecture that the present project will investigate.  The project includes work on trying to prove this conjecture, starting with special cases stemming from the Subspace Theorem of W. M. Schmidt, and from Faltings' work on closed subvarieties of abelian varieties.  In addition, it will further study the extent to which McQuillan's inequality can serve as a gateway to the main theorems of Nevanlinna theory.  As a separate but related project, the Principal Investigator will also continue work on completed invariant jet spaces in the arithmetical context.<br/><br/><br/>The Thue-Siegel-Roth method in number theory is a method for showing that certain types of diophantine equations have only finitely many solutions, or at least showing that their families of solutions obey additional equations.  It made its debut 100 years ago this year, but it has been gaining momentum in the last 20 years, due in part to similarities with Nevanlinna theory.  The latter is a part of complex analysis, encompassing methods for showing that meromorphic functions having certain properties do not exist, or more generally that in certain cases a non-constant holomorphic function from the complex plane to a complex algebraic manifold must satisfy additional equations.<br/>The similarities between these two fields have benefited both areas of mathematics, allowing ideas, conjectures, and methods to be carried over from one area to the other, in both directions.  However, the fundamental reasons for these similarities are not at all understood at the present time.  In particular, the derivative -- specifically the ""lemma on the logarithmic derivative"" -- plays a central role in Nevanlinna theory, but has no known counterpart in number theory.  Based on a recent inequality of McQuillan in Nevanlinna theory, however, the proposer has a conjectural counterpart for this lemma in number theory.  This grant will support work on this conjecture and its possible ramifications.<br/>"

The main goal of the research is the classification of defective secant varieties of Segre varieties, Grassmann varieties and Segre-Veronese varieties. This is analogous to the celebrated theorem of Alexander and Hirschowitz, which asserts that higher secant varieties of Veronese varieties have the expected dimension (modulo a fully described list of exceptions). This work completed the Waring problem for polynomials which had stood for some time as an outstanding unsolved problem. There is a corresponding, conjectural complete list of defective secant varieties for Segre varieties and for Grassmann varieties. The first component of the project is on the refinement of existing methods and the development of new theoretical and algorithmic methods towards the solution of this classification problem. The second component of the project is concerned with decomposition of tensors.<br/><br/>In many applications, it is natural to represent a collection of data as a multi-indexed list. Alternatively, one can think of the data as a multidimensional array (sometimes called a multi-way array). For example, a digital grayscale picture can be stored as a matrix of numbers where each pixel location in the picture corresponds to a location in the matrix and the number in the matrix corresponds to the darkness of the pixel. In a similar manner, a digital color picture can be stored as a three dimensional array of numbers. A mathematical framework that includes the study of multi-way arrays, and their representations as sums of more basic objects, is through parameter spaces of tensors. This project explores problems related to tensors, tensor decomposition, tensor rank and tensor border rank from an algebro-geometric point viewpoint. These subjects have significant applications in fields as diverse as signal processing, data analysis, computational biology, combinatorics, algebraic geometry and statistics. It is the expectation, therefore, that techniques developed through this research will advance our knowledge and understanding across multiple disciplines."

These questions are intertwined in intricate and beautiful ways:  Intersection-theoretic constructions govern curve classes on both the moduli space of stable curves and holomorphic-symplectic varieties.  The Torelli Theorem for K3 surfaces is the starting point for their moduli theory;  the lack of such a result for higher dimensional holomorphic-symplectic manifolds is a major impetus for analyzing their ample cones.

Here the type of the variety is expressed in algebraic terms.  Alternately, one can study all the varieties sharing common geometric characteristics, e.g., those with given numerical invariants.  This project addresses the interplay between the algebraic and geometric quantities, and how these govern the behavior of families of varieties.<br/>"

For example, the Jones polynomial is one such invariant. In the case of the general linear group and the standard representation the PI and Joel Kamnitzer categorify these invariants, meaning that to each knot they assign a (bi-graded) homology group whose Euler characteristic is the original invariant. This is analogous to the way (singular) homology of topological spaces ""categorifies"" the Euler characteristic. Their construction involves studying the (derived) category of coherent sheaves on certain flag-like varieties. All this parallels the earlier pioneering work of Khovanov and Rozansky who discovered such categorifications using algebraic and combinatorial constructions. Using the algebraic geometric approach the investigator and his colleagues have a conjecture for how to categorify some of the remaining Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. Checking, for instance, invariance under Reidemeister move 2 involves proving that certain integral transforms between (derived) categories are equivalences.<br/>The existence of such equivalences, which include Seidel-Thomas spherical twists, is a lively area of research which is interesting in itself.<br/><br/>The simplest example of a knot is obtained by taking a tangled-up shoe lace and glueing the ends together. A fundamental question in low-dimensional topology is to determine when two such knots are different (you are allowed to move the knots around without cutting them). One way to do this is to assign a number (an invariant) to each knot so that if two knots are assigned different numbers then they must be different. How to assign such numbers is a deep problem which is related to various areas of mathematics in surprising ways. For example, the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are obtained from representation theory (which is the study of matrices). There are also constructions of such invariants using algebra and others that are inspired by physics and string theory. The proposed research suggests yet another approach using algebraic geometry (which is the study of systems of polynomial equations).

Besides its increasing importance within mathematics to geometry, topology, combinatorics, and algebra, it has important applications outside of mathematics in areas such as physics, chemistry and computer science. Over the last 30 years, the universities in the southeastern region of USA have hired a steady stream of mathematicians working on different aspects of Lie theory and its applications. This project focuses on using the current infrastructure to build a sense of regional unity and foster cohesive research collaborations in the region. Annual regional workshops (for 3-4 days) in Lie theory will be held. These workshops will bring together senior and junior researchers (including graduate students), and create an academic environment which will encourage the exchange of ideas along with the awareness of research opportunities.<br/><br/>This project will also setup a regional network of researchers in Lie Theory to improve communication and collaboration. This network will significantly strengthen the recruitment and retention of graduate students in mathematics, the placement of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who have been trained in the southeast, the visibility of area mathematics departments at both the national and international levels, and the quality of graduate education and research in mathematics. Funding from this grant will support the first three annual workshops in Lie theory. These will be held at the North Carolina State University (2009), the University of Georgia (2010), and the University of Virginia (2011)."

The PI will investigate alternate compactifications, with the long-term goal of constructing a modular interpretation for the canonical model of the moduli space. The first objective is to give a systematic classification of all classes of singular curves which are deformation-open and satisfy the unique limit property - any such class gives rise to a modular compactification. The second objective is to study these alternate compactifications from the perspective of the minimal model program, factoring the birational maps between them into divisorial contractions and flips, and studying the numerical properties of the canonical class at every intermediate stage.<br/><br/><br/>Quite generally, the theory of moduli is concerned with the underlying numerical parameters of a given class of geometric objects. For example, a circle is determined by a single modulus (its radius), while a triangle has three moduli (its three side lengths). Furthermore, the moduli associated to a geometric object typically satisfy fundamental constraints. For example, the fact that the sum of any two side-lengths of a triangle must be less than the third constrains the possible moduli parameters of a triangle. For modern geometry and physics, Riemann surfaces comprise one of the most important classes of geometric objects - their moduli are complex numbers and the relations constraining these moduli remain deeply mysterious. By viewing the moduli parameters of a Riemann surface as solutions to a system of polynomial equations, the PI will investigate these relations through the techniques of higher-dimensional algebraic geometry."

Together with co-workers, the PI will also develop a theory of total positivity for loop groups, and for their flag varieties.  The theory being developed generalizes the classical Edrei-Thoma classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group.  Furthermore, new combinatorics for Coxeter groups occurs, including a weak order for the limiting elements of a Coxeter group.  In another direction, the PI with collaborators will study the convex geometry of the affine Coxeter arrangement, and in particular, certain polytopes which occur in the study of affine Schubert varieties and total positivity of the affine Grassmannian.<br/><br/>The PI's research is in the area of combinatorics, which studies how to count discrete objects. The PI studies combinatorial problems which arise from geometry (studying shapes of objects in space) and algebraic structures (studying solutions to polynomial equations).  One of the on-going themes of the PI's work is the study of (positive) numbers which arise in mathematics.  These numbers may occur when counting the ways geometrical objects interact in space, or by couting certain solutions to polynomial equations.  In particular, the PI aims to understand the ""positive"" part of a geometrical figure in the same way the positive real axis is the ""positive"" part of the real line.  The PI's work will have a significant impact on the understanding of the relationships between geometry, algebra, and combinatorics.<br/>"

The first conjecture, stated by Morton and Silverman in 1994, predicts that there is some uniform upper bound for the number of preperiodic points of a given dynamical system that happen to be rational numbers.<br/>The second conjecture states that there is a uniform lower bound for the canonical height of a non-preperiodic rational point; in other words, roughly speaking, the non-preperiodicity of such a point must become obvious after a bounded number of iterations of the dynamical system.  While easy to describe either by example or by formal statement, both conjectures quickly lead to deep and subtle arithmetic problems.  Over the past decade or two, there has been great progress on such problems, and a substantial amount of technical machinery, some due to the investigator, has been developed to help answer them:<br/>advances in dynamics over local fields, capacity theory of Julia sets, local canonical heights, and dynamical Green's functions.  The resulting theory has parallels both to the analytic study of complex dynamics and to the arithmetic study of rational points on elliptic curves and other algebraic varieties, and it has drawn interest from specialists in both fields.<br/><br/>At its heart, the focus of this project is a type of classical Diophantine problem: to understand the set of rational number solutions to a naturally arising set of polynomial equations.  Such problems have been a major theme in the study of number theory for thousands of years.  More specifically, a central goal of this project is to further our theoretical understanding of Diophantine problems arising from a certain kind of dynamics: the iteration of a polynomial or rational function.  At the same time, because this dynamical subfield of number theory is relatively young, many of its aspects are accessible to undergraduates but still remain unsolved problems.<br/>Thus, as in an earlier successful project, the investigator plans to supervise some students in an REU summer research project to aid in their mathematical training.  The REU will include intense computer computations, especially of canonical heights and preperiodic points, and any relevant data generated will be disseminated to the research community via publications and the web."

The first topic is on rational  W-algebras and modular invariant representations. Quantum Hamiltonian reduction has been developed as a powerful tool for solving many open problems coming from physics and representation theory.  The next goal is classification of rational W-algebras, which should play an important role in Conformal field theory.  The basic idea is to utilize modular invariant representations of affine Lie algebras.  The second topic is on four fundamental algebra structures. This is a general framework, which unites in one picture Poisson algebras, associative algebras, Poisson vertex algebras and vertex algebras, that underline classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, classical field theory, and the simplest quantum field theory, respectively. The third topic is on classification of freely generated simple vertex and  Poisson vertex algebras.  A conjecture on classification of freely and finitely generated vertex algebras and Poisson vertex algebras is discussed.  The ""infinite"" problem is reduced to a finite, but ""non-linear'"" problem.  A computer search for the latter has confirmed the conjecture.<br/>The fourth topic is on Poisson vertex algebras and infinite-dimensional  integrable Hamiltonian systems.  Poisson vertex algebras is the most adequate language for the theory of Hamiltonian PDE.  This point of view leads to further development of the integrability theory of evolutionary equations. The last topic is on Lie conformal algebra cohomology and calculus of  variations.  The goal is to study the relation of the classical variational complex to the cohomology theory of Lie conformal algebras.  This connection should lead to further development of both theories.<br/><br/>It is expected that this proposal will have a significant unifying  impact upon several branches of  mathematics and, possibly, upon theoretical physics.  For example, the development of the theory of classical and quantum W-algebras should lead to further progress in the theory of classical and quantum integrable systems.  The theory of four fundamental algebraic structures should lead to deeper understanding of connections between representation theory,  topology and soliton theory on the one hand and the four fundamental  frameworks of physics theories on the other hand.  The theory of Poisson vertex algebras should lead to further development of the theory of integrable systems, such as the KdV hierarchy and the non-linear Schrdinger hierarchy.  The cohomology theory of  Lie conformal algebras should lead to a better understanding of the variational calculus, a theory that goes back to the works of Euler and Lagrange."

In the ensuing years the scope and depth of applications of expanders has increased -- over the past decade several completely new and unexpected lines of development have emerged and the field has undergone explosive growth.

On one hand, the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture has led to work by Kontsevich, Soibelman, Gross, Siebert, Zharkov and others to view mirror symmetry in terms of integral affine manifolds and tropical data on them. On the other hand, Mikhalkin's pioneering work on holomorphic curve counting using tropical geometry demonstrated that Gromov-Witten invariants were accessible by tropical methods, and increasingly, tropical methods are being seen as a tool for studying algebraic varieties. The aim of this FRG is to make further connections between tropical geometry and mirror symmetry with the aim of creating a new synthesis of these two fields. Some of the research directions of this project include the study of mirror symmetry for Fanos and manifolds of general type;  Lagrangians and SYZ fibrations in this new setting; non-archimedean integrable systems in hyper-Kaehler manifolds; tropical enumerative geometry of real and complex curves; the development of non-commutative Hodge theory, tropical homology and its relation to classical homology and the Hodge conjecture; Welschinger invariants, open Gromov-Witten theory and their applications to mirror symmetry. These should greatly extend the realm of mirror symmetry and applications of tropical geometry to the classical algebro-geometric world. Members of this FRG include: Ricardo Castano-Bernard (Kansas State), Mark Gross (San Diego),  Ilia Itenberg (Strasbourg), Ludmil Katzarkov (Miami), Viatcheslav Kharlamov (Strasbourg); Maxim Kontsevich  (I.H.E.S & Miami),  Diego Matessi (Alessandria); Grigory Mikhalkin (Geneva), Yan Soibelman (Kansas State), Jake Solomon (Hebrew U),  Ilia Zharkov (Kansas State).<br/><br/>During past 25 years there has been intensive interaction between string theory and geometry which has led to a creation of entirely new mathematical areas. String theory also suggested that ""conventional""<br/>geometry emerges from the quantum theory at certain limits. Then various ""string dualities"" give equivalent but mathematically very different descriptions of the same physical quantities. A beautiful and deep example illustrating all these ideas is mirror symmetry. An important component of this project is to expand the existing collaborative links of the FRG members exploring tropical methods of mirror symmetry into a solid collaborative network of postdocs, graduate students and experts in an integrated research-training environment. This includes the organization of workshops, summer schools and local seminar series at the local FRG nodes. International exchange of young and senior researchers is one of the key aspects of this project bringing together well-established groups in Europe and in the U.S. The participation of mathematicians and young researchers from underrepresented groups will be promoted."

If the usual laws of arithmetics do not hold in a theory, calculations tend to be difficult and often require the aid of electronic computers. In nonassociative mathematics, neither the commutative law nor the associative law are assumed to hold. Nonassociative mathematics is a broad field that interacts with many traditional mathematical disciplines. It includes the algebraic theories of quasigroups (nonassociative groups) and Lie algebras, the combinatorial theory of Latin squares (with Sudoku being a very special case), the geometric theories of nets and webs (that originally arose from nomography), and applications of nonassociative algebra to particle physics. Lately, there has been a resurgence of interest in nonassociative mathematics. This is due partly to improved computational tools, partly to the working out of many problems in associative mathematics, and partly due to the self-organizing efforts by researchers working in the field.<br/><br/>The proposed 2nd Mile High Conference on Nonassociative Mathematics will be an international conference on all aspects of nonassociative mathematics, with an expected audience of 100 researchers. The meeting will take place at the University of Denver, Denver, Colorado, June 21-27, 2009. The main goals of the 2nd Mile High Conference are as follows: (i) to establish a leading conference on nonassociative mathematics world-wide; (ii) to bring together scientists from all areas of nonassociative mathematics, thereby promoting cross-disciplinary research; (iii) to make the conference accessible to graduate and post-doctoral students while also providing a forum for these young researchers; (iv) to encourage and support the participation of researchers from underrepresented and underprivileged groups; (v) to assemble a list of the most important open problems in the field and to facilitate its dissemination and maintenance.<br/>"

Grant funds will be used to enable US-based researchers to participate in this international meeting.  The meeting will advance the theory and applications of mock theta functions by bringing together world class researchers with expertise not only in mock theta functions themselves, but also in the diverse areas that impact this very active field.  Mock theta functions have recently become a particularly active area of research in mathematics.  These functions were introduced by Ramanujan in his last letter to Hardy in 1920, but for a long time, little was known about these functions.  In 2002, Zweger's PhD thesis provided an important link between mock theta functions and harmonic Maass forms.  This breakthrough in the subject opened the door to a rich area of research.  Since then, applications of mock theta functions to various mathematical fields and topics in physics have led to solutions of major open problems.  Despite its recent rapid development, there are still many open problems and further applications (in different areas of mathematics and physics) needing investigation.<br/><br/>The conference will not only advance our understanding of mock theta functions, but also provide an important and timely opportunity for participants to start new collaborations and strengthen existing collaborations.  International connections between senior researchers indirectly benefit students and post-docs, who may later visit institutions abroad to give talks, study, or hold visiting positions.  Junior participants will be able to start new projects with international experts at a critical stage in their careers.<br/>"

W-algebras (of finite type) are certain finitely generated associative algebras associated with nilpotent elements in semisimple Lie algebras. They originate from the work of B. Kostant of late 70's. In 90's they were studied by physicists. Starting from 2000 they attracted lot of attention of specialists in Representation Theory: Brundan, Ginzburg, Kleshchev, Premet, and others. In two recent years the investigator discovered a completely new approach to W-algebras based on Deformation quantization. This new approach allowed to him to prove many conjectures on W-algebras (mostly due to Premet) and, in particular, obtain the classification of their irreducible finite dimensional modules. The investigator plans to continue the study of representations of W-algebras and their q-deformations. In particular, he plans to prove a conjecture of Brundan-Goodwin- Kleshchev on the structure of the category O of W-algebras. Algebraic transformation group theory is a classical topic of algebraic geometry and group theory. One of major developments in algebraic transformation groups in recent 25 years is the theory of spherical varieties developed by Brion, Knop, Luna, Panyushev, Vinberg, Vust, and others. Spherical varieties are a particularly nice class of varieties equipped with a reductive group action. When the group is a torus, spherical is the same as toric. One of the nice features of spherical varieties is that their classification may be obtained in entirely combinatorial terms. In the recent few years the investigator obtained certain uniqueness properties of spherical varieties in terms of their combinatorial invariants proving conjectures due to Brion, Knop and Luna. The investigator plans to generalize these results to arbitrary varieties equipped with an action of a reductive group. In particular, he plans to prove that a smooth affine G-variety is uniquely determined by its algebra of U-invariants.<br/><br/>This research projects deals with different kinds of symmetries arising both in pure mathematics and in physics. For instance, W-algebras are certain algebraic structures appeared in pure algebraic studies of Kostant in late 70's. Since then they found a number of applications in representation theory. On the other hand they are a manifestation of the notion of W-symmetry from Conformal field theory extensively studied by physicists. So the investigator's research project will contribute to pure mathematics and may have some applications to physics. The second part of this research project deals with a more classical notion of symmetries coming from geometry."

The principal investigator has already made the first progress on breaking the convexity bounds for self dual L-functions on GL(3). The problems related to breaking the convexity bounds for L-functions on high rank groups in various aspects are discussed in the proposal. Concrete conjectures are made, possible difficulties are discussed, new techniques and tools are mentioned. These projects are closely related to one of the most fundamental open problems in number theory - the Lindeloff hypothesis for degree n L-functions. The subconvexity bounds are the first steps toward the Lindeloff hypothesis.<br/><br/><br/>The proposal is concerned with the study of the size of certain number theoretical functions (infinite sums with one complex parameter) which are constructed on some geometric spaces. Bounding such functions are important not only because of its theoretical value but also because of its vast applications. For example, one application would be a stronger quantum unique ergodicity conjecture which tells us the convergence of certain measures on certain geometric spaces as well as the rate of convergence of these measures. This is a very important problem in mathematical physics. Other applications will be found in the future.<br/><br/><br/>"

Sjostrand involving hyperplane arrangements and Bruhat order.  He will continue to try to prove that there is some finite lattice L such that there is no finite group G whose subgroup lattice contains an interval isomorphic with L.  In particular, he will examine a class of lattices appearing in a conjecture that specializes both his own topological conjecture and a combinatorial conjecture of M. Aschbacher.<br/><br/>Most of Shareshian's work on this project lies in the intersection of three areas of mathematics, namely, combinatorics, topology and finite group theory.  The emphasis is on combinatorics, which is the study of discrete, usually finite, sets endowed with some additional structure. <br/>Typically, a combinatorialist wishes to know how many structures of a given type exist, or how many such structures possess some interesting additional property.  For example, consider the set S(n) of all possible lists of the numbers 1,...,n.  When n=3, there are 3x2x1=6 such lists, namely, 123,132,213,231,312,321.  In general, there are<br/>nx(n-1)x(n-2)...x2x1 such lists, and when n gets at all large, one cannot answer questions about these lists by examining all of them, even with a very powerful computer.  One type of problem of interest is, for given n and k, to figure out how many members of S(n) have exactly k positions i on the list where the number in position i is larger than i.  The answer to this particular problem is well understood, but Shareshian and Michelle Wachs are working on various generalizations.  With Axel Hultman, Svante Linusson and Jonas Sjostrand, Shareshian proved a conjecture of Alexander Postnikov relating a problem of the type described above to a problem involving slicing high dimensional spaces into pieces.  He plans to work on generalizing this result.  Finally, Shareshian is working towards proof a conjecture made by himself and Michael Aschbacher relating a class of algebraic objects (ubiquitous in pure and applied mathematics), called finite groups, to a class or combinatorial objects, called finite lattices.  In all projects, it is hoped that both the solutions to the problems under consideration and the methods used to obtain them will be of use and interest to both combinatorialists and mathematicians working in other fields.<br/>"

This is a a p-adic geometric analogue of Ribet's level raising and level lowering theorems.  As a second project they intend to establish a local to global principle at p by developing the theory of p-adic modular forms using Fontaine's notion of (phi, gamma)- modules and Colmez's p-adic local langlands correspondence.

The first concerns development of a computational apparatus to derive asymptotics from mutlivariate generating functions.  This is done using complex analytic methods.  In one variable, the subject of analytic combinatorics is well developed, but in more than one variable, methods are only now beginning to be understood.  Geometric properties of the singular variety of the generating function become important, requiring further work both in the construction of appropriate deformations and in the effective computation of the resulting integrals.<br/>The second area of proposed research concerns analysis of several probability models.  One of these is to find perfect squares in products of random integers.  This model, due to Pomerance, arises in sieving methods of factorization.  In past work, we analyzed a square-finding algorithm believed to have asymptotically the shortest possible run time.  In fact we know it to be within about 30% of the best run time, but would like to prove that it is in fact asymptotically optimal.  A positive result would tell us the algorithm in fact searches for an asymptotically optimal witness.  Other probability models in the proposal include searches and sampling in trees of exponential growth, and computations saddle point integrals for likelihood functions. <br/>Here follows a ""big-picture"" description of how this research is situated with respect to problems of general scientific interest.<br/><br/>Generating functions are perhaps the single most widely applicable technique for counting or estimating the size of combinatorial classes.<br/>Generating functions encode recursive information: tractable generating <br/>functions exist when the sizes of the classes satisfy a recursion.   <br/>An explicit (non-recursive) descriptions of these numbers is usually more desirable.  For example, the recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers, a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2), while remakably simple, is less useful for size estimation than the explicit formula a(n) = (1+o(1)) b^n where b is the Golden ratio.  It has been known for several decades how to convert one-variable generating functions into explicit asymptotic formulae.  Recent research of the PI and others extends this knowledge to generating functions for multivariate arrays.  An important component of the proposed research is the automation of these new mutlivariate techniques, which requires development of effective tools for computing algebraic and topological invariants of polynomials.  <br/><br/>One aspect of the utility of the proposed research on square subproducts is obvious: it gives us the run time of the main component of a basic and widely used factoring algorithm.  The method of analysis is to show that the factorizations of random integers converge, in an appropriate sense, to a certain Poisson process.  Probability limit theorems are common in analytic number theory, but the limit structure required for this analysis requires keeping track of the magnitude of<br/>the product of all the factors.   A second aspect of the significance<br/>of the proposed research, therefore, is that it will develop a number-theoretic probability model containing more information than previous models, and to which actual factorizations of random integers may be shown rigorously to converge.  The part of the proposal concerning searches and sampling on graphs of exponential growth is motivated by in part by the connection between uniform sampling and size estimation.<br/>"

Research on the Hecke symmetry, both in characteristic p and in mixed characteristics (0,p), will likely lead to new tools and perhaps new insight on the geometry of modular varieties.<br/>The effect of Hecke symmetry in the p-adic topology has not been systematically studied before.  Progress on the expected non-density statement for the union of all Hecke translates of a lower-dimensional subvariety will provide an affirmative answer to a question posed by N. Katz on the existence of abelian varieties of dimension 3 or higher over the field of all algebraic numbers which are not isogenous to any Jacobian variety. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a CM lifting up to isogeny over a normal domain of characteristic 0 is known from prior sponsored research.  The focus in this part of the project is the existence of a CM lifting up to isogeny over a not-necessarily normal local domain of characteristics (0,p).<br/><br/>A projective algebraic variety is basically a subset of the projective space defined by a system of homogeneous polynomial equations, with the surrounding projective space stripped off and only the abstract mathematical structure left.  An abelian variety is a very special kind of projective algebraic variety such that one can perform addition and substraction on it and the standard rules of arithmetic are satisfied.<br/>A moduli space considered above is an algebraic variety whose points parametrizes abelian varieties with a fixed dimension and shape of symmetry.  Such a moduli space does not have many symmetries of the usual kind, those which to every point of the moduli space associate another point of the moduli space.  Instead there are many symmetries of another sort on these moduli spaces, known as Hecke correspondences, which to every point of the moduli space associates several points of the moduli space.<br/>A basic question about Hecke symmetry is the following. Start with either one point or more generally a subvariety of a moduli space, then spread it around using all Hecke correspondences.  Does the resulting subset almost fill the whole moduli space, so that every point of the moduli space has many points of the spread-out subset nearby and as close to it as one wants? This question is of interest mainly in one of two situations: the polynomial equations are considered over a ring such that either a prime number p times 1 is equal to 0, or over a ring which contains the standard integers but elements divisible by a high power of p is close to 0.<br/>The CM lifting question involves both kinds of rings above.  Abelian varieties are extensively used in modern number theory, and properties of the moduli spaces over either kind of rings above are often of key importance for application in number theory. The PI's prior sponsored research has made Hecke symmetry a useful tool for number theory and algebraic geometry, producing short new proofs of known theorems as well as results inaccessible by previous methods. This project, when carried out, is likely to increase our knowledge about geometry of the moduli spaces of abelian varieties and may generate additional methods applicable to other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

In this project the PI will investigate the combinatorics associated with some of the most useful of these, Macdonald polynomials, which are multi-variate symmetric functions which satisfy an orthogonality relation and play a central role in algebraic combinatorics with applications to special functions, algebraic geometry, and statistical mechanics.  Their original definition was rather difficult and indirect, but in 2004 the PI found a nice combinatorial formula for them, which was proved in subsequent joint work between Haiman, Loehr and the PI.  The PI and others have been finding that the new combinatorics of Macdonald polynomials often leads to new combinatorial formulas for related objects.  For example, in recent joint work with Luoto, Mason, and Van Willigenburg, the PI has been investigating certain limiting cases of nonsymmetric<br/>Macdonald polynomials known as Demazure characters and Demazure atoms, which are connected to representation theory.   The PI and his collaborators have shown that some of the fundamental relations satisfied by the important Schur function basis have refined versions involving Demazure characters and atoms, involving constructs in the new combinatorics of Macdonald polynomials.  Another part of the project involves conjectures the PI has recently formed which are multi-variate versions of previous conjectures of the PI and others involving the zeros of rook and matching polynomials.  The PI is using computers combined with current mathematical methods to make progress on these conjectures.<br/><br/>Polynomials in a single variable play a fundamental role in science and mathematics, for example when modeling discrete data by a continuous function.  Certain families of polynomials known as orthogonal polynomials are especially useful.  Macdonald polynomials are a master family of orthogonal polynomials in several variables which contain all sorts of previously studied families of orthogonal polynomials and other useful polynomials as special cases.  Macdonald proved they exist, but gave no particularly simple description of them.  The PI, in a previous collaboration with Haiman and Loehr, proved a direct combinatorial description of them.  There are still many unsolved problems involving Macdonald polynomials, and in this projectthe PI will continue to develop the combinatorial side of the theory, with applications to a variety of polynomials from various branches of mathematics.  Another aspect of this proposal involves values of the variables which make a given polynomial zero, which the PI is investigating using computers and experimental methods."

The noncommutative analogues should replace the commutative algebra of complex-valued functions on n-dimensional real space by a free algebra on n generators, or more generally by path algebras of quivers.  This should extend a construction of a Lie algebra action found earlier by the co-PI and Ginzburg.  These representations should be useful in studying Calabi-Yau potentials for completed group algebras of fundamental groups of compact aspherical three-manifolds.  More generally, this project aims to understand ""non-commutative quantization"" in the sense of replacing an associative algebra whose variety of n-dimensional representations is Poisson by some structure which maps under a generalization of the representation functor to a quantization of the original Poisson variety.  This construction would include the non-commutative differential operators on the associative algebra, which are used in the definition of the Heisenberg representation.  Finally, the project aims to continue studying potentials for Calabi-Yau algebras in three and higher dimensions, such as Sklyanin algebras, and apply this to their deformation theory and the deformation theory of singular Poisson varieties, generalizing works of the co-PI, as well as of Ginzburg, Etingof, and others.  Various aspects of the problem will be approached using computational algebra and are suitable as projects for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In less technical language, the project aims to connect quantization theory (e.g., quantum mechanics and symmetries) with representation theory (the study of ways that algebras can act on vector spaces), by studying objects whose representations are themselves quantizations.  This should have applications to understanding the structure of three-dimensional spaces as well as deformations of various well-known classical and quantum systems.  An important part involves the study of algebras related to string theory which are defined by certain graphs and their relations, and particularly those spaces related to Calabi-Yau geometry.  A central example is the Weil representation, which incorporates the Fourier transform between position and momentum coordinates, or time and frequency coordinates, as well as all in-between coordinates."

A guiding principle of the proposer's research is that many problems in stochastic geometry are best understood in terms of random surfaces and height functions (in discrete settings) and random distributions such as the Gaussian free field (in continuum settings).<br/><br/>Two dimensional random geometries are important in part because many problems in statistical physics (such as the way crystal surfaces fluctuate) are essentially two dimensional.

Over the past two decades, physicists have developed sophisticated non-rigorous techniques for understanding the properties of random objects with conformal symmetries. During the past few years, several mathematicians have begun to rigorously prove some of the predictions from the physics literature, along with many additional results.

The speakers will be distinguished mathematicians working in the areas of Lie groups, representation theory and related fields with an emphasis on the interplay of algebraic and geometric methods in representation theory. The main topics of the conference are: finite and infinite dimensional Lie groups and Lie algebras, representation theory of Lie algebras and algebraic groups, invariant theory, symmetric and wonderful varieties and their compactifications, quantum groups and quantum affine algebras, hyperplane and subspace arrangements and their compactifications.<br/><br/>Representation theory is an area of mathematics that studies symmetry in linear spaces. It has important applications to quantum physics and chemistry. For instance, it allows one to incorporate the rotational symmetry of the space into the study of atoms, ultimately underlying the structure of the Periodic Table of chemical elements. Also, representation theory is one of the main tools in classifying elementary particles, and is a fundamental instrument of string theory, which aims to explain gravity quantum-mechanically. In addition, representation theory has applications to statistical physics, and to the theory of quantum computers. Recently, a great progress in representation theory was made thanks to applying deep ideas from geometry. In the other direction, representation theory may shed a new light on classical problems in geometry. The conference will highlight this interplay and will review some of the main achievements in this field.<br/>"

More precisely, he will investigate the Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series induced from parabolic subgroups. When the degree of the cover is trivial, this reduces to the case of Eisenstein series on linear algebraic groups as studied by Langlands, Shahidi, and others, which have been instrumental in formulating and proving portions of the Langlands program. By studying metaplectic forms in families ranging over all finite covers (including the trivial one), surprising new structure emerges. Brubaker and his collaborators have demonstrated that the resulting Fourier-Whittaker coefficients contain Dirichlet series in several complex variables (so-called ``multiple Dirichlet series'') whose coefficients are described in terms of crystal graphs. These crystal graphs encode information about representations of quantum groups, which are deformations of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. In this situation, the relevant Lie algebra is associated to the Langlands dual group of the group on which one builds the Eisenstein series. The proposal seeks to develop this theory more completely and explore the novel connections it suggests between number theory, quantum groups and combinatorial representation theory. <br/><br/>Langlands' program was initially conceived as a stunning collection of conjectures relating functions with interesting arithmetic properties (e.g., counting the number of integer solutions to an equation) to functions with good analytic properties (e.g., having symmetries and being the solution of a natural differential equation). But similar kinds of duality have been observed in geometry and mathematical physics, leading to geometric and quantum versions of the Langlands programs, respectively.  In short, these dualities have become a lens through which a large portion of modern mathematics and mathematical physics can be organized and understood. However, the explicit underlying mechanisms which relate, for example, arithmetic functions to analytic functions remain largely a mystery. In these projects, Principal Investigator Brubaker with his collaborators and students will use the data provided by the above special examples to attempt to find such a mechanism and attempt to better understand the relationships between various incarnations of the Langlands program in arithmetic, geometry, and physics. An equally important component of the projects is the training of students at all levels by creating a tiered system of mentoring. To bolster these efforts, a set of course materials will be developed to reflect the changing emphasis in modern number theory on analytic techniques, focusing on computational approaches and example-based learning to reinforce concepts"

One major goal is the analysis and classification of various kinds of highly-symmetric polyhedra, graphs or complexes in Euclidean spaces, with a focus on ordinary three-space. Specific research projects aim at the full enumeration of the discrete regular polygonal complexes, the fully transitive polyhedra, the two-orbit polyhedra, and the non-discrete chiral or regular polyhedra of finite local complexity.

Another important direction of research are modular reduction techniques in abstract polytopes. This involves a detailed study of polytopes and reflection groups in finite orthogonal geometries associated with Coxeter (or other) groups, and of polytopes derived from groups of linear fractional transformations over complex or quaternionic integers. Further projects concern abstract two-orbit polytopes and links between polytopes and incidence geometries.

These are fundamental geometric objects that will stay in mathematics, independent of trends or fashion. Via their skeletal nature as periodic geometric graphs in space, they also have considerable potential for applications in the design and synthesis of molecular structures appearing in crystallography, physics or biology.  Tessellations, or maps, on surfaces or manifolds are another rich source of polyhedral structures with a high degree of symmetry. There has been a huge amount of work on maps and graphs, parallel to, but largely independent, of developments in polytope theory.

The objective of the conference is to provide a forum to explore the manifold interactions between the branches of mathematics and computer science named in the title. Ever since the inception of the polynomial-time paradigm in the late 1960s, theoretical computer science has been a major consumer of concepts and techniques developed in combinatorics, and, conversely, the conceptual frameworks developed in algorithms and complexity theory have transformed much of combinatorics. As the relatively young areas of combinatorics and complexity theory have matured in the past decades, algebraic methods have become increasingly relevant to each. Group theory has played an important role both as a source of techniques and as a subject of rigorous algorithmic study, with the subarea of asymptotic group theory leading the way in the interaction.<br/><br/>The subareas to be covered include but are not limited to arithmetic combinatorics, asymptotic group theory, automorphism groups of combinatorial structures, vertex-transitive graphs, expanders, combinatorial models of computation (circuits, decision trees, communication complexity, etc.), probabilistically checkable proofs and approximation algorithms, derandomization, algebraic graph theory, abelian sandpiles, algorithmic problems in combinatorics and algebra, mathematical problems motivated by problems in algorithms and complexity theory. This interdisciplinary conference will focus on the crossfertilization between the areas of combinatorics, group theory, algorithms, and complexity theory, the first two being areas of mathematics and the last two - areas of theoretical computer science.   Each of these areas has significantly contributed to the development of the others over the past decades.  It is expected that the conference will increase our understanding of the deeper mathematical issues that underlie the connections between these areas, with implications to each of the areas concerned.   A particular occasion for this meeting will be the 60th birthday of Laszlo Babai whose work has been influential in developing connections between these fields.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The Cumberland Conference is an annual conference held to bring together combinatorial mathematicians and computer scientists from the southern and southeastern regions of the United States. It has been held every year since 1988, with the venue changing from year to year, moving around between universities.<br/><br/>The conference will focus on two active areas of research: extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, and complexity theory. These areas have applications in the natural and social sciences, and form the theoretical foundation of modern information infrastructure. Combinatorial methods are used in problems of computer science, ecology, statistical physics, chemistry, logistics, applied for the reliability of transportation and communication networks such as the Internet, scheduling, and many optimization problems. Computational complexity theory is a branch of computer science which investigates the problems related to the amounts of resources required for the execution of algorithms, and in many cases uses combinatorial tools. <br/><br/>The conference is expected to have about 100 participants, and about 60 contributed talks, arranged in two or three parallel sessions. There will be five principal speakers who will give one-hour presentations. Vitaly Bergelson (Ohio State University), Ralph Faudree (University of Memphis), Alexandr Kostochka (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Benny Sudakov (University of California at Los Angeles), and Mario Szegedy (Rutgers University) have accepted our invitations to be principal speakers. The conference is organized by a committee of six people from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Western Kentucky University, the chair of the committee is Bela Csaba."
