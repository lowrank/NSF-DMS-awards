One example of the first aspect of the project is the proposed study of the asymptotic behaviour of Betti numbers of the Frobenius endomorphism. The paradigm for the results sought is Kunz's theorem: local ring of non-zero characteristic is regular precisely when the Frobenius endomorphism is flat.  A second example concerns Koszul algebras: the investigator will build on recent work with Herzog that was motivated by results of Eisenbud, Floystad, and Schreyer on the relationship between linear strands of resolutions over a polynomial ring and modules over its Koszul dual exterior algebra. Some of the techniques proposed are derived from rational homotopy theory, and a guiding light in this endeavour is the ""Looking glass principle"" of Avramov and Halperin. However, many of the crucial results that govern it have not been pinned down in the desired level of detail. Avramov and the investigator propose a manuscript that fills this gap in the literature. The project will also investigate the role of cellular approximations, staple to topologists, in the context of commutative rings.<br/>In the second half of the 19th century, David Hilbert discovered a close relationship between geometric objects called varieties, and certain types of functions defined onthem. The latter form algebraic gadgets called commutative rings. Over the last century, commutative rings have arisen in combinatorics, topology, and other branches of mathematics.  They have also found applications in diverse fields like cryptography, pattern recognition, and theoretical physics. This project seeks to apply techinques from 'homological algebra' to study commutative rings.  Topology has been a major force in the development of homological algebra, although some of its roots can be traced to geometry. Homological methods have proved remarkably efficacious in tackling problems in commutative algebra; in turn, this has infused new ideas into the subject.<br/><br/>"

Witherspoon studies representations of these algebras as linear transformations on vector spaces, and their cohomology, which measures properties of the algebras and their representations. Witherspoon will compute the Hochschild cohomology of certain crossed product algebras arising from group actions on spaces. There are expected connections to some new theories of cohomology of orbifolds, and Witherspoon's research will inform the effort by many mathematicians to understand these cohomology theories. At the same time it will be of interest to quantum group theorists as Witherspoon expects, based on her current work, that deformations of these crossed product algebras come from representations of certain quantum groups on these algebras. Related work that Witherspoon proposes will involve progress on some basicquestions about Hopf algebras and quantum groups, such as finite generation of cohomology, and three-manifold invariants arising from finite quantum groups. Another project involves fundamental questions about how representations of an algebra are related to those of a subalgebra. Witherspoon will continue her work in generalizing Clifford theory from groups to certain types of algebras, with the goal of finding constructive answers to these questions, and will apply such a theory to answer questions about representations of algebras.<br/><br/>Algebra is the expression of physical objects as equations or functions. A curve or surface is the graph of an equation, and its physical properties may be determined directly from the equation. More general algebraic systems such as collections of many functions, called algebras, encode information about more complicated physical objects. For example, if an object (such as a crystal or a molecule) exhibits symmetry, this symmetry is expressed in its corresponding algebra. Many such examples are well understood, and the mathematics involved is exploited in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. However there are many systems that are less well understood, such as the quantum groups that arose in mathematical physics less than two decades ago. Witherspoon's work involves the study of properties of such algebras and their representations as physical objects. One technique that is used frequently in Witherspoon's work is cohomology. Witherspoon will compute the cohomology of various types of algebras, as well as use other methods to study them and their representations. Witherspoon's proposed activities will result in a collection of publications on a wide range of topics within algebra that will also impact fields outside algebra such as geometry and mathematical physics. Most of the activities address questions, in which many mathematicians are currently interested, while others are new ideas that will find an interested audience upon publication.<br/><br/>"

These objects play an increasingly important<br/>role in number theory,  but they can be difficult to study, because<br/>the powerful representation theoretic methods that plays such a crucial<br/>role in the classical theory of automorphic forms do not apply to them.<br/>Work of the proposer shows that they can be studied representation<br/>theoretically, however, by using methods from the recently introduced<br/>locally analytic representation theory of p-adic groups.  The proposed<br/>project will employ these methods to construct p-adic analytic families<br/>of automorphic Hecke eigenforms for arbitrary reductive groups, and to<br/>construct and study p-adic L-functions attached to these automorphic<br/>forms.

A typical number theoretic<br/>question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some<br/>equation of interest.

These are methods that exploit<br/>the many symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyse<br/>their mathematical properties.  A more recent approach to their study,<br/>that is playing an ever more important role, is to use p-adic methods. <br/>These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect<br/>to some fixed prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients<br/>of the automorphic forms and L-functions.  A large part of their<br/>usefulness comes from that fact that they allow one to group<br/>automorphic forms and the related L-functions into families<br/>called ``p-adic families'', and study the members of the families<br/>simultaneously.  Until recently, the representation theoretic approach<br/>and the p-adic approaches have remained quite distinct.  The goal of the<br/>proposed project is to unite the two approaches using methods of so-called<br/>``locally analytic representation theory'' (an emerging branch of<br/>representation theory).

The investigator's<br/>research primarily deals with such a notion.  Specifically, the PI hopes to<br/>show that the number of rational points with bounded Weil height in an orbit<br/>under the action of the group of automorphisms of a K3 surface grows<br/>asymptotically like a power of the bound.  The exponent of growth should<br/>depend only on the geometry of the surface.  When the K3 surface contains<br/>no -2 curves, the exponent is expected to be n-2, where n is the dimension<br/>of the Picard group.  The situation is particularly interesting when there<br/>are -2 curves. In this case, the exponent of growth should be related to the<br/>Kahler cone or nef cone.  The Kahler cone lies in a Lorentz space of<br/>dimension n (where the intersection product is the Lorentz product) and a<br/>cross section of the cone lies in a hyperbolic space of dimension n-1.  When<br/>the K3 surface has a -2 curve, the boundary at infinity of this cross<br/>section is a fractal on a sphere of dimension n-2. The PI believes that the<br/>previously mentioned exponent of growth should be the Hausdorff dimension of<br/>this cross section.  When n=4, these fractals are similar to the well known<br/>Apollonian gasket.<br/><br/>This is basic research aimed at improving our understanding of K3 surfaces<br/>and related objects.  Surfaces of type K3 can be thought of as higher<br/>dimensional analogs of elliptic curves, for which analogous research was the<br/>subject of early 20th century mathematics. Our basic understanding of<br/>elliptic curves eventually led to the development of elliptic curve based public key codes, fast<br/>factoring algorithms, and efficient error correcting codes.  The theory and<br/>existence of public key codes revolutionized cryptography and with it, the<br/>internet as we know it.  Without them, internet based commerce would be far<br/>too vulnerable to allow the sorts of transactions we currently take for granted.  A K3 surface can<br/>also be thought of as a two dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold.  Three<br/>dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds are of interest to physicists studying<br/>string theory and quantum field theory.<br/>"

We expect to make significant progresses on all three fronts. <br/>On the theoretical side, the PI previously proved that Dwork's unit root zeta <br/>function is p-adic meromorphic but no information about its zeros is known  <br/>except in the simpler abelian rank one case. We propose to obtain effective <br/>information about zeros of the unit root zeta function in the general <br/>non-abelian higher rank case, settling this basic problem.

The third part of the proposal is to prove a non-negativity theorem about the multiplication in the torus-equivariant K-theory of the flag variety. The fourth part of the proposal is to describe the Riemann-Roch map of a geometric quotient by an algebraic group in terms of the equivariant Riemann-Roch map.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics that has grown out of the study of solutions to polynomial equations.  By linking algebra and geometry, it sheds light on both, and has implications for many other branches of mathematics, including number theory, cryptography, and group theory.  This project is largely devoted to studying some problems in algebraic geometry that are related to algebraic groups. To say that a problem is related to algebraic groups means that the problem has some symmetry which can make it more accessible to investigation.  Sometimes the symmetry can be used to extract essential features of the problem and study them without considering all of the geometric complexities; the moment graphs, which are part of this project, are an example of this.<br/><br/>"

Put simply, the aim is to understand the objects in n-dimensional (and infinite-dimensional) space, which, like the circle or sphere, have a large, continuous family of symmetries, and to encode this symmetry in discrete combinatorics.<br/>"

Namely, it describes a geometric analog of spectral theory on moduli spaces of bundles. Moreover in the work of Beilinson and Drinfeld this global theory for complex algebraic curves (Riemann surfaces) arises from a local-to-global principle, whose local components are algebraic structures underlying conformal field theory (which itself underlies string theory). My proposal, highlighting joint work with D. Nadler, seeks to develop a real version of the geometric Langlands program, describing a harmonic analysis on moduli spaces of real bundles on real algebraic curves, widening the scope of interactions with both classical representation theory and string theory. A strong impetus for this extension is its potential role as an enhancement of the classical representation theory of real semisimple Lie groups. Specifically, we propose that the Langlands classification of representations appears essentially as the special case of our program when the algebraic curve is the projective line. Another motivation arises from the local features of its description on Riemann surfaces with boundary. Here we find a strong interplay with the rapidly emerging physical theory of D-branes, the boundary conditions of conformal field theory.<br/><br/>A fundamental theme of modern mathematics is the exploitation of symmetry as an organizing principle, linking diverse and potentially baffling phenomena in an elegant overarching framework. Perhaps the prime example of this trend is the Langlands program, which identifies a general pattern in the appearance of symmetry in number theory, and counts among its successes the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem. In recent years, the Langlands philosophy has been applied in new and more geometric directions, in particular the geometry of surfaces, where it makes contact with the symmetry principles that underly the exciting developments of string theory in physics. My current research proposal (with D. Nadler) suggests an extension of this geometric Langlands program to organize the symmetries associated to surfaces with boundaries or ends. This extension has two main novel attractions. On the one hand, it seeks to encompass, and thereby shed new geometric light on, a classical topic in the study of symmetries involving real numbers. This topic appears naturally in the case when the surface involved is simply a disc. On the other hand, it suggests an intimate new link with one of the most active areas of interest in string theory, the study of the membranes where strings can attach themselves, or end. Thus this proposal provides a new instance of the versatility and unifying appeal of the Langlands philosophy.<br/><br/><br/>"

The meeting will cover three main, inter-related areas. The first is the representation theory of simple algebraic groups in defining characteristic. There is no known character formula for the irreducible modules, but some years ago, Lusztig<br/>proposed a conjectural formula, which has become the main focus of attention. While Lusztig's conjecture remains far from proved, attempts to prove it have led to spectacular progress in the area in recent years. The second area is modular representation theory in non-defining characteristic. Here one considers the finite groups of Lie type over a field of characteristic p, and studies representations over fields of characteristic different from p. One should also include in this area the representation theory of Coxeter groups (such as the symmetric groups), which is intimately related to that of groups of Lie type. Again there have been spectacular developments in recent years. Fundamental conjectures have been formulated by Alperin, Dade and Broue, and while these are again nowhere near proved, many special cases have been solved, leading to a much deeper general understanding of this field. The third area is the structure theory of simple algebraic and finite groups, particularly the subgroup structure, and its relationship with the representation theory discussed above. Powerful parallel theories for subgroups of both the finite and the algebraic simple groups have been developed, using representation theory as one of the main tools, via the actions of classical groups on their natural modules, and of exceptional groups on their adjoint modules.<br/><br/>The symmetry of any system, physical or mathematical, abstract or concrete, is encapsulated in its symmetry group. Thus, the theory of groups finds many applications, both in mathematics and in the physical sciences. Much of group theory is concerned with the study of the actions of groups on spaces of various kinds. The study of group actions on vector spaces is known as representation theory, and that of group actions on sets as permutation group theory, and the focus for this meeting will be on these two areas and their applications. The building blocks of all finite groups are the so-called simple groups, and most of these arise in a natural way from simple algebraic groups (such as SL(n,K), the group of n x n determinant 1 matrices over an algebraically closed field K). Consequently, most attention is devoted to the representation and permutation group theory of these simple groups. These areas are alive with basic conjectures, such as those of Lusztig, Alperin, Broue and Dade. While these are all far from proved, attempts to prove them have led to spectacular progress in the subject in recent years. The meeting will focus on this progress and its applications. There is a healthy number of graduate students working in these areas, and one of the goals is to stimulate interaction between graduate students, young researchers and some of the established leaders in the field.<br/>"

First, in the defining characteristic theory, the underlying module is taken over a field with the same characteristic as the defining characteristic of the group. Second, in the cross-characteristic theory, modules are taken over fields of characteristic different from the defining characteristic. Cross-characteristic studies are unavoidable if one wants to understand all ways that one finite Lie group might embed in another. The third class involves the representation theory in all characteristics of the underlying Weyl group. In all cases, representations of continuous Lie groups provide starting point for representations.  This is most apparent in the defining characterstic case, where an ambient algebraic group is available. In cross characteristic, quantum groups plays a similar role, but, so far, only for the finite general linear groups.  Arguably, there is fourth class of ""finite group of Lie type,"" viz., the Hecke algebras associated to Weyl---or even Coxeter---groups. These algebras often connect the three classes; e.g., in the cross-characteristic theory, they provide a link between the finite general linear groups and quantum groups. Though an analogous role for quantum groups in other types has yet to appear, the Hecke algebra ""link"" remains, often with interpretations in continuous geometry. This project will advance research in these areas, both in current investigations and in focusing anew on finding a unified approach to the representation theory of the finite Lie groups. For example, can everything be reduced to Hecke algebras in a suitably rich sense (allowing homological or geometric structure)? Recently, the authors ""reduced"" the defining characteristic Lusztig conjecture for finite general linear groups to proposed symmetric group cohomology properties. Is there a similar reduction for other types or analogous cross-characteristic conjectures?  Progress on these questions will involve much further development of the authors' recent work on Hecke algebra cohomology, as well as continued pursuit of Parshall's nullcone research. Other continuing projects, including Scott's computer work with undergraduates, fit in well with these themes.<br/>The groups and representations studied here comprise the most important basic ingredients for creating a general theory of all finite group representations. Over the past century, similar theories for continuous groups played a large role in quantum theory and the theory of elementary particles. Their finite analogs have already proved valuable in the design of communications and data storage devices, though this finite theory remains very incomplete. In the future, one expects that the finite discrete worlds of computers and communications will become even more important. The task of creating a viable general theory of finite group representations-the investigators' long-term goal-is, thus, a central problem for the future.<br/>"

A very precise computation of the metaplectic<br/>kernel for all groups has been done in Prasad's joint work with<br/>M.S.Raghunathan and A.S.Rapinchuk. On the other hand, the centrality of<br/>the congruence subgroup kernel is still unknown for some important class<br/>of groups. Prasad's goal is to investigate these groups and also find a<br/>conceptually better proof of the centrality in the known cases. He will<br/>continue his collaboration with A.S. Rapinchuk on this project. Another<br/>topic on which Prasad will work on is the representation theory of<br/>reductive p-adic groups. Prasad has been interested in classification of<br/>irreducible admissible representations where his goal is to obtain a<br/>classification in terms of theory of ""types"". A begining in this<br/>direction, for general reductive groups, was made in his joint work with<br/>Allen Moy--the geometric techniques which they introduced in<br/>representation theory have turned out to be very useful. Prasad plans to<br/>continue his research towards classification of admissible<br/>representations.<br/><br/> The set of symmetries of many geometric and number theoretic objects form<br/>a group. For studying these geometric and number theoretic objects, it is<br/>important to study their groups of symmetries. Prasad has been studying<br/>problems related to these groups and their subgroups. These problems have<br/>number theoretic or geometric origins and therefore their solution will<br/>have important applications to these areas. Prasad proposes to work on the<br/>Kneser-Tits and Margulis-Platonov problems which provide conjectural<br/>description of normal subgroups; both the problems have been settled for a<br/>large class of groups but some challenging cases remain open. Prasad also<br/>proposes to continue his work on the famous congruence subgroup problem<br/>where he and his collaborators Raghunathan and Rapinchuk have made many<br/>important contributions. In another direction, Prasad proposes to work on<br/>the representation theory of reductive p-adic groups. Representations of<br/>these groups arise naturally in various contexts and their study is an<br/>important component of the Langlands program in modern number theory. The<br/>geometric methods which Prasad and Allen Moy introduced in the area have<br/>turned out to be very useful. Prasad proposes to refine these methods to<br/>give a complete classification of all admissible representations.<br/>"

The investigators<br/>propose to study the Iwasawa theory of modular forms with supersingular<br/>reduction.  A primary focus of this work is the behavior of Iwasawa<br/>invariants in p-adic analytic families of modular forms such as the<br/>eigencurve of Coleman and Mazur.  In fact, the definitions of these<br/>invariants, well known in the ordinary case, are not yet known in general<br/>in the supersingular case.

The definitions of the analytic invariants should be<br/>related to special values of modular L-functions; exhibiting the desired<br/>behavior in families will involve a study of congruences of special values<br/>of modular L-functions, a recurring theme in much recent work.  An<br/>eventual goal of this project is to show that the main conjecture of<br/>Iwasawa theory can be checked for an entire family by checking it for a<br/>single form in the family.

The remainder of the project is subdivided into<br/>three major subprojects.  The first subproject is to provide a complete<br/>set of recognition theorems for the alternating groups of degree at least<br/>nine and for the finite groups of Lie type of untwisted Lie rank at least<br/>three. These recognition theorems will mesh with the local structure<br/>obtained in other volumes, generally a bouquet of known quasisimple groups<br/>of Lie or alternating type, arising as components in the centralizers of<br/>commuting elements of prime order.  This project involves collaboration<br/>with finite geometers, including Shpectorov, Gramlich and Hoffman. The<br/>second project is to provide an analysis of two special classes of finite<br/>simple groups of even type -- those of Klinger-Mason type and those of<br/>intermediate type.  The former are characterized as groups of both even<br/>type and p-type for some odd prime p, and include approximately half of<br/>the sporadic simple groups. The latter class roughly approximates the<br/>groups with e(G) = 3 and includes most of the groups of Lie type of<br/>BN-rank 3 defined over finite fields of characteristic 2.  This project is<br/>a collaboration with Inna Korchagina and Kay Magaard. The third project is<br/>to establish the non-existence of finite simple groups of even type having<br/>a p-uniqueness subgroup for some odd prime p.  This project is a<br/>collaboration with Gernot Stroth.<br/><br/>Finite groups arise as the symmetry groups of discrete objects in many<br/>branches of mathematics, as well as in chemistry and other sciences.  <br/>Objects having a high degree of symmetry generally have symmetry groups<br/>which are either almost simple groups or affine groups having almost<br/>simple point groups.  As such, finite simple groups, and questions about<br/>their subgroups and representations by permutations or matrices, arise<br/>naturally and pervasively in coding theory, crystallography, graph theory<br/>and number theory.  The ability of scientists and mathematicians to<br/>understand and use the symmetry groups which arise in their research<br/>depends critically on recognition theorems, almost all of which rely<br/>eventually on the classification theorem of the finite simple groups.  <br/>Many of these recognition theorems have been used in recent years to<br/>design powerful computer software for the efficient recognition of groups<br/>from fragmentary information, usually given by a generating set of<br/>permutations or matrices.  Again this relies fundamentally on the validity<br/>of the classification theorem of the finite simple groups. This project,<br/>in conjunction with other recently completed projects and a small number<br/>of well-accepted treatises and papers, will provide a coherent, reliable<br/>and readable source for the proof of this fundamental theorem. In<br/>addition, in the process, it is documenting a wealth of recognition<br/>theorems and detailed subgroup information about the finite simple groups.<br/>"

This is the biannual meeting of the community of physicists, mathematicians, and engineers who practice the methods of symmetry.  It was last held in North America in 1988, so it provides an especially good opportunity for U.S. junior researchers in this broad field.  The purpose of the meeting is to review the principal developments that have occurred in recent years, to present the main results leading to current work in the subject in a coherent form that will be accessible to graduate students and young researchers newly entering the domain, and to point out the most promising directions for future research.  In particular, the meeting's special panel on ""Group theory in the XXI Century,"" is meant to provide guidance to junior researchers, and the Proceedings will be published. <br/><br/>Group theory is the mathematics of symmetry.  Modern physical theories make extensive use of group theoretical ideas to represent the symmetries observed in nature.  The periodic table of the elements, atomic spectral analysis, classification of crystal structure, and theories of elementary particles all involve group-theoretic models.  The concept of what is an explicitly solvable classical or quantum mechanical system is best understood in terms of the symmetry of the system.  Engineering areas such as tomography and signal processing, including wavelets, radar, and sonar, are intimately bound up with harmonic analysis, the expansion and analysis of functions on groups.  This conference explores current developments and open problems in this important, multidisciplinary field.  The principal topics for the meeting are: Lie groups, quantum groups, representation theory, and special functions; Supersymmetry, superstrings, and quantum gravity; Integrability, nonlinear systems, and quantum chaos; Discrete systems and signal analysis; Foundations of quantum mechanics; Semigroups, time asymmetry, and resonances; Quantum computing; Linear and nonlinear optics; Nuclear, atomic, and molecular physics; Elementary particle physics; and Condensed matter and statistical physics.<br/>"

Although these projects seem quite different, they both involve the study of spaces of rational curves on varieties in a crucial way.  In the first problem, one can prove that a Fano manifold is not unirational by proving there are ""few"" rational curves on the space of rational curves on the manifold.  In the second problem, conjecturally, the condition is that the spaces of rational curves on the geometric generic fiber are themselves rationally connected.  <br/><br/>In complex algebraic geometry, the notion of a variety defined over a non-algebraically closed field is the common situation of a sequence of polynomial equations in variables x,y,z,... that depend on parameters s,t,u,... (which themselves may satisfy some polynomial equations).  A basic question is whether for each choice of parameters there is a solution of the equation of the form: x,y,z,... are quotients of polynomials in the parameters s,t,u,...  This is the problem of rational points.  Another question, in the case where the polynomials don't depend on parameters, is whether x,y,z,... can be written as polynomials in a set of free variables, a,b,c,... such that every choice of a,b,c,... gives a solution of the polynomials, and essentially every solution of the polynomials arises in this way.  This is the problem of unirationality.  Both are old, difficult problems with applications in algebraic geometry and number theory.

Over prime fields, the fundamental open questions involve cohomology and extensions of modules, and such questions are the focus of the project.  Of particular interest are two one-parameter families of subgroups associated to a reductive algebraic group - finite Chevalley groups and Frobenius kernels. Recent results have uncovered deep relationships between these two theories, and an underlying goal of the project is to strengthen these connections. Such relationships are of inherent theoretical interest and can be powerful computational tools for transferring information from one category to the other as well as to other areas.  Professor Bendel in partial collaboration with Daniel Nakano and Cornelius Pillen will build upon previous work of the trio to make computations of cohomology and extensions groups as well as support varieties, while seeking to extend known relationships.  Computations of ordinary Lie algebra cohomology for small primes, which have independent interest, will be used to meet these objectives.<br/><br/>Algebraic structures such as groups and Lie algebras arise naturally in a number of physical situations, for example in the symmetries found in natural phenomenon, and have been applied in biology, physics, chemistry, and computer science. In basic terms, a representation of a group (or Lie algebra) provides a geometric glimpse at the structure of the group. A typical group has many representations of varying sizes.  By better understanding the representations of a group, one can better understand the group and extract information for applications. One of the main objectives of this work is to investigate the fundamental question of how different representations can be combined to form new representations.  The principal investigator has been actively involved in promoting new mathematical ideas.  He is currently organizing a conference that relates representation theory to other algebraic and geometric areas.  At the local level, another objective of this project is to enhance the teaching and learning environment of the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department at the University of Wisconsin-Stout (a predominantly undergraduate institution) and to increase student interest in scientific research.

This work is motivated in part by the<br/>discovery of aperiodic tilings, such as the Penrose tilings of the<br/>plane by the kite and dart polygons, tilings which can be understood<br/>as solutions of such a packing problem. The symmetries of aperiodic<br/>tilings have long been connected with the mathematics of ergodic<br/>theory, using either the translation group or the full congruence<br/>group of the space being tiled as the dynamics. The symmetry of the<br/>tilings has then been related to the conjugacy class of the associated<br/>dynamical system. Several questions are proposed here about the<br/>symmetry of packing problems, some directed at general qualitative<br/>behavior and some directed at important special cases. For instance,<br/>it is proposed to show that the symmetry of the densest packings of a<br/>hyperbolic space by spheres of fixed radius is different for different<br/>radii. (It is already known that for most radii the densest packings<br/>are aperiodic - they cannot have crystallographic symmetry.)

Saltman<br/><br/>Fractions of integers, which we all learned about in the early grades,<br/>form a system called a ``field''. But this field is not large enough,<br/>since in this so called ``rational'' field you cannot take the square<br/>root of 2, or write down pi. It has become, therefore, a truism that we<br/>need to study all fields. But even the study of all fields is not<br/>encompassing enough, because in physics, or when using matrices, one<br/>finds one must study objects which are field-like, but which are<br/>noncommutative, meaning A times B might not equal B times A. Such<br/>objects are called division algebras. The question, in the largest<br/>sense, that this grant considers is the classification of all division<br/>algebras in terms of the better understood fields, with particular<br/>reference to the ``center'' of the division algebra, which is inside<br/>the division algebra and is a field. Coupled with the center is the<br/>``degree'' of a division algebra, which is a positive integer that<br/>measures how much bigger the division algebras is as compared to its<br/>center. Division algebras are an old subject, with a great deal of<br/>information known when the center is one dimensional. For example when<br/>the center is close to the rational field, any division algebra is<br/>known to be so called ``cyclic'', which means there is a very good<br/>description in terms of fields. The focus of this proposal is the study<br/>of division algebras whose centers have dimension 2. For example, a<br/>major focus is the case where the center comes from a curve over a<br/>p-adic field, a very special case of a 2 dimensional field. In this<br/>case, not all division algebras are cyclic, but the proposers hopes to<br/>use algebraic geometry to show that when the division algebra has<br/>degree a prime integer, and the center comes from a p-adic curve, then<br/>cyclicity does hold.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important tool in studying division algebras is Galois<br/>cohomology, because the set of all division algebras with fixed center<br/>F form a group isomorphic to the second Galois cohomology group with<br/>unit coefficients. Since second cohomology can be hard to compute,<br/>often one attacks this group by using ramification. In more detail, any<br/>discrete valuation defines a map to a first cohomology group, and by<br/>using all possible discrete valuations one hopes to capture the<br/>division algebras. In special cases this is known to work, for example<br/>for rational field or the fields arising from p-adic curves. In both<br/>cases, one shows, or hopes to show, cyclicity by showing there is a<br/>cyclic Galois extension which splits all the ramification of the<br/>division algebra. This leads to a more fundamental question. If D is a<br/>division algebra of prime degree, is there always a cyclic field<br/>extension, of the same degree, which at least splits all the<br/>ramification?<br/>"

Keel<br/><br/>The proposed research centers on the study of fundamental objects in mathematics and theoretic physics: moduli spaces of hyperplane arrangements, moduli spaces of curves, and moduli spaces of Abelian varieties. The research involves the application of basic ideas of Mori theory. For example the largest portion of the proposal, and the portion with the largest potential payoff has to do with finding a natural compactification of the<br/>moduli of hyperplane arrangements (i.e. moduli of ordered n-tuples of hyperplanes in projective space modulo automorphisms of the projective space) with reasonable singularities. This is of interest for example because the obvious compactifications -those that come from geometric invariant theory, have boundary with literally arbitrary singularities (all possible affine schemes occur as boundary strata), so a natural desingularisation would include a desingularisation of all singularities at once. The researcher makes the elementary observation that the moduli space of hyperplane arrangements is (log) minimal, and thus the main conjectures of Mori theory predict the existence of a canonical compactification, with reasonable boundary. The main question is to find this compactification.<br/><br/>The researcher proposes to consider the geometry of some of the basic parameterising spaces in mathematics -- the so-called moduli spaces of hyperplane arrangements, Riemann surfaces, and Abelian varieties. The unifying theme of the proposal is the application of fundamental ideas from one branch of geometry, Mori theory, to other branches, where the ideas have not yet been widely exploited. The simplest and potentially deepest example is in the first and main part of the proposal, where the researcher observes that Mori theory predicts the existence of an absolutely canonical object for the resolution of singularities -- one of the central problems in geometry.<br/><br/>"

Heitmann<br/><br/>In the study of local rings of equicharacteristic p, the tight closure has proved very useful.  This closure also extends nicely to local rings of equicharacteristic zero.  Unfortunately this closure does not naturally extend to mixed characteristic rings.  This project is designed to fill this void.  In earlier work, the principal investigator defined several variants of an extended plus closure.  As the name suggests, these closures, which coincide with tight closure in equicharacteristic p, are based upon the plus closure of an ideal, the set of elements which are in the extension of the ideal in some integral extension of the original ring.  In the earlier work, a number of properties of these closures were demonstrated.  Most notably, the principal investigator has demonstrated that the colon-capturing property implies that ideals in regular rings are closed and also that the colon-capturing property does in fact hold in dimension three.  Hence the Direct Summand Conjecture is a theorem in dimension three.  The primary objective of the current project is to extend these results to dimension four and above.  A completely successful program would establish that one of these extended plus closures - or a close relative - satisfies all of the requirements suggested by Huneke for a mixed characteristic analog of tight closure.   In addition to those properties already mentioned, the most notable is the persistence property, the property that elements in the closure of an ideal remain in the closure when a homomorphism is applied to the ring.  An additional objective is a theory of test elements that mimics the corresponding theory for tight closure. <br/><br/>One of the most fundamental subjects in algebra is the understanding of the concepts of ""ideals"" and ""modules"" in local rings.  For those local rings that contain a field, the notion of tight closure has evolved as a way to give a unified presentation - and a simplified one - for many of the known properties of these objects.  As a natural byproduct, it has led to the discovery of new properties.  Understanding of local rings that do not contain a field has always lagged behind.

These candidates have already led to one significant new result.  In this project, the investigator will continue his efforts to determine to what extent the new closures fill the void. <br/>"

It is known that for low g this space behaves <br/>very much like a projective space which means that one can <br/>describe explicitly most curves of given genus. However for g <br/>large the nature of M(g) changes completely and the investigator <br/>studies this transition by constructing new loci in the moduli <br/>space, which are of a completely different nature than those <br/>studied by previous mathematicians. The geometry of these new <br/>loci strongly suggests  that the transition in the nature of <br/>M(g) appears much earlier than the leading conjecture in the <br/>field has predicted. The technical machinery developed by the <br/>investigator to solve this problem is also employed to study <br/>some open problems about vector bundles on general curves of <br/>genus g.  A different project concerns the moduli space of <br/>pointed curves of genus 0.  Obects of striking beauty, these <br/>spaces are important because of their pivotal role in new <br/>developments in enumerative geometry and because often <br/>statements about curves of arbitrary genus can be reduced to <br/>questions about pointed curves of genus 0. The investigator <br/>studies several invariants of these spaces and the proposed <br/>approach has been succesful in low dimensional cases. <br/><br/>Algebraic curves are ubiquitous objects in mathematics. They <br/>appear in complex analysis (as Riemann surfaces), in algebra <br/>(as field extensions) and in algebraic geometry (as curves in <br/>projective spaces).  The most important problem in algebraic <br/>geometry is to classify algebraic varieties. For one-dimensional <br/>varieties (that is, for algebraic curves) this problem is <br/>approached by considering the moduli space M(g) of all curves of <br/>given genus. This is the universal parameter space for curves of <br/>fixed genus and interest in its geometry comes from fields as <br/>diverse as algebraic geometry, theoretical physics, number theory <br/>or coding theory. By understanding this space not only can we <br/>learn about families of curves but quite often the moduli space <br/>itself has beautiful geometric and arithmetic properties which <br/>one cannot expect to find on an arbitrary space.  <br/>"

The problem of quantization of coisson algebras is posed by A. Beilinson and V. Drinfeld; they found a rather non-trivial solution to this problem in a particular case  of linear coisson brackets. The general quantization problem is much harder and is not accessible by similar methods. An appropriate tool may be the deformation theory and introduction of an additional structure on an appropriate deformation complex.<br/><br/>The Batalin-Vilkovitsky formalism is one of the most powerful tools in quantization of systems with sophisticated gauge symmetries. This formalism implies an extensive use of path integrals, whence the lack of mathematical meaning of the most important ingredients of the construction, such as the operator $\Delta$ and the $BV$-bracket. The difficulty in defining path integrals are well known, a straightforward extension of usual (finitely-dimensional) integration rules necessarily leads to divergencies. It is  only a careful analysis of Batalin-Vilkovitski formalism involving a theory of D-modules and homological algebra that can allow one to construct a mathematically meaningful theory.<br/><br/><br/>The action of Grothendieck-Teichmueller group is known to be present on the set of quantization functors of Lie bialgebras as well as on the set of formality quasi-isomorphisms from Kontsevich's formality theorem. This fascinated subject was originated by V. Drinfeld and was further developed by P.Etingof-D. Kazhdan, M. Kontsevich and other authors.   Yet there are several open questions  concerning this action on the space of formality quasi-isomorphisms, namely, whether it is transitive or free in a certain homotopical sense. I hope that  studying these problems should deepen our understanding of algebro-geometric and motivic aspects of quantization.<br/><br/><br/>"

The algebraic<br/>structures under investigation include  symmetric groups and<br/>Weyl groups, the finite general linear group and other finite<br/>Chevalley groups, partition algebras, and Hecke algebras.<br/>These structures often come as pairs acting on vector spaces<br/>and commuting with each other; for example the symmetric group<br/>and the partition algebra commute with each other on tensor<br/>space and a  Chevalley group and its Hecke algebra commute on<br/>a flag variety.

Its goal is to bring together researchers from a broad spectrum of mathematics all of which are strongly intertwined with invariant theory. The distinguished lectures will be delivered by Roger Howe, Peter Olver, Karen Parshall, Vladimir Popov, David Wehlau, and Clarence Wilkerson. The symposium will focus on the universality of invariant theory. It will show that invariant theoretic questions occur in a wide range of mathematics, e.g., in commutative and homological algebra, Lie theory, algebraic topology, combinatorics, geometry, coding theory, and mathematical physics. These fields pose often challenging problems to invariant theory, and vice versa: results in invariant theory nurture its neighboring fields. The Red Raider Symposium 2004 provides a forum to shed light on these interactions. <br/>The Red Raider Symposia are highly multidisciplinary. This concept will initiate new collaborations, and will greatly contribute to the scientific development of graduate students and early career mathematicians who will have the opportunity to interact with some of the most outstanding leaders in their field and to learn about research problems that represent the frontiers of the field.

In the first part the investigator and his colleagues study the asymptotic affine Hecke algebra introduced by G. Lusztig.  The asymptotic Hecke algebra is a suitable limit of the usual Hecke algebra as parameter tends to zero.  Its representation theory is closely related with representation theory of the Hecke algebra itself.  One of the aims here is a proof of Lusztig's Conjecture describing the asymptotic Hecke algebra in the elementary K-theoretic terms.  In the second part the investigator studies module categories over monoidal categories.  This subject is closely related with modern physics where module categories appear in the context of the Boundary Conformal Field Theory.  In the third part the investigator and collaborators study distinguished involutions in the affine Weyl group.  In particular they make extensive explicit calculations of canonical distinguished involutions in number of cases.  In the fourth part the investigator and his colleagues study the Double Affine Hecke Algebra.  The aim here is to describe Intersection Cohomology of certain infinite dimensional algebraic varieties in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig type combinatorics of this algebra.<br/><br/>In this proposal the investigator studies various questions of Representation Theory. Representation Theory is a part of mathematics that studies all possible ways in which symmetry can be used for solving concrete physical or technical problems.  Many physical and technical systems do not change under some transformations (e.g. the gravitational field of the Sun depends only on the distance from the Sun and so it does not change under rotating of the space around the Sun).  Such transformations are called symmetries of the system.  In many cases symmetries can be used to simplify the study of such systems.  So it is not surprising that Representation Theory has many applications in physics (where continuous symmetry is one of the most fundamental concepts), chemistry (especially in quantum chemistry where it is used in computations of chemical forces inside molecules), computer science (for example, Fourier analysis, which can be considered as a simplest case of Representation Theory, is one of the most widely used of all calculation techniques), and inside of mathematics itself, in number theory (where Representation Theory is an essential part of the Langlands program). One of the central objects of study in Representation  Theory is the affine Hecke algebra, because answers to many seemingly unrelated questions are encoded in the structure of this algebra.  This proposal is mainly devoted to the study of the affine Hecke algebra.<br/><br/>"

A rich source of representations for such groups is the p-adic cohomology of algebraic varieties. The Fontaine-Mazur conjecture predicts precisely which p-adic Galois representations ought to arise in this way. What is remarkable about the conjecture is that the most subtle condition in its formulation involves only the restriction of the Galois representation to the decomposition groups of primes above p. In certain situations Fontaine-Mazur combine their philosophy with that of Langlands, and predict which Galois representations come from modular eigenforms. A few years ago Coleman and Mazur, building on work of Hida, discovered that modular eigenforms tend to move in p-adic families. The aim of the project is to approach the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture using the geometry of these families, and corresponding families of Galois representations: The modularity of some Galois representations can be proved following ideas of Wiles and Taylor-Wiles, and then one hopes to deduce the modularity of the rest by p-adic interpolation style arguments.<br/><br/>Almost ten years ago Wiles proved Fermat's Last Theorem. He did this by relating elliptic curves to modular forms. The latter are complex functions which admit an incredibly large number of symmetries. Wiles' breakthrough involved the use of the p-adic Galois representation attached to an elliptic curve. His result can be viewed as a special case of a more general philosophy due to Fontaine and Mazur, which predicts that a certain class of p-adic Galois representations always arise from modular forms. My aim is to approach this conjecture by exploiting the fact discovered by Hida and Coleman-Mazur - that modular forms tend to move in p-adic families. This is rather surprising given that they are complex valued functions. It serves as a striking illustration that although modular forms are defined as analytic objects, they are of a profoundly arithmetic nature.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

These are rather complicated analytic varieties, which in most of the cases have infinite topological type.  However in all known cases these varieties are holomorphically convex and there are results establishing this fact for a broad range of projective varieties.  The proofs usually exploit the properties of representations of the fundamental group of the initial variety.  The objective is to establish a realistic version of holomorphic convexity conjecture for these universal coverings.  Though holomoprhic convexity of the universal coverings was proved in many important cases the PI proposes to show the existence of such coverings containing infinite chains of compact curves thus violating holomoprhic convexity.  For varieties defined over finite fields PI focus is to establish the analogue of Torelli theorem for the projective curves of genus greather than 1 defined over finite field.Namely every such curve has an imbedding into a torsion group of points of it's jacobian.  The latter is an inifinite torsion group, which depends (almost) only on the genus of the initial curve as an abstract group. Thus the image of the curve in jacobian provides with an infinite subset of points in this standard torsion group consisting of all points of the curve over algebraic closure of the finite field.  The objective is to show that this set theoretic image defines the curve completely as an algebraic object.<br/><br/>The proposed research here lies at the interface of algebraic geometry, number theory, group theory and topology. The PI will study different aspects of the geometry of algebraic varieties defined over algebraically closed fields.  For algebraic curves defined over number fields the research will focus on finding a minimal class of curves (conjecturally one curve) with the property that nonramified coverings of curves from the class dominate all the other curves defined over algebraic numbers.   Bely's theorem indicated that the geometry of algebraic varieties defined over number fields substantially differs from the geometry of generic algebraic varieties over complex numbers.  The long-term objective is to find a precise formulation for this phenomenon.<br/>"

The Principal Investigator proposes to find provable variants of the AKS test that achieve its heuristic complexity, and do so with effectively computable tools in analytic number theory.  In addition, the Principal Investigator proposes to study normal cycle lengths and the normal number of cycles of certain commonly used pseudorandom number generators. More theoretical problems include gaps between primes in a polynomial sequence, equations involving primitive roots, and the number of divisors of a multiplicative function. The Principal Investigator has plans to write a monograph on primality testing based on a graduate-level course he recently taught at Dartmouth College.<br/><br/>Concerning broader impacts of the proposed research, the fields of cryptology and information security depend heavily on algorithmic number theory, and fundamental advances in the latter field are of intense interest in the former. In fact, the naturally conservative field of information security would perhaps prefer that there not be any more fundamental advances in algorithmic number theory. That they still can occur at this late date may cause the security field to rethink and broaden the underpinnings of their subject.  The study of pseudorandom number generators has many applications to cryptology and numerical analysis.  Surprisingly, we don't know the typical cycle length or the typical number of cycles for certain basic and commonly-used generators, a topic addressed by this proposal. The theoretical topics that will be considered deal with certain basic and natural questions connected with prime numbers, and some of these problems may well lead to practical applications.  For example, primitive roots are also closely connected to the field of cryptology, and a deeper understanding of the possible relationships among them is of fundamental interest.<br/>"

Effective methods make use of modular equations, the distribution of the zeroes of the zeta function, the Hasse-Witt matrix, approximation of Euler products, optimized algorithms, and others. The second part concerns with the Weil descent methodology for elliptic curves or other Galois descent methods. The Weil descent methodology is a means to reduce the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) over composite finite fields to the discrete logarithm problem in an abelian variety over a proper subfield. This leads to an effective method of reducing any instance of the ECDLP over a finite field to an instance of the discrete logarithm problem in the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve over a subfield. Since subexponential-time algorithms for the latter problem are known, this shows how important the method is for cracking certain elliptic curve cryptographic schemes.  Similar ideas are applicable for curves of genus bigger than one.<br/><br/>The proposed research belongs to the interface between number theory and algebraic geometry.

R. Goodearl<br/><br/>The Principal Investigator proposes to continue his investigations<br/>into the structure of various classes of noncommutative rings,<br/>particularly quantum coordinate rings (quantized algebras of<br/>functions) and related algebras, with a focus on geometric aspects of<br/>noncommutative rings and ring-theoretic aspects of noncommutative<br/>algebraic geometry. The proposed projects, located within<br/>noncommutative algebra, will build up the infrastructure of and<br/>interconnections among active parts of several related areas -- ring<br/>theory, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and quantum groups. Roughly<br/>speaking, the long-term goals framing many of these projects stem from<br/>noncommutative algebraic geometry, and the basic examples come from<br/>quantum groups, while many lines of approach are recruited from ring<br/>theory. The main focus will be on algebraic and geometric features of<br/>the prime and primitive spectra of quantized coordinate rings. The<br/>goals include classification of prime ideals, finiteness conditions<br/>for prime ideals invariant under tori of automorphisms, verification of<br/>supporting properties such as Auslander-regularity and<br/>Cohen-Macaulayness, and presentations of quantized prime or primitive<br/>spectra as topological quotients of classical spectra or varieties.<br/><br/>A pervasive theme in the mathematical study of geometric objects is<br/>that the properties of these objects are completely encoded in the<br/>functions on them, and are often more accessible via these functions<br/>than directly. Within algebraic geometry -- the study of geometric<br/>spaces defined by polynomial equations -- it is the polynomial<br/>functions on a space that determine it. These functions form a ring (a<br/>system endowed with compatible addition and multiplication operations)<br/>which is, moreover, commutative (fg = gf always). In the 1980s,<br/>researchers in the former Soviet Union, in the process of solving<br/>certain problems in theoretical quantum physics, discovered rings<br/>which appear to enjoy all the structure of rings of functions on<br/>geometric spaces, except that the multiplication is noncommutative. In<br/>honor of their origins in quantum theory, these rings are now called<br/>""quantized coordinate rings."" It proved very useful to treat them as<br/>if they were rings of functions (except for the noncommutativity), and<br/>the guiding principle in their study became the search for<br/>""noncommutative versions of the geometry."" Sufficiently many common<br/>phenomena (both geometric and algebraic) have been discovered in a wide<br/>range of quantized coordinate rings to lead one to conjecture that<br/>general, axiomatizable underpinnings within this class of rings are<br/>responsible for the parallels in their behavior. The main long-term<br/>thrust of the PI's research is to uncover such general structures and<br/>decode their geometric content. In the medium term, the proposal aims<br/>to extend the range of known shared phenomena within this class of<br/>rings, in order to gain better insight into their common base.<br/>"

This theory has<br/>led to very many important geometric & representation-theoretic<br/>consequences.  The principal investigator's recent research shows that once<br/>there is a good SMT for an algebraic variety, much information could be<br/>inferred about the variety (using SMT); for instance, SMT throws light on<br/>the degenerations of the variety.

This is finite-dimensional and can be compactified like a space of stable maps, allowing Gromov-Witten invariants of loop groups to be defined and calculated.  This should allow a fruitful generalization of the very active field of quantum cohomology of homogeneous spaces to the infinite-dimensional setting of affine Lie groups.  Another variation of quantum cohomology is the stringy or orbifold cohomology of Chen-Ruan: a version of the Weil conjectures for this theory will be sought, and the role of a B-field or grebe investigated.  Yet another is the quantum Riemann-Roch theory recently developed by Coates, which will be applied to symmetric products of curves.<br/><br/>This is research in algebraic geometry, one of the most classical parts of mathematics, concerned with finding solutions of polynomial equations.

The Number Theory part of Special Year 2004-05 <br/>will be highlighted by two conferences: (i) An International Conference <br/>on Additive Number Theory in November 2004, and (ii) An International <br/>Conference on Arithmetic Geometry in February 2005. The highlight of <br/>the Combinatorics part of the Special Year Program will be (iii) A <br/>Workshop on Automated Deduction in Geometry in September 2004, and <br/>(iv) The Third International Conference on Pattern Avoiding<br/>Permutations in March 2005. There are plans to publish the refereed<br/>proceedings of these conferences. Topics for these conferences have <br/>been chosen from areas of our research strengths but involve broader <br/>themes. The conferences will be augmented by lectures throughout <br/>the year on the latest trends in research by eminent visiting <br/>mathematicians, as well as History Lectures which should appeal <br/>to students.  The Additive Number Theory Conference will involve<br/>three main themes:   partitions and q-series; Goldbach, Waring type problems, <br/>and sieves; and basis and density questions. The Arithmetic Geometry <br/>Conference will be devoted to p-adic methods in arithmetic and algebraic <br/>geometry.  Automated Deduction in Geometry Workshop will be a forum to <br/>exchange ideas and views, to present research results and progress, <br/>and to demonstrate software tools on the intersection between geometry <br/>and automated deduction.  The Conference on Pattern Avoiding Permutations <br/>is on the exact and asymptotic enumeration and structural analysis, <br/>of permutations with subsequence conditions. This area is connected <br/>to the theory of Young tableaux, labeled trees, partially ordered sets, <br/>and planar maps, as well as sorting and searching.<br/><br/><br/>    The Special Year Program in Number Theory and Combinatorics  <br/>will be of interest even to researchers outside of mathematics and <br/>therefore will strengthen ties with other disciplines. Number Theory is <br/>the study of the properties of whole numbers and is the oldest branch <br/>of mathematics.  Topics such as partitions, elliptic curves, and <br/>cryptography, covered by our conferences in number theory will be <br/>of interest to physicists and those in computer science.  Combinatorics is <br/>the study of discrete collections of objects, and how they can be arranged<br/>and counted efficiently.  The areas covered by the conferences in <br/>combinatorics will be of appeal to computer and engineering sciences. <br/>Number Theory and Combinatorics are ideally suited to attract the attention of <br/>non-experts and students to significant developments in mathematics. <br/>Thus the History Lectures in these areas will inform graduate and <br/>undergraduate students as to how fundamental ideas and concepts <br/>developed, and this in turn will help in attracting talented <br/>students to take to more advanced study in mathematics.     <br/>"

The proposed research deals with certain singularities of algebraic varieties and log pairs, including ones that appear in the Log Minimal Model Program (LMMP). Their most fundamental characteristics, such as discrepancies, thresholds, and complements, are investigated with an aim to apply them to the LMMP in dimensions 4 and higher. This process is set forth by some new and old conjectures. PI Shokurov intends to finish the log termination for 4-folds, which completes the LMMP in dimension 4, and to obtain new results in dimensions 5 and higher. It is expected that some fundamental results on singularities must precede the<br/>LMMP, but other results, more advanced, could be interwoven. It is proposed to clarify this situation and the relations between known and new concepts, methods, and conjectures in the field of algebraic geometry toward better understanding of the LMMP within its environment. The focus will be on discrepancies, thresholds, lengths of extremal rays, the Alexeev-Borisovs and acc type conjectures, and on confinement of saturated linear systems.<br/><br/>This is research in the field of algebra with methods and applications in algebraic geometry. A termination for flips or flops, an important class of standard transformation of geometrical objects, means finiteness of any sequence of those transformations, and effectiveness of corresponding geometrical algorithm from the computational point of view. Algebra and algebraic geometry are very old, traditional areas of modern mathematics, but which have had a revolutionary flowering in the past decades. In its origin, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials, or be given in the 3-space by the simplest geometric constructions, e.g., conic sections.  Algebra is about these equations. Both fields interacts with most of branches of mathematics, e.g., analysis, topology and mathematical physics, with applications in those fields as well as in number theory, physics, discrete and computational mathematics, and robotics.<br/>"

This is joint work with S. Friedberg. Our plan is to use Bessel models to play the role Whittaker models play in the generic case. This work should lead in the direction of establishing the automorphic transfer of cusp forms from classical to general linear groups, generalizing the generic case established by Cogdell - Kim - Piatetski-Shapiro - Shahidi. It should also allow for the completion of the work of Jiang - Soudry on the local Langlands correspondence for special orthogonal groups of odd dimension. Even establishing the transfer in low rank cases would give significant results. For example, we anticipate results on Hilbert-Modular forms with trivial central character from the most primitive example. In the course of this project we expect to address the local theory for the Archimedean case, as well as refining our earlier results in the non-Archimedean case. Additional goals of this project are to understand the poles of intertwining operators for maximal parabolic subgroups of quasi-split reductive groups over non-Archimedean fields (joint with F. Shahidi), construction of types, in the sense of Bushnell - Kutzko for the non-cuspidal spectrum of classical groups over non-Archimedean fields (joint with P. Kutzko and S. Stevens), and understanding reducibility of parabolically induced representations of Spin groups over non-Archimedean fields via Knapp - Stein theory. <br/><br/>Among the most powerful results in mathematics are those that display a connection between seemingly disparate ideas. These connections tend to improve our understanding of both ideas, and are interesting both as a matter of philosophy and application. For example, the power of Calculus lies not in our understanding of differential and integral calculus separately, but in the connection between the two via the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. This is what lends the subject to the myriad applications which have impacted upon society, but also makes the subject a great achievement in human thought. This project is designed to address certain problems within what is known as the Langlands Program, which seeks to unify three major areas within mathematics. Namely, Number Theory, Harmonic Analysis, and Algebraic Geometry. Our work concentrates on one aspect of the conjectural connection between the first two areas. Tremendous progress has been made in recent years, and we hope to contribute to furthering our understanding of these subjects. This project will have broader impact not only through its contribution to mathematics (and more specifically number theory), but through raising the level of research at a public university with a diverse student population. <br/><br/>"

The proposed projects are: 1) the study of higher Massey products on derived categories of coherent sheaves on projective varieties; 2) the determination of the rings of algebraic cycles on Jacobians of curves modulo algebraic equivalence; 3) the study of intersection theory on the moduli spaces of higher spin curves in connection with the generalized Witten's conjecture; 4) the study of categories of holomorphic vector bundles on noncommutative tori; 5) the study of minimal representations of p-adic groups and their relation with the theory of automorphic forms.<br/><br/>A significant part of this proposal is motivated by mathematical conjectures originating from physics. In particular, one of the five projects is motivated by a conjecture of Kontsevich, the ""homological mirror conjecture"", which is an attempt to give a mathematical foundation to mirror symmetry phenomena discovered in string theory. Another of the projects is devoted to the study of geometric objects relevant for a certain conjecture of Witten in connection with the theory of gravity. From a mathematical point of view, this proposal belongs to the fields of algebraic geometry and representation theory. Algebraic geometry is the part of mathematics studying geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. The richness of this area is due to the fact that it combines algebraic techniques with geometric intuition. Representation theory is essentially the study of symmetries given by linear transformations. Because of the ubiquity of symmetries of this type, representation theory is relevant for many other fields, including number theory and physics.<br/><br/>"

He will especially work on such congruences between  Eisenstein series and cusp forms as in the works by Mazur-Wiles or in his  work on the main conjecture for the symmetric square of an ordinary elliptic curve. In that direction, the PI will continue his joint work in progress with C. Skinner proving the Iwasawa main conjecture for elliptic curves via the study of the Eisenstein ideal for U(2,2). He also plans to guide some Ph-D students on a similar topic for some other unitary groups.  The PI will also work on the theory of p-adic families of automorphic forms for general reductive groups by both geometric and topological approaches. This work will be undertaken for its own interest but also because the study of such  congruences for Eisenstein series has numerous powerful applications. By these means, Urban plans to obtain some new and general constructions of certain arithmetical fundamental objects as for instance $p$-adic Euler systems that will be an essential tool to bound above the size of some Selmer groups.<br/><br/>Urban's research field is the arithmetic theory of automorphic forms.  Those are certain holomorphic functions having many symmetries and whose deep arithmetical properties are read from their Fourier coefficients. These objects play a fundamental role in number theory as their study has been very fruitful in the last two decades, leading A. Wiles to the proof of the Fermat's last theorem. The ultimate goal of the inverstigator's research is to relate two apparently unrelated objects which are the special values of L-functions (a meromorphic function on the complex planes associated to an automorphic form) and the order of certain Selmer groups (a generalization of the class group of a number field) via the study of congruences between automorphic forms. One of the main tools that will be used in Urban's investigation is the theory of p-adic modular forms, a theory that encodes all the congruences between modular forms modulo arbitrary high powers of a given prime number p. He will develop new aspects of this theory for general reductive groups and apply it to relevant modular forms called Eisenstein series whose constant terms carry information on critical L-values. Among other things, the results of this research will also have some important implications to the p-adic and classical conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer that are major conjectures on the set of solutions of cubic equations in two variables<br/><br/><br/>"

The first project is concerned<br/>with several concrete aspects of Schubert calculus on generalized flag<br/>varieties. Its goal is to find combinatorial formulas for expressing the product<br/>of two Schubert classes (in cohomology) in the basis of Schubert classes; this<br/>is equivalent to counting points in a suitable triple intersection of Schubert<br/>varieties. The emphasis will be on the multiplication rule in the cohomology of<br/>the variety of complete flags in complex space. Many different approaches have<br/>been used in this area, but the only manifestly positive formulas that exist are<br/>limited to some easier special cases. The second project is concerned with the<br/>development of a simple combinatorial model (recently introduced by the<br/>investigator in collaboration with A. Postnikov) for the representation theory<br/>of complex semisimple Lie groups, as well as for the Chevalley-type<br/>multiplication formula in the equivariant K-theory of the corresponding<br/>generalized flag variety. The construction is based on combinatorics of<br/>decompositions in the corresponding affine Weyl group and enumeration of<br/>saturated chains in the Bruhat order on the (nonaffine) Weyl group. This model<br/>has several advantages over other combinatorial structures in the area, such as<br/>various specializations of the Littelmann path model. The new model will be<br/>extended in several directions, such as: the representation theory of Kac-Moody<br/>algebras, standard monomial theory, and the quantum K-theory of flag varieties.<br/>The connections with other models and a deeper study of the combinatorics<br/>involved will also be pursued. The third project is concerned with a<br/>combinatorial study of certain formal group laws related to topology. The main<br/>application is to certain immersion problems for lens spaces and projective<br/>spaces.<br/><br/>A unifying theme of the projects outlined here is the emphasis on combinatorics<br/>and computation. During the last decades, computation has gained an important<br/>role in mathematical research. This stimulated the development of combinatorics,<br/>as it became clear that combinatorial structures are particularly well suited<br/>for encoding complex mathematical objects, while combinatorial methods are well<br/>suited for related computations. This research plan is part of the ongoing<br/>effort to perform concrete computations, based on combinatorial structures. One<br/>of the main objects of study are generalized flag varieties. Although these are<br/>classical varieties, they feature prominently in current mathematical research<br/>due to their remarkable combinatorial complexity and the subtle interplay<br/>between various areas related to them. Examples of such areas relevant to the<br/>projects in this plan are: enumerative geometry (concerned with problems such as<br/>counting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection<br/>conditions, which are equivalent to performing certain cohomology calculations),<br/>and the geometric construction of representations of Lie groups (and, more<br/>generally, Kac-Moody groups). Flag varieties also provide a useful testbed for<br/>the development of combinatorial models relevant to computations in various<br/>cohomology theories of certain projective varieties.<br/>"

These topics are linked by a common theme:  a new perspective on Gromov--Witten theory, introduced by Givental, which reveals surprising connections with symplectic linear algebra, geometric quantization and the theory of loop groups.  One objective of this research is to understand the geometric origin of the structures revealed by this point of view; the second and main objective is to apply the new computational tools that this perspective provides:  1. To the calculation of Gromov--Witten invariants of symplectic quotients; 2. To the computation of higher-genus Gromov--Witten invariants; 3. To the structure theory of non-semisimple Frobenius manifolds; and 4.  To various structural and computational questions in quantum K-theory and quantum extraordinary cohomology.<br/><br/>Gromov--Witten invariants have been studied intensively for the past decade in an effort to understand some of the mathematical consequences ofstring theory.  As a string moves through space, it sweeps out a surface: the Gromov--Witten invariants of a space describe the number of these surfaces in the space which satisfy certain conditions --- for example,<br/>one could insist that the surfaces pass through a number of different points, or that they intersect with a particular curve.  Gromov-Witten invariants give important information about the shape of a space.  They play a vital role in Mirror Symmetry, a circle of ideas which expresses in mathematical form the equivalence of two different string theories.<br/>Mirror symmetry suggests that we can count surfaces in a space X (i.e. compute Gromov--Witten invariants of X) by studying differential equations on a space X' called the mirror of X.  This is interesting from the point of view of both mathematics and physics:  mathematicians had studied surface-counting and solving differential equations for more than a century without realising that the subjects had anything to do with one other, and some of the most convincing evidence for string theory to date comes not from experiment but from the gradual verification of its mathematical predictions.<br/><br/>"

More specifically, we concentrate on issues of existential/Diophantine definability that have evolved from the solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem.  The main open problems in the area concern the existential decidability of rational numbers and rings of algebraic integers of number fields.  New methods involving elliptic curves have shown promise in making these problems more approachable.  We also investigate existential definability over function fields.  In the case of function fields of characteristic 0 we also look at first-order definability problems since the corresponding existential definability problems seem out of reach at the moment.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>The interest in the questions of Diophantine definability and decidability dates back to the time of the solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem (HTP).  At the beginning of the XX century Hilbert asked the following question (among others): is there an algorithm that can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables and with integer coefficients has integer solutions? In the early 1970's, Yurii Matijasevich, building on the work by Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson showed that Diophantine sets and computably enumerable sets of integers were the same and thus showed that an algorithm sought by Hilbert did not exist. Matijasevich's result immediately raised another question which proved to be even more vexing: is there an algorithm as described above but for the solutions in rational numbers?  This problem is unsolved to this day. As is often the case with difficult problems in Mathematics, HTP for rational numbers as well as its sister problem, HTP for the rings of integers of number fields, generated many new questions, quite interesting on their own, which the author of this proposal plans to investigate.  Some of these questions turned out to be questions of Number Theory or Algebraic Geometry, but they in turn generated quite interesting consequences in Logic.  The expectations are that questions originating in HTP will generate many new areas of interaction between Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry and Logic.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>"

Some examples are sets of values x having an (x,y)<br/>with entries in the field that satisfy the relation. One of these is the<br/>Davenport's problem of determining equivalence classes of polynomials<br/>according to their value sets over finite fields. Describing complex<br/>multiplication fields, generated by those x with (x,y) a special<br/>elliptic curve torsion point, is a variant. A relation with a data<br/>variable x produces a permutation group G: The Galois group. The<br/>investigator treats these as cases of the Inverse Galois<br/>Problem (IGP). One goal is to decide, from certain lists<br/>of relations, if some have the rational numbers as definition field.<br/>Serious group theory helped solve Davenport's 1965 problem and Schur's<br/>exceptional polynomial problem (1919; see below). Further, modular<br/>curves reveal complex multiplication to be a version of Schur's<br/>problem. Having command of all finite simple groups has many<br/>applications. One is to list those groups attached to exceptional<br/>polynomials. Knowing many characters of Chevalley groups showed Thompson<br/>and Voelklein where to find series of solutions to the IGP. Yet, it will<br/>require more than massive group theory to solve the whole IGP. The<br/>investigator uses Modular Towers, a modular curve generalization, to<br/>finesse unknowable group classifications. He and his students let a<br/>known group G, and a prime p dividing the order of G, seed the base level<br/>of a Modular Tower. Higher tower levels code relations with mysterious<br/>groups covering G related to p. Coherent maps between the tower levels<br/>replace details on these intricate covering groups. Work of Y. Ihara and<br/>J.P. Serre inspire showing that Modular Towers has many properties of<br/>their special, modular curve, case. For example, high tower levels for a<br/>G with no Z/p quotient should have no rational points. For certain groups G, <br/>and the prime p=2, this extends Serre's program on spin structures. The <br/>investigator applies new spin-like structures to all cases when p is 2 and <br/>to all primes p. <br/><br/>PRACTICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY AND IGP OVER FINITE FIELDS: Modern cryptosystems<br/>aim to secure electronic transfers of data. Exceptional functions act as<br/>permutations on infinitely many finite fields. A special case of the<br/>Inverse Galois Problem over finite fields asks how to construct<br/>exceptional functions. These scrambling functions look simple. Users can<br/>easily apply them (up to 1993, all came from the 19th century). Still,<br/>finding them has been difficult. Fried (UCI), Guralnick (USC) and Saxl<br/>(Cambridge) nearly classify them. This solves old problems (Dickson 1896<br/>and Carlitz 1965). They also produce unexpected new examples. Their best<br/>discovery is that exceptional polyomial Galois groups (excluding now<br/>well-understood cases) have the affine geometric property. This is<br/>useful for it gives the degrees of exceptional polynomials. Yet, it is<br/>also a difficult challenge: There can be no final description of all<br/>affine groups. The investigator with A. Mezard approaches affine groups<br/>by generalizing to all algebraic relations over finite fields<br/>Grothendieck's famous results for tame relations. Applications for<br/>exceptional functions alone include ways to manipulate data for<br/>encryption and to assure integrity. This will mean faster, more<br/>efficient and accurate file back-ups; more stable software; and more<br/>secure data transfers.<br/><br/>"

Professor Goncharov investigates the higher quantum Teichmuller theory, which studies some new moduli spaces of G-local systems on a surface S, where G is a split reductive group,  and its non-commutative deformations. This theory unites many different aspects of the representation theory which appear when S is simple but the group is general, and the classical Teichmuller theory corresponding to the case when G is the simplest possible, that is the group of two by two matrices, while S is general.  The quantisation of these moduli spaces is governed by the motivic and quantum dilogarithms, and thus provides an example of fruitful relationship between mixed motives and mathematical physics. <br/><br/> <br/>This research is in the area of arithmetic algebraic geometry, which is the branch of mathematics that is concerned with questions about the integers, but approaches them using the ideas coming from investigation of geometric shapes.

Szczesny<br/><br/>The principal investigator proposes four projects relating conformal field theory, vertex algebras, and algebraic geometry. The first one concerns orbifolds of the chiral de Rham complex and their relation to Chen-Ruan's orbifold cohomology. More precisely, the PI proposes to understand the product structure on orbifold cohomology in terms of the orbifold chiral de Rham complex.  The second (with E. Frenkel and R. Donagi) relates spaces of twisted conformal blocks and D-modules on generalized Prym varieties. The third project involves the construction and study of sheaves of orbifold conformal blocks over the stack of pointed G--covers. The objective here is to obtain an orbifold CFT generalization of the KZ equations. Finally, the last project (with L. Borisov) is concerned with a non-chiral generalization of the chiral de Rham complex. The aim is to construct, for each Calabi-Yau manifold M, a sheaf of non-chiral vertex algebras in the sense of Kapustin-Orlov, which computes the (2,2)-sigma model with target M. This construction should have complexified Kahler dependence.<br/><br/>The purpose of these projects is to apply ideas in conformal field theory (CFT) ( a type of quantum field theory) to algebraic geometry. This has already been done successfully in the case of ordinary conformal field theories, leading to a large number of beautiful results. Most of the above projects are concerned with so called orbifold models, which arise when the CFT has additional discrete symmetries. In this case, the connections with algebraic geometry have not been fully explored, and the PI wants to extend some of the geometric results already known in the case of ordinary CFT's to the orbifold setting. The last of the projects proposed above focuses on rigorously defining and constructing an important quantum field theory, called the sigma model. So far, only a partial construction of ""half"" the theory exists.<br/><br/>"

The first part of this project is centered around the Hecke orbit conjecture for good reductions of Shimura variety, formulated by Oort, which states that the Zariski closure of a prime-to-p Hecke orbit is equal to the Zariski closure of a leaf. Partly in collaboration with his collaborators, F. Oort and C.-F. Yu, Chai has developed several techniques toward the Hecke orbit conjecture, and also formulated a plan to prove the Hecke orbit conjecture for the moduli space of abelian varieties.

A main objective of this proposal is a detailed exposition of that proof, as well as further development of the method for future applications. Also will be explored is the Hecke orbit problem for Shimura varieties attached to unitary groups.  The focus of the second part is a numerical invariant of semiabelian varieties over local fields, called the base change conductor, defined using the Neron models. The goal here is to understand the behavior of the base change conductor when the residue field is not perfect, and to explore the foundational properties of formal Neron models of rigid analytic spaces.<br/><br/>The first part of this project studies the of symmetries on a very special class of polynomial equations. This class of polynomial equations, called Shimura varieties, are of central importance in Number Theory. Conjecturally, these symmetries characterize a structure, called ""foliation"", on Shimura varieties.  The proposal is to develop and document a recently conceived proof of this conjecture. The second part of this project deals with another aspect of system of polynomial equations, on the drop of the level of complexity of a system of equation when more general numbers are allowed to be used for solutions.  This project is expected to enhance our knowledge in number theory, a subject which, though considered platonic and pure in the past, has found a plethora of applications in the digital age.<br/>"

Witherspoon studies representations of these algebras as linear transformations on vector spaces, and their cohomology, which measures properties of the algebras and their representations. Witherspoon will compute the Hochschild cohomology of certain crossed product algebras arising from group actions on spaces. There are expected connections to some new theories of cohomology of orbifolds, and Witherspoon's research will inform the effort by many mathematicians to understand these cohomology theories. At the same time it will be of interest to quantum group theorists as Witherspoon expects, based on her current work, that deformations of these crossed product algebras come from representations of certain quantum groups on these algebras. Related work that Witherspoon proposes will involve progress on some basicquestions about Hopf algebras and quantum groups, such as finite generation of cohomology, and three-manifold invariants arising from finite quantum groups. Another project involves fundamental questions about how representations of an algebra are related to those of a subalgebra. Witherspoon will continue her work in generalizing Clifford theory from groups to certain types of algebras, with the goal of finding constructive answers to these questions, and will apply such a theory to answer questions about representations of algebras.<br/><br/>Algebra is the expression of physical objects as equations or functions. A curve or surface is the graph of an equation, and its physical properties may be determined directly from the equation. More general algebraic systems such as collections of many functions, called algebras, encode information about more complicated physical objects. For example, if an object (such as a crystal or a molecule) exhibits symmetry, this symmetry is expressed in its corresponding algebra. Many such examples are well understood, and the mathematics involved is exploited in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. However there are many systems that are less well understood, such as the quantum groups that arose in mathematical physics less than two decades ago. Witherspoon's work involves the study of properties of such algebras and their representations as physical objects. One technique that is used frequently in Witherspoon's work is cohomology. Witherspoon will compute the cohomology of various types of algebras, as well as use other methods to study them and their representations. Witherspoon's proposed activities will result in a collection of publications on a wide range of topics within algebra that will also impact fields outside algebra such as geometry and mathematical physics. Most of the activities address questions, in which many mathematicians are currently interested, while others are new ideas that will find an interested audience upon publication.<br/><br/>"

The author recently exploited a result in geometric invariant theory to give definitive existence and conjugacy results for a suitable class of rank 1 simple subgroups, called optimal, containing any given element of order p.  If this element is rational over a ground field, the techniques yield an optimal rank one subgroup defined over that ground field. The project seeks to extend these results; an optimal rank 1 subgroup is G-completely reducible in the sense of J-P. Serre, and one hopes to describe any G-completely reducible rank 1 subgroup using the optimal ones.  Moreover, the project will consider counterparts of these results for simple subgroups of rank greater than 1 -- e.g. one hopes to characterize the optimal ones. In a slightly different direction, the project seeks to extend recent results of the author on nilpotent orbits -- in the Lie algebra -- over ground fields. For an imperfect ground field, the author has showed for a rather general class of reductive groups that the orbits of the group of rational points on nilpotent elements -- i.e. the arithmetic nilpotent orbits -- have favorable properties; as consequences, for instance, one finds over a local ground field that there are finitely many arithmetic nilpotent orbits, and one finds that nilpotent orbital integrals converge; the convergence of orbital integrals was obtained in characteristic 0 by Deligne and Ranga Rao.  The project will explore related issues; for instance, it seeks to exploit recent results of the author and E. Sommers to obtain information about nilpotent orbits for groups over the field of rational functions on an algebraic curve.<br/><br/>The structure and representations of linear algebraic groups - and especially the reductive ones -- are important to diverse parts of mathematics.  The groups of their rational points over finite fields account for most of the finite simple groups; they are the natural transformation groups of many algebro-geometric questions; representations of the groups of their rational points over local and global fields carry deep number-theoretic information.  The project will focus on important aspects of these groups.  The local and global fields just mentioned are imperfect when their characteristic is positive; the author's existing results -- and those sought by the project -- on reductive groups over imperfect fields are essential to the study of linear groups in this ""number theoretic"" setting.  Reasons for tackling the proposed problems abound: results on arithmetic nilpotent orbits for a group over a local field of positive characteristic should provide tools needed for the study of the relevant ""harmonic analysis""; results on reductive subgroups defined over the ground field contribute to one's understanding and provide useful inductive tools.<br/>"

The defining properties are (i) any two points is contained in exactly one line and (ii) all lines (viewed as subsets of points) contain the same number of points. In statistical terminology, points are same as treatments and lines are called blocks and the 2-design is called an incomplete block design. Incomplete block designs (or 2-designs) are needed to construct optimum experimental plans to determine the best treatment. Therefore it is important to determine for what parameters v, (the total number of points) and k (the number of points), a Steiner 2-design can be constructed. After decades of research culminating in the work of R. M. Wilson, the existence and construction problem for Steiner 2-designs is solved for at least large number of points. Steiner 3-designs are analogous to circle geometry in which any 3-points is contained in a unique circle, where the numbers of points and circles (blocks) are finite. Steiner 3-designs are fundamental mathematical objects which have application in statistical experimental plans, mathematical communication theory (coding theory), cryptography, computer networking and many branches of mathematics. The problem of determining parameters, v (the total number of points) and k, the circle (block) size for which a Steiner 3-design exists and the corresponding construction problem are very challenging problems. The PI and his collaborators already made significant progress on this problem. The PI now proposes to solve the existence problem for large v.<br/>        Historically, continuous mathematics, i.e. calculus,  differential equations, etc. played a fundamental role in the formulation of physical phenomena and their idealized solutions. These kinds of mathematical approaches solved many practical problems of engineering like building of bridges, aircraft and space ships, electrical networks and also provided the foundation of theoretical physics. With the advent of computers, methods of 'discrete mathematics' where one studies a space of finitely many points are playing increasingly important roles in diverse areas like planning optimum clinical trials (experimental designs), scheduling, networks, cryptography, etc. A Steiner 2- design is like Euclidean geometry except that the number of points and lines are finite.  Steiner 3-designs studies 3-dimensional configurations in finite geometry. Steiner designs have important applications in optimum planning of trials, computer networks, communication in the presence of noise, and cryptography. This project will concentrate on mathematical methods for construction of Steiner designs.<br/>"

About 60 graduate students,<br/>20 recent Ph.D's and 10 more senior researchers will participate<br/>in this three week event.<br/><br/>The summer school will combine both teaching and research. Half<br/>the time will be devoted to teaching coding theory and cryptography<br/>by some leading researchers in the field. During the other half of<br/>the day groups of 3-4 graduate students will do research under<br/>the supervision of a senior mentor who typically is a recent PhD.<br/>A broad variety of research projects will be studied by the graduate<br/>students. The school will provide a learning and research experience<br/>both for the graduate students and their senior mentors.<br/>Details about the summer program and the studied research<br/>projects can be found on the web:<br/>http://www.nd.edu/~cam/ima/<br/>NSF support helps to cover the travel expenses of participants."
