This theme runs throughout some of the great accomplishments of the last decade, but it is just now being isolated and its role recognized.  As one example, it is the key to Ribet's proof of Serre's Conjecture Epsilon and a crucial ingredient to Taylor and Wiles's subsequent proof of the Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture for semi-stable elliptic curves.  For arithmetic over the rational numbers (which is the setting for  the Ribet and Taylor/Wiles result), the point is that by Cerednik/Drinfeld Shimura curves are p-adically uniformized and this enables one to simultaneously study both the Hecke structure and  the action of inertia for a prime of bad reduction on the points of finite  order on their jacobians.  The various theorems proved here should all generalize to any setting where one has an analogous  p-adic uniformization, even to cases of higher dimension.  Jordan wants to study these cases in increasing order of complexity: Shimura curves over totally real fields, quaternionic Hilbert modular varieties over totally real fields, and finally Shimura varieties uniformized by unitary groups.    This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks."

Most of this work will be in the context of quantum groups, quantum topological invariants, and finite-type invariants of 3-manifolds.

Another example is the conjecture that no Vassiliev invariant distinguishes a knot from its reverse. This research involves the investigation of connections between topology, enumeration, and quantum mechanics.  Topology is the study of how objects such as knots and surfaces are connected to themselves; although it was first established firmly as a field of mathematics a century ago, it has seen major advances in the past 30 years due to contributions from many areas of mathematics and physics.  Enumeration is the art of counting things, such as how many way that there are to tile a square tray with dominos; it is related to the thermal properties of materials and other questions in physics.  Quantum mechanics is a famous subject, but it is less well known that it has had an enormous influence in mathematics; it has partly redefined our conception of geometry and mathematical spaces.  These three areas saw a confluence in the 1980's, culminating in the Fields medals awarded to Vaughan Jones, Vladimir Drinfeld, and Edward Witten.

Specifically, Bennett intends to extend previous work on solutions of simultaneous Pell equations or, more generally, intersections of quadric surfaces, combining the aforementioned methods with recent work of Schlickewei and Wirsing and of Voutier. These results have a number of interesting applications to bounding the number of integer points or rational points of bounded height on certain classes of elliptic curves. They also lead to parameterized families of elliptic curves with rank at least two and, potentially, to families with rather higher rank. The PI also plans to extend these techniques to the problem of absolutely bounding the number of solutions to certain simultaneous decomposable ternary quadratic form equations and to bound the number of common values of recurrence sequences, as considered by Schlickewei and Schmidt. In the latter situation, one would hope for rather stronger bounds than those obtained by Schlickewei and Schmidt, though perhaps in less generality. In addition to the core program of research outlined above, the PI intends to pursue three additional problems. First, the PI will apply p-adic gap principles similar to those of Bombieri and Evertse to attack a conjecture about the function g(k) in Waring's problem. Second, the PI will continue his investigations of the hypergeometric method, with reference to improving known bounds upon solutions to the Ramanujan-Nagell and related polynomial-exponential equations and to cubic and quartic Thue equations. Finally, the PI intends to extend his joint work with N.P. Dummigan and T.D. Wooley on representations of integers by binary additive forms, to more general decomposable forms.

The conjecture is true for curves and subvarieties of Abelian varieties. Little is known for other varieties. Professors Sarnak and Wang have shown that some hypersurfaces yield either a violation of the Hasse principle which is not accounted for by the Brauer--Manin obstruction or a violation of the above Lang's conjecture. Professor Wang will continue to  investigate this problem for 0-cycles of degree 1. (Project 2)   The  densities of rational points on algebraic varieties have  been studied extensively. Professor Wang plans to study weak  approximation, Brauer--Manin obstruction and the modified Mazur's   conjecture on the topology of rational points on the Hurwitz  families, and more generally, on Hurwitz spaces.

While the continuous part of the spectrum can be deduced from the theory of Eisenstein series, the discrete spectrum is very hard to study. It is the purpose of Arthur's trace formula to study this part. However, the trace formula will not separate the cuspidal part from the residual part, and one needs to study the residual spectrum by computing the residues of Eisenstein series. Moreover, the first exotic example of the residual  spectrum of the split group G_2, which was discovered by Langlands and  further studied later by Moeglin and Waldspurger, was significant to Arthur in formulating his conjectures.  Computing residues of Eisenstein series is a very difficult problem and requires both the knowledge of the poles of corresponding automorphic L-functions, as well as handling very difficult computational combinatorics. These computations are already highly non-trivial even for rank 2 split groups.  On the other hand, Arthur's conjectures are aimed at parametrizing the discrete spectrum in terms of representations of a certain profinite arithmetic group. While parametrizing most of it requires the introduction of this hypothetical group, there are parts of it that can be parametrized by our existing knowledge. In particular, this is the case if the Eisenstein series is built out of minimal parabolics.  Moeglin proved that for split classical groups, the local components of the residual spectrum coming from the trivial character of the torus, are parametrized by the distinguished unipotent orbits O of the dual group and  Springer(O) , where  Springer(O)  is the set of characters of the component group that are in the image of the Springer correspondence. The PI verified that the same thing happens for the split group G_2 and plan to show that the same thing would happen for all split groups. The fact that the component group of the Arthur parameter for  G_2 is non-abelian explains the ""bizarre"" multiplicity condition in Moeglin-Waldspurger's work on G_2. The PI showed, in joint work with F. Shahidi, that for an arbitrary unitary character, the local components of the residual spectrum attached to certain unipotent orbits, are parametrized by the Knapp-Stein R-group of the character. In general, the Knapp-Stein R-groups are not enough. We have to combine the R-group and Springer(O). In this way, the PI plans to  show that the quadratic unipotent Arthur parameters  in the sense of Moeglin exhaust the residual spectrum coming from the torus.  The investigator will carry the above projects to quasi-split groups. A similar thing happens to U(n,n), but the global Weil group W_F comes into play. Therefore we expect that the action of the global Weil group will play a role in parametrizing the residual spectrum.  The groups U(n,n) and  E_7,3  all have a relative root system of type C_n, and the technique of symplectic groups will be applied directly.     This proposal is in the part of mathematics known as the Langlands program. The Langlands program is part of Number Theory. Number Theory is the study of the  properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have  furnished a driving force in creating new mathematics in other  diverse parts of the discipline. The Langland's program is a  general philosophy that connects number theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern approach to the study of whole numbers. Modern Number Theory is very technical and deep, but it has had  astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer  science and coding theory."

Data mining is the automatic extraction and discovery of  patterns, associations, changes, anomalies, and significant structures in large data sets.  Large data sets generated by scientific, engineering, medical and business applications are becoming increasingly common.  Developing algorithms which can uncover patterns in large data sets is an important mathematical challenge.    In the past decade, extremely large sets of data have been generated at an alarming from very diverse areas including scientific, medical, communications, and manufacturing.  These data bases are growing much faster than the speed of computers and thus are outstripping our ability to extract information  with current techniques.

There  are two cases to consider: (1) the describing characteristic theory in  which the representations are taken over a field k having the same  characteristic as the defining characteristic p of G; and (2) the  non-describing characteristic theory in which k has characteristic  different from p.  Over the past decade the investigators have developed  many new techniques (often in collaboration with E. Cline) for attacking  case (1).  These methods have often come about by adapting geometric  methods, such as the theory of perverse sheaves, to classical algebra  (especially the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras).  In  the proposed work they will continue in that direction.  At the same time,  the investigators will integrate their approach with high dimensional  deformation techniques which have also been applied to (1).  In addition,  the investigators have recently developed new endomorphism algebra  techniques for attacking (2).  In particular, their introduction (with Jie  Du) of Kazhdan-Lusztig cell theory into the theory of Hecke endomorphism  algebras suggests that much progress can be made on developing a general  theory (i.e., valid for all types) for the non-describing characteristic  theory.  The project involves, and/or will have applications to, many other  areas of mathematics, including cohomology, Lie theory, finite dimensional  algebras, and the maximal subgroup theory of finite groups.         A mathematical group is an abstract embodiment of symmetry.  Its  concrete realizations can provide powerful constraints on the behavior of  complicated physical and communications systems.  This project concentrates  on determining the ways in which the most important abstract finite groups  find concrete representations as square matrices over finite number  systems.  The groups and representati ons the investigators study comprise  the most important basic ingredients for creating a general theory of all  finite group representations.  In this century, similar theories for  continuous groups over familiar continuous number systems have played a  large role in quantum theory and the theory of elementary particles.  Their  finite analogs have already proved valuable in the design of communications  and data storage devices, though this finite theory remains very  incomplete.  In the next century, one reasonably expects that the finite  discrete worlds of computers and communications will become even more  important. The task of creating a viable general theory of finite group  representations -- as is the investigators' long-term goal -- is, thus, a  central problem for the future."

Extremal combinatorics  is an important part of combinatorial mathematics.  For example a typical problem in graph theory is as follows:  given a graph F determine the maximum number  ex (n,F) of edges in a graph of order n not containing F.  Ramsey theory investigates structures that are preserved under restricted partitions. Naturally, the classical example is the theorem of Ramsey that, in its simplest form, tells us that arbitrarily large 2-edge-colored complete graphs must contain arbitrarily large monochromatic complete subgraphs.  Here the partition is given by the coloring and the structures that are preserved under this partition are the complete graphs.  Probabilistic Methods have proved to be a powerful technique in combinatorics, and the theory of random graphs is a branch of graph theory that has emerged from these methods.  Over the last three years, the proposer's research was mainly concentrated within these areas. The work in this project will include some problems in Ramsey theory, problems involved with possible extensions of the regularity lemma, extremal properties of random graphs, problems on delta systems and others.    This research is in the area of combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research."

The proposed research lies at the junction of non-commutative ring  theory and algebraic geometry. The most abstract  setting for the subject is to view a pair, consisting of an abelian  category and a distinguished object in it, as the category of  sheaves on some imaginary non-commutative space and the structure  sheaf of the space. Such a pair is called a scheme.  The category of modules over a ring together  with the ring itself is a basic example.    Much of the project involves the examination of special examples  with the goal of getting a better understanding of the appropriate  analogues of standard geometric notions such as subschemes, open,  closed, singular, etc. Particular  attention will be paid to non-commutative analogues of projective  spaces; included in this are the Sklyanin algebras, which first  arose from some problems in physics. It is also proposed to examine  several homological properties of non-commutative rings, such as  Auslander regularity, the Koszul property, and the Cohen-Macaulay  property.    The basic problem addressed by  non-commutative ring theory is to understand the solutions in  (possibly infinite) matrices to systems of polynomial equations in  non-commuting variables.   Non-commutative algebraic geometry aims to  develop a more geometric approach to such a problem, essentially by  viewing the solutions as geometric objects."

The Gross-Zagier formula has been extended to  the p-adic case and to higher weight case.  One of the main purposes of this project is to prove the Gross-Zagier formula without any restriction on the ``imaginary quadratic field'' using  Kudla's recent results on the central derivative of Eisenstein series.  This is a joint project with Kudla.  Kudla's idea is quite conceptional and should be able to work on other classical groups.  From that point of view,  it seems also possible to extend the Gross-Zagier formula to Shimura varieties of type O(n,2) or U(n, 1).  This will be a long term goal of the Principal Investigator.  In the second part of this project, the Principal Investigator plans to continue his study of the leading coefficients of Hecke L-functions of CM number fields.  The concerned Hecke characters have a center of symmetry and have root number  1 or -1.  When the root number is 1, the PI has proved a formula to express the central Hecke L-value as the inner product of some theta lifting from U(1) to itself, and applied the formula  to prove that a family of elliptic curves have  rank 0.  When the root number is -1, the central L-value is 0 automatically.  The PI plans to prove a Gross-Zagier formula to relate the central derivative of the concerned Hecke L-function to height pairing of two distinct cycles on some Shimura variety associated to U(1) by adapting Kudla's idea.  Furthermore, the PI plans to apply the formula to prove that the central derivatives of the Hecke L-functions do not vanish in some special cases.  In particular, he wants to prove that certain CM elliptic Q-curves have rational rank 1.  When significant progress is made in the first two parts, the PI will start  o tackle similar questions on the Picard modular surfaces.    This proposal is an th e part of mathematics known as the Langlands program.  The Langlands program is part of Number Theory.  Number Theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics.  From the beginning problems in number theory have furnished a driving force in creating new mathematics in other diverse part of the discipline.  The Langland's program is a general philosophy that connect number theory with calculus; it embodies the modern approach to the study of whole numbers.  Modern Number Theory is very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing application in areas like theoretical computer science and coding theory."

In the past twenty years the study of representaiton  theory of a special class of affine Lie algebras and  Lie groups led to many new unexpected discoveries in mathematics  and theoretical physics as well as to a synthesis of many established  areas in both disciplines.  In particular, it yielded a pure mathe-  matical description of a simplest quantum field theory -- a prototype  theory of fundamental interactions.  It is expected that representation  theory of new classes of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups  might substantially deepen our understanding of mathematics and  theoretical physics during the next decade."

Kim to continue his past research on the Diophantine geometry of curves over function fields of arbitrary characteristic.  In elementary language, this is the study of equations of  type f(x,y,t)=0  (1)  viewed as a two-variable polynomial equation whose coefficients are functions of t to which we seek solutions (x,y)=(p(t), q(t)), that is, pairs of polynomials (or rational functions) which satisfy  f(p(t),q(t),t)=0 as a function of t.  In particular, he will continue his previous work on `effective' Mordell conjectures over function fields, which allows one to find all solutions to (1) (for f's of high genus) by giving a priori bounds on the `height' (which in this case is the degree) of solution pairs (p(t),q(t)).  A result of this sort over number fields is the long-term eventual goal of this research This is an outstanding problem in Diophantine geometry whose resolution would provide a crude algorithm for finding all rational solutions to Diophantine equations in two variables over the rational numbers.  The specific projects go in three closely related directions:  (1) finding more refined geometric height inequalities in arbitrary characteristic to serve as efficient input into algorithmic search for solutions;  (2) embedding the PI's previous work into the study of curves on surfaces of general type in the spirit of Bogomolov's theorem on boundedness of curves of bounded genus, and that of his joint work with Shepherd-Barron; (3) approaching geometric height inequalities from a more explicitly algorithmic viewpoint in the hope of finding techniques which would transfer more readily to number fields than the existing ones.

The group  will study the modular representation theory of  algebraic and finite groups of Lie type. In the  case where the (prime) characteristic of the base field is the natural  characteristic of the ambient algebraic group, the main problem centers  upon a famous conjecture by Lusztig for the characters of certain  irreducible representations.  Recent progress shows that this  conjecture is true for all but a finite number of primes. However, at  present, there is no effective bound on the size of the prime. One goal  of this project is to continue work toward a complete proof of this  conjecture. In the case where the characteristic is  not the natural characteristic, the theory is much less well developed.  Recent work of Cline, in collaboration with Parshall and Scott, yields  techniques which apply, generally, to the modular representation theory  of the finite groups of Lie type in all characteristics. A second goal  of this project therefore is to develop these new techniques into an  effective tool for the study of these representations in the  non-natural characteristic cases. In particular, one hopes  eventually to obtain significant insight into the nature of the  irreducible modules in these cases.    The theory of groups and their representations is a central area of  research in mathematics because its methods apply generally to the  study of any object, in particular to many mathematical structures, with  a high degree of symmetry. For a given group, the determination of its  irreducible representations is a central problem.  The research of the  principal investigator in this grant will have as one focus the  determination of these irreducible representations for the finite  groups of Lie type, and their associated algebraic groups. The problem  divid es into two major cases. The first case, in which major progress  has been made on the Lusztig conjecture, is much more well developed  than in the second where little is known in general.  Therefore the work   of the principal  investigator on this grant will be of a more preliminary nature in the  second case than in the first. Progress in either case would have  applications in many other areas of mathematics including cohomology  theory, Lie theory, the theory of finite dimensional algebras and the  study of the subgroup structure of the finite and algebraic groups of  Lie type."

The classical Kloosterman sum has important applications in number theory. An example is Kuznetsov's estimate of a weighted sum of Kloosterman sums which is a step toward the Linnik--Selberg conjecture; the proof is based on the Kuznetsov trace formula. Generalized Kloosterman sums appear in various relative trace formulas; such a relative trace formula is indeed an equality between a generalized Kuznetsov trace formula and one of its relative versions. The above appearances of the Kloosterman sums suggest their central role in number theory and group representation theory. This research project is centered at Kloosterman sums and related exponential sums, their generalizations, and their applications. The objectives are listed below.  (i) The Langlands functoriality conjecture predicts functorial relationships between representations of different groups. If a functorial lifting can be studied by a relative trace formula, its fundamental lemma may be reduced to an identity of exponential sums of the Kloosterman type. The first objective is to study specific lifting problems and deduce the corresponding identities of exponential sums.  (ii) Conversely, such an identity not only will imply the fundamental lemma of the relative trace formula, but also might be used to deduce the whole relative trace formula, based on recent results on Shalika germ expansions and exponential sum expansions of local orbital integrals of relative trace formulas. The second objective is to deduce a relative trace formula from its identity of exponential sums.  (iii) Important applications of the classical Kloosterman sum are usually based on estimation of its values and weighted sums. The last objective is to estimate certain weighted sums of generalized Kloosterman sums and related high ranking exponential sums.        This proposal is in the part of mathematics known as the Langlands program. This program represents a fus ion of Number Theory and Representation Theory , and it has been a stimulus to a great deal of recent research in both fields. Number Theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics and is concerned with the most basic of mathematical objects, the ordinary whole numbers.  However, it turns out that in order to express many of the patterns and relations discovered by mathematicians, it is necessary to use some of the  most advanced and technical theories of twentieth century mathematics. On the other hand, the problems of number theory have provided a powerful stimulus to research in other  diverse parts of the discipline.  The Langland's program provides a framework for investigating and vastly generalizing the so-called reciprocity laws of number theory using the tools of infinite-dimensional representation theory.  Although very technical and deep, this program  has found astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer science (construction of expanding graphs) and coding theory (finding optimal Goppa codes).  It has also played a role in some of the recent spectacular developments in number theory itself, such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."

To date, the most successful general method has used Heegner points. Briefly, one defines certain divisors on a modular curve by specifying points in the upper half-plane; the theory of complex multiplication allows one to show that these divisors are defined over a number field, and using a modular parameterization one gets rational points on the elliptic curve.  One needs then to test whether these points have infinite order, which can be done by comparing their heights with special values of L-functions using the method of Gross and Zagier. The first project Ulmer will pursue is extending these methods to the case of elliptic curves defined over the fields of functions of curves over finite fields.  Specifically, he proposes to develop the analogues of the results of Gross and Zagier relating values of L-functions to heights of special points on Shimura curves.  This will allow one to prove that certain Heegner points, a priori rational, have infinite order and thereby prove the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer for elliptic curves over function fields whose L-function vanishes simply.  The second project Ulmer will investigate is also related to elliptic curves over function fields.  As in the number field case, the group of rational points on such an elliptic curve is finitely generated.  On the other hand, the group of local points is very big--it is a Zp-module of infinite rank.  He proposes to construct a submodule of the local points which is of finite Zp-rank and which contains the global points.  In contrast to the Heegner point construction, this method yields points which are a priori of infinite order; in some cases one can identify a Z-module of points which are conjecturally rational over the ground field, thus offering the hope of an alternative construction of global points of infinite order.  The third project deals with  the mod p Galois representations attached to classical modular forms.  Specifically, Ulmer plans to use the existence of a large supply of congruences between modular forms proved in his previous work to study the geometry of a parameter space of p-adic modular forms constructed by Coleman.  He also hopes to relate a property of modular representations (``twisted ordinarity'', which is roughly speaking the condition that the representation be reducible when restricted to a decomposition group at p) to ``slopes'', i.e., to the valuations of Hecke eigenvalues.      This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful, having recently solved problems that withstood the efforts of generations.  Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes which are used in computer storage devices like compact disks and hard drives and secure information transmission schemes which are used for financial transactions on the internet."

Once that is done, it will be possible to apply the resulting tools to seek unified geometric explanations of the Macdonald polynomials' many remarkable properties.  This constitutes the first part mf the planned research.  Haiman and his student W. Brockman, seeking to apply recent work of Broer to certain aspects of the above study, have discovered new connections linking other algebraic varieties to the one- and two-parameter Kostka polynomials.  These discoveries have led to a geometric explanation of Lascoux's atoms and to tantalizing conjectures whose further study will form the second part of the planned research.  As a third and final part of the planned research, Haiman will resume his earlier work on Hecke algebras and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, motivated by his still unsolved conjectures on Hecke algebra characters, and the related problem of finding a satisfactory combinatorial interpretation of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.  This research concerns the interplay between combinatorics and algebraic geometry. One of the goals of  combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.

He will develop and bring to bear techniques of symbolic computation to  attack some of these questions. Several of the specific questions about Hopf algebras  that Professor Nichols plans to investigate are related by their connection with  Yetter-Drinfel'd modules. With the goal of proving Kaplansky's conjecture that the  degree of an absolutely irreducible representation of a semisimple Hopf algebra  divides the dimension of the Hopf algebra, Professor Nichols, in joint work with  Bettina Richmond, has been studying the Grothendieck algebra of a Hopf algebra.  Information about how certain Yetter-Drinfel'd modules multiply should help resolve a  conjecture which is a key part of that program. A quite different investigation  involves computations of bialgebras which are completely determined by  Yetter-Drinfel'd modules of finite groups. Even when the groups are small, these can  be extremely complicated. The algebra/coalgebra interaction in Yetter-Drinfel'd  modules is considerably easier to understand than is the corresponding interaction in  the Hopf algebra itself, yet it is rich enough to shed a great deal of light on the  Hopf algebra structure. Its elucidation in this situation should be quite  instructive.      Hopf algebras and symbolic computation are both areas of growing interest, areas  which cross fields in mathematics, and areas which are very important outside  mathematics as well. Hopf algebras are useful in the type of knot theory that is of  interest to molecular chemists. Certain types of Hopf algebras are now referred to as  ""quantum groups"", in recognition of their applications in physics.  Symbolic  computation is part of a key technology, namely, scientific and engineering  computation, that is becoming increasingly important to science, technology, and  society. It is leading to dramatic changes in the theory and practice of mathematics.  There  are good reasons to expect a synergistic relationship between investigations in  Hopf algebras and symbolic computation. Hopf algebra arguments often involve  complicated symbolic calculations which are quite similar to ones which (in the  commutative case) can now be done very effectively by machine. In the other  direction, Hopf algebra ideas help to explain and organize computations. Hopf  algebras provide a challenging setting in which to develop computational methods, but  the very structure that causes the scarcity of simplifying relations helps to keep  track of the ones that exist. It is expected that the insights gained in exploiting  this Hopf structure will contribute to the wider goal of advancing  symbolic  computation."

The first problem is  Robertson's double-path conjecture, which states that if a class G of graphs is closed under topological minors and is free of arbitrarily long double-paths, then G does not contain infinite antichains with respect t o the topological-minor relation. This is a fundamental conjecture in graph theory. It relates structural graph theory, combinatorial optimization, and classical combinatorics. The PI has made significant progress towards solving this conjecture, which includes, but is not limited to, proving the conjecture for all minor-closed classes of graphs and for the class of graphs of cutwidth at most three. He hopes that his  past experience on this problem together with some of his new ideas will help him to settle this conjecture completely. The second problem is the edge version of Hajos' conjecture. Recently, the PI has established the edge version of Hadwiger's conjecture by identifying all minor- minimal graphs with chromatic index greater than n. Now he proposes to study topological-minor-minimal graphs with chromatic index greater than n. This is exactly the edge version of Hajos' conjecture, which claims that  K_n  is the only topological-minor-minimal graph with  chromatic number greater than n. This problem relates not only to Hajos' conjecture and Hadwiger's conjecture, but also to Vizing's planar graph conjecture and several well-known results in this field. The third problem concerns unavoidable graphs of large crossing number.  Crossing number is a typical graph parameter that is monotone with respect to the topological-minor relation but not with respect to the minor relation. A natural problem concerning this parameter is to understand what makes the crossing number big. One obvious cause is a high genus for the graph. There are also other causes. For example, for some large n, the containment of a topological minor D_ n can make the crossing number large. The PI proposes to characterize the complete list of unavoidable graphs of large crossing number.      This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged.

There is, of course, an extensive conjectural framework in this area (Langlands' conjectures, supplemented by other conjectures such as Serre's conjecture and the Mazur-Tilouine conjecture).  In a sense there are two problems here. The first problem is attaching Galois representations to modular forms and, and the second is attaching modular forms to Galois representations. Until recently, most work, including the investigator's, focused on the first problem. Taylor worked on constructing Galois representations for Hilbert modular forms, genus 2 Siegel modular forms and modular forms for GL(2) over an imaginary quadratic field. He made heavy use of ``congruence techniques''. There are still fascinating open questions on this problem, but the PI's present interest has now shifted to the second problem.  Until recently there was only really one isolated result on the second problem --the Langlands-Tunnell theorem. The situation changed when Andrew Wiles initiated, and he and the PI completed, a proof that a suitable l-adic lift of a modular mod l representation was itself modular.  Combined with the Langlands-Tunnell theorem this proved the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture for semi-stable elliptic curves and hence (by the Frey-Serre-Ribet argument) Fermat's Last Theorem. Also using this work, Nick Shepherd-Barron and the PI have recently managed to show that many mod 5 and mod 2 icosahedral representations are modular. In the immediate future, the PI will look at extensions of these arguments. One extension is to relax the conditions on the ramification of the lift at l. Another direction to extend the argument to higher dimensional representations and automorphic forms on unitary groups. In the medium term, the PI will investigate whether or not this result can shed light on the Artin conjecture for 2-dimensional odd ic osahedral representations.    This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.

Let G be a reductive group over a number field F; let H be a subgroup of G; we assume that over the algebraic closure of F the group H has an open orbit in the flag variety of G. If f is an automorphic form on G and t a suitable character of H the corresponding period integral is the integral of f times t taken over the adelic quotient of H. In many cases, it is conjectured that at every place of F the triple (G,H,t) satisfies Gelfand multiplicity one condition. Furthermore, it is conjectured that the period  integral is related to the value of an automorphic L-function at its center of symmetry. For instance, the value of the L-function may be essentially the square of a period integral. In other cases, automorphic representations that admit a vector f for which the integral is non-zero are especially interesting from the point of view of the Langlands program. In this proposal, the tool for studying the period integrals is a variant of the trace formula, the relative trace formula. There will be applications to the value of the L-functions at their center of symmetry. In some cases, it might be possible to prove that this value is non-negative. Other results will be more directly related to the Langlands program, and will provide information on the principle of functoriality or the structure of the L-packets. In general, this information cannot be obtained from the standard trace formula or the theory of dual pairs. The questions in local harmonic analysis which arise may be of independent interest. A notable example is a conjectural identity between certain Kloosterman integrals (or sums).  This proposal deals with the Langlands program, and  the Langlands program is part of number theory. Number theory is the study of the  properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have  furnished a driving force in creating new mathematics in other  diver se parts of the discipline. The Langland's program is a  general philosophy that connects number theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern approach to the study of whole numbers.   Modern number theory is very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer science and coding theory."

After the proof of the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture by A. Wiles and R. Taylor, which include the proof of  Mazur's conjecture on Hecke algebras and deformation rings of modular Galois representations, there are now effective tools to deal with non-abelian Selmer groups; in particular, those of adjoint modular Galois representations. This award will support research into five projects connected to Selmer groups. From the view point of Iwasawa's theory, number theorists need to construct p-adic analytic L-functions on the spectrum of the Hecke algebra to supply tools to describe such Selmer groups(Project II).  Since adjoint L-values are often non-critical, one needs to find out how to compute the algebraic part of the L-values in an automorphic way feasible enough to connect them directly to Selmer groups even in non-critical case (Project I).Since the work of Taylor and Wiles is now generalized to the Hilbert modular case by K. Fujiwara, one can try to attack the two variable main conjecture for the adjoint Selmer groups (Project III).  Two key tools in studying this problem are: (i) analysis of base change via Hecke algebras and deformation rings, and (ii) theory of p-adic nearly ordinary Hecke algebras for symplectic groups constructed by J. Tilouine and E. Urban.  Thus it is natural to study how functorial operations on Galois representations are reflected by deformation rings and Hecke algebras (Project IV) and to generalize the theory to more general groups, perhaps unitary groups (Project V).      This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that w ithstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks."

The first technique involves the use of double Dirichlet series, associated groups of functional equations and a convexity principle for functions of two complex variables. Our purpose is to study the properties of L-series of number theoretic interest in one variable s that arise in these double Dirichlet series as coefficients in the expansion as a Dirichlet series in another variable w. Such double series often arise in the theory of metaplectic Eisenstein series on higher rank groups.  A good deal of our efforts in past years have been devoted to obtaining information about collections of  L-series that appear in these double series.  The main tool has been generalizations of the Rankin-Selberg method applied to metaplectic Eisenstein series and cusp forms.  A major obstacle to progress, however, has been the difficulty of analyzing the archimedian factors associated to these L-series that are created by the Rankin-Selberg process. It is our belief that the technique described above should be applicable in all the cases that are theoretically accessible by the Rankin-Selberg method, but the difficulties of working at the infinite place should be avoided.  We hope to use this method to prove the entirety of the symmetric fourth power  L-series associated to an automorphic form on GL(2) .  This would have as a consequence an improvement of the best known exponent in Fourier coefficients estimates for Maass forms from  5/28  to  1/6 .  Other applications should include the entirety of the symmetric cube L-series, non-vanishing of infinitely many cubic twists of a GL(2) automorphic L-series at arbitrary points, and mean value estimates for arbitrary order twists of Hecke L-series. The second technique is connected to certain generalizations of metaplectic forms.  Metaplectic forms on  GL(2)  transform under the action of a congruence subgroup of the fu ll modular group. In this project, the investigator and his collaborators will construct a new kind of metaplectic group with the Kubota symbol replaced by a representation of the congruence subgroup. This could then be used to construct an Eisenstein series. The investigator hopes that the Artin  L-series associated to extensions of the base field with Galois group a subgroup of  G  will be connected to this Eisenstein series.  If true, an investigation of integral transforms of the Eisenstein series could lead to new information about certain classes of Artin L-series.  At the very least, an investigation of such generalizations of metaplectic forms should prove interesting, as they appear to be completely new objects.      This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number Theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems."

The project describes a number of ideas relating algebraic cycles with  arithmetic. There are three main themes in the project.   The first theme deals with an interpretation of   the local Euler factor of a projective, smooth variety over a number field   at a finite prime of semistable reduction. Consani gave in her Ph.D Thesis a description of the local factor at an Archimedean place as a characteristic polynomial of an operator playing the role of the geometric  Frobenius at infinity. The Frobenius acts on an infinite dimensional real  vector space of invariants for the action of an arithmetic monodromy.  Supported by this description and by the fact that an Archimedean fiber  of an arithmetic variety should be thought as completly degenerate,  Consani hopes to show a corresponding description also at a place of semistable reduction.  Consani intends to better understand the analogy between the Archimedean and non Archimedean fibers by studying, in a quite concrete  way, the pole of the L-function of a product variety XxX at a non Archimedean semistable reduction prime of X, associated to the monodromy  map N. This represents the second main theme of the project. The operator  N can be interpreted as a cocycle into the middle dimensional cohomology  group of XxX correctly twisted. Via the spectral sequence of the nearby  cycles one should be able to read that element as a cocycle and eventually as an algebraic cycle, into the disjoint union of the 3-fold intersections of the components of the special fiber of a resolution of the model of XxX. The last theme reported in the project describes a closer relation between algebraic cycles and differential forms over the fiber at infinity of an arithmetic variety. Consani hopes to introduce a higher Arakelov theory and a higher arithmetic Riemann Roch theorem.    This project falls into the general area of arithme tic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks."

Number Theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics and is concerned with the most basic of mathematical objects, the ordinary whole numbers.  However, it turns out that in order to express many of the patterns and relations discovered by mathematicians, it is necessary to use some of the most advanced and technical theories of twentieth century mathematics.  On the other hand, the problems of number theory have provided a powerful stimulus to research in other  diverse parts of the discipline.  The Langland's program provides a framework for investigating and vastly generalizing the so-called reciprocity laws of number theory using the tools of infinite-dimensional representation theory.  Although very technical and deep, this program  has found astonishing applica tions in areas like theoretical computer science (construction of expanding graphs) and coding theory (finding optimal Goppa codes).  It has also played an indispensable role in some of the recent spectacular developments in number theory itself, such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."

These varieties play an important role in Commutative Algebra, serving  as basic examples and also providing links to other fields, like Combinatorics,  Representation Theory and Singularities.

These problems include: (i) Vizing's Planar Graph Conjecture; (ii) the Total Coloring Conjecture for planar graphs; (iii) the Entire Coloring Conjecture; (iv) the Cyclic Coloring Conjecture; (v) the Nine Color Conjecture; (vi) further investigation on the k-Walk Conjecture, which the principal investigators solved in 1996; (vii) vertex reconstruction of 4-connected planar graphs, which is a special case of the Vertex Reconstruction Conjecture; (viii) edge reconstruction of triangulations of surfaces, which is a special case of the Edge Reconstruction Conjecture. Some of these problems have been around for more than thirty years, but still remain unsolved. Recently, the principal investigators have successfully solved several problems related to (i)--(vi) by using the Discharging Method. It seems that other methods which were used to attack several of the problems mentioned above have stalled, and that the Discharging Method indeed provides a far more general and powerful tool for various problems.

List coloring problems in graph theory involve coloring the elements (vertices or edges) of a graph in such a way that adjacent or incident elements receive different colors, and the color of each element must be chosen from a prescribed list of colors associated with that element. For example, the list chromatic index (or list edge-chromatic number) of a graph is the least number n such that, given an arbitrary assignment of a list of n colors to each edge, there is a proper edge-coloring in which each edge is colored with a color from its list. The list (vertex-) chromatic number and list total chromatic number are defined analogously. The list coloring conjecture, due to Vizing, asserts that the list chromatic index of any graph (or multigraph) is equal to its (ordinary) chromatic index. The list coloring conjecture (LCC for short) is a notoriously deep and difficult problem. One of the major recent advances in this area was the PI's proof of the LCC for bipartite multigraphs, a result which included, as a special case, the well-known Dinitz conjecture about partial Latin squares. In this project, the PI hopes to make further progress on the LCC, by extending and applying his result on the bipartite case, and by other means. While the main focus of this project is on list colorings, the PI plans to investigate various other problems in combinatorics and graph theory, possibly including, but not limited to, the areas of Ramsey theory for paths, hypergraph games, cliques in factorizations of graphs and hypergraphs, and Frankl's conjecture on union-closed families. This research is in the area of combinatorics. Combinatorics is generally applicable to various practical problems: routing, scheduling, and other management science problems, communications, cryptology, etc. The mathematical formulation of a scheduling problem is a graph coloring problem. List coloring theory, besides being directly applicable to certain kinds of scheduling problems, is a useful tool in the study of classical graph coloring problems. The educational significance of a lot of work in combinatorics and graph theory, in particular the kind of work planned for this project, is that the problems and results, and even the methods used, are often accessible to bright undergraduate and high school students, so that they can enjoy the excitement of direct contact with current research."

The main topics of this proposal are summarized below. These topics cover a large part of graph structure theory as it relates to the graph minor inclusion relation. In fact, each topic contains major problems, often well known and difficult, and so significant progress in any direction is likely to absorb a great deal of time. There are at present serious attacks (which our group welcomes) being made on many of these problems elsewhere in the graph theoretical community. The main topics are as follows: (1) To continue the attack on the open problems in explicit finite graph minor structure. (2) To continue the attack on the open problems in general finite graph minor structure. (3) To attack coloring problems made accessible by the improved proof of the four-color theorem and structure theory results. (4) To continue to study connectivity at the levels exhibited by the graphs of the Platonic solids and the toroidal regular lattices; in particular chains of minors or types of minors at a given level.

The proposed research would improve our understanding of both automorphic forms and p-adic cohomology by providing new tools for studying the former and by providing concrete examples of the latter. The PI's recent proof of a conjecture of Mazur, Tate, Teitelbaum, and Coleman raises new questions about analytic families of automorphic forms, their p-adic L-functions, and families of galois representations and overconvergent F-crystals. The proposed research would clarify how such families degenerate at special non-crystalline points and would describe monodromy at such points in terms of a deformation in the weight direction, thus enlarging the standard picture of monodromy in potentially useful ways. This research would also complement Kato's recent work on values of L-functions and K_2 of modular curves by providing tools for deforming Kato's theory in p-adic analytic families. In related work, the PI hopes to develop a p-adic Eichler-Shimura correspondence that would relate his theory of overconvergent modular symbols to Katz's theory of overconvergent modular forms and to construct analytic families of non-ordinary half-integral weight modular forms by generalizing a p-adic theta lifting developed in earlier work of the PI. Finally, the PI intends to generalize these ideas to automorphic forms on other reductive algebraic groups. This research offers promising tools for the construction of p-adic analytic families of non-ordinary automorphic representations together with natural deformation spaces of Galois representations, and multivariable p-adic L-functions. This is connected with a number of new investigations, including p- adic monodromy, Jochnowitz's conjectures on the square root of theta operator on half-integral weight forms, and the p-adic deformation theory of Galois representations.

The investigators will build on this progress by considering these problems from extremal topological graph theory: (4) Bounds for crossing numbers of graphs. (5) Further investigation of the connection between crossing numbers and combinatorial geometry. (6) Graph drawings, where many pairwise crossing edges are excluded. This is research in extremal combinatorics, a subject at the very core of our understanding of how discrete structures work and how to use them optimally. Significant longstanding open problems are abundant in extremal combinatorics, and new problems frequently come from nearby rapidly d eveloping fields such as information theory, computer science, computational biology, or number theory. Certain database security models require the solution of certain extremal combinatorics problems in order to optimize their performance."

The principal investigator will define and study p-adic intermediate Jacobians for algebraic varieties over a p-adically complete field which have a p-adic uniformization. It is expected that these will be fundamental tools in the theory. He will also study higher obstructions to the Hasse principle for varieties over algebraic number fields. The theory of algebraic cycles is part of algebraic geometry, which is the study of solutions to systems of polynomial equations. This is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, but it has experienced an explosion of new ideas and fundamental theorems over the past thirty years. Also, new applications of the theory have been found to coding theory, cryptography and engineering."

The main problems are to complete the classification of the maximal subgroups of exceptional algebraic groups, to determine pairs of maximal subgroups of simple algebraic groups for which there are finitely many double cosets, and to establish results on lifting representations of finite groups to representations of corresponding algebraic groups. Additional problems concern bounds for dimensions of weight spaces in irreducible modules and a problem concerning finite groups acting irreducibly on adjoint modules. Groups are algebraic objects that appear whenever there is symmetry and it is natural to study general properties of groups as well as their representations. Many problems can be reduced to the analysis of subgroups of simple groups. However, such an analysis can be extremely difficult and is ultimately linked to fundamental problems in representation theory. Seitz has a long standing research program aimed at systematically studying the subgroups and representations of some of the most interesting families of simple groups, the simple algebraic groups and their finite analogs."
