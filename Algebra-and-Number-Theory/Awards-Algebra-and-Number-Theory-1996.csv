These algorithms are codified in a language, under  development, which facilitates the mechanical verification of  proofs about binary linear codes. One method is to take a  generalized weight enumerator, and use it to generate a linear  programming problem, as Delsarte did with the ordinary weight   enumerator.  Thse linear programming problems tend to be large,  and thus are not generally amenable to hand calculation.  One  particularly promising weight enumerator is the split weight  enumerator arising from a partition of n, where n is the length  of the code.  Using this method and others, many new specific  results about binary linear codes will be proved.  In turn, these  may suggest new algorithms and closed-form general statements.  This research is about error-correcting codes, a fundamental  topic in mathematical combinatorics, computer science, and  electrical engineering.  Such codes are indispensable whenever  information must be transferred across noisy channels from one  place to another.  For example,they are used in compact disk  players to get digitized music from the surface of the CD to the  inside of the player, and in communications between the earth and   orbiting satellites.  Error-correcting codes work by creatively  incorporating redundancy into the transmitted message, to permit  the receiver to detect and correct those errors introduced in  transit, which were caused  by (for instance) dust on the surface  of the CD or cosmic rays. A code is  good if it allows the  detection and correction of many errors without incurring the  expense of excessive redundancy.  This award funds both a search  for good codes and an investigation into the mathematical  limitations of how good they can be."

For many interesting surfaces, there is little contact between the algebraic geometry of the surface and Seiberg-Witten theory.  However, for ruled surfaces, there is a close connection between Seiberg-Witten theory and certain questions in classical algebraic geometry.  If the ruled surface is a product, then the description of the Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces is related to Brill-Noether theory for curves, in both its deformation-theoretic and enumerative guises.  If the ruled surface is more general, the Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces are connected to questions concerning stable rank two vector bundles over algebraic curves.  One problem is whether the Hilbert scheme of a general ruled surface is  smooth.  This problem is related to a famous example of Mumford, which says  that every irreducible curve on a general ruled surface has positive self-intersection.  A second question in classical algebraic geometry is  to study various enumerative loci in the moduli space of stable bundles where the Hilbert scheme is not smooth or does not have the expected  dimension.  Another set of questions involves studying the classification of symplectic 4-manifolds, which in many ways should be similar to the classification of algebraic surfaces.     Algebraic geometry is an old branch of mathematics which studies the solutions to polynomial equations in the plane or in space.  It is important to study the solutions in complex numbers to such equations, in order to see more of the geometry of the solutions. Over the last fifty years, new methods in algebra, analysis, and topology have led to deep results in this theory.  Since an algebraic surface depends on two complex numbers and hence four real numbers, it is a four-dimensional object and thus is important physically,  since the universe of space-time has four dimensions.  Recent ideas  from physics have led to deep breakthroughs relating the topology of an algebraic surface to its geometry.  These methods have also led to progress in the understanding of four-dimensional objects with a geometry connected to classical mechanics, which are called symplectic 4-manifolds."

To this end, unimodular  multiplicative functions are to be viewed as characters on the group, and a systematic study made of their value distribution on arithmetic progressions with large differences. Besides their intrinsic interest and applicability in number theory, the methods to be employed offer a theoretical approach to various algorithms used in the fast factorization of large numbers;  hence, these methods bear on public encryption.

This investigation will exploit the rich interplay between Number Theory and Combinatorics. The problems to be investigated either have their origin in Combinatorics or have immediate application to Combinatorics, yet the problems themselves are Number- Theoretic. Roughly speaking, the problems in this investigation can be  divided into two parts. The first part concerns the distribution of the character sums occurring as eigenvalues of Ramanujan graphs and their  connection with eigenvalues of Hecke operators. The PI will continue her investigation of the Kloosterman conjecture over rational function fields. This conjecture implies that certain Kloosterman sums are eigenvalues of Hecke operators over function fields. The proposed approach includes the  study of L-functions attached to curves over function fields and their  connection to L-functions attached to representations. The second part is to obtain good results for partial character sums defined using additive and multiplicative characters of p-adic fields. If established, these bounds will have immediate applications in information theory to design better families of periodic sequences with low partial correlation. The  proposed approach is a combination of the investigator's technique in estimating full character sums involving characters of p-adic fields  and estimating partial character sums involving characters of finite  fields. The PI plans to give a graduate course on ""Number Theory with  Applications"" in 1996-97, which will include her past work in this area as well as the results from this proposal.

A common theme is that such behavior is surprisingly  nice in important ways, and that this is often because there is a  substantial amount of approximate independence in appropriate  probability spaces associated with the system in question. The  project thus seeks to understand both properties of said  probability spaces and their consequences for combinatorial  problems.The heart of the  project is concerned with asymptotic  normality and related issues. Roughly, the investigator seeks to  show that various combinatorially-defined  random variables are  always approximately normally distributed in the  absence of  trivial obstructions to such behavior. Recent work of the   investigator suggests the possibility of such a phenomenon in  some  surprisingly general and unstructured situations. It is  hoped that  satisfactory answers to some of these questions,  involving so-called ""canonical"" or ""hard-core"" distributions,  will support new directions in the development of the powerful  probabilistic method of combinatorics,  which seeks to apply  probabilistic ideas to resolve non-random combinatorial problems.  This work also opens new possibilities for the interplay between  probability and questions about the relation between integer  programming problems and their associated linear relaxations. We  may take asymptotic agreement of integer and linear optima as a  definition of nice ""long range behavior"" since linear programming  problems are computationally tractable and integer programs are  generally intractable. Then, very roughly, a good solution to the  linear version of a problem gives a  ""canonical distribution""  which can be used to randomly generate or prove  existence of a  good solution to the original problem. This idea is thought to  have considerable potential.    This research is in t he general  area of Combinatorics.

The straightforward way to analyze a position is to examine all of its options and all the options of these options and all the options of the options of these options and all the.... The obvious difficulty is that this exhausting search through the game-tree takes an enormous amount of time even for very simple games (exponential running time in terms of the board-size). Note that the game-matrix approach, the set-up of traditional game theory, is much worse: usually requiring double exponential time. A desperate attempt to make up for the lack  of time is to study the random walk on the game-tree. Now the basic idea of the probabilistic theory of the investigator is that  the probabilistic analysis of the random walk (i.e. the random game)  is often a tractable problem, and also what one has learned from this analysis can often be converted, via potential arguments (like resource counting with loss-probabilities), into deterministic optimal strategies. The probabilistic theory is basically a game-theoretic  adaptation of the so-called Probabilistic Method in Combinatorics  applied to hopelessly complicated games where algebraic and other exact methods fail to work. The surprising thing is that this desperate attempt turns out to be very successful for large, interesting classes of positional games. The main chapters of the proposal are: the foundations of positional games (a surprisingly non-trivial task), game-theoretic Ramsey theory, game-theoretic random graph theory, game-theoretic Lovasz Local Lemma, and applications in algorithms and complexity.  Traditional game theory, i.e. von Neumann's theory, is basically the theory of games of incomplete information. It provides good insights to Economics, and many areas of social science (Management, Military Strategy, etc.). Similarly, one can expect many new applications from a successfu l theory of games of complete information (i.e. positional games). This is exactly what the investigator's proposal is all about. An extremely exciting aspect of studying positional games is that it might give a better understanding of how human intelligence works. It might have some impact on fundamental questions like whether human understanding is a computational or a non-computational process. Note that in Japan there are several ""perfect"" players who, when playing first, can consistently win Go-Moku (5-in-a-row on the 19 by 19 Go board), but nobody can turn these heuristics into precise arguments. Similarly, 6-in-a-row on a sufficiently large board between two reasonably good players is always a boring draw-game, but again we cannot precisely explain why. Or what is the reason that Go-playing computer programs are nowhere close to the best human players? These are just three of many examples where the human mind ""knows"" something beyond rigorous mathematics. One more thing: in contrast to Go, the best Chess-playing computer programs have now reached the level of human Grandmasters. But there is a basic difference. Computer programs examine millions of positions before deciding what to do next. On the other hand, even the best Grandmasters do not search more than 100 positions per move. In human Chess, pattern recognition plays a more important role than search. How to supply this human knowledge to a computer is a puzzle that no one has solved yet. Beside its theoretical importance, the investigator's project could be a crucial step toward the solution of these questions, too."

Work of the proposer   with J. Horvath describing isotropy groups of actions of GLn on   products of flag manifolds associated to tame quivers will be used   to study the occurrence of dense orbits in actions associated to   wild quivers.Instances of the First Fundamental Theorem of Invariant  Theory for some low dimensional reducible actions analyzable by means   of multiplicity-free actions will be investigated. A major goal  will be an investigation of certain rings important for understan-   ding tensor products and related questions. It has been proved in some   cases, and is suspected in others, that these rings may be free as   modules over certain natural polynomial subrings. The description of   nice bases for these free modules may provide insight into the   Littlewood-Richardson Rule and related formulas. As time permits,   investigations of the ordinary geometric import of geometric invariant   theory, and of the Plancherel Theorem of  p-adic groups via Hecke   algebras, may also be undertaken.      Expository Abstract: In mathematics, one is often interested in   objects which may be different, but may be equivalent for some   purposes. Thus, in elementary geometry there is the notion of   congruence: two triangles, or other figures, are congruent if one   may be moved so as to fit exactly over the other. In an industrial   context, congruence is the idea underlying interchangeable parts.   The idea of invariant theory is to provide numerical criteria for   two objects to be equivalent, with respect to whatever is the   relevant notion of equivalence. Thus, two triangles are congruent   exactly when the lengths of their sides are the same triple of   numbers. The numbers which may be used to determine whether or not   two objects are equivalent are called *invariants(it)*. Invariant   theory seeks to f ind invariants for geometric configurations. This   project seeks to apply invariant theory in new directions. It will  look for systems of invariants for some new classes of configurations,   and it will also attempt to find some new structure in some of the most   important systems of invariants. Symmetry will be heavily exploited,   and systems whose structure is very strongly determined  by symmetries will form the central objects of investigation."

To a log variety one can associate various numerical invariants (for instance discrepancies and selfintersection numbers), and these invariants exhibit very interesting behaviour. For ordinary varieties these invariants are integers, but for log varieties they are rational numbers. In many cases not all rational numbers arise this way, and it is crucial to understand the set of rational numbers that arise.

(1)  Linear systems on higher dimensional varieties. One of the basic tools in investigating the geometry of an algebraic variety is to study the properties of the linear systems on the variety. Ein (jointly with R. Lazarsfeld) proved a conjecture of Fujita on the freeness of a large class of adjoint linear systems on threefolds. They would like to apply the new techniques developed in studying this conjecture to study singular divisors and  the geometry of the special subvarieties. In particular they plan to study the singularities of the theta divisors on abelian varieties.  They would also like to extend their results on linear systems to higher dimensions and to study questions on very ampleness.  (2) Local positivity of ample line bundles and Seshadri constants.  The Seshadri constant is an important invariant that measures the local positivity of an ample line bundle.  Ein would like to work on the conjecture that the Seshadri constant is greater or equal to one for a general point x in our projective variety.  (3) Syzygies of algebraic varieties.

(4) Subvarieties  od generic complete intersections.  Ein has proved a result that all the subvarieties of a generic complete intersection of high degree are of general type. This result has recently been improved by Voisin.    Ein would like to extend the result to study the deformations of subvarieties of a generic complete intersection while the complete intersection variety is a Calabai-Yau manifold.

The hypergeometric function is one of the most  important special functions in mathematics and mathematical  physics.  Many of the functions that arise in various branches of  mathematics and physics-Bessel, Legendre, and Jacobi functions,  and many interesting orthogonal polynomials-are special cases of   the hypergeometric function.  Similarly, the q-hypergeometric  functions arise in the study of mathematical physics.  The  investigator has introduced an analogue for function fields, and  he will develop their theory and applications.  A classical  problem in Number Theory is to understand the nature of the  values of the Riemann zeta-function.  Euler showed that the   values at even integers s are rational multiples of powers of pi.  For odd s, the only known result is that the zeta-function is  irrational at s=3.  Carlitz considered an analogue of the  zeta-function by taking a sum over monic polynomials with  coefficients in finite fields, and established an analogue  of  Euler's result.  In the joint work with Anderson, the PI showed  that for  any positiveminteger s, the values are logarithms of  algebraic numbers, and are therefore transcendental.  It was also  shown that the analogue of Euler's  result for odd s does not  hold in this case.  The proposer plans to generalize thismresult  to general function fields.  The order of vanishing of zeta   functions gives important arithmetic information.  The PI plans  to complete  new partial results that he has obtained about these  orders. Also, the PI  plans to workmout the relations of special  values with the cyclotomic theory, in light of recent work of  Anderson.  The special values of the classical gamma function  have also been extensively studied.  The PI introduced a new   gamma function for function fields.

Over the last few years, the investigator has  developed a refinement of this method by bringing in descent in a  precise way. Until now, his work on this method has been restricted to  Fermat curves. He will now consider more general applications of this method, and will develop results of independent interest in multivariable Iwasawa theory and in the Iwasawa theory of p-adic representations.  Broadly, the refinement of the method of Coleman and Chabauty consists of two parts. The first is the construction of an element of a certain Selmer group attached to the Jacobian of the curve, and the second is the transformation of this element via a sort of explicit reciprocity  law into a p-adic analytic function that vanishes on the rational  points of the curve. The second part has, in the case of Fermat curves, yielded a new and beautifully geometric argument for Fermat's Last Theorem (not just the second case) for those primes p for which the necessary Selmer group element exists. The investigator has already proved that the necessary element exists when p is regular. The effort to construct it more generally has led to some interesting results in multi-variable Iwasawa theory. The investigator will continue to work on this line of inquiry, both for its independent interest and for its potential application to the general method.    This project falls into the general area of Arithmetic Algebraic  Geometry-a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: Number Theory and Geometry.

One of the   main themes in this project involves the study of  (so called) singular unitary representations using a   technique we call transfer which ""moves""  unitary representations between real forms of the same   complexification.  To implement this idea one must have   very detailed information on the restriction of   representations to (generally non-compact) symmetric   subgroups.  This analysis is of interest in its own right   and has led (and will lead) researchers (including the PI)   to surprising generalizations of Howe's theory of reductive   dual pairs to exceptional groups.  It will also lead to   confirmation of special cases of some remarkable   conjectures of B.  Gross and D.  Prasad.  Another key   direction of this research involves the continued study   of the module theory of the ring of invariant polynomial   differential operators on a reductive Lie algebra.  This   work has already led to a new interpretation of the   Springer correspondence.  The new direction here will   involve some sort of ""relative Springer correspondence"".

For   example the detailed analysis of one singular representation   (by Kostant and his coworkers) has led to new solutions to   Einstein's equations.  Representation theory of the type   studied in this  project is also an important ingredient in the   Langland's program of which one very small part due to Wiles   led to his (Wile's) proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."

This basis promises to be a central element in the connnection between Representation Theory and the Theory of Special Functions. The investigation is a continuation of a project that the investigator and his collaborators have pursued for more than four years. The main object is to understand the Representation Theoretical and Special Function Theoretical properties of this new basis. Earlier joint work with M.

An extensive computer calculation carried out by the investigator and his collaborators produced a variety of conjectures.

The corresponding monodromy representations are also important in this study.  Zariski studied the case of zero-dimensional hypersurfaces (points on the projective line), where the fundamental group is the braid group of the sphere and the corresponding representations include the permutation and  Burau representations.

It is common in algebraic geometry to consider the quotient of a variety by an algebraic group.  Recently Keel and Mori proved that a quotient exists as an algebraic space under quite eneral conditions.  In particular there is a geometric quotient whenever the family of stabilizers is finite.  One goal of the project is to extend these results, in particular to allow for positive dimensional stabilizers.  This would have applications to moduli problems, and also to coarsely representing Artin-stacks.  One of the principal invairants of smooth projective varieties are the plurigenera, the number of global sections of various tensor powers of the canonical bundle (the dual of the top exterior power of the tangent bundle).  A main conjecture is that plurigenera all vanish iff the variety is covered by images of the projective line.  One of the principal results of Mori's program is the proof of this in dimension three.    There is a notion of plurigenera for open (i.e. quasi-projective) varieties as well (the so called log plurigenera), and it has been conjectured by Keel and McKernan that these vanish iff the variety is dominated by images of the affine line.  Keel and McKernan recently proved this in dimension two, and one of the goals of this project is to consider the case of dimension three.  An interesting special case is that of a smooth affine three-fold.  Harshorne conjectured that if smooth subvariety of a smooth projective variety has ample normal bundle, then some multiple moves in a large dimensional family.  This is known to be false in general, but remains open for curves.  One goal of the project is to consider the case of a curve in  a  three-fold.  A preliminary result has been obtained by considering hypersurfaces with high multiciplicity along the curve, and it is hoped that the  results can be extended."

This will have important consequences in the theory of Eisenstein series and global liftings. In particular, he plans to prove a definitive reducibility criterion for representations induced from irreducible quasi-tempered generic representations of Levi subgroups of these groups in terms of L-functions.

It states that the standard modules whose Langlands quotients are generic are irreducible. These are parts of a joint project with W. Casselman. As his second and third problems, he will continue his work on the tempered spectrum of classical groups (with D. Goldberg) and their residual spectrum (with H. Kim). He also plans to prove the equality of certain coefficients defined by two different methods (Rankin-Selberg and Langlands-Shahidi) as well as the study of different approaches to understanding poles of L-functions using the second method. He will also try to establish certain identities satisfied by normalized intertwining operators, extending his results from the tempered case to the non-tempered ones.

The research falls in the general mathematical area of the Langlands program.The Langlands program is part of Number Theory, which is the study of the  properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics.

It is natural to try to represent a graph by drawing, or embedding, it in a surface, in such a way that no edges of the graph cross. The natural surface in which to try to embed a graph is the plane, and embedding in the plane is equivalent to embedding in the surface of a sphere. Many graphs cannot be embedded in a sphere, but can be embedded in other surfaces obtained by attaching handles, or mathematical devices known as crosscaps, to a sphere.  This  investigation will deal with three facets of graph embeddings in surfaces.  (I) Certain embeddings of a graph in a surface are nicer than others. In particular, a desirable feature of an embedding is that each of the  regions into which the graph divides the surface, or faces, has no hole and touches no vertex more than once. Embeddings with this property are called  strong embeddings. The Strong Embedding Conjecture (SEC) says that any graph  satisfying a necessary condition (2-connectivity) has such an embedding.  This is closely related to another very important problem in graph theory,  the Cycle Double Cover Conjecture. The investigation will: first, extend the  range of graphs for which the SEC is known to be true; second, consider the  local structure of strong embeddings with a view to determining what makes  them possible, and third, examine other parameters of an embedding which may  be useful for changing other embeddings into strong ones.(II) In working  with embeddings on a surface, it would be very useful to be able to cut the  surface into smaller pieces and investigate embeddings of pieces of the  graph on these less complicated surfaces. The cut must follow edges of the  embedded graphs to be helpful; the edges of each cut form a separating  circuit of the embedded graph. This investigation will increase current  knowledge about the circumstances under which separating circuits exist. (III) A very important question in graph theory is whether it is poss ible to traverse a graph in such a way that every vertex is visited, under given restrictions. If the restrictions are first, to end up where the traversal began, and second, to visit no vertex no more than k times, the result is  called a k-walk in the graph. Knowing that a graph can be embedded in a particular surface can, in conjunction with other conditions, guarantee the  existence of a k-walk for certain values of k. The proposed research will determine conditions for the existence of k-walks in graphs embedded on surfaces, in particular surfaces of negative Euler characteristic, i.e.,  with at least 2 handles or 3 crosscaps.    This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications. For example, the design of large  networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of  algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research."

Two of the problems will  take a major effort to  solve.  The first problem is to find  necessary and sufficient conditions for a given edge-colored copy  of the complete graph on n vertices (Kn) to be embedded in an  edge-colored copy of Kv in such a way that the subgraph induced  by the edges of each color form a connected spanning k-regular   subgraph of Kv.  This would be a companion to existing results  with either drop the requirement that the subgraphs are connected  or replace it with the requirement that they be 2-edge connected.  The second problem is to show that any partial Mendelsohn triple  system of order n and index l can be embedded in a complete  Mendelsohn triple system of order v and index l for some v not  exceeding 2n+1.  This is a directed version of Lindner's   conjecture, a conjecture which has now been proved for triple  systems of even index using amalgamation techniques.  This  progress in the undirected case suggests that the directed  analogue is ready to be solved.  Amalgamation techniques are of  interest in their own right, and warrant further study. Other  problems will be studied.  The investigator will consider the  graph H(C) naturally arising from a Hamming code C and attempt to  show that H(C) has a hamilton decomposition and is pan-cyclic.  The investigator also plans to make contributions to the growing  literature on graph designs.  This research is in the general  area of Combinatorics.

It has flourished during the last half of the twentieth century, especially in this country.  The recent interactions with physics have brought a new energy to the field, since we have learned that very classical problems - like counting the numbers of plane curves passing through a given set of points - are intimately related to ideas like mirror symmetry in modern physics.  This is another example of a problem that seemed to be of purely theoretical interest in mathematics that has turned out to have unexpected connections with another subject, to their mutual benefit.

In this  methodology, as developed by Paul Erdos, one proves the existence of a  combinatorial object by showing that a suitably defined random object has  the desired properties with positive probability. Closely aligned is the   study of Random Graphs and other Random Structures. Also closely aligned is   the analysis of Randomized Algorithms in Computer Science. A particular set  of problems in this investigation involve radom greedy algorithms, which  combine all of these elements. Asymptotic packing is a problem of current  interest. Given a family of objects, one wants a disjoint subfamily, a   packing, taking up as much space as possible. Results over the past decade  have given general conditions such that almost all of the space can be  covered. This project considers bounds on the amount of space not covered.  Recent years have seen the use of more subtle probability methods in this  area. Martingales have long been a powerful tool for probabilists, but  now we are seeing how to use them to give strong bounds on discrete   problems. The Lovasz Local Lemma and probability inequalities of Jason and  Talagrand are used to good effect. Random algorithms are analyzed via   birth processes and differential equations. The percolation of the random  graph when average degree is near one is analagous to bond percolation in  the plane near critical probability. For random graphs, the appropriate  reparameterization is known. For bond percolation on the n by n grid, an  analogous result is in sight. The random graph percolation also corresponds  to a birth process with the expected family size near one. This gives new  insight into the random graph model and led to a surprising connection  between enumeration of graphs and a conditional form of Brownian motion.    This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of  Combinat orics is to find efficient methods to study how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged.

In a prior supported project, the PI exploited this link to prove theorems on the deformations of Galois representations and the structure of Galois groups, particularly of  unramified extensions. This project will exploit these ideas further with an eye towards proving further cases of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture and towards elucidating the structure of deformation spaces of Galois  representations.

The investigator has solved several important problems in graph theory, some in collaboration, including a 1970 conjecture of Grunbaum, a 1972 conjecture of Nash-Williams, and a 1975 conjecture of Plummer. The highlights are the solution of a conjecture of Thomassen about Hamilton cycles in locally planar triangulations of surfaces and the solution of a conjecture of Robertson and Thomas; both have opened up new directions for research. The investigator  will extend the techniques of finding ""Tutte paths"" and cutting surfaces developed in solving the above mentioned problems to attack some other important problems about Hamilton cycles in graphs in surfaces. One such example is an old conjecture of Barnette, which states that every 3-connected cubic plane graph in which each face is bounded by at most 6 edges contains a Hamilton cycle. This problem is related to molecular structures of certain organic compounds in Chemistry. Another problem is the conjecture of Grunbaum (1970) and Nash-Williams (1973) that every 4-connected toroidal graph contains a Hamilton cycle. The investigator will also work on a conjecture of  Dirac (1964) about K5-subdivisions. Dirac's conjecture is equivalent to the conjecture that every 5-connected non-planar graph contains a K5-connected subdivision. One approach is to characterize all 4-connected graphs containing a K4-subdivision with prescribed  degree three vertices. This problem is related to designing communication networks. Finally, the investigator was able to solve the rooted K4 problem for planar graphs; he would like to extend the techniques used for planar graphs to attack the general rooted K4  problem.

First,  the principal investigator proposes to continue his work, joint with D. Bump and J. Hoffstein, to obtain information about automorphic L-functions through the systematic study of certain naturally  occurring Dirichlet series in two complex variables. These L-functions are not themselves Euler  products, but their individual coefficients are Eulerian. These series arise  as integrals of Rankin-Selberg type, possessing meromorphic continuation and functional equation.  The integrals may be analyzed by local representation- theoretic methods, and the Dirichlet series coefficients related to  L-functions.  The properties of the integral are then used to obtain  properties of the L-functions. The principal investigator will  investigate integrals on certain orthogonal and symplectic groups and on  their metaplectic covers, which should give analytic information concerning  such objects as twists of GL(2) automorphic forms by cubic characters, mean  squares of twists by ideal class characters of quadratic extensions, and the  nonvanishing and mean size of quadratic twists of the standard L-function  associated to an automorphic representation on GL(3).The study of more  general sums of L-functions, involving more than two complex variables, is  also anticipated. Second, the principal investigator proposes to investigate  the Euler products associated with higher degree metaplectic automorphic  forms.  The existence of such Euler products is predicted by the hypothetical correspondence between metaplectic forms and non-metaplectic ones; however,  they have only been exhibited in a few cases.  There are two such Euler  products known on covers of GSp(4), one on the double cover due to the  principal investigator and Wong, and the second on the triple cover due to  the principal investigator's student T. Goetze.  The principal investigator  proposes to first give these works less computational foundations by   connecting them  to the theory of non-unique models presented by Rallis and  Piatetski-Shapiro, and then to use this new approach to generalize them to  covers of degree higher than 3, and to groups other than GSp(4). This work  will probably be joint with D. Bump. Third, the principal investigator will  continue to work on the relative trace formula. This formula, which combines  period considerations arising from integral expressions of $L$-functions with Langlands functoriality, should ultimately allow one to establish in many  cases that L-packets contain generic members.In a recently completed massive  project, the principal investigator and Jacquet have proved the fundamental  lemma for one such formula. Fourth, in recent work with D. Goldberg, the  principal investigator has begun to use certain models which are not  Whittaker models to deal directly with non-generic representations on  orthogonal and unitary groups.  It is proposed to use these models to  establish both local results (e.g. Langlands conjecture on Plancherel  measure) and the global continuation of many L-functions arising from  Eisenstein series a la Langlands-Shahidi, even for non-generic  representations of these groups.    This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons.

The  Relative Trace Formula (as initiated by Jacquet) is a new tool for   studying automorphic L-functions and functoriality in the Langland's  program. Rader and S. Rallis have been collaborating to prove some  of the local results they think necessary to make the Relative  Trace Formula a theorem instead of just a collection of examples. They  have shown that many of the results known for usual character and   central orbital integrals generalize to the case of spherical characters  and double coset integrals on certain p-adic symmetric spaces. They  plan to expand their research to include spherical subgroups such in  the sense of M. Brion. Although it will take many years to complete  such a project, it seems to be the natural domain for relative trace  formulae, because (probably) one dimensional representations of H occur  in irreducible smooth infinite dimensional representations of G with  finite multiplicity. Rader also plans to complete a collaborative effort  with Marie-France Vigneras investigating the geometric Zelevinskii   involution for nilpotent orbits in certain Lie algebras. This should have  applications in constructing modular representations of Hecke algebras,  after Kazhdan-Lusztig.    The Langlands program is part of number theory. Number theory is the  study of the  properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of  mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have  furnished  a driving force in creating new mathematics in other  diverse parts of the  discipline. The Langland's program is a  general philosophy that connects  number theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern approach to the  study of whole numbers.   Modern number theory is very technical and deep,  but it has had  astonishing applications in areas like theoretical   computer science and coding theory."

On the other hand, investigations in combinatorial mathematics are at times hampered because the objects get large so quickly that it is hard to view them or to gather any data about them. This investigation continues work on efficient combinatorial  generation and counting, with a new emphasis on classical problems  in combinatorics. Novel application of recursive decomposition  techniques have been the key to results in earlier phases of this  work. The results and techniques will be applied to address directly  some outstanding structural problems in related areas of  combinatorics, graph theory, and group theory. Specifically, the  investigator will address open problems in combinatorial Gray codes,  efficient listing algorithms for several combinatorial families,  efficient algorithms to count and tabulate combinatorial families,  Hamilton cycles in vertex transitive graphs and Cayley graphs,  asymptotic and bijective relationships between certain families of  integer partitions, and matchings and symmetric chain decompositions  in posets of partitions and permutations.  This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of  the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of  studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged.

Among these representations, the supercuspidal  representations have always played a distinguished role as  building blocks.  One way to construct them is via induction from  compact open subgroups, and this has led to the philosophy of  studying admissible representations of a reductive group by  restricting them to appropriate compact open subgroups.  Bushnell  and Kutzko have applied this philosophy with great success to the  general or special linear groups; this has led them to formalize  it via the very general notion of S-types.  This approach has  also been successful in studying the smooth representations of an  arbitrary reductive group that contains a fixed vector under the  prounipotent radical of some parahoric subgroup (the ""level zero  case"").  Finally, preliminary results suggest this approach can  work more generally for other groups.  The PI will continue his  investigations in this area, and in particular, he will consider  the following topics: (a) The study of S-types for classical  groups; in particular the classification of the admissible dual  of classical groups, (b) Applications of (a) to the study of the  reducibility of generalized principal series of classical groups  and related arithmetic, (c) Further study of problems arising  from the level zero case; in particular, the classification of  the level zero part of the  admissible dual in terms of Langlands  parameters and applications of level zero S-types to the study of  reducibility and R-groups.  The Langlands program is part of  number theory.  Number theory is the study of the properties of  the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics.  From  the beginning problems in number theory have furnished a driving  force in creating new mathematics in other diverse parts of the  discipline.  Th e Langland's program is a general philosophy that  connects number theory with calculus; it embodies the modern  approach to the study of whole numbers.  Modern number theory is  very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing applications  in areas like theoretical computer science and coding theory."

Finally, the  solution is  reconstructed through a   recombination of the  components.The Fourier series and Fourier  transform are    examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the other   representing   a continuous decomposition.

The PI is in possession now of a number of techniques which make it possible to approach at least some of the ""hard"" motivic conjectures. These conjectures can be divided into two classes depending on whether they deal with rational or finite coefficients. The goal of the research described in this proposal is to understand the structure of the ""Motivic world"" for finite coefficients.  It turns out that the usual ""motivic t-structure"" intuition does not work in the finite coefficients case. One of the possible replacements for it seems to be the ""chromatic"" intuition which was very successfully employed in algebraic topology in the last decade. This approach was used in the recent PI's preprints where it was shown that a number of standard conjectures about motives with finite coefficients could be solved if we had a good definition of algebro-geometrical analogs of the higher Morava K-theories.    To construct these theories seems to be a nontrivial but relatively straight forward problem. The steps to be taken include the description of the cohomological operations in motivic cohomology, construction of algebraic cobordisms through an algebro-geometrical analog of Thom spectrum, computation of its ""coefficients ring"" using ""motivic"" Adams spectral sequence and finally the formal construction of algebraic Morava K-theories from the algebraic cobordisms.

First, the investigator will extend existing work on irreducibility and degree of Severi varieties to varieties parametrizing plane curves with singularities other than nodes. Second, he will apply recently developed techniques to describe certain hyperplane sections of these varieties, with possible applications to questions (such as the Enriques conjecture) concerning the Picard groups of these varieties and of the universal curves over them. Finally, the investigator will attempt to use the same ideas to analyze a related question, that of the dimension of the linear series of plane curves with singularities at assigned general points.    This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry deals with very basic objects, figures that can be defined in the plane and in space by the simplest equations, namely polynomialsis.

At the same time it is one of the newest, having had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. Within algebraic geometry, perhaps the most basic and most thoroughly studied subject is that of algebraic curves, that is, curves in the plane defined by a single polynomial equation in two variables.

Regular Galois realizations in one variable over Q have been studied extensively by Belyi, Malle, Matzat, Thompson, and others. The investigator's recent book gives an introduction to that theory, and the forthcoming book of Malle and Matzat gives a complete description of all known results. On the other hand, very little is known about such realizations in r variables when r is bigger than 1. This investigation will further explore the case of r greater than 1. Geometrically, this means studying fundamental groups of complements of hypersurfaces W in projective r-space. More specifically, it means looking at finite quotients of such fundamental groups and deciding when the complements of W are defined over the rational numbers. The main body of proposed work is in the case where W is a Coxeter arrangement (of hyperplanes in affine space) or its quotient by the corresponding Coxeter group. To show that a covering of the complement of such W is defined over the rationals, two methods are available. The first is to interpert such a covering as a moduli space for covers of the Riemann sphere, and the second involves using a  higher-dimensional rigidity criterion. Another part of this project is quite different from the rest. This is a joint project with M. Fried  about Galois realizations in non-zero characteristic p.   This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and  communicat ion systems."

Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods  to study how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The  behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern  communications. For example, the design of large networks, such  as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of  algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of  objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.

The present project will expand this approach to include the model theory of modules with an endomorphism, or equivalently - the model theory of modules over the ring of polynomials.  Also to be considered are (1) first-order variants of the Brauer-Thrall conjectures for an artin algebra, and (2) a theory of homology for positive-primitive formulas.    This research involves the connection between logic and algebra.  Logic provides the context in which one can study the expressive power of mathematical language; as such it is an essential tool in computing.  Algebra provides a vehicle for understanding notions such as symmetry and mappings, and finds application in sciences and manufacturing.  Professor Herzog's research takes place in a part of algebra called module theory, which is akin to, but broader than, linear algebra.  The problems which arise are similar to solving systems of linear equations.  By forging the relationships between logic and algebra, his research will provide new understanding of modules."

Many problems that arise in diverse mathematical disciplines can be distilled into related problems about finitely presented groups. One of the major developments of the decade beginning in the mid 1950s has been the proof that almost all questions about such finitely presented groups are algorithmically undecidable. Nevertheless, the very importance of these groups makes it essential to try to obtain at least partial information about them. In particular, although problems about finitely presented groups are unsolvable in general, it may be possible in a number of specific instances to solve such problems. In order to gain some insight into these problems, it is often necessary to try to carry out some experiments and computations with finitely presented groups. Such experiments and computations are very time-consuming and usually impossible to carry out by hand. This project aims to make such experiments and computations possible by using very fast computers. enabling one to gather enough information together about many important problems to facilitate their solution. The project creates and implements a package of group-theoretical algorithms and procedures, which can be run by means of a graphical user interface and which is easily accessible by a widevariety of users. Groups are mathematical entities that encapsulate, among other things, the intrinsic meaning of symmetry. This explains,in part, why they turn out to be a very important tool in physics, chemistry, biology and other mathematical disciplines. The understanding of these ""groups"" provide insight into these disciplines, as well as a means for studying them. For example, groups play an essential role in quantum mechanics and particle physics and they also provide a means for studying the space people live in. Many of these groups have seemingly simple descriptions, even though t hey themselves can be very complicated. This complexity helps to explain why, for example, certain important parts of chemistry and biology are so difficult. They also give rise to new problems and provide for solutions to problems in theoretical computer science, cryptography and other fields. Their ubiquitousness and usefulness make the creation of a software package that will lead to a deeper understanding of many of them an extremely important enterprise."

This award provides support dor a conference on the Langlands program. The objectives of the conference are (1) to bring the ideas of Langlands before a wide mathematical audience; (2) to describe recent developments in major areas of the Langlands program; (3) to attempt to anticipate future directions of work on the problems making up the Langlands' program. The Langlands program is part of number theory. Number theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have furnished a driving force in creating new mathematics in other diverse parts of the discipline. The Langland's program is a general philosophy that connects number theory with calculus; it embodies the modern approach to the study of whole numbers. Modern number theory is very technical and deep, but it has had astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer science and coding theory."

They are an ingenious and highly original answer to the questions raised by the famous 12th problem of Hilbert. Hayes has given constructive proofs of the abelian Stark conjectures in function fields using the theory of Drinfield modules. He hopes to apply insights gained from the function field setting to number fields. Hayes has shown that the Brumer-Stark units over a number field satisfying Leopoldt's conjecture can be aligned into a Hecke character. In this project, he will attempt to prove the existence of further Hecke characters analogous to the well-known Jacobi sum characters introduced by A. Weil. The existence of such character is intimately related to the invariance under base change of the Brumer-Stark axioms, which is as yet unproved. Since Stark's conjectures are based upon the special value of partial zeta functions at zero, it is important to understand what such special values mean. Haye has given one interpertation of this special value over a real quadratic number field. He will try to extend this interpertation to the special values at negative integers and to arbitrary totally real number fields. Finallly, Hayes will also continue his work with Drinfield modules of rank one using the insights gained from the computation of Drinfield modules associated to hyperelliptic functions fields. This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems."

In the past few years a number of significant advances have taken place in several different branches of computational algebra and number theory. Because of the growing interdependence between the different branches, an algorithmic advance in one area often has a major impact on the performance of algorithms in other areas. Consequently, the meeting brings together workers from some of the key areas, including researchers working on software development as well as those using these tools. The conference is intended to inform algorithm designers and users of recent developments in cognate areas of computational algebra, number theory, and geometry and inform key theoretical mathematicians of the possibilities offered by the computational algebra tools that are now becoming available. It is also expected to identify desirable algorithm and software developments that would result in significant new applications in the near future. The conference promotes the use of the techniques of computational algebra in application areas such as digital signal processing, complex system design, network design, cryptography, coding theory and applied combinatorics. Algebra studies basic questions about discrete structure and symmetry in the world. Theoretical results from this branch of mathematics help chemists understand the spectra of organic molecules, physicists organize families of elementary particles, and engineers solve systems of equations. Algebraic invariants are used to answer biochemists' questions about knotting in DNA and anthropologists have even used algebraic classifications to organize native artifacts in the southwestern U.S. For many years mathematicians have studied algebra with little more than their imaginations and a pencil and paper. But now, computers allow researchers to work with larger and more complicated situations tha n were possible in the past. Computational algebra is the general title given to these research efforts. However, to use a computer in mathematical research requires the development of specialized software -- a task that can be time-consuming for the typical researcher. One way to address this need is through systems such as Magma which provide easy access to state-of-the-art algorithms in a number of fields of study. Another important process is to encourage researchers to share their experiences (and even software) through conferences such as this; the interaction at a conference often leads to adaptation of ideas and development of new directions. These tools enable theoretical researchers to explore more complicated situations, to gain insight in unfamiliar settings, and to compute answers to larger problems. Computer-based work on primality testing and factoring of large numbers is showing direct application to cryptography and security. Work in finite geometries and designs are providing improved techniques for error-detection and data compression. These have a large impact on everyone's use of computers and communications."
