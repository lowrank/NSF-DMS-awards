"0701771","Arithmetic of Varieties Without Rational Points","DMS","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM","07/01/2007","04/22/2013","Peter Clark","GA","University of Georgia Research Foundation Inc","Standard Grant","Andrew Pollington","09/30/2013","$94,969.00","","pete@math.uga.edu","310 E CAMPUS RD RM 409","ATHENS","GA","306021589","7065425939","MPS","1264","0000, OTHR","$0.00","Abstract for the award DMS-0701771 of Clark<br/><br/>The fundamental problem of interest is that of acquisition of rational points on algebraic varieties: given a variety V over a number field K, describe the set of finite field extensions L/K such that V has L-rational points, or has points everywhere locally over L.  The P.I. seeks to understand what sort of acquisitive behavior is possible -- e.g., what are the possible indices of a curve of genus g over K?  Can elements of all orders occur in the Shafarevich-Tate group of an elliptic curve over K, or over a small degree field extension? -- and also what happens generically -- e.g. what is the Zariski-closure of the locus of curves having points everywhere locally but not globally on the moduli space of all curves of genus g?  Particular attention is paid to modular curves, including Atkin-Lehner twists and Shimura curves, which provide a natural proving ground for more general conjectures.  These investigations are fueled by tools from Galois cohomology, field arithmetic, Fuchsian groups, spectral theory, p-adic geometry and deformation theory, and thus provide a welcome incentive to interact with and learn from many other researchers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The P.I.'s research is in the general area of mathematics known as Diophantine geometry: given a system of polynomial equations, one wishes to find all integer solutions.  The evident first question -- to determine whether there exist any solutions at all -- has proven to be quite daunting (in fact, algorithmically impossible) in general, so until recently most research has assumed the existence of at least one solution and then attempted to study the structure of the set of all solutions.  However, it seems that ""most"" systems of equations do not have any integral solutions, so the greater part of Diophantine diversity has gone unstudied.  These ""pointless varieties"" have a rich intrinsic geometry -- there are geometric phenomena that can only exist in the absence of integral solutions -- and their study is closely connected to many other problems in related fields.  The P.I.'s research program consists both in a general study of pointless varieties -- including working towards several conjectures on their ubiquity -- and in pursuing connections and applications, for instance to the structure of Shafarevich-Tate groups of abelian varieties.<br/><br/><br/>"

Classical Schubert calculus, a branch of enumerative algebraic geometry concerned with counting subspaces satisfying certain intersection conditions, is the outcome of the solution to Hilbert's Fifteenth problem. In the modern formulation, Schubert calculus is usually interpreted in cohomology theories of homogeneous spaces, most notably flag varieties. The full development of affine Schubert calculus will solve long-standing open problems in Macdonald theory and have an impact on physical questions, such as generalizations of Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory models and extensions of Calogero-Sutherland quantum mechanical models whose eigenfunctions are k-Schur functions. The new approach to affine Schubert calculus is made possible by the recent discovery of certain explicitly defined symmetric functions called k-Schur functions. The k-Schur functions, which arose in the study of the seemingly unrelated Macdonald theory, were recently shown to be connected to the geometry and topology of the affine Grassmanian. The novel combinatorics of k-Schur functions will be exploited to deduce formulae for various multiplicities, including intersection multiplicities in the affine Grassmannian and the affine flag manifold. Some of these multiplicities are known to occur in Macdonald theory and as Verlinde fusion coefficients for the WZW model.<br/><br/>This many-faceted project involves and ties together various problems from combinatorics, geometry, representation theory, physics, and computation. The main questions that will be addressed can be viewed from several points of view: a geometric perspective (questions such as ""how many lines are there satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions?""), a combinatorial perspective (""how many elements are in given sets and what properties do these sets have?""), a physics perspective (""how do fields correlate?""), and computational aspects (""are there efficient algorithms for calculating these numbers or objects?""). The project is an international cooperative research venture, with core group members located in Canada, the United States, Chile, and France, and interdisciplinary, involving mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists. Graduate students will receive professional training by direct involvement in the research and will benefit from interaction with the research team. A summer school at the Fields institute for graduate students is also planned at the conclusion of the project. The investigation is largely fueled by extensive computational experimentation. The robust implementation of algorithms derived from the project, will lead to the development of new packages for computer algebra systems. The dissemination of this new software through an open-source computational package, will not only advance the proposed research program but will also have an outreach impact on the mathematics, physics, and computer science communities.<br/>"

Our main goal  is to study arithmetic properties of X like finiteness of R-equivalence classes, weak approximation and Hasse principle for X defined over a 2-dimensional field:- number fields and function fields of surfaces over real and algebraically closed fields are examples of this class of fields. In the case of number fields, the subject is well-understood, thanks to the results of Harder, Kneser, Borovoi, Sansuc, Colliot Th\`el\'ene, and others. The main impetus for the study in this generality came from a conjecture of Serre concerning the existence of rational points on principal homogeneous spaces under semisimple simply connected linear algebraic groups over fields of  cohomological dimension 2. Thanks to a result of P. Gille, the conjecture for groups of type E_8 over function fields of surfaces over algebraically closed fields would follow if one proves cyclicity of prime degree division algebras over such function fields. Cyclicity of prime degree algebras is a wide open question for a general ground field. We propose to study the structure of division algebras over function fields of surfaces with a view to understanding cyclicity. While looking for rational points on principal homogeneous spaces, one comes across the weaker question of finding  zero cycles of degree one. It is an open question whether the existence of zero cycles of degree one implies existence of rational points on principal homogeneous spaces.<br/>This question has an affirmative answer for number fields and we propose to investigate this question for a general field, with special reference to arithmetic like fields.<br/><br/><br/>The study of homogeneous spaces under linear algebraic groups encompasses the study of interesting algebraic structures--quadratic forms and involutorial division algebras which are associated to classical groups and Cayley and Albert algebras which are associated to exceptional groups. The study of these structures permeates through several areas of mathematics like Number Theory, Representation Theory and Algebraic Geometry. The study of quadratic forms--homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 --has a long and rich history. The classical theorem of Hasse-Minkowski reduces the existence of nontrivial zeros of such a polynomial to solutions of certain congruences modulo primes.<br/>Our objective is to study these algebraic structures over fields which share certain `cohomological properties' in common with number fields, for example, the function fields of surfaces over real or complex numbers. We propose to investigate arithmetic properties of algebraic structures like quadratic forms and involutorial division algebras over this class of fields where arithmetic techniques like class field theory and reciprocity laws are not available.<br/><br/>"

First, the PI intends to continue his program to explicitly verify the full conjecture in many specific cases using explicit computations with Iwasawa theory, Euler systems, L-functions, and Galois cohomology; this work simultaneously motivates the development of new algorithms and the refinement of existing theorems.  Second, the PI plans to carry out a theoretical and computational study of properties of Kolyvagin's Euler system of Heegner points, with the hope of carrying forward several of the ideas Kolyvagin left unfinished in the early 1990s.<br/><br/>Elliptic curves play a central role in modern number theory and arithmetic geometry.  For example, Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's Last Theorem by showing that the elliptic curve attached by Gerhard Frey to a counterexample to Fermat's claim would be attached to a modular form, and that this modular form cannot exist.  Our understanding of the world of elliptic curves is extensive, but many questions remain unresolved.  Perhaps the most central unsolved problem is the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, which relates many of the arithmetic invariants of an elliptic curve.  The goals of this project are to provide substantial new data, techniques, and ideas relevant to attacks on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.<br/><br/>"

The Langlands program studies the interrelations between several subjects, including the representation theory of reductive groups (both over local fields and over the adeles of a global field), automorphic forms, global Galois representations, and L-functions.  Each of these subjects has a p-adic aspect:<br/>one may consider p-adic or adelic groups acting on topological p-adic vector spaces, p-adic automorphic forms (or their close cousins, cohomology classes with p-adic coefficients on arithmetic quotients of symmetric spaces), p-adic representations of Galois groups and their deformation theory, and p-adic L-functions.  The proposed investigation will encompass all these.  Some of the particular results expected to follow from this investigation are: new results on the modularity of two-dimensional p-adic representations of the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers,  and the construction of several variable p-adic L-functions attached to p-adic families of modular forms.<br/><br/>Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies phenomena related to properties of whole numbers.  A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest.  The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions.<br/>The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form.  (Number theorists refer to Langlands conjectured relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ``reciprocity law''.)  Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic methods to study his conjectures. <br/>These are methods that exploit the many symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics known as ``the Langlands program''.  A more recent approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods.  These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms and L-functions.   Recently, the representation theoretic methods and p-adicmethods have begun to be unified into a so-called ``p-adic Langlands program''. The proposer aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, to use them to establish new results about L-functions, and, in particular, to establish new reciprocity laws.  <br/><br/><br/>"

The ordinary representation theory of the symmetric group is closely related to that of the general linear group through classical work of Schur and others. Recently this relationship has been extended to the modular representation theory, and even more recently to the corresponding cohomology. Although this interplay can lead to new results in either direction, it is especially useful in studying the symmetric group, where many of the basic problems remain completely open.  The investigator will continue to refine and improve techniques to exploit this important relationship in order to obtain results in both areas. Recently Parshall and Scott proved that the celebrated Lusztig conjecture, in the case of the general linear group, is equivalent to a problem entirely in the realm of symmetric group representation theory. Meanwhile breakthroughs by Brundan and Kleshchev, Ariki, Grojnowski and others have led to a ``Lie-theoretic"" approach to the symmetric group theory which is very different from the original approach of Gordon James and others. Together these developments suggest the next few years will be very exciting indeed in this field.<br/><br/>This project is in an area of mathematics known as representation theory, in particular the representation theory of finite groups. Problems involving groups and their representations arises naturally in many diverse fields, including mathematical physics, chemistry, error correcting codes, cryptography and others.

Specifically, it aims to find a unifying theory of pseudocodewords of codes on graphs, by introducing a new decoder for such codes.  Currently, there are three notions of pseudocodeword in the literature: graph cover pseudocodewords, which correspond to codewords in codes defined by finite covers of the Tanner graph of the original code; linear programming pseudocodewords, which are rational points in the fundamental polytope of the parity check matrix of the code; and computation tree pseudocodewords, which are valid configurations on computation trees for the Tanner graph of the code.  While most of the research in the literature has focused on graph cover pseudocodewords and linear programming pseudocodewords (and, in particular, Vontobel and Koetter have shown that these two notions are essentially the same), Wiberg proved that it is computation tree pseudocodewords that actually are the impediments to correct decoding. <br/>The new decoding algorithm proposed in this project provides a precise link between computation tree pseudocodewords and the other two notions of pseudocodewords, thus allowing existing results on graph cover and linear programming pseudocodewords to be modified to apply to computation tree pseudocodewords.  This in turn provides an explanation for the empirical performance results for capacity achieving codes.<br/><br/>Claude Shannon's famous 1948 paper ""A Mathematical Theory of Communication"" and its channel coding theorems spawned the body of research referred to as Coding Theory.  The 1993 discovery of turbo codes and the 1996 re-discovery of low density parity check codes represent a major milestone in coding theory.  These two classes of codes come equipped with iterative message-passing decoding algorithms under which they can achieve realistic bit error rates with signal-to-noise ratios that are only slightly above the minimum established by Shannon's theorems.  As such, these codes are sometimes considered to have solved, in the engineering sense, the coding problem for the additive white Gaussian noise and similar channels. However, the decoding algorithms for these codes are far from completely understood, and the codes which perform best in simulations thus far are randomly constructed.  Therefore, the coding problem remains very much unsolved in the mathematical sense.  The primary goal of this project is a better understanding of the decoding algorithms, with an aim toward methods of constructing codes which are guaranteed to perform well.<br/>"

The PI proposes to utilize geometric methods to study the representation theory through the use of support varieties. For Lie superalgebras, this approach provides a beautiful homological interpretation of the well-studied combinatorial notions of defect and atypicality. <br/><br/>Representation theory emerged about 100 years ago with the pioneering work of Frobenius and Schur, and has become a central area of mathematics because of its connections to combinatorics, algebraic geometry, number theory, and applications to physics. Cohomology theories were developed throughout the 20th century by topologists to construct algebraic invariants for the investigation of manifolds and topological spaces. Cohomology was also defined for algebraic structures like groups and Lie algebras to determine ways in which their representations can be glued together. Even more striking is how the cohomology of algebraic structures can be used to introduce the underlying geometry, which is not seen at the representation theoretic level, into the picture. The PI has been actively promoting the working knowledge of cohomological methods in representation theory and has recently organized several conferences in the area with an emphasis toward the development of junior mathematicians.

The first is to prove that the zero locus of an admissible normal function on a complex algebraic variety is algebraic. Such normal functions arise in connection with the Hodge conjecture as follows: Let X be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 2n and L be a very ample line bundle over X. Then, a primitive Hodge class on X defines an admissible normal function over a Zariski open subset of the complete linear system attached to L. The second objective is to establish the existence of the limiting periods of the relative completion of the fundamental group of a smooth complex algebraic variety with respect to tangential base points and use the results to study iterated integrals of modular forms.<br/>The unifying theme between these two projects is the study of the asymptotic behavior of variations of mixed Hodge structure. <br/><br/>A period integral is a generalization of the integral of an algebraic function over an algebraic set. Such integrals have long been of importance in geometry, number theory and physics. By allowing the integrand and/or domain of integration to depend upon parameters in an appropriate way, such period integrals define holomorphic functions on the parameter space. In general, these period functions are not algebraic. Nonetheless, the zero locus of certain systems of period integrals arising in algebraic geometry (normal functions) are expected to be algebraic. The first goal of this proposal is to study the asymptotic behavior of period functions, and use the results to prove the algebraicity of the zero locus of a normal function. In a similar spirit, Dr. Pearlstein plans to use the study the asymptotic behavior of period integrals to study the special values of certain important functions arising in number theory.<br/>"

These include the Horn functions (defined by Appell and Horn around 1880), the hypergeometric functions of matrix arguments (introduced by Bochner and Herz around 1950, used in multivariate statistics), the hypergeometric functions associated to root systems (due to Opdam and Heckman in the middle 1980s, connected to dynamical systems and representation theory), and the A-hypergeometric functions of Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky (dating from the late 1980s, used in algebraic geometry, especially mirror symmetry). Although these functions seem at first glance to be unrelated to each other beyond the obvious fact that each contains the one-variable Gauss hypergeometric functions as a special case, some nontrivial connections among them have been found.  This project aims to study each of the aforementioned multivariate hypergeometric theories, developing them as tools for researchers across mathematics; to generalize known connections between them and to find new ones, potentially building new bridges between the areas each hypergeometric class belongs to; and to advance the theory of algebraic D-modules (the natural framework in which to study hypergeometric equations), as well as discrete and toric geometry (which provide the extra structure that makes hypergeometric systems special).<br/><br/>The study of hypergeometric functions in one variable was started over two hundred years ago. This is a beautiful and interesting theory in its own right, but its importance lies in its many uses in both pure and applied mathematics, as well as in physics, engineering and statistics. Most familiar functions, from the elementary sine and cosine to the more sophisticated Bessel functions, are hypergeometric. Hypergeometric functions in several variables also arise naturally in many contexts. For example, it was a famous problem to find an expression for the roots of a polynomial of degree five in terms of their coefficients which uses only radicals, generalizing the quadratic formula for the roots of ax^2 + bx + c = 0 in terms of a, b and c. The first complete proof that this cannot be done was given by Abel in 1824, and a few years later, Galois found exactly which polynomials admitted solutions by radicals. Still, the question remained: what kind of functions do we need to use instead of radicals in the general case?  Mellin answered this question in 1921 by showing that the roots of polynomials are hypergeometric functions of the coefficients.  The goal of this project is to further the study of hypergeometric functions in several variables, which are now at the forefront of research in many areas, but for which much less is known than in the one variable case.<br/>"

Through a series of interrelated problems, the PI investigates properties and statistics of various combinatorial structures, including permutations, involutions, matchings and set partitions. By a variant of the RSK algorithm from algebraic combinatorics, matchings and set partitions are in one-to-one correspondence with oscillating and vacillating tableaux, which are certain random walks in the Hasse diagram of the lattice of integer partitions. Recently there have been major breakthroughs in understanding the statistics of such tableaux. Many unexpected and deep connections have been obtained with such areas as representation theory and random matrix theory. The proposed research concentrates on the combinatorial properties behind these connections, in particular, on the properties of crossings and nestings in matchings and set partitions, which are natural extensions of increasing and decreasing subsequences in permutations. The PI will study the problems from the following aspects: pattern avoidance, filling of Ferrer shapes and growth diagram, generating functions, and asymptotic distribution.<br/>She will also extend the theory to general graphs, chord configurations, and filling of certain polyminos. In this research, some algorithm plays an important role in understanding the evolution of combinatorial patterns and structures. This algorithmic approach is a particular emphasis of the project.<br/><br/>This research is in the general area of combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods for arranging, enumerating,<br/>  and manipulating discrete collections of objects. The proposed research is right aimed at these goals. The PI uses a combined algebraic and algorithmic approach to understand the formation and growth of discrete structures, which will help develop new methods and techniques in combinatorial theory. The proposed research are closed connected to other areas of mathematics, including analysis, representation theory, random matrix theory, and free probability theory.  Results from this project would have direct applications in computer sciences, electronic engineering, operation research, and statistics.<br/><br/>"

Classical Schubert calculus, a branch of enumerative algebraic geometry concerned with counting subspaces satisfying certain intersection conditions, is the outcome of the solution to Hilbert's Fifteenth problem. In the modern formulation, Schubert calculus is usually interpreted in cohomology theories of homogeneous spaces, most notably flag varieties. The full development of affine Schubert calculus will solve long-standing open problems in Macdonald theory and have an impact on physical questions, such as generalizations of Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory models and extensions of Calogero-Sutherland quantum mechanical models whose eigenfunctions are k-Schur functions. The new approach to affine Schubert calculus is made possible by the recent discovery of certain explicitly defined symmetric functions called k-Schur functions. The k-Schur functions, which arose in the study of the seemingly unrelated Macdonald theory, were recently shown to be connected to the geometry and topology of the affine Grassmanian. The novel combinatorics of k-Schur functions will be exploited to deduce formulae for various multiplicities, including intersection multiplicities in the affine Grassmannian and the affine flag manifold. Some of these multiplicities are known to occur in Macdonald theory and as Verlinde fusion coefficients for the WZW model.<br/><br/>This many-faceted project involves and ties together various problems from combinatorics, geometry, representation theory, physics, and computation. The main questions that will be addressed can be viewed from several points of view: a geometric perspective (questions such as ""how many lines are there satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions?""), a combinatorial perspective (""how many elements are in given sets and what properties do these sets have?""), a physics perspective (""how do fields correlate?""), and computational aspects (""are there efficient algorithms for calculating these numbers or objects?""). The project is an international cooperative research venture, with core group members located in Canada, the United States, Chile, and France, and interdisciplinary, involving mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists. Graduate students will receive professional training by direct involvement in the research and will benefit from interaction with the research team. A summer school at the Fields institute for graduate students is also planned at the conclusion of the project. The investigation is largely fueled by extensive computational experimentation. The robust implementation of algorithms derived from the project, will lead to the development of new packages for computer algebra systems. The dissemination of this new software through an open-source computational package, will not only advance the proposed research program but will also have an outreach impact on the mathematics, physics, and computer science communities.<br/>"

There are also many applications, especially to the structure and representation theory of finite groups, finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras, algebraic groups and supergroups, and to quantum groups and infinite dimensional Lie algebras. There are eight specific projects detailed in the proposal, many of which are linked together by the idea of categorification. Several projects in the proposal are concerned with finite W-algebras, which have emerged in the last few years as important objects in surprisingly diverse branches of mathematics and mathematical physics. There are also projects studying blocks and equivalences between them in various contexts, including Broue's conjecture. Finally there is one project discussing applications to Aschbacher's maximal subgroups program.<br/><br/><br/>Broadly speaking, finite group theory and Lie theory are concerned with studying the symmetry of complicated structures. The idea of representation theory is to understand such complicated symmetries by studying the shadows of these symmetries in simpler structures that are already understood. One of the motivations for the problems in this proposal is to explain observed numerical coincidences between the representation theory of various quite different objects such as blocks of finite group algebras and Lie algebras in terms of equivalences between the underlying categories. This point of view leads naturally to the idea of categorification in which combinatorial invariants are replaced by categorical ones.

The tools used to attack these problems include Galois and flat cohomology, Galois descent, root systems, and J. Tits's constructions of exceptional groups.<br/><br/>The family of semisimple groups includes familiar matrix groups like special linear and special orthogonal groups.  These groups appear in many areas of mathematics, and may be viewed as an essential outgrowth of the linear algebra developed in the early 1800s and now taught to undergraduates.  The groups became prominent objects of mathematical interest in the late 1800s via Sophus Lie's famous general theory of Lie groups.  In algebra, the notion of semisimple group unifies various historically distinct areas of study.  For example, it connects Jordan algebras -- discovered by physicists in the early 1900s -- with quadratic forms, which were studied by the Babylonians."

Professor Lyubeznik is going to continue to study these (and some other) questions by using methods that have been successful in the past as well as developing some new methods.<br/><br/>It is always fascinating when a connection is discovered between two very different fields of mathematics because it can result in unexpected and significant discoveries inaccessible by the methods of only one of those two fields. This project is in the areas of mathematics known as Abstract Algebra and Algebraic Geometry, with connections to Topology. Abstract Algebra is a vast generalization of high school or college algebra, think of it as the algebra of many simultaneous polynomial equations in many variables. Algebraic Geometry gives a way of studying the solutions to such a system of equations as a geometric object. Topology is the study of those properties of geometric objects that don't change when the object is stretched or twisted, as if it were made of rubber. Over the last fifteen years ""local cohomology,""<br/>an algebraic tool used in all three areas, has been shown to have some striking connections with a number of very different areas, including differential equations and others.

A variety of previously studied examples have been organized into a coherent framework. The emergent structures serve to both suggest natural generalizations---often with applications to analytic number theory---and point towards unexpected connections with such diverse areas of mathematics as the spectral theory of automorphic forms, arithmetic of function fields, the geometry of affine root systems and combinatorial representation theory. Many applications in analytic number theory have been found and many more are expected. These include moment estimates and convexity breaking for L-functions over an arbitrary number field, nonvanishing results for L-functions over number fields and function fields and results on the nature of the mysterious Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series and higher order theta functions. Moreover, during the past several years the combined efforts of the investigators have demonstrated that Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series have a beautiful structure that was previously unknown, and by elucidating this structure, new connections with other areas of mathematics are rapidly emerging. The grant will fund continued investigation of these rapidly developing areas. In addition, two workshops are planned for the dissemination of these results and new techniques to research mathematicians and graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Number theory began thousands of years ago and was initially inspired by questions about prime numbers. Dirichlet series are infinite series, such as the Riemann zeta function, and are a primary tool in the study of prime numbers. More recently they have come to fore by providing interconnections between many diverse areas of pure mathematics and physics.  Multiple Dirichlet series are simply Dirichlet series in several variables -- they have the merit that the number theoretic quantities they measure can themselves be Dirichlet series, in particular L-functions, which are fundamental objects that can be associated with many classes of number-theoretic data, such as elliptic curves, representations of Galois groups, or modular forms.<br/>"

He has also been working with Andrei Rapinchuk to find the extent a locally symmetric space of finite volume is determined by the set of lengths of its closed geodesics, or its spectrum.

A second set of problems involves using multiplier ideals and related tools from higher dimensional geometry to study some questions of an essentially local nature.

The estimated total number of moves in Chess is more than ten-to-the-hundred, which is more than the number of particles in the observable universe. The majority of problems in Discrete Mathematics lead to cases studies of the same size.  Statistical Mechanics faces the same problem: a mole of gas contains about<br/>ten-to-23 particles; the underlying dynamic is incredibly complicated. The basic idea of Statistical Mechanics is to work with a priory probabilities; usually equiprobability in the phase space (it is counterintuitive: how does probability enter Newtonian mechanics?).  The investigator develops a<br/>Tic-Tac-Toe Theory which is a striking analog of the Statistical Mechanics approach: it can determine the exact value of infinitely many natural Game Numbers (the same paradox: how does probability enter Chess?).

To integrate this new branch of game theory (the investigator's Tic-Tac-Toe Theory) into math education is an extremely promising aspect.

Our objective is to strengthen the mathematical framework for studying these physical applications, and to identify and explore problems in algebra and geometry that are of relevance to the development of high-energy contemporary physics."

This relationship can be viewed as a kind of highly nontrivial functoriality in Gromov-Witten theory. Such instances of functorial behavior are quite rare and therefore very interesting. Ciocan-Fontanine proposes to significantly broaden the study of this abelian/nonabelian correspondence in several different directions. Specifically, the correspondence will be extended to higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants, and a version of the correspondence in terms of bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves will be explored. Further, some new and nontrivial examples will be studied. A second project deals with several applications of the derived moduli spaces introduced several years ago by Ciocan-Fontanine and Kapranov to the study of Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants of some classes of projective varieties. For example, a construction of derived versions of the moduli of sheaves appearing in DT-theory is proposed. In the crucial rank one case, it is expected that a variant of the construction will lead to a very concrete expression of the virtual fundamental classes in terms of known complexes of bundles on simple varieties (products of Grassmannians). Using this expression, Ciocan-Fontanine will investigate the DT-theory of hypersurfaces in projective 4-space, about which little is known at the present time.<br/><br/>This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, a highly developed branch of modern mathematics. In recent years, the methods and ideas of algebraic geometry, especially the study of moduli spaces, have been employed in string theory, a very active part of theoretical physics. Developments in string theory have  sparked a fruitful interaction between the two communities of researchers and have led to the discovery and study of many unexpected new phenomena. The theories of Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants (and the exciting conjectural relations between them) are particularly striking examples.<br/>"

Remmel <br/><br/>Abstract: <br/>The PI plans to pursue research in three different areas: the application of symmetric functions to permutation enumeration, the combinatorics of Macdonald polynomials, and rook theory. In the area of permutation enumeration, the PI plans to extend the work of Brenti, Remmel, Beck, Langley, Mendes and Wagner who have shown that many old and new generating functions for permutation statistics over the symmetric group, hyperoctahedral group, and the wreath products of cyclic groups with the symmetric group can be derived by applying suitable homomorphisms to simple symmetric function identities. One goal of this research project will be to extend the homomorphism method to new classes of symmetric functions and new symmetric function identities. A second area of research in this project is to study various combinatorial aspects of the Macdonald Polynomials. For example, in recent work, Haglund, Haiman, and Loehr gave a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients that arise in the expansion of the modified Macdonald polynomials in terms of quasisymmetric functions and gave a combinatorial interpretation of non-symmetric Schur functions. The PI plans to study the algebraic meaning of the coefficients that appear in the quasisymmetric function expansion of the modified Macdonald polynomials and related polynomials in the context of Garsia-Haiman modules. Last year, Mason defined a modification of  the famed Robinson-Knuth-Schensted correspondence which can used to prove  various identities for  non-symmetric Schur functions. Recent work of Haglund, Mason, and the PI has lead to the discovery of  a new family of such correspondence which allow one to give a uniform proof of many properties of these correspondences. The PI plans to continue the study of these correspondences. Finally the PI also plans to study applications of a new rook theory model developed by the PI and his student B. Miceli. This new rook theory model allows one to prove a quite general factorization theorem for rook polynomials that specializes to many such factorization theorems that have appeared  in the literature. The PI will research further applications of this new rook theory model.<br/><br/><br/>Each of three proposed research areas, the applications of symmetric functions to permuation enumeration problems, the combinatorial aspects of Macdonald polynomials, and the new combinatorial models for rook theory, are currently active areas of research and have many connections with other areas of mathematics. For example, the combinatorics of symmetric functions have played a key role in many areas of mathematics including the theory of polynomial equations, the representation theory of finite groups, Lie algebras, algebraic geometry and the theory of special functions. Since their introduction in 1988, Macdonald polynomials have been intensely studied and have found applications in special function theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, group theory, statistics, and quantum mechanics.

For example, one focus of the investigator's work will be the continued development of support varieties for complex Lie superalgebras.  These geometric objects provide links between the representation theory, cohomology, and combinatorics of these algebras.  Additionally, he intends to investigate questions involving the modular representations of the symmetric group and related algebraic objects.<br/><br/><br/>This project is in the area of mathematics known as representation theory.  Algebraic structures such as groups and Lie algebras arise in nature as the symmetries of some object.  Thus it is natural to study these objects in terms of how they interact with other mathematical objects.  This is the point of view of representation theory.  Because of the insight it provides regarding the underlying structure and symmetries of an object, it is not surprising that representation theory has proven valuable in other areas of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, cryptography, networking, computer graphics, and art.  This proposal focuses on ``super'' versions of these algebraic objects;  that is, ones which involve both symmetries and anti-symmetries.  Inspired by their usefulness in mathematical physics, mathematicians have found that super algebraic objects play an important role similar to their classical counterparts.  The investigator expects this trend to continue as new applications of ``super'' representation theory are discovered.<br/>"

Each function in a family satisfies a Riemann hypothesis with finitely many possible exceptions. Moreover, when the parameter is not too large, the functions have approximately the same number of zeros as the zeta or L-function, the zeros are all simple, and consecutive zeros repel. One may therefore regard them as models of the zeta-function or L-function. In fact, if the Riemann hypothesis holds for an L-function, the zeros of functions in the corresponding family tend to those of the L-function as the parameter increases, and between zeros on the critical line the functions tend to twice the L-function. The main goal of this project is to investigate the new functions further in order to gain insight into the behavior of the Riemannn zeta-function and L-functions and into connections between their zeros and the prime numbers. One project is to investigate how well the models approximate L-functions in a transitional region close to the critical line. Another is to study the approximations for a particularly important range of the parameter. In several projects the proposer will use the models to try to understand problems that have so far resisted other treatments, such as how the zeros of the derivative of the zeta-function are distributed.  The present line of inquiry gives finite Euler products a more prominent role than previously in analytic number theory, so another goal is to study such products anew, particularly their moments. This is quite difficult from the traditional point of view, but the prposer's recent work leads to a new approach. A second and separate set of projects aims at furthering our understanding of the distribution of primes and zeros of L-functions. One is to explore connections between the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble hypothesis, the distribution of primes, and mean values of the zeta-function. Another is to calculate the discrete number variance and other statistics for the zeros of the zeta-function. A third project is to develop discrete mean values formulas for long Dirichlet polynomials and use these to estimate the size of gaps between zeros of the zeta-function.<br/><br/>The projects proposed all address fundamental problems in analytic number theory: the distribution of prime numbers, the distribution of zeros of L-functions, and the general behavior of L-functions. Prime numbers are the ultimate building blocks of arithmetic, and therefore much of mathematics, so understanding their properties is of basic importance. Many of these properties are encoded in the Riemann zeta-function and other L-functions, and that makes these important objects of study as well. Most of the projects proposed center on the investigation of functions recently constructed by the proposer to model L-functions and capture their basic features. The structure of these simpler functions makes it clear why they behave as they do, thereby providing insight into the behavior of the actual L-functions. The remaining projects study the primes, L-functions, and their connections more directly.<br/>  <br/><br/>"

A variety of previously studied examples have been organized into a coherent framework. The emergent structures serve to both suggest natural generalizations---often with applications to analytic number theory---and point towards unexpected connections with such diverse areas of mathematics as the spectral theory of automorphic forms, arithmetic of function fields, the geometry of affine root systems and combinatorial representation theory. Many applications in analytic number theory have been found and many more are expected. These include moment estimates and convexity breaking for L-functions over an arbitrary number field, nonvanishing results for L-functions over number fields and function fields and results on the nature of the mysterious Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series and higher order theta functions. Moreover, during the past several years the combined efforts of the investigators have demonstrated that Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series have a beautiful structure that was previously unknown, and by elucidating this structure, new connections with other areas of mathematics are rapidly emerging. The grant will fund continued investigation of these rapidly developing areas. In addition, two workshops are planned for the dissemination of these results and new techniques to research mathematicians and graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Number theory began thousands of years ago and was initially inspired by questions about prime numbers. Dirichlet series are infinite series, such as the Riemann zeta function, and are a primary tool in the study of prime numbers. More recently they have come to fore by providing interconnections between many diverse areas of pure mathematics and physics.  Multiple Dirichlet series are simply Dirichlet series in several variables -- they have the merit that the number theoretic quantities they measure can themselves be Dirichlet series, in particular L-functions, which are fundamental objects that can be associated with many classes of number-theoretic data, such as elliptic curves, representations of Galois groups, or modular forms.<br/>"

In the real numbers if you add the exponential function, the definable sets are still geometrically simple, but in the complex numbers you can construct infinite discrete sets like the integers.  In this case it is unknown if the sets constructed can be arbitrarily complicated.  Possibly, all the sets arise from simple pieces.

We plan to turn this success into a method that delivers results for a much wider class of growth models while broadening the connection of the subject to other domains of mathematics and mathematical physics.<br/><br/>"

Of particular interest are modular forms that are of cohomological type but are not associated to Shimura varieties, especially modular forms over an imaginary quadratic field K. In this case, the associated symmetric space quotients are hyperbolic manifolds of real dimension 3, and thus, the study of such forms is not amenable to the usual techniques of algebraic geometry. A long-term goal of the project is to establish the modularity of elliptic curves over K, adapting the method of Taylor-Wiles to this setting. Modular forms over K can be thought of geometrically as cohomology classes of certain local systems on arithmetic 3-manifolds. From a topological viewpoint, the cohomology of arithmetic 3-manifolds has been intensely studied in relation to such questions as Thurston's ""Virtual Positive Betti Number Conjecture."" However, in number theory, these cohomology classes have conjectural associations to motives and Galois representations. The tension between these different perspectives makes this a fertile area for interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wiles' famous work on Fermat's last theorem established a correspondence between two classes of disparate objects: elliptic curves, given by polynomial equations of degree three in two variables, and modular forms.Associated to each elliptic curve is a modular form, which is like the DNA of the corresponding elliptic curve: many properties of the elliptic curve can be determined directly from the modular form. An emerging theme in number theory (and beyond) in the last twenty years is the Langlands program, a vast generalization of this correspondence. In the Langlands program, one considers algebraic varieties, which are finite collections of polynomial equations of arbitrary degree, and automorphic forms, which, like modular forms in the classical case, play the role of algebraic variety DNA. For example, given a set of equations, one would like to know if there exist infinitely many solutions where all the variables are integers. Conjecturally, one can determine this directly from the corresponding automorphic form by computing whether a particular integral vanishes. The Langlands program is still, in many respects, in its infancy --- we neither know exactly how to relate systems of equations, in general, to automorphic forms, nor have we ""cracked the code"" for understanding how to extract useful information from automorphic forms, or have even determined all the components from which automorphic forms are built. Nevertheless, this broad area of study promises to be a guiding problem in number theory for the foreseeable future.<br/>"

Its aim was to explore the interaction between<br/>several directions in noncommutative geometry: index theorems,<br/>noncommutative calculus and operads, relations to mathematical<br/>physics, to number theory, and to the geometric Langlands<br/>program. An important objective was to highlight the subjects<br/>that are strong in the Chicago area (algebraic geometry, motives,<br/>microlocal analysis, representation theory, geometric Langlands<br/>program, mirror symmetry) and investigate their links to the<br/>works in what is more traditionally considered noncommutative<br/>geometry, and vice versa. For example, an algebraic approach to<br/>loop spaces that is used in the geometric Langlands program and<br/>in representation theory of real groups was compared to the<br/>topological string theory which is related to algebraic topology<br/>and mathematical physics, as well as to an approach to the<br/>representation theory of p-adic groups. A relation was<br/>established between these subjects, in particular string<br/>topology, and current research on motives. Several approaches to<br/>a conjectural relationship between noncommutative geometry and<br/>mirror symmetry were presented.<br/><br/>Noncommutative geometry is an extension of the classical geometry<br/>to ""spaces"" in which coordinates x, y, etc. no longer commute,<br/>i.e. where the identity xy=yx is not necessarily true. Such<br/>""spaces"" abound in mathematics and physics. For example,<br/>noncommutativity is the mathematical manifestation of the<br/>Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics: if x<br/>stands for a position of a particle and y for its momentum, you<br/>cannot know precise values of both x and y. In a more<br/>mathematical context, noncommutativity is an expression of the<br/>fact that, if you apply two transformations to an object, the<br/>result depends on the order in which you do it. Mathematical<br/>situations where noncommutativity occurs have been known for a<br/>long time but the idea to treat them as ""noncommutative spaces""<br/>and to study them by geometric methods is relatively recent. One<br/>of the successes of this approach is a radical simplification of<br/>the standard model in quantum field theory by means of allowing<br/>the space to be noncommutative. The aim of the conference was to<br/>compare several approaches to noncommutative geometry, as well as<br/>its links to other areas of mathematics and physics.

An important feature of L-functions is that their values at certain special points - these values are often called `special values' - are expected to be the orders of algebraic quantities associated to the data defining the L-function. The investigator aims to prove the existence of such relations for various classes of L-functions, drawing especially on the theory of automorphic forms. Automorphic forms are closely connected to both analysis (they are a rich source of L-functions, conjecturally all) and algebra.

Multiple Dirichlet series are simply Dirichlet series in several variables -- they have the merit that the number theoretic quantities they measure can themselves be Dirichlet series, in particular L-functions, which are fundamental objects that can be associated with many classes of number-theoretic data, such as elliptic curves, representations of Galois groups, or modular forms.<br/>"

One case of particular interest is in genus 1, where the PI is studying mixed motives associated to elliptic curves. With Makoto Matsumoto (Hiroshima University) the PI is studying the action of the absolute Galois group on the Malcev completion of the fundamental group of a once-punctured elliptic curve and also on the relative completion of the corresponding mapping class group. With Gregory Pearlstein (Michigan State) the PI is studying variations of mixed Hodge structure over moduli spaces of elliptic curves and their relationship to iterated integrals of modular forms recently defined by Yuri Manin. The Galois and Hodge structures are parallel and the PI expects each approach to illuminate the other. In other projects, the PI and his collaborators are developing general machinery needed to study the case of elliptic motives. On the Galois side, Matsumoto and the PI are proving basic results about Galois actions on completions of arithmetic mapping class groups. On the Hodge side, Pearlstein, Terasoma and the PI are developing fundamental mathematical tools for studying general classes of variations of mixed Hodge structure over complex algebraic varieties.<br/><br/>Motives encode deep connections between the theory of whole numbers, integrals of certain algebraic functions and topology.  Each of these theories has its own set of symmetries, and all are related through the theory of motives. The PI, together with his collaborators and students, are investigating the interactions of these symmetry groups that are associated to ``elliptic curves'', which are curves defined by cubic polynomials. Although this work is foundational, it has potential applications to cryptography and pseudo random number generation. Indeed, the PI's principal collaborator, Matsumoto (Hiroshima University), is an established expert in these subjects.<br/>"

The first group of problems is related to investigation of the structure of the category of finite dimensional representations of current algebras and Yangians. There is a remarkable connection between graded representations of current algebras and module categories of quasi-hereditary algebras. On the one hand, this allows one to use the power of representation theory of finite dimensional associative algebras to study the structure of indecomposable finite dimensional representations of current algebras. On the other hand, existence of certain families of indecomposable representations for current algebras, such as restricted Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules, is expected to yield interesting families of finite dimensional associative algebras. Another direction of the PI's work is a study of relations  between realizations of crystal bases of fundamental Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules in the framework of Littelmann's path model, their q- and q,t-characters and the braid group action on the Heisenberg subalgebra of the quantum affine algebra. The PI will also investigate a possibility of constructing an analogue of Littelmann's path model adapted to the study of finite dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras other than fundamental Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules and their tensor products. Finally, he intends to work on developing an analogue of Littelmann's path model for the generalized Kac-Moody algebras, first introduced by Borcherds in his study of the Monstrous Moonshine.  <br/><br/>The study of representations of affine algebras, finite and infinite dimensional, was originally motivated by and is related to problems stemming from mathematical physics, in particular from  conformal field theory, Bethe ansatz, solvable vertex models and affine Toda theory. It also has fruitful interactions with other branches of mathematics, such as knot theory, number theory and especially combinatorics. The beauty of this subject is that, although it has been and is being intensively studied for more than two decades, it does not cease to exhibit surprising new aspects and even more surprising connections with other mathematical disciplines.<br/>"

They are different and yet very closely related. One important instance of combinatorial packing problems is that of graph packing. Graphs of size n pack, if there exists an edge disjoint placement of all these graphs into the complete graph with n vertices. Various classical combinatorial problems can be modeled as packing or covering problems.<br/>For example, the problem of existence of a spanning cycle in an n-vertex graph is the question whether the n-cycle packs with the complement of G. Important examples of packing and covering problems are problems on existence of a given subgraph, coloring problems, Turan-type problems, domination problems and Ramsey-type problems. These examples (and many more) show that (hyper)graph packings and coverings are rather general problems and are rich enough models for many important applications. Areas of application include scheduling, database access, assignment of computer registers, data clustering, computer-aided design of printed circuits, positional games, DNA sequencing, etc.<br/><br/>The main thrust of the project is to explore a series of extremal packing and covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs, with restrictions on degrees of their vertices. It is expected that the results will make an essential step in understanding extremal packing and covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs.<br/>Some proofs can lead to efficient packing and covering algorithms; negative results will impose limits on what can be accomplished. The particular packing problem of equitable coloring has many applications in scheduling, partitioning, and load balancing problems. It will be studied also from an algorithmic viewpoint. A fair amount of the work will be done jointly with graduate students and recent graduates of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."

It is expected to attract upwards of 150 mathematicians, logicians and computer scientists. <br/><br/><br/>Recent years have witnessed increased research activity on the interface between logic and universal algebra. In particular, the use of algebraic methods has proved to be fruitful in the study of non-classical logics - such as modal logic, fuzzy logic, and substructural logics - with ordered structures playing a central role in this relationship. A profound study of the connection between commutator theories and the shapes of congruences lattices of algebras, over any variety, has been completed by K. Kearnes and E. Kiss, and the central open question in the representation theory of lattices, asking whether every algebraic distributive lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of a lattice, has been given a negative solution by F. Wehrung. Methods of universal algebra have generated deep new results on certain decidability questions, and on complexity questions for algorithmic problems in finite algebras. <br/><br/><br/>The conference aims to bring together researchers from all these research fields in order to foster collaboration and further research. The featured areas include, but are not limited to, the following (in alphabetical order): <br/><br/><br/>- Algebraic logic <br/>- Algebraic theory of quasivarieties <br/>- Algorithmic problems in algebra <br/>- Applications of universal algebra to logics <br/>- Binary systems <br/>- Complexity and other algorithmic problems <br/>- Duality theory for algebraic structures <br/>- Finite axiomatizability problems <br/>- Modal logics <br/>- Non-classical logics <br/>- Numerical invariants of locally finite varieties <br/>- Ordered algebraic structures <br/>- Ordered topological spaces <br/>- Representations of lattices <br/>- Residuated structures <br/>- Substructural logics <br/>- Tame congruence theory and applications <br/>- Topological methods in algebra and logic <br/><br/><br/>The scientific program of the conference will include invited lectures, contributed talks and tutorials. The organizers will make strong efforts to ensure a substantial participation by recent Ph.D. recipients and graduate students, for whom attendance at such a meeting can significantly promote career development and integration into the mathematics community. <br/>"

One of the mathematical manifrestation of the duality is the conjecural Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas duality due to Maulik, Nekrasov, Okounkov and Pandharipande. The conjecture relates the generating function for the integrals over the module space of stable curves in the thefolds to the generating function for the integrals over Hilbert scheme of curves in the threfold. At the moment we are able to prove the conjecture for the toric threefolds. To prove the conjecture for the general threefold the relative version of the duality need to be addressed. This is the focus of our research. We also hope to explore the connections between Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas theory and the quantum cohomology of the Hilbert scheme of points on the surface. At the moment these relations are fully understood only for the surfaces which are resolutions of the simple singularities.  <br/> <br/> It is a classical problem in geometry to compute the number of curves satisfying some natural geometric conditions. For example, one can ask how many lines in three-dimensional space intersect four given lines. In this case the answer is either infinity, two or one (depending on the position of thefour lines). The first advances  this type of problems are due to 19 century<br/>italian algebraic geometers. Recent advances are motivated by the new insights coming from physics. In particular String theory and Gauge theory  give two ways of looking at the curves in three-dimensional space. The first theory treats the curves as the traces of the flying closed strings, for the second theory the curve is defined by simultanious vanishing of two equations.<br/>Interplay between this two approaches is in the center of our research."

Pfaffian graphs are important as the problem of enumeration of perfect matchings can be solved in polynomial time in a Pfaffian graph, while the corresponding problem for general graphs is #P-complete. Among other approaches to structural characterization of Pfaffian graphs, the PI proposes to continue his work on a general matching minor theory, an analogue of celebrated graph minor theory of Robertson and Seymour. Such a theory would have many potential theoretical and algorithmic applications beyond the theory of Pfaffian graphs. The PI also proposes to continue his research on three other types of graph theoretical problems. The first one is connected to the Four Color Theorem, a problem that remained open for over a hundred years and lies at the heart of the modern graph theory. The second type of problems involves circular colorings, a relatively new concept that has been studied extensively in recent years and has both practical motivations and theoretical applications to the theory of graph coloring. Thirdly, the investigation of graph theoretical analogues of the results in the theory of Riemann surfaces is proposed. The PI, in collaboration with Matthew Baker, has recently been able to prove a Riemann-Roch theorem for graphs. The Riemann-Roch theorem is widely regarded as the most important result in the theory of Riemann surfaces. The discovery of its analogue demonstrated an interesting connection between Riemann surfaces and graphs and led to further open problems with potential applications outside graph theory.<br/><br/>This work belongs to the area of graph theory. Graph theory can be used to model various objects in diverse fields, ranging from telephone networks and Internet to molecular structures and crystal lattices. The problems considered in this proposal have applications in physics, chemistry and computer science, as well as potential applications to practical problems of periodic scheduling and computer chip design.

A rich source of representations for such groups is the p-adic cohomology of algebraic varieties. The Fontaine-Mazur conjecture predicts precisely which p-adic Galois representations ought to arise in this way. What is remarkable about the conjecture is that the most subtle condition in its formulation involves only the restriction of the Galois representation to the decomposition groups of primes above p. In certain situations Fontaine-Mazur combine their philosophy with that of Langlands, and predict which Galois representations come from modular eigenforms. Recently work on this conjecture has been given new impetus by a connection with Breuil's p-adic Langlands program, especially for representations which arise from higher weight modular forms. The project's aim is to pursue this connection by exploring new cases of this correspondence as well as their connections to geometry and applications to modularity. <br/><br/>A little over ten years ago Wiles proved Fermat's Last Theorem. He did this by <br/>relating elliptic curves to modular forms. The latter are complex functions which admit an incredibly large number of symmetries. Wiles' breakthrough involved the use of the p-adic Galois representation attached to an elliptic curve. His result can be viewed as a special case of a more general philosophy due to Fontaine and Mazur, which predicts that a certain class of p-adic Galois representations always arise from modular forms. Recently Breuil has proposed a p-adic analogue of the Langlands correspondence. This is a completely new ingredient which seems to have very strong applications to questions about modularity. The project aims to develop Breuil's correspondence and explore its relation to geometry and modularity of Galois representations. <br/>"

The first focuses on applications of the differential equations method for the analysis of greedy algorithms and random graph processes.  <br/>Recent work of the investigator and Alan Frieze gives a new technique for employing this method to prove good performance of randomized algorithms on random graphs without an explicit solution (or numerical approximation of the solution) of the associated system of differential equations (the need for such often complicates application of the method).  The key new idea is to use combinatorial observations to identify an invariant set in the autonomous system of ordinary differential equations that, by a standard application of the method, governs the evolution of the algorithm.  Problems to be addressed in this part of the project include Hamiltonicity, matchings and 3-colorability of sparse random graphs.  The second part of this research project is motivated by the problem of determining the Shannon capacities of graphs. The Shannon capacity is a function of the independence numbers of the powers of the graph.  The investigator proposes a novel technique, based on combinatorial stability, for attaining upper bounds on the independence numbers of powers of odd cycles.<br/> <br/><br/>This research is in the areas of probabilistic and extremal combinatorics.  Probabilistic combinatorics is comprised of the study of random combinatorial structures, randomized algorithms and probabilistic existence proofs for combinatorics (i.e. the probabilistic method).  <br/>Extremal combinatorics considers questions of the form: <br/>`How large (or small) can an object that lies in a particular discrete mathematical system and satisfies a certain condition be?'  We are often concerned with the behavior of the size of the extremal objects as the size of the underlying system goes to infinity.  Interest in both fields grew extensively during the twentieth century.  <br/>Pioneers, such as Paul Erdos, discovered many beautiful properties of extremal and random discrete structures, posed vast arrays of fascinating questions in these areas and devised powerful methods for solving them even before the close connections between probabilistic and extremal combinatorics and various other fields (including theoretical computer science, statistical physics and <br/>information theory) were discovered.   The Shannon <br/>capacities of graphs are a classic example of the close interaction between extremal combinatorics and the theory of communication.  The Shannon capacity gives a measure of the optimal zero-error performance of a noisy communication channel and is centrally important in information theory.

This result had been conjectured independently by the PI and De Concini. The first project, in collaboration with B. Feigin and E. Frenkel, endeavours to establish a precise link between the Casimir connection and Conformal Field Theory by exhibiting new fields in the Wess-Zumino-Witten model whose correlation functions satisfy the corresponding system of differential equations, thus incorporating connections with irregular singularities into this model. This project has a number of important potential applications beyond those to Conformal Field Theory: to the structure and representation theory of simple Lie algebras (quantisation of the shift of argument subalgebra, construction of new basis of irreducible finite dimensional representations) and to Statistical Mechanics (construction of new integrable models generalising the Gaudin model). The second project aims at extending the PI's monodromy theorem at roots of unity. This extension could provide the impetus for the study of generalised braided tensor categories, that is tensor categories whose underlying braid group is a generalised one, and whose definition is implicit in the axioms of a quasi-Coxeter algebra. The last project, in collaboration with R. Rouquier, is concerned with Dynkin diagram cohomology, which was introduced by the PI to control deformations of quasi-Coxeter algebras. Its aim is to arrive at a better combinatorial and topological understanding of this cohomology by computing it for Coxeter groups and the enveloping algebras of semi-simple Lie algebras.<br/><br/>Quantum groups are deformations of the most basic symmetry groups of Nature. They were discovered in the mid-eighties as symmetries of certain Quantum mechanical systems and have since appeared in a wide range of fields in Mathematics and Physics such as String Theory, Quantum Statistical Mechanics, the study of finite symmetry groups, Topology and Combinatorics. One of their bewildering aspects is their uncanny ability to address, and solve, long standing problems in these fields which are often formulated without appealling to quantum groups. The PI has been pursuing one such avenue of investigation, by using quantum groups to describe the branching behaviour of solutions of certain systems of differential equations in the complex domain. This proposal aims at further broadening our understanding of this intriguing phenomenon. This project has important potential applications to String Theory and Representation Theory. It is also expected that it will lead to a wide generalisation of Braided Tensor Categories which, in their present guise, have been extensively used in Computer Science, Logic and, more recently, Quantum Computing. The PI has, on several occasions, given lectures to audiences of young researchers and graduate students about his recent results and always found an extremely receptive audience. It is likely that the further developments stemming from them which are presented above will attract such young mathematicians."

Sieve methods, which have their origins in the work of the ancient Greek mathematicians Eratosthenes, have been developed and refined in an attempt to resolve the Twin Prime Conjecture and related problems. Recently, Goldston, Pintz, and Yildirim have introduced some interesting new ideas in sieve methods, and they have used them to make an important advance on the Twin Prime Conjecture. These same authors, together with the investigator, have also proved results about short gaps between numbers between semi-primes; i.e., between numbers with exactly two prime factors. The sieve techniques developed by Goldston et alia have potential applications. Motivated by these techniques, the investigator proposes work on three projects. The first project is to improve sifting limits and sifting bounds for sieves of dimension greater than 2. The second project is to resolve questions on an idealized problem involving sifting by primes in limited ranges. The third project is to extend recent results on equal values of the number of divisors function for consecutive integers.<br/><br/>This project is for work in the area of number theory. Number theory is the study of the special properties of the integers. In particular, one of the central problems of number theory is to understand the interplay between the additive structure and the multiplicative and additive structure of the integers. Prime numbers form the basic building blocks of the integers under multiplication, but there are many open questions about the behavior of the primes with respect to addition. For example, Goldbach's Conjecture, which was first stated in 1742, is that every even number exceeding 2 is a sum of two primes. De Polignac's Conjecture, which dates to 1849, is that every even number is a difference of two primes in infinitely many ways. Both of these conjectures are open, but attempts to solve them have lead to the development of sophisticated sieve methods. In turn, sieve methods have lead to important advances in our understanding of the integers.<br/>Sieves also have practical applications within computer science; for example, the sieve of Eratosthenes is a standard benchmark test for computer software. In 1994, Thomas Nicely was studying Brun's Constant, which is the sum of the reciprocals of twin primes. His attempts to approximate this constant ultimately led him to discover a flaw in the Pentium FPU.<br/>"

The PI plans to continue his research on various geometric incidence matrices, such as the subspace-inclusion matrices and their symplectic analogues. The Smith normal form results will have interesting geometric applications, for example, in classifying ovoids in three-dimensional projective space over a finite field of even order.

More specifically, the principal investigator studies the structure of graphs pertaining to the graph minor inclusion and its relatives, such as the directed minor and matching minor relations, and uses those results to attack flow and coloring problems, as well as the problem of characterizing ``Pfaffian graphs"". Pfaffian graphs are of interest because they allow efficient computation of perfect matchings, and their rich theory is related to other areas. This research requires the development of new tools in graph structure theory.<br/>In particular, the PI proposes an in-depth study of the notion of ``society"", originally introduced by Robertson and Seymour.<br/>Applications of the theory  range from theoretical (the flow conjectures, the double cycle conjecture) to more algorithmic (coloring graphs on surfaces and graphs belonging to a proper minor-closed family).<br/><br/>An important method employed in the proof of the Four-Color Theorem is the technique of ``reducibility"". While it is essential for the proof, there is almost no associated theory. The PI attempts to develop such a theory for the Four-Color Theorem, for the 5-Flow Conjecture and for the Cycle Double Cover Conjecture. A successful theory of reducibility (if it exists) will hopefully lead to a computer-free proof of the Four-Color Theorem and to proofs of the 5-Flow and Cycle Double Cover Conjectures.<br/><br/>This work falls within the area of graph theory, and is closely related to theoretical computer science and mathematical programming (operations research). A graph is an abstract mathematical notion used to model networks, such as telephone networks, transportation networks or the Internet. Various problems arise in the study of such networks, and this proposal is concerned with problems of structural nature. Why do some networks possess certain specific desirable properties, and others do not? A satisfactory answer can have many applications, ranging from better understanding of the undelying structure, to the design of efficient algorithms, to practical computations. For instance, one such question answered earlier by the PI settles a question of Georgia Polya from 1913, it also solves a different problem that baffled theoretical computer scientists for quarter of a century, and has applications in economics.<br/><br/><br/>"

Classical Schubert calculus, a branch of enumerative algebraic geometry concerned with counting subspaces satisfying certain intersection conditions, is the outcome of the solution to Hilbert's Fifteenth problem. In the modern formulation, Schubert calculus is usually interpreted in cohomology theories of homogeneous spaces, most notably flag varieties. The full development of affine Schubert calculus will solve long-standing open problems in Macdonald theory and have an impact on physical questions, such as generalizations of Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory models and extensions of Calogero-Sutherland quantum mechanical models whose eigenfunctions are k-Schur functions. The new approach to affine Schubert calculus is made possible by the recent discovery of certain explicitly defined symmetric functions called k-Schur functions. The k-Schur functions, which arose in the study of the seemingly unrelated Macdonald theory, were recently shown to be connected to the geometry and topology of the affine Grassmanian. The novel combinatorics of k-Schur functions will be exploited to deduce formulae for various multiplicities, including intersection multiplicities in the affine Grassmannian and the affine flag manifold. Some of these multiplicities are known to occur in Macdonald theory and as Verlinde fusion coefficients for the WZW model.<br/><br/>This many-faceted project involves and ties together various problems from combinatorics, geometry, representation theory, physics, and computation. The main questions that will be addressed can be viewed from several points of view: a geometric perspective (questions such as ""how many lines are there satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions?""), a combinatorial perspective (""how many elements are in given sets and what properties do these sets have?""), a physics perspective (""how do fields correlate?""), and computational aspects (""are there efficient algorithms for calculating these numbers or objects?""). The project is an international cooperative research venture, with core group members located in Canada, the United States, Chile, and France, and interdisciplinary, involving mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists. Graduate students will receive professional training by direct involvement in the research and will benefit from interaction with the research team. A summer school at the Fields institute for graduate students is also planned at the conclusion of the project. The investigation is largely fueled by extensive computational experimentation. The robust implementation of algorithms derived from the project, will lead to the development of new packages for computer algebra systems. The dissemination of this new software through an open-source computational package, will not only advance the proposed research program but will also have an outreach impact on the mathematics, physics, and computer science communities.<br/>"

In another project the plan is to show that previously constructed examples of projective surfaces indeed provide counter examples to the uniformization conjecture which claims holomorphic convexity of the universal coverings of complex projective manifolds. The completion of this project will change the current perception of the structure of non-simply-connected projective varieties.

The dominance conjecture claims that any such curve has a finite nonramified covering which surjects onto arbitrary other curve. The covering depends on the target curve. This result would provide a simple geometric reason for the structure of algebraic points on all arithmetic hyperbolic curves to be similar. Hence many statements about the arithmetic of hyperbolic curves would be sufficient to check for one such curve only. It opens a new avenue for the advance in arithmetics of algebraic varieties. The focus of another project is a study of the structure of a hyperbolic curve defined over a finite field considered as a subset of its points under a standard imbedding into the jacobian of the curve. In this context the jacobian is viewed simply as an infinite torsion group. The subsets defined in this way have many remarkable properties and the plan is to investigate those systematically.

A variety of previously studied examples have been organized into a coherent framework. The emergent structures serve to both suggest natural generalizations---often with applications to analytic number theory---and point towards unexpected connections with such diverse areas of mathematics as the spectral theory of automorphic forms, arithmetic of function fields, the geometry of affine root systems and combinatorial representation theory. Many applications in analytic number theory have been found and many more are expected. These include moment estimates and convexity breaking for L-functions over an arbitrary number field, nonvanishing results for L-functions over number fields and function fields and results on the nature of the mysterious Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series and higher order theta functions. Moreover, during the past several years the combined efforts of the investigators have demonstrated that Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series have a beautiful structure that was previously unknown, and by elucidating this structure, new connections with other areas of mathematics are rapidly emerging. The grant will fund continued investigation of these rapidly developing areas. In addition, two workshops are planned for the dissemination of these results and new techniques to research mathematicians and graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Number theory began thousands of years ago and was initially inspired by questions about prime numbers. Dirichlet series are infinite series, such as the Riemann zeta function, and are a primary tool in the study of prime numbers. More recently they have come to fore by providing interconnections between many diverse areas of pure mathematics and physics.  Multiple Dirichlet series are simply Dirichlet series in several variables -- they have the merit that the number theoretic quantities they measure can themselves be Dirichlet series, in particular L-functions, which are fundamental objects that can be associated with many classes of number-theoretic data, such as elliptic curves, representations of Galois groups, or modular forms.<br/>"

The first problem is in representation theory:<br/>it is a conjecture in local harmonic analysis that is<br/>motivated by taking Arthur's conjectures together with results<br/>of Burger, Li and Sarnak. This problem is of interest as a<br/>question in representation theory; it also offers a testing<br/>ground for Arthur's conjectures and affords the possibility<br/>of a better understanding of the automorphic spectrum. The<br/>second problem is to study analytic number theory in the context<br/>of automorphic forms on groups of higher rank.  The dream goal of<br/>this is a better understanding of higher moments of L-functions,<br/>but there are a number of easier and concrete problems, such as<br/>the development of large-sieve inequalities, whose solution would<br/>also have immediate consequences for analytic number theory.<br/><br/> The project concerns two questions in the field of<br/>``automorphic forms.'' This is a relatively new field of mathematics,<br/>guided by the Langlands program -- it seeks to establish<br/>connections between certain (apparently) far-separated<br/>areas of mathematics. These connections have allowed work in<br/>automorphic forms to have a significant impact in other fields.<br/>Many cryptographic algorithms -- necessary for secure communication<br/>over the Internet --  are based on<br/>very subtle properties of prime numbers, and underlying<br/>many of these algorithms are difficult results from analytic number<br/>theory and automorphic forms. Another application<br/>of automorphic forms has been the construction of ``Ramanujan graphs''<br/>-- these are graphs with remarkable connectivity, and have had<br/>application to communication networks and to theoretical computer<br/>science. The questions under consideration will deepen<br/>our understanding of automorphic forms. In addition<br/>to the type of application just discussed,<br/>these questions lie at the intersection of different fields of<br/>mathematics, and will encourage collaboration between experts<br/>in these different fields.<br/>"

In addition to their intrinsic beauty, these objects find applications in quantum field theory, statistical physics, and the theory of random surfaces.  A guiding principle of the proposer's research is that many problems in stochastic geometry are best understood in terms of random surfaces and height functions (in discrete settings) and random distributions such as the Gaussian free field (in continuum settings).<br/><br/>Two dimensional random geometries are important in part because many problems in statistical physics (such as the way crystal surfaces fluctuate) are essentially two dimensional.  Since the path-breaking work of Belavin, Polyakov, and Zamolodchikov in the 1970's and 1980's, it has been understood---at least heuristically---that the laws of certain macroscopic observables of these systems should be invariant under conformal maps from one planar domain to another.  Over the past two decades, physicists have developed sophisticated non-rigorous techniques for understanding the properties of random objects with conformal symmetries. During the past few years, several mathematicians have begun to rigorously prove some of the predictions from the physics literature, along with many additional results.  Many of the these problems have natural higher dimensional analogs that we are only beginning to understand.

In the mid-eighties Margulis, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak used deep results from the theory of automorphic forms (Selberg's 3/16 theorem, proved Ramanujan<br/>conjectures) to give explicit constructions of expanders as Cayley graphs of finite groups with respect to very special choices of generators.  A basic problem, formulated by Lubotzky and Weiss, is to what extent being an expander family is a property of the groups alone, independent of the choice of generators. The first project of the principal investigator will be devoted to addressing this problem and  constructing new robust families of expanders using recently developed tools from additive combinatorics. The second project of the principal investigator builds on the recent joint work with Bourgain and Sarnak, in which expanders were used to obtain novel sieving results towards non-abelian generalizations of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. The general problem addressed in the second project involves sieving for primes (or almost-primes) on an orbit of a group generated by finitely many polynomial maps; application of combinatorial Brun sieve depends crucially on the expansion property of the ""congruence graphs"" associated with the orbit. The third project of the principal investigator is devoted to studying from a unified point of view one of the basic conjectures pertaining to expander graphs and one of the basic conjectures in the theory of Quantum Chaos. A basic conjecture in the theory of expander graphs asserts that many families of groups are expanding with respect to random choices of generators (Independence Conjecture for random generators). A basic conjecture in Quantum Chaos, formulated by Bohigas, Giannoni, and Shmit, asserts that the eigenvalues of a quantized chaotic Hamiltonian behave like the spectrum of a typical member of the appropriate ensemble of random matrices. Both conjectures can be viewed as asserting that a deterministically constructed spectrum ""generically""  behaves like the spectrum of a large random matrix: ""in the bulk"" (Quantum Chaos<br/>Conjecture) and at the  ""edge of the spectrum"" <br/>(Independence Conjecture).  The principal investigator will work on proving these conjectures in the context of the spectra of elements in  group rings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanders are highly-connected sparse graphs widely used in Computer Science, in areas ranging from parallel computation to complexity theory and cryptography.  In the early seventies, following Pinsker's observation that <br/>random sparse   graphs are expanders, Margulis gave  the <br/>first explicit group-theoretic construction of expanders;  in the late eighties  Margulis, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak constructed celebrated Ramanujan graphs (optimal expanders from spectral point of view)  using deep number-theoretic results. In the ensuing years the scope and depth of applications of expanders has dramatically increased; over the past decade several completely new and unexpected lines of  development have emerged and the field has undergone explosive growth.  The principal investigator plans to pursue three projects centered on expanders and involving mutually beneficial interactions between arithmetic, group theory and combinatorics. The first project is devoted to constructing new robust families of expanders using recently developed tools from additive combinatorics.  In the second project expanders will be used to obtain novel sieving results, thus partially repaying the debt of computer science to number theory. <br/>The third  project is devoted to studying connections between expander graphs and random matrices. The  principal investigator will  direct research by graduate students on the problems related to the three projects described above and will design and teach graduate courses in additive combinatorics and random matrix theory, as well as an undergraduate course devoted to applications and constructions of expander graphs. He will also direct undergraduate research projects, involving a mix of numerical experimentation, analyzing data, background reading, and theoretical work. In addition, the principal investigator will organize meetings bringing together Bay Area researchers and graduate students for a day of talks and informal discussions, leading to long-term collaborations in research and education.<br/><br/>"

They are different and yet very closely related.  One important instance of combinatorial packing problems is that of graph packing.  Graphs of size n pack, if there exists an edge disjoint placement of all these graphs into the complete graph with n vertices.  Various classical combinatorial problems can be modeled as packing or covering problems.<br/>For example, the problem of existence of a spanning cycle in an n-vertex graph is the question whether the n-cycle packs with the complement of G.  Important examples of packing and covering problems are problems on existence of a given subgraph, coloring problems, Turan-type problems, domination problems and Ramsey-type problems.  These examples (and many more) show that (hyper)graph packings and coverings are rather general problems and are rich enough models for many important applications.  Areas of application include scheduling, database access, assignment of computer registers, data clustering, computer-aided design of printed circuits, positional games, DNA sequencing, etc.<br/><br/>The main thrust of the project is to explore a series of extremal packing and covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs, with restrictions on degrees of their vertices.  It is expected that the results will make an essential step in understanding extremal packing and covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs.<br/>Some proofs can lead to efficient packing and covering algorithms; negative results will impose limits on what can be accomplished.  The particular packing problem of equitable coloring has many applications in scheduling, partitioning, and load balancing problems.  It will be studied also from an algorithmic viewpoint.  A fair amount of the work will be done jointly with graduate students and recent graduates of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br/>"

In the first category, the PI will work with Hendrik Lenstra on improving the AKS primality test, with applications to the construction of finite fields, and he will work with Lenstra and Jonathan Pila on a rigorously fast factorization algorithm involving jacobian varieties of hyperelliptic curves of genus 2.  In combinatorial number theory, the PI will continue his recent work with Michael Filaseta, Kevin Ford, Sergei Konyagin, and Gang Yu dealing with the covering congruences problem of Paul Erdos.<br/>Among the arithmetic functions that the PI will study are the order of the multiplicative group modulo an integer (Euler's function) and the order of the largest cyclic subgroup of this group (Carmichael's function), including the index of this subgroup in the full group.  This index has applications to the work of Ulmer on the ranks of elliptic curves over function fields of positive characteristic and some questions of Arnold.  The PI will be working jointly with Igor Shparlinski on the former applications and with Michel Balazard on the latter.  With the Carmichael function, the PI intends with Florian Luca to strongly improve the known results concerning its range.<br/><br/>One would think that basic questions concerning the integers, such as deciding when one is prime, factoring another, or the multiplicative structure of the remainders when a particular number is used as a divisor, would be well-understood by now.  But they are not, and for one of these problems, namely factoring, the fact that it is apparently difficult in general is the basis for the security of cryptographic systems that underpin commerce and communication.  The principal proposed activities of this proposal concern these fundamental problems, mostly from the theoretical side.  In addition, the PI proposes to study some applications of the multiplicative structure of remainders to the study of the ranks of certain elliptic curves.  Elliptic curves arise from cubic equations in two variables; one studies the solutions to such an equation with the variables coming from a given algebraic domain such as the rational numbers and similar domains.  They have provided a rich source of structure for number theorists. These curves too have been used in cryptographic systems and in computational number theory, but the PI's focus here is a statistical study of certain algebraic invariants of the solution sets as one varies curve parameters. Finally, the PI will study some problems in combinatorial number theory, including the famous covering congruences problem of the late Paul Erdos. Here one asks if there can be a finite set of large integers and a single remainder for each such that every integer when divided by the given large numbers leaves at least one corresponding remainder in the given pre-set list.  The current record for ""large"" is 25, and it is not known if one can do this with arbitrarily large numbers.<br/>"

Pfaffian graphs are important as the problem of enumeration of perfect matchings can be solved in polynomial time in a Pfaffian graph, while the corresponding problem for general graphs is #P-complete. Among other approaches to structural characterization of Pfaffian graphs, the PI proposes to continue his work on a general matching minor theory, an analogue of celebrated graph minor theory of Robertson and Seymour. Such a theory would have many potential theoretical and algorithmic applications beyond the theory of Pfaffian graphs. The PI also proposes to continue his research on three other types of graph theoretical problems. The first one is connected to the Four Color Theorem, a problem that remained open for over a hundred years and lies at the heart of the modern graph theory. The second type of problems involves circular colorings, a relatively new concept that has been studied extensively in recent years and has both practical motivations and theoretical applications to the theory of graph coloring. Thirdly, the investigation of graph theoretical analogues of the results in the theory of Riemann surfaces is proposed. The PI, in collaboration with Matthew Baker, has recently been able to prove a Riemann-Roch theorem for graphs. The Riemann-Roch theorem is widely regarded as the most important result in the theory of Riemann surfaces. The discovery of its analogue demonstrated an interesting connection between Riemann surfaces and graphs and led to further open problems with potential applications outside graph theory.<br/><br/>This work belongs to the area of graph theory.

Classical Schubert calculus, a branch of enumerative algebraic geometry concerned with counting subspaces satisfying certain intersection conditions, is the outcome of the solution to Hilbert's Fifteenth problem. In the modern formulation, Schubert calculus is usually interpreted in cohomology theories of homogeneous spaces, most notably flag varieties. The full development of affine Schubert calculus will solve long-standing open problems in Macdonald theory and have an impact on physical questions, such as generalizations of Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory models and extensions of Calogero-Sutherland quantum mechanical models whose eigenfunctions are k-Schur functions. The new approach to affine Schubert calculus is made possible by the recent discovery of certain explicitly defined symmetric functions called k-Schur functions. The k-Schur functions, which arose in the study of the seemingly unrelated Macdonald theory, were recently shown to be connected to the geometry and topology of the affine Grassmanian. The novel combinatorics of k-Schur functions will be exploited to deduce formulae for various multiplicities, including intersection multiplicities in the affine Grassmannian and the affine flag manifold. Some of these multiplicities are known to occur in Macdonald theory and as Verlinde fusion coefficients for the WZW model.<br/><br/>This many-faceted project involves and ties together various problems from combinatorics, geometry, representation theory, physics, and computation. The main questions that will be addressed can be viewed from several points of view: a geometric perspective (questions such as ""how many lines are there satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions?""), a combinatorial perspective (""how many elements are in given sets and what properties do these sets have?""), a physics perspective (""how do fields correlate?""), and computational aspects (""are there efficient algorithms for calculating these numbers or objects?""). The project is an international cooperative research venture, with core group members located in Canada, the United States, Chile, and France, and interdisciplinary, involving mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists. Graduate students will receive professional training by direct involvement in the research and will benefit from interaction with the research team. A summer school at the Fields institute for graduate students is also planned at the conclusion of the project. The investigation is largely fueled by extensive computational experimentation. The robust implementation of algorithms derived from the project, will lead to the development of new packages for computer algebra systems. The dissemination of this new software through an open-source computational package, will not only advance the proposed research program but will also have an outreach impact on the mathematics, physics, and computer science communities.<br/>"

The proposed research deals with complements of log pairs with different levels of singularities, including ones which naturally appear in the Log Minimal Model Program (LMMP). Complements have important applications in modern birational geometry but rooted in the classical question about singularities of a linear system on algebraic variety, in particular, of a plurianticanonical linear system. The main conjecture of the project about boundedness of complements implies almost directly two other fundamental conjectures in the field: the ascending chain condition (acc) conjecture for minimal log discrepancies (mld's) and that of for thresholds of singularities. The acc for mld's and for thresholds are intimately related to log termination in the LMMP, completion of the LMMP, and birational rigidity. On the other hand, complements can be applied to the Alexeev and Borisov brothers conjecture on Fano varieties. For this, a renewed key tool is log adjunction, namely, conjectural effectiveness and positivity of log adjunction. The PI intended to develop further these methods. They may have also other fundamental generalizations and implications in Diophantine and algebraic geometry, e.g.,  toward a more precise form of conjectural Kodaira additivity.<br/><br/>This is a research in the field of algebra and geometry with methods and applications in birational geometry. The morphisms of such geometry are rational transformations, e.g., flips, and are typically far away from classical continuous or differentiable transformations of a space. Rational transformations fits to model disconnected catastrophic changes of a space. Algebraic geometry treats rational transformations in terms rational functions with prescribed zeros and poles, or in geometrical terminology, in terms of linear systems of divisors on algebraic varieties. Thus many problems about these transformations can be translated into problems about singularities of those linear systems. Birational geometry is an old and traditional area of mathematics which get a revolutionary flowering in the past decades. The area interacts with most of branches of mathematics, e.g., analysis, topology and mathematical physics, with applications in those fields as well as in number theory, cosmology, discrete and computational mathematics, robotics.<br/>"

The structures investigated are: vertex algebras, (non-linear) Lie conformal algebras, Lie pseudoalgebras, and vertex (Lie) algebras in higher dimensions. Three main projects are proposed. The first is to classify certain non-linear Lie conformal algebras with three generators, which can be viewed as non-linear deformations of affine sl(2). This will lead to the discovery of new interesting vertex algebras. The second project is to classify the irreducible representations of simple Lie pseudoalgebras of type H and K, extending previous work of the PI and collaborators that settled types W and S. This project is closely related to the representation theory of Lie-Cartan algebras of vector fields, and it involves pseudoalgebra versions of the hamiltonian and contact de Rham complexes. The third project develops further the theory of vertex algebras in higher dimensions introduced previously by N.M. Nikolov, with the long-term goal of constructing examples that lead to nontrivial models of axiomatic quantum field theory. The PI will continue his investigation of the vertex Lie algebras in higher dimensions introduced by him and Nikolov. Another approach proposed here is to reconstruct a conformal vertex algebra in higher dimensions from its one-dimensional restriction and the action of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal conformal transformations.<br/><br/>Lie groups, named after the 19th century Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, provide a mathematical description of the notion of continuous symmetry and play a prominent role in mathematics and physics. Related objects, Lie algebras, describe infinitesimal transformations. The PI investigates infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and related algebraic structures, which first appeared in an algebraic approach to quantum field theory. The goal of this research is to develop further the mathematical theory of such algebras and at the same time discover new concrete examples, which will lead to the construction of new models in quantum field theory and thus will deepen our understanding of the nature.<br/>"

It is a ramification of Langlands' formulation of non-abelian class field theory, probably the most important  problem in modern number theory, which can be tested in a self-contained manner within the context of the theory of automorphic representations.<br/>The approach to this problem considered here is via the theory of L-functions of automorphic representations  and the development of a  Converse Theorem for these L-functions for the general linear group. These L-functions are analytic invariants that can be attached both arithmetic objects and analytic objects and are used to mediate between them; Langlands non-abelian class field theory is one such connection. Converse Theorems allow one to characterize the analytic side of this equation via the properties of these invariants. The problem of Functoriality comes from interpreting arithmetic phenomena on the analytic side in term of these L-function invariants. <br/>Much progress on the problem of Functoriality has been made by the proposer in collaboration  with Kim, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shahidi and has set the paradigm for proving such results with these techniques. The main thrust of this proposal is to continue these efforts. It includes projects toimprove the Converse Theorem,  projects  to extend certain technical results on  L-functions and develop new techniques that are more widely applicable, and finally projects aimed towards applications to arithmetic. <br/><br/>The projects in this proposal all fall under the broad rubric of analytic number theory. At its most basic level, number theory is interested in understanding the integers. Additively, the integers are quite simple, generated by 1, but from the point of view of multiplication and factoring they are quite complicated and mysterious. The multiplicative structure is generated by the prime numbers and a large swath of number theory  is devoted to the study of prime numbers. This study is full of problems that are simple to state but with no apparent machinery with which to attack them. Over the ages a vast and subtle algebraic structure has been built around these problems -- this is algebraic number theory.  But as with many problems,  to bring in seemingly incongruous techniques from other areas can lead to new insights. One such ``incongruous'' area is analysis and the theory of group representations; this leads to the theory  of automorphic forms, a type of analytic number theory. The connection between the two in its most basic guise is  ``class field theory'' and is mediated by certain analytic invariants, called L-functions. Class field theory  is a deep and hard problem and any light we can shed on this connection lets us bring the tools of analysis to bear on basic arithmetic problems. This proposal investigates these invariants, the L-functions, from both the algebraic and analytic points of view in hopes of narrowing the gap between these two areas in the short term and impacting our understanding of class field theory in the long term.<br/>"

A variety of previously studied examples have been organized into a coherent framework. The emergent structures serve to both suggest natural generalizations---often with applications to analytic number theory---and point towards unexpected connections with such diverse areas of mathematics as the spectral theory of automorphic forms, arithmetic of function fields, the geometry of affine root systems and combinatorial representation theory. Many applications in analytic number theory have been found and many more are expected. These include moment estimates and convexity breaking for L-functions over an arbitrary number field, nonvanishing results for L-functions over number fields and function fields and results on the nature of the mysterious Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series and higher order theta functions. Moreover, during the past several years the combined efforts of the investigators have demonstrated that Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series have a beautiful structure that was previously unknown, and by elucidating this structure, new connections with other areas of mathematics are rapidly emerging. The grant will fund continued investigation of these rapidly developing areas. In addition, two workshops are planned for the dissemination of these results and new techniques to research mathematicians and graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Number theory began thousands of years ago and was initially inspired by questions about prime numbers. Dirichlet series are infinite series, such as the Riemann zeta function, and are a primary tool in the study of prime numbers. More recently they have come to fore by providing interconnections between many diverse areas of pure mathematics and physics.  Multiple Dirichlet series are simply Dirichlet series in several variables -- they have the merit that the number theoretic quantities they measure can themselves be Dirichlet series, in particular L-functions, which are fundamental objects that can be associated with many classes of number-theoretic data, such as elliptic curves, representations of Galois groups, or modular forms.<br/>"

The first project is in combinatorial representation theory, and is mostly concerned with the development of the alcove path model; this is a simple combinatorial model (recently introduced by the investigator in collaboration with A. Postnikov) for the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras and, more generally, of complex symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras. One problem is to describe the way in which the alcove path model specializes to other models in this area, such as Kashiwara-Nakashima tableaux (in the classical types), and the Kyoto path model (in the affine Kac-Moody types). Other problems are related to the combinatorics of Kashiwara's crystals and an efficient construction of a monomial basis of an irreducible representation; the approach to these problems is based on the alcove path model. Unrelated to this model, the first part of the project also includes a combinatorial study of explicit constructions of irreducible representations based on lattices with a small number of covers. The second part of the project is concerned with modern Schubert calculus on generalized flag varieties. The main goal is to derive combinatorial multiplication formulas for Schubert classes (i.e., the natural basis elements) in the cohomology and K-theory of flag varieties. One such problem is a Chevalley-type multiplication formula (by a codimension 1 class) in the equivariant K-theory of flag varieties for Kac-Moody groups; this formula generalizes a similar formula in the finite case based on the alcove path model. More general such formulas will be investigated in cohomology, based on combinatorial structures such as certain monoids for the Bruhat order on the corresponding Weyl group. The third part of the project is concerned with combinatorial applications to algebraic topology. More precisely, it involves combinatorial formulas (based on trees) for the coefficients of certain formal group laws. There are applications to topological conjectures about classifying spaces of certain finite abelian groups.<br/><br/>A unifying theme of the project outlined here is the emphasis on combinatorics and computation. During the last decades, computation has gained an important role in mathematical research. This stimulated the development of combinatorics, as it became clear that combinatorial structures are particularly well suited for encoding complex mathematical objects, while combinatorial methods are well suited for related computations. This research plan is part of the ongoing effort to perform concrete computations, based on combinatorial structures. Such structures are used to study representations (i.e., actions on vector spaces) of complex Lie algebras. They are also used to study the geometry of certain classical algebraic varieties, namely flag varieties; related applications exist, for instance, to enumerative geometry (such as counting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions, which is equivalent to performing certain cohomology calculations). The representations of Lie algebras and the geometry of flag varieties are related to each other, and they play a fundamental role in several areas of mathematics and theoretical physics. They display remarkable combinatorial complexity, which is investigated in this project.<br/>"

The deepest results are expected for moduli of Del Pezzo surfaces and certain classes of surfaces of general type, for moduli of stable rational curves, and for  their higher-dimensional analogues: compact moduli spaces of hyperplane arrangements. New methods are based on the interaction between Mori theory and tropical algebraic geometry, which assigns to any algebraic variety an object of combinatorial nature, basically a polytope. This polytope (a tropical variety) surprisingly encodes a lot of geometric information about the variety and most importantly about its compactifications. Tropical varieties were originally introduced in the community of computational algebraic geometers who study how to read invariants of algebraic varieties from their equations.<br/>It turns out that proposed methods can also be used backwards to advance computational algebraic geometry. In particular, they can be used to find implicit equations of algebraic varieties given parametrically.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry studies algebraic varieties shapes defined by systems of polynomial equations. Algebraic varieties have discrete characteristics that allow to classify their species: rational curves, Del Pezzo surfaces, Abelian varieties, Calabi-Yau varieties, varieties of general type, etc. Varieties of each type depend on certain continuous parameters (called moduli) and the set of all parameters has a rich structure of the so-called moduli space. One is particularly interested in compact moduli spaces that parametrize varieties with allowed mild degenerations.For example, a hyperbola xy=C on the plane can degenerate to the union of two lines xy=0 when C goes to 0. The principal investigator will study these compact moduli spaces and related problems in algebraic geometry. This centuries-old concept of pure mathematics has rich relationship with physics, and applications to computational algebraic geometry will lead to new algorithms useful in algebraic statistics and mathematical biology.<br/>"

The present proposal suggests a number of problems to try to extend functoriality to a larger class of cases as well as using them to establish new results in number theory and group representations. Among them is understanding the transcendental nature of values of L-functions, generalizations of Riemann zeta functions, at certain integers and half-integers, in line with integral values of the latter, as well as analyzing other analytic objects of arithmetic significance.

Homogeneous spaces form basic fundamental objects in Geometry and other related fields. The flag varieties constitute an important class of homogeneous spaces; Schubert subvarieties in flag varieties provide a powerful inductive machinery for the study of flag varieties. Problems of this proposal are related to some interesting and important algebraic varieties - Schubert varieties, affine Grassmannians (and affine Schubert varieties), quiver varieties, nilpotent orbit closures, toric varieties. Lakshmibai, Musili and Seshadri developed a ""Standard Monomial Theory"" (henceforth abbreviated SMT) for flag varieties and their Schubert subvarieties. This theory has led to very many important geometric & representation-theoretic consequences. This proposal deals first with developing a SMT for the varieties mentioned above, next proposes to use SMT to study such geometric problems as determination of singular locus, determination of the multiplicity at a singular point etc. Lakshmibai's recent research shows that once there is a good SMT for an algebraic variety, much information could be inferred about the variety (using SMT); for instance, SMT throws light on the degenerations of the variety. The degenerations of a variety in turn facilitate the understanding of the geometric aspects of the variety. This technique has been used very recently in the area of Complexity Theory in Computer Science, esp., in the context of the ""P not equal to NP-conjecture"".<br/><br/>Modern Algebraic Geometry (developed in the latter half of the 20-th century) has proved itself (beyond any doubts) to be indispensable in various disciplines within Mathematics as well as in other areas outside Mathematics, such as: Topology, Representation Theory, Combinatorics (within Mathematics), the modern Quantum theory (especially Quantum & Conformal field theories) in Physics; Robotics, Complexity theory in Computer Science. This proposal is at the cross-roads of Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, Combinatorics & Representation-theory. The varieties studied in this proposal form an important class of varieties in Algebraic Geometry; for example, the theory of Schubert varieties (over finite fields) is closely linked to Coding theory. The principal investigator believes that this proposal is bound to have significant impacts on the above-mentioned disciplines."

In some recent work with Kantor, Kassabov and Lubotzky, it was shown that every finite simple group, with the possible of one family, have short and/or bounded presentations.  This was a very surprising result and much better than conjectured. It does lead to some important and basic problems including removing the exception, understanding the differences (if any) between discrete presentations and profinite presentations and getting a good bound on cohomology.  More generally, the proposer will consider linear and permutation representations of finite and algebraic groups and use these results to study problems  in number theory and algebraic geometry.  One wants to obtain fairly precise information about finite groups acting on curves and higher dimensional varieties.  In the case of curves, one wants to know about possibilities for ramification groups.  In higher dimensions, the non-irreducibility of certain modules leads to some interesting properties of varieties of families of curves as shown by earlier work of the proposer with Tiep answering questions of Katz and Kollar.<br/><br/>Since the classification of finite simple groups was completed, many problems about finite groups and related questions in other areas of mathematics have been solved that would have been unimaginable without this classification.  The classification manifests itself in two ways.  First of all, it is a list and so to prove properties about all finite groups, one can often reduce it to questions about simple groups and then attack the families.  For example, one can show that the group of all permutations of a set of a finite set has a presentation with 4 generators and 10 relations. It seems likely that 2 generations and 3 relations suffice (that would be the best possible answer).  The standard presentations, known for a century, have a linear number of generators and quadratic number of relations (in the size of the set).  Secondly, the classification also gives information about the subgroup structure of the simple groups.  This is closely related to understanding how simple groups can act on sets as permutations and on vectors by linear transformations. Rather surprisingly, such information can lead to breakthroughs in seemingly unrelated topics. For example, one aspect of the proposal is to classify exceptional polynomials over a finite field.   These are polynomials which are bijective (with degree large enough compared to the size of the field).   Using knowledge of simple groups and their subgroups has lead to a complete classification aside from the case where the degree is a power of the characteristic of the field.   The proposer expects to complete this classification. These polynomials have been studied since the late 1800's but it has been only in the last 15 years that there has been major progress.   The proposer will study related<br/>problems in number theory and geometry and translate them to questions in group theory and then apply this powerful theory.<br/>"

A variety of previously studied examples have been organized into a coherent framework. The emergent structures serve to both suggest natural generalizations---often with applications to analytic number theory---and point towards unexpected connections with such diverse areas of mathematics as the spectral theory of automorphic forms, arithmetic of function fields, the geometry of affine root systems and combinatorial representation theory. Many applications in analytic number theory have been found and many more are expected. These include moment estimates and convexity breaking for L-functions over an arbitrary number field, nonvanishing results for L-functions over number fields and function fields and results on the nature of the mysterious Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series and higher order theta functions. Moreover, during the past several years the combined efforts of the investigators have demonstrated that Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series have a beautiful structure that was previously unknown, and by elucidating this structure, new connections with other areas of mathematics are rapidly emerging. The grant will fund continued investigation of these rapidly developing areas. In addition, two workshops are planned for the dissemination of these results and new techniques to research mathematicians and graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Number theory began thousands of years ago and was initially inspired by questions about prime numbers. Dirichlet series are infinite series, such as the Riemann zeta function, and are a primary tool in the study of prime numbers. More recently they have come to fore by providing interconnections between many diverse areas of pure mathematics and physics.  Multiple Dirichlet series are simply Dirichlet series in several variables -- they have the merit that the number theoretic quantities they measure can themselves be Dirichlet series, in particular L-functions, which are fundamental objects that can be associated with many classes of number-theoretic data, such as elliptic curves, representations of Galois groups, or modular forms.<br/>"

The geometric foundation of this new theory is a construction proposed by the PI, called the ``spectrum of a tensor triangulated category'', which produces a locally ringed space. For example, the spectrum of the category of perfect complexes over a scheme recovers the scheme. Heuristically, this says that algebraic geometry embeds into tensor triangular geometry. In modular representation theory, the spectrum of the stable category recovers the ``projective support variety''. For the triangulated categories discovered more recently, the computation of the spectrum is one of the challenges proposed here by the PI, e.g. for mixed Tate motives or equivariant KK-theory of C*-algebras. This will establish unexpected bridges between these areas and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>The PI wants to extend well-understood concepts from the above numerous examples to tensor triangular geometry (e.g. invariants, like Chow groups, K-theory, Brauer groups, Dade groups,... etc). Then, he wants to prove general theorems at the astract level that can be applied to the various areas listed above to obtain new results. This ideal strategy has already been successfully started by the PI, like with filtrations by dimension of support yielding a new local-global spectral sequence for K-theory of singular varieties, or like in the joint work with Benson and Carlson on the Picard group, a standard invariant in algebraic geometry but a more subtle one in modular representation theory. The PI also applies such ideas to quadratic forms (via ``triangular Witt groups''), allowing many new results, like the proof of the 1980 Gersten-Witt Conjecture, and more computations to come.<br/>"

The interest in the questions of polynomial definability and decidability dates back to the time of the solution of Hilbert's Tenth Problem (HTP). At the beginning of the XX century a famous German mathematician David Hilbert asked the following question (among others): is there an algorithm that can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables and with integer coefficients has integer solutions? In the early 1970's, Yurii Matiyasevich, building on the work by Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson showed that the sets of integers which can be defined using polynomial equations and the sets of integers that can be listed by a computer program were the same, and thus showed that an algorithm sought by Hilbert did not exist. Matiyasevich's result immediately raised another question which proved to be even more vexing:<br/>is there an algorithm as described above but for the solutions in rational numbers? This problem is unsolved to this day.<br/>As is often the case with difficult problems in Mathematics, HTP for rational numbers as well as its sister problem, HTP for the rings of integers of number fields, generated many new questions such as Mazur's conjectures and various conjectures for elliptic curves. Many of these questions turned out to be questions of Number Theory or Algebraic Geometry, but they in turn generated quite interesting consequences in Logic. The author of this proposal believes that this line of research will continue to reveal new areas of interaction between Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry and Logic, enriching all the fields involved.<br/><br/><br/>The language of rings or the language of polynomial equations is widely used in almost all branches of Mathematics, sciences and social sciences, and therefore understanding what can be expressed by this language and whether we can determine algorithmically which sentences in this language are true is of importance to many areas of Mathematics and beyond. <br/><br/>"

Specifically, the proposed research focuses on constructing Dirichlet series in several complex variables, termed ``Multiple Dirichlet Series'' (MDS), with good analytic properties (e.g. functional equations and meromorphic continuation) and connecting these series to the Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of Eisenstein series on metaplectic groups. Since the construction of the metaplectic cover is intimately tied to reciprocity laws in number fields, the Dirichlet series and its polar residues contain families of automorphic forms twisted by characters built from power residue symbols. Analytic properties of the Dirichlet series then translate to arithmetic applications for automorphic forms, including non-vanishing results for automorphic L-functions. The construction and subsequent proof of analytic properties of these MDS uses new techniques in combinatorial representation theory, and another primary objective of this work is a deeper understanding of the connections between this representation theory and metaplectic forms. In the process, this structure is expected to illuminate further the relationship between combinatorial representation theory and the special case of Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of automorphic forms.<br/><br/>Historically, problems in number theory have centered around integer solutions to polynomial equations, so called ``Diophantine equations,'' which could be simply stated, but often extraordinarily hard to prove. It once appeared that these questions were the stuff of pure thought experiments, since the integers are discrete and should therefore have no bearing on the world and its continuous phenomena. But in the late 1960's, Robert Langlands developed a series of far-reaching conjectures known today as the Langlands' Program to investigate connections among number theory, arithmetic geometry and harmonic analysis; in fact, his conjectures were based on calculations involving a special case of the highly symmetric functions known as Eisenstein series, which are the principal objects of study in this proposal. The reach of Langlands' conjectures has been greatly expanded in the last several decades and now extends from methods for solving Diophantine equations to geometric versions with intimate connections to quantum field theory <br/>and string theory, which attempt to explain the origins and expansion of our universe via a uniform treatment of fundamental forces including gravity and electromagnetism. That is, motivated by natural questions about solutions of polynomial equations in the integers, one obtains a new interpretation for profoundly important physical phenomena; in trying to answer discrete problems, one finds explanations of the continuous world. This project attempts to bring together a previously disparate community of researchers and students in number theory, automorphic forms, Lie groups, and combinatorics to further investigate analogous connections by studying large classes of more general Eisenstein series and their relations to the aforementioned disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>"

Skinner and Urban's proof of the main conjecture, Khare and Winterberger's proof of Serre's conjecture, Emerton's and Kisin's independent work on the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture represent only a partial list of the incredible recent progress that has occurred.  Moreover, there is a rich emerging p-adic theory of automorphic forms generalizing the corresponding p-adic theory of modular forms.  However, the vast computational methods available in the study of classical modular forms, do not yet exist in the higher rank case.  Currently, there is a gap in the understanding of the shape and structures of many of the fundamental objects that appear in this more general setting.  Pollack proposes to make a concrete and explicit study of overconvergent cohomology of higher rank groups along the lines that he and Glenn Stevens did in the case of classical modular forms.  This previous study had both theoretical and computational aspects that, in particular, led to a deeper understanding of two variable p-adic L-functions and to a p-adic method of computing (conjecturally) global points on elliptic curves.  He hopes that a similar study in the higher rank case will lead to a better understanding of analogous phenomena in this more general setting. <br/><br/>For over a hundred years, mathematicians have studied modular forms which are certain complex analytic functions possessing many symmetries. The definition of these objects is through analysis (the rigorous study of calculus); nonetheless, these objects have made their way into the center of number theory as they possess a wealth of arithmetic information of the type that would have interested Euclid, Gauss, Fermat, etc.  A deep understanding of these arithmetic properties of modular forms was one of the key steps in Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  Moreover, the theory of automorphic forms -- a far-reaching generalization of modular forms -- has proven to also be extremely rich arithmetically.  However, unlike classical modular forms where one can compute with relative ease, general automorphic forms can be extremely difficult to compute and experiment with numerically.  Pollack proposes to make an in depth study of the computation of certain kinds of automorphic forms with the hope of gaining a better arithmetic understanding of them through conjecture and numerical exploration.<br/>"

The workshop will focus on a key aspect of the structure and classification of complex algebraic varieties: the conjectures of Lang and others on the existence and properties of algebraic and holomorphic curves in complex varieties.  Both analytic and algebraic techniques have recently played a role in making inroads into these conjectures, which are related to Mori's program on the algebraic side and which refine Nevanlinna's Second Main Theorem on the analytic side.  The workshop will bring the experts in algebraic geometry and complex analysis together to foster further interaction and collaboration. <br/><br/>Complex algebraic varieties, which are the solution sets of polynomial equations, provide models for describing physical problems in science and engineering.  The understanding of the structure and classification of these varieties is a central theme in both algebraic geometry and complex analysis.  The workshop will introduce recent developments in this area to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty members, as well as to senior mathematicians.  Approximately 50 mathematicians, at all stages in their research careers, are expected to participate; eight of the invited speakers are postdoctoral researchers or junior faculty members.  In addition to the scheduled talks, we shall provide ample time for open discussions during the afternoons in order to encourage active participation by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.

A variety of previously studied examples have been organized into a coherent framework. The emergent structures serve to both suggest natural generalizations---often with applications to analytic number theory---and point towards unexpected connections with such diverse areas of mathematics as the spectral theory of automorphic forms, arithmetic of function fields, the geometry of affine root systems and combinatorial representation theory. Many applications in analytic number theory have been found and many more are expected. These include moment estimates and convexity breaking for L-functions over an arbitrary number field, nonvanishing results for L-functions over number fields and function fields and results on the nature of the mysterious Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series and higher order theta functions. Moreover, during the past several years the combined efforts of the investigators have demonstrated that Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series have a beautiful structure that was previously unknown, and by elucidating this structure, new connections with other areas of mathematics are rapidly emerging. The grant will fund continued investigation of these rapidly developing areas. In addition, two workshops are planned for the dissemination of these results and new techniques to research mathematicians and graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>Number theory began thousands of years ago and was initially inspired by questions about prime numbers. Dirichlet series are infinite series, such as the Riemann zeta function, and are a primary tool in the study of prime numbers. More recently they have come to fore by providing interconnections between many diverse areas of pure mathematics and physics.  Multiple Dirichlet series are simply Dirichlet series in several variables -- they have the merit that the number theoretic quantities they measure can themselves be Dirichlet series, in particular L-functions, which are fundamental objects that can be associated with many classes of number-theoretic data, such as elliptic curves, representations of Galois groups, or modular forms.<br/>"

The main tools which are going to be used in this investigation <br/>combine combinatorial techniques, probabilistic methods, tools from Linear <br/>Algebra and spectral techniques amongst the others. First group of <br/>questions in this proposal deals with Ramsey numbers.

Finite dimensional algebras are often described as path algebras of quivers with relations. The modules of the algebra then correspond to the representations of the quiver. Cluster algebras are commutative algebras with a special combinatorial structure. The theory of cluster algebras is a fast developing field which is related to many areas of mathematics. One of its most active branches is its connection to the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras which has been established in the PI's joint work with Caldero and Chapoton and, independently, by Buan, Marsh, Reineke, Reiten and Todorov. Their construction of certain triangulated categories, the cluster categories, has provided unexpected new insights in tilting theory and has given rise to a whole new class of finite dimensional algebras, the cluster-tilted algebras.<br/><br/>When cluster algebras were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002, their original motivation came from representation theory, which is a branch of modern algebra that is concerned with the study of symmetries of scientific models. Studying the symmetries of a model is often more fruitful than studying the model directly, and representation theory has found many applications in physics and chemistry, as well as in other mathematical fields. The cluster algebras provide a mathematical framework for fundamental patterns which occur throughout representation theory. Surprisingly, these patterns are also observed in various other branches of science which, a priori, are not related to representation theory. This motivates a further development of the theory of cluster algebras to which this project will contribute."
