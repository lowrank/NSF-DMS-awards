In particular, various aspects of the Robinson-Schensted                        algorithm for skew tableaux will be explored, and it is hoped                   that various q-analogs of Stirling number identities can be given               combinatorial proofs.

The second problem concerns finding efficient                discrete logarithm algorithms and efficient algorithms for                      factoring large numbers.  The principal investigator and his                    colleagues have built a special purpose computer for implementing               his quadratic sieve algorithm for factoring large integers.

Montgomery               will pursue a number of basic questions in analytic number theory               and related areas of harmonic analysis, diophantine approximation               and the geometry of numbers.  Most of these questions involve                   sets of numbers or vectors which are almost independent.  The                   object is to exploit the almost independence appropriately in                   order to achieve the desired aim.  Masser will study some                       diophantine problems which lend themselves into the following                   groupings: (a) using transcendence techniques to examine                        isomorphism classes of elliptic curves; (b) to obtain upper                     bounds for the number of points of small height on a fixed                      abelian variety; (c) to establish precise conditions for the                    algebraic independence of values of certain Mahler-type power                   series at algebraic points; and (d) to study the multiplicities                 of linear recurrences for a finite field.  Milne's research                     object is to produce a comprehensive set of reciprocity laws                    describing how automorphisms of the complex numbers act on                      automorphic functions automorphic forms, their special values,                  their ""Fourier-Jacobi series, and the Eisenstein series attached                to cusp forms on boundary components.  Keating's research object                is to understand Igusa curves better by studying their function                 fields including applications to coding theory and factorization                theory.  He proposes to use Drinfeld's theory of extensions of                  function fields to produce a more explicit characterization of                  the function fields.                                                                 This research is in very broad areas of number theory, the                 study of the properties of the integers.  Montgomery's focus is                 on that part of the subject where classical analysis is used to                 understand these deep questions.  Masser's research concentrates                on using transcendence techniques (again analytic but of a very                 different type than Montgomery's techniques) to study problems                  concerning solutions of equations in integers.  Milne combines                  algebraic and modern analytic techniques to study special                       functions that arise in number theory.  Keating studies special                 domains that are important in number theory."

The first problem is to prove                      asymptotic mean value estimates for Dirichlet polynomials whose                 lengths are much longer than the interval of integration or, in                 the case of discrete means, than the range of summation.

These techniques will be used to study the modular                       representations of the highly exceptional sporadic simple                       groups.                                                                              The study of groups arises from consideration of the                       symmetry of physical and theoretical objects. The expression of                 these symmetry transformations by means of matrices leads to                    group representation theory. This project will develop                          representation theory by exploiting techniques from                             combinatorics and discrete geometry."

In particular there will be special emphasis on the                     classification and representation problems of positive definite                 forms.  With respect to the classification theory the Principal                 Investigator will investigate both the explicit and complete                    determination of certain genera as well as the relationships                    between even unimodular quadratic forms over integers of a number               field and their algebraic descents.  In the area of                             representation of quadratic forms he will study primitive                       representations of n-ary forms by positive definite m-ary                       quadratic forms and representations of binary forms by certain                  positive quaternary quadratic forms.                                                 Quadratic forms are homogeneous polynomials in many                        variables of degree two.  This research concerns the number                     theory problems which arise in determining which integers can be                values of them when integer are substituted for their variables.                Classifying quadratic forms in classes that all have the same                   values and representing the forms by simpler forms are valuable                 tools in answering this problem."

Work will be done to generalize the Siegel-Weil formula to the                  general case.

She will be studying some of the soliton equations which arise naturally in physics. In particular she will work with the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. These model various standing wave configurations and demonstrate many symmetries. Previato will be investigating the geometrical aspects of this theory. Since the special qualities possessed by these integrable systems are algebraic in nature, her work will have impact in both differential and algebraic geometry. The major objective of the research is to embed integrable systems in moduli spaces in order to gain information on the latter's function theory and properties as projective varieties. This offers potential applications to the study of moduli spaces for vector bundles on curves as well as the possible discovery of some new and interesting finite dimensional integrable systems."

Professors Kustin and Miller will concentrate in this research mainly on the aspects of the theory that involve the interplay of linkage with the structure of finite free resolution of perfect ideals, putting particular emphasis on the multiplicative structures supported on these resolutions. They will also extend this study to the more flexible relation of residual intersection, so that previous techniques can be extended to a wider class of algebras. They are particularly interested in Rees algebras, and algebras defined by sequences and matrices of indeterminates. Applications to determination of rationality of Poincare series and the computation of certain K-groups are expected."

In the second category, the proposer aims at the problem of whether the rings, all of whose left modules are direct sums of finitely generated modules, are of finite representation type. The research is in the general area of ring theory. A ring is an algebraic structure having both an addition and a multiplication. These objects arise naturally and are important in many areas of mathematics and physics."

Other areas of investigation include the connection with vector space representations of finite partially ordered sets, the structure of torsion-free abelian groups that are flat as modules over their endomorphism ring, and E-modules. This project is in the general area of abelian group theory and is concerned with the classification of abelian groups. Although the classification of finite abelian groups has been well understood for a century, the classification of infinite abelian groups remains elusive. This research involves this old problem of classification of the infinite abelian groups, approached with new techniques."
