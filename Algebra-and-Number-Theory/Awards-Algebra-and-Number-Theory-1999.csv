The PI's will consider several algorithmic problems associated with presentations of groups and semigroups.  In particular they will use recent results on Higman type embeddings of free Burnside groups into finitely presented groups in order to construct an infinite torsion group with a finite number of generators and a finite number of relations.  They will also use these embedding results to study computational complexity by algebraic means.  In a second set of problems, they will study connections between residually finite extensions of free groups and their connection with dynamics of polynomial maps over p-adic numbers.  A third set of problems is concerned with use of automata-theoretic methods to study algorithmic problems about subgroups of various classes and associated problems.  A fourth set of problems is concerned with the study of diagram groups---groups that arise naturally in connection with semigroup presentations.<br/><br/>Groups and semigroups are algebraic objects that arise ubiquitously in mathematics whenever one studies symmetries of a mathematical object.  When these groups and semigroups are well described, certain algorithmic techniques my be used to study them.  There are applications of these studies to a number of areas including computer science.<br/>"

The Brauer group of the function field F of a rational p-adic curve can be fruitfully studied by examining its restriction to the completion F_p at the arithmetic prime p.  PI has in this way proved the existence of F-noncrossed products using lifting techniques tailored to this situation, and in part I of this project plans to determine more fine structure over F such as the theory of decomposability, index reduction, and noncrossed products.  In part II, PI plans to study the influence of ramification on the Brauer group over a general field by examining its effects on index, splitting, and decomposability, in the special setting of rank two henselian fields over fields of cohomological dimension two, such as number fields and generalized local fields.  One example of such a field is the generalized local field of dimension four.  The combination of a limited measure of totally ramified division algebras and a nontrivial index theory (index not equal to exponent) first occurs in these settings, and an analysis appears to be both interesting and tractible.<br/><br/>A division algebra is number system that has multiplication/division, like the complex numbers C, only these operations are noncommutative. W. R. Hamilton discovered the first example, the ``real quaternions'', in 1843 while searching for a way to define multiplication/division on real 3-space extending the one possessed by 2-space (given by C).  His discovery, which he considered to be the greatest of his career, showed that it could be done (only) in real 4-space.  Since Hamilton, division algebras extending many interesting number systems (fields) other than the real numbers have been found, and it has been realized that apart from being an interesting and beautiful subject in its own right, the theory of the division algebras extending a given field provides important information about the field itself.  This project seeks to understand the ``pathologies'' (obstructions to a general theory) that occur in division algebras by examining them in their most elemental forms.  Part one investigates fine structure over the function field of a curve defined over the p-adic field.  This field is of interest as perhaps the most elemental function field with a theory that includes standard pathologies such as noncrossed products and unequal index and exponent.  Part two investigates division algebras with a strictly controlled pathology known as total ramification, a notorious obstruction to general theory.  The PI has partial results to support the tractibility of these projects, in addition to examples illustrating their general interest.<br/>"

In the last two years, V. Voevodsky has revolutionized algebraic K-theory with the methods he uses in his proof of the Milnor conjecture.  The methods he has developed suggest a program which will be developed over the next few years to understand algebraic K-theory through a so-called stable homotopy category of algebraic varieties.  Using his methods, it has been possible to verify the Quillen Lichtenbaum conjecture in some cases, notably for number fields at the prime two.  Part of this project is to continue this work, some joint with M. Rost, to prove this conjecture in a larger number of cases.  G. Carlsson has developed a revised version of the Quillen Lichtenbaum conjecture, which should explicitly identify all homotopy groups of the algebraic K-theory spectra, not only the high dimensional ones as in the original conjecture. This version involves the representation theory of the absolute Galois group, rather than just the Galoios cohomology. The second goal of this project is to understand the relationship between The two constructions, in the hopes that Voevodsky's method might prove the revised conjecture, or that Carlsson's method will shed light on the general relationship between Voevodsky's work and the Quilen Lichtenbaum conjecture.<br/><br/>Algebraic K-theory is a relatively new subject in mathematics, which promises to relate two seemingly very disparate areas, namely topology (the study of curves and surfaces and their deformations),  and the very classical area of number theory, which studies the properties of the integers and equations over the integers.  Algebraic K-theory, which is defined topologically, appears to carry with it a great deal of arithmetic information.  Two important conjectures concerning this relationship are the Quillen Lichtenbaum conjecture and the Bloch-Kato conjecture.  V. Voevodsky has revolutionized this area over the last two or three years with his breakthrough work on both conjectures.  This project will be devoted to developing this work further, by having Voevodsky and Rost continue their work on the Bloch-Kato conjecture, and by connecting Voevodsky's methods with a revised, stronger version of the Quillen Lichtenbaum conjecture proposed by Carlsson.  In the long run, solutions to these problems have the potential to help us study the sets of solutions in the integers of algebraic equations, such as the famous Fermat equation.<br/>"

A finite field is a finite collection of objects where one can perform addition, multiplication and division in a similar fashion as for real numbers. The difference is that finite field operations involve no round-off errors at all. It is exactly this important property that makes finite fields useful for encoding (and hiding) digital information.  In fact, almost all the known encoding  methods for error correction and data security are based on algebraic structures over finite fields.  For instance, the US Digital Signature Standard (1998) is  based on finite field operations, while error correction codes based on  finite fields can be found today in almost every household (CD players) and on the outskirts of the solar system (Voyager probe).  This project focuses on efficient computations in finite fields and has important applications to coding theory, cryptography, and computer science."

A Modular tower is a sequence of moduli spaces canonically attached to a set of data coming from a finite group.  Modular towers are designed to allow analogies of the ideas of modular curves in many applications not previously associated with such techniques.  This project will concentrate on modular curve towers.  Among the goals of the project is to establish that high levels of a modular tower of curves will have no rational points, an important issue for many of the applications of the towers. Also to make the techniques of modular towers more easily applicable in new situations, Professor Fried will try to establish criteria which allow arbitrary towers of non-congruence curves to be given the structure of a modular tower. <br/><br/>In this project, Professor Fried will continue his work on issues related to the Inverse Galois Problem.  This is a long-standing unanswered question with its origins in the 19 century.  Over a hundred years ago mathematicians found that one could classify properties of the solutions to an equation by studying the symmetries of those solutions.  The solutions themselves and the symmetries of the solutions were connected in a direct but very surprising way.  Easy properties of symmetries were often connected to difficult properties of the solutions and vice versa. This allows the easy things to be transferred back and forth to the hard things through the connection.  The result is very powerful method for discovery.  In earlier work, Professor Fried introduced a new object into this connection called modular towers, and he hopes to use this object strengthen our understanding of the connection in the direction from the symmetries to the solutions."

This investigation will exploit the rich interplay between Number Theory and Combinatorics. The problems to be investigated either have their origin in Combinatorics or have immediate application to Combinatorics, yet the problems themselves are Number- Theoretic. Roughly speaking, the problems in this investigation can be divided into two parts. The first part is an extension of the recent joint  work with C.-L. Chai, concerning explicit constructions of automorphic  froms for general linear groups over function fields from geometric setting. Such forms will automatically satisfy the generalized Ramanujan conjecture. The Sato-Tate conjecture for the automorphic forms whose Fourier coefficients  are eigenvalues of certain Ramanujan graphs is expected to be proved. Also  proposed in this part is the study of Ramanujan hypergraphs, their connection  with buildings, and the connection between the eigenvalues of hypergraphs and  eigenvalues of Hecke operators. The purpose is to understand to which extent  the connection between Ramanujan graphs and classical cusp forms can be  generalized to higher rank groups. The second part is applications of number  theory to the construction of good codes. The proposed approaches include  p-adic analysis, character sum estimates, and explicit constructions of infinite towers of curves with many rational points. The PI plans to write a sequal to her book ""Number Theory with Applications"", including  results on the interaction between number theory and eigenvalues of Ramanujan graphs obtained in recent years as well as new results from this proposal.  The content of this book will also be taught in a graduate course at her home  institution.<br/><br/>This research falls into the general mathematical fields of Number Theory and Combinatorics.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems, which is the central theme of modern information theory. Combinatorics is also an indispensable tool in modern communications. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, good error-correcting codes used in satellite and wireless  communications, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with  discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research using techniques from number theory.<br/>"

Topics considered include: (1) Partially ordered sets. (This includes new approaches to several classical questions about sorting under partial information.  One main theme focuses on the behavior of various new parameters, with the intention of gaining a global understanding of the mysterious space of linear extensions of a poset.)  (2) Random matrices.  (Central here are questions about the first dependency among vectors drawn uniformly and independently from the set of vectors of a fixed weight in a high-dimensional vector space over a fixed finite field.  Recent work of J. Komlos and the investigator settled several issues concerning sparse random matrices over finite fields, and it is expected that the ideas developed in that work will be relevant to the present questions.)  (3) Randomized complexity of graph properties.  (The basic problem here is an old conjecture of R.M. Karp concerning the power of randomization in decision tree algorithms.  The investigator suggests an approach to this which, inter alia, leads to a range of new questions in the classical area of random graphs.)  (4) Entropy and the hard-core model. (One main issue here is estimation of the critical activity for the hard-core lattice gas model on the d-dimensional integer lattice.  It is hoped that this, as well as several other problems, can be attacked using an entropy method developed in earlier work of the proposer and his student A. Lawrenz.) (5) A percolation problem of Kasteleyn.  (Recent work of J. van den Berg and the proposer gives hope of a proof of Kasteleyn's simple but powerful correlation conjecture.)  (6) Conjectures of Chvatal and Frankl.  (The investigator suggests novel approaches to these two notorious old ""extremal"" problems from the theory of finite sets.)<br/><br/>Many of the question addressed here are of interest for computer science or statistical physics.  In particular, (1) and (3) are concerned with fundamental questions about the intrinsic complexity of (that is, theoretical limits on the efficiency of procedures for) basic algorithmic problems such as sorting and searching; while those in (4) and (5) deal especially with, roughly speaking, the spread of information in physical systems.  All are also of interest on purely mathematical grounds: each is centered on one or more problems against which current methods have proved woefully inadequate, so that significant progress requires significant new ideas.  New approaches are proposed for most of the problems considered.  One common theme is the application ideas from other areas of mathematics (e.g. entropy, geometry, Fourier analysis) to discrete problems.  Conversely, there is the possibility, particularly in (4) and (5), of bringing discrete ideas to bear on problems which until now have mainly been studied by people in other disciplines.<br/>"

The methods used to understand this  relationship involve a deep study of the necessity of conditions on the reduction number, which in turn are equivalent to explicit formulas for the core of an ideal.

His previous work provides a foundation for interpretting sets of syzygies as objects in combinatorial topology, and provides a link between toric and monomial ideals, two significant classes of ideals arising in combinatorics.  He seeks to extend this foundation for a class of toric ideals which relate to the combinatorial theory of matroids, and to then generalize the new results to a broader class of ideals, while avoiding arbitrary orientation choices by working in a product of projective spaces.  He will also continue his study of computational algebraic geometry and his development of computer algebra tools, seeking to further develop injective methods as a computational tool.<br/><br/>In other words, the investigator proposes to strengthen a link between counting methods in combinatorics and in algebra, for the purpose of making the algebraic methods more applicable to combinatorics.  In many combinatorials settings, such as counting colorings of a map, one can count by overcounting the possibilities, counting each possibility at least once, and then iteratively correcting by subtracting each overcount at least once, and so forth. Syzygies play exactly the same role in algebra, correcting for overcounting of dimensions.  The investigator's prior work yields new interpretations of syzygies which arise from combinatorial problems, and he seeks to further develop these interpretations and to apply them to combinatorial problems.<br/>"

He bridge for this connection is provided by the Frobenius map which relates group characters to symmetric functions.  In the ten years since its discovery, the Macdonald symmetric function basis has progressively emerged has a central element in this connection.  Efforts at proving a variety of conjectures surrounding the Macdonald basis, have led to some truly remarkable discoveries in the Theory of Symmetric functions as well as in Representation Theory.  In particular this led the principal  investigator  and his associates to the discovery of new and  efficient tools  to carry out calculations (both at the theoretical as well as practical levels) within the theory of symmetric functions.  The surprising development is that there is a family of plethystic operators which play a remarkable role within the theory of symmetric functions and unravel the complexity of the Macdonald basis.  Investigations, made possible by these discoveries reveal that this basis encodes some truly surprising properties of the diagonal action of the symmetric group Sn on polynomials on two sets of variables x1,...,xn and y1,...,yn.  The implications of these developments in several areas which range from Algebraic Combinatorics to Algebraic Geometry and Theoretical Physics are  presently under intensive investigation.<br/><br/>To this date very few researchers and educators in the pure as well as the applied sciences truly appreciate the vastness of new horizons offered by the combination of symbolic manipulation software and processing power of present day computers.  Several areas of mathematics have truly become experimental sciences.  In computer explorations, investigators that have mastered this art, are being daily amazed to see conjectures and theorems literately jump out of the screen.  In the early days of  the computer era, in the late sixties and early seventies involvement with the space exploration efforts carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratories, the principal investigator was made keenly aware of the needs to develop tools that enabled the translation of theoretical discoveries into practical computational methods.  This led to a frantic effort towards the replacement of pure ""existence"" proofs by ""algorithmic"" arguments. Nevertheless, the ability to carry extensive computations by hand for days without committing a single mistake is a quality that has been reserved to only a handful of humans over the ages.  It has become clear that the power of such giants as Gauss and Euler was substantially based on this rare ability.  However, it is not irreverent to say that, nowadays, any talented mathematics graduate student in possession of a 400MHz PC with MAPLE or  MATHEMATICA  can easily computationally outdo weeks of both Gauss and Euler  ombined in a matter of minutes.  Yet a great deal remains to be done.  The few utilities that are added constantly to these symbolic manipulation packages, nowhere near exhaust the possibilities that have become available.  Surprisingly, very few investigators realize the power of the theory of symmetric functions as a symbolic manipulation tool.  The latter stems from the fact that non linear problems may be linearized by the introduction of an infinite number of variables.  It develops that the change of bases matrices of symmetric function theory may be used to ""mock"" the presence of infinities within a finite device, thereby permitting the linearization of many a computational problem.  This given it is easily seen how important it is to pursue investigations in the theory of symmetric functions that extend and deepen  the computational power of the theory.  This is the foremost goal of the present project.<br/><br/>"

Unfortunately many times these collections are much too difficult to actually count.

The original, and still basic, applications are to discrete mathematics when one wishes to prove the existence of an object having certain properties.  Very roughly, a random  object is appropriately defined and it is shown that the random object has the desired properties with positive probability.  The methodology strongly intersects with the use of randomness in Theoretical Computer Science, the interaction going both ways.  If a random algorithm can be proven to have positive chance of success then the existence of a success is guaranteed.  Further, the output of  random algorithms is very much of interest for its own sake.  As the random object evolves there are certain critical regions, dubbed threshold functions, where the probability of events move rapidly from near zero to near one.  Using methods from mathematical logic the investigator attempts to describe the possible threshold functions for all events expressible in a given logical language.<br/><br/>Randomness is now recognized to play an important role in many computer algorithms.  The investigators particularly study packing algorithms.  How  can a set of partially overlapping requests - for bandwidth, takeoff slots or whatever - be handled to satisfy the maximal number of requests?  With the random greedy algorithm the requests are taken in randomly shuffled order and then each is approved if not conflicting with previous  approvals.  Oftimes this natural and easily implemented algorithm can be  shown to give near optimal results though analysis of it has proved to be particularly subtle.  A second, though related, area is in percolation effects.  Large systems are (often) nonlinear - they undergo a phase transition (liquid  to gas, low crime to high crime) which is qualitative as well as quantitative in a surprisingly short period of time.  With the appropriate scaling the  investigator shall spread out this transition so as better to understand  the phenomenon.<br/>"

Their importance is highlighted  by their applications in Theoretical Computer Science.  The PIs continue their work on this subject and investigate three different aspects of  representations.  One of the goals of the PIs is to discover dense graphs not containg some fixed graph G as a subgraph.  This problem is wide open once G is bipartite.  The PIs search for algebraic or geometric representation of the appropriate graphs (e.g., Ramanujan graphs, norm graphs, polarity graphs).  In another aspect of graph representations the type of representation is given and one tries to find the most efficient one for a class of graphs.  The PI and the coPI investigate ``worst-case'' and ``average-case'' efficiencies of important representations.  The methods here also include probability theory.  Finally, the PIs apply appropriately chosen representations as tools in the  determination of some other parameter or property of a combinatorial structure of interest. <br/><br/><br/>Graphs are made up of ""vertices"" and ""edges"" connecting some pairs of vertices. Behind the transparent definition hidden is a vast amount of  complexity.  One of the reasons the study of graphs is of paramount interest  is their wide applicability in Computer Science.  The ""thinking"" of today's  computers is modeled by graphs.  Algorithms often use specific exmples of graphs having a certain appropriately chosen structure.  The speed of an  algorithm could depend on the attributes of the graphs employed.  The problems  arising are part of a broader research area within Combinatorics, which aims at obtaining information about global properties of graphs under some local restrictions.  The PIs tackle specific problems of this type.  They apply ideas from algebra and geometry to obtain representations of graphs with excellent global properties.  Another aspect of graph representations is the following.  Expensive computer (disk) space can be saved by communicating the structure of a graph to the computer efficiently.  In these problems the type of the representation, that is the the way of communication is fixed, and one tries to determine how well different graphs can be represented.  The  PI and the coPI investigate ""economic"" ways to represent graphs using  representations from algebra and geomtry. <br/>"

Almost all problems in graph theory, including various   coloring problems, routing problems, and embedding problems are very   closely related to connectivity. However, connectivity is not   preserved under most graph operations which are usually needed in   studying graphs. Thus, knowing how to perform these operations, in   particular, minor operations, while maintaining the connectivity is   a very important and fundamental problem facing graph theorists   today. In this project, the PI proposes to investigate three (sets   of) problems on graph connectivity. Instead of concentrating on   local properties like the existence of contractible edges, these   problems are more concerned with global structure of k-connected   graphs. The PI's first problem is a Ramsey-type problem which   basically says that a large complete-bipartite-graph-minor is   unavoidable from every highly connected large graph. Problem two is   about fixing the connectivity of a minor. It seeks the best function   f(k,m) for which, if G is a minor of a k-connected graph H, then H   has a k-connected minor H' with at most f(k,|E(G)|) edges such that   H' also contains G as a minor. The third problem in this project is   a conjecture which asserts that the graph version of Seymour's   splitter theorem can be extended from 3-connected graphs to   k-connected graphs for all k.<br/><br/>All these proposed problems are important and fundamental. Their   solutions will provide powerful new tools for dealing with high   connectivity, and that will affect many areas of graph theory. For   instance, these solutions could have a big impact on problems like   characterizing K(6)-minor-free graphs and Petersen-minor-free   graphs, two well-known open problems in graph theory. Moreover, this   study is also very important from the point of view of   applications. It could bring new insights on improving network   reliability and network security.<br/>"

The complex <br/>irreducible characters of a finite group G separate <br/>naturally into blocks with respect to any prime p dividing the <br/>order of G. Each such character has a defect, which depends only <br/>on the power of p dividing the degree of that character. <br/>In 1992 the principal investigator of this project formulated a conjecture <br/>relating the number of characters with a fixed defect in a fixed <br/>block of G to the numbers of characters with the same defect in <br/>related blocks of certain p-local subgroups of G. This conjecture, <br/>if true, would imply several other important conjectures about <br/>blocks of group characters. Furthermore, a very strong form of it <br/>would hold for all finite groups G if it held whenever G is <br/>simple. Since the finite simple groups have been classified, this <br/>gives some hope of proving a number of major conjectures about <br/>characters of arbitrary finite groups by verifying this one <br/>strong conjecture for all blocks of finite simple groups. This <br/>verification for any given group involves a long, delicate calculation. <br/>It has been carried out in detail by several people for a large number of <br/>individual simple groups and a few infinite families of such groups. So <br/>far it has always proved to be correct. We hope it will continue to do <br/>so.<br/><br/>Groups in mathematics grew out of the notion of symmetry. We regard <br/>the symmetries of any object in physics, chemistry or mathematics as <br/>transformations of that object onto itself preserving all relevant <br/>properties of the object. Then the composition of two such symmetries is <br/>again a symmetry of the object. So is the inverse of any symmetry. In <br/>mathematical terms, this means that the symmetries form a group. This <br/>symmetry group is an important invariant of the object, and is much <br/>studied. In quantum mechanics, differential geometry and algebraic number <br/>theory the relations of this group with other invariants of the object are <br/>often expressed using representations of the group by complex matrices, <br/>one for each element of the group, which behave under multiplication as <br/>the corresponding group elements do under composition. When the group is <br/>finite, such representations are completely determined by their <br/>characters, which are the functions mapping each group element into the <br/>trace of the corresponding matrix. The relations between finite groups <br/>and their characters have fascinated mathematicians for over a hundred <br/>years.

Passman plans to work on three main problems during the next few years along with his usual slew of miscellaneous ones.  The main problems concern (1) the semiprimitivity of groups rings of finitely generated groups, (2) the structure of the lattice of two-sided ideals of a group algebra, and (3) the simplicity of Lie algebras of generalized Cartan type.  The proposer returned to the study of group rings in 1990 and during the past few years, in a long series of papers, he was able to describe the Jacobson radicals of group rings of locally finite groups.  In some sense, this solves half of the semiprimitivity problem, and he now proposes to work on the other half, namely the case of finitely generated groups.  The second problem is motivated by the visit of Alex Zalesskii to Madison for the Spring semester of 1999.  He and the proposer plan to study variations of the question of when group algebras have only trivial ideals.  This will hopefully be the start of a long term collaboration.  Finally, the proposer has recently taken a ring theoretic approach to study the simplicity of Lie algebras of generalized Cartan type.  He has already settled the problem for Witt type algebras, is presently working with Jeff Bergen on the special algebras, and hopes to deal with the Hamiltonian and contact types at some later time.<br/><br/>Historically, groups first arose as the set of all symmetries of a geometric object.  Since the product (composition) of two symmetries is again a symmetry, we see that a group is a collection of elements with a ``nice'' multiplication.  Conversely, if we start with an abstract group, then we can better understand it by allowing it to ``act'' as symmetries on certain algebraic objects.  The appropriate objects to consider here are built out of vectors and are called vector spaces.  The action is achieved by forming the group algebra, which is an algebraic object determined by the group and having both an addition and a multiplication.  The vector spaces of interest are then what are known as the irreducible modules for the group algebra, irreducible because we would like them to be as small as possible.  As it turns out, there is a fundamental obstacle to this procedure, namely the Jacobson radical of the group algebra.  Indeed, the procedure works if and only if this radical is trivial, in which case we say that the group algebra is semiprimitive.  Thus, it is a natural and important problem to decide when group algebras are semiprimitive, and this is the goal of proposal (1), described above. Proposal (2) is concerned with taking an even closer look at the group algebra, but under more special circumstances.<br/>"

In the study of tilings one examines the different ways in which a region can be built by fitting together smaller pieces (called tiles) taken from a small collection of shapes.  The combinatorial perspective focuses on the question `In how many ways can this tiling problem be solved?' while the probabilistic perspective focuses on the question `What does a typical solution to this tiling problem look like?'  In many instances these tiling models are equivalent to models studied by statistical mechanicians for decades, but the new outlook is leading to many results that the physicists missed.  The tools that are used in attacking these questions range from complex analysis and the calculus of variations to ergodic theory and interacting particle systems.<br/><br/>On one level, this is basic mathematical research whose main motivation (like that of most theoretical mathematics) arises from the desire to understand phenomena that are simple yet surprising, especially in cases where existing analytical tools do not make it possible to provide rigorous proofs of empirically well-founded conjectures.  A further (and potentially more applicable) motivation for this research comes from the fact that tilings are simplified models of matter, particularly of matter that incorporates randomness at the very finest levels of organization.  In many cases, the precise details of the tiling problem (the shape of the tiles and of the region to be tiled) enforce a kind of large-scale heterogeneity reminiscent of physical systems in which different phases of a substance (such as ice, liquid water, and steam) coexist.  In studying tiling models, one can prove rigorous results concerning the ways in which the boundaries between different phases are maintained thermodynamically.  Thus the study of tilings can serve as a kind of a test-bed in which some ideas about random media can be subjected to mathematical analysis.<br/>"

One of the modern trends in extremal combinatorics is the study of extremal and probabilistic aspects of  general properties and large families of combinatorial structures.  The PI is one of the main advocates of this trend, and several of the  main results due to him and his collaborators. The substantial theory  that has emerged so far continues the theory started fifty years ago,  but goes way beyond the classical achievements. The aim is to determine  the fine structure of a hereditary property of graphs (or hypergraphs)  that is minimal for a given lower bound on the rate of growth. The hope  is to obtain characterizations that are precise enough to lead to good  estimates of the generalized chromatic numbers of random graphs. The  methods to be employed are an exciting blend of intricate extremal arguments and probabilistic methods based on the Erdos-Stone theorem,  variants of Ramsey's theorem, Szemeredi's regularity lemma, and  concentration of measure inequalities. The PI will collaborate with  Thomason, Brightwell, Leader, Scott, Balogh, Weinreich, and others on  the project. The PI will work on several other related projects:  with Riordan on invariants and polynomials of colored graphs and fat  graphs, with Balister and Stacey on percolation, with Arratia and Sorkin  on problems related to sequencing, and with Borgs, Chayes, Kim and Wilson on phase transitions in random combinatorial structures.<br/><br/>The problems to be studied by the PI are major problems of extremal  and probabilistic combinatorics. In addition to their intrinsic  significance, the problems are relevant to questions in computer science, statistical physics, and DNA sequencing.<br/>"

These two definitions are widely  believed to be equivalent. However, there is no strong evidence that this would be the case. The investigator's goal is to clarify this question  and to give new estimates for crossing numbers of graphs satisfying some special conditions. Some similar estimates turned out to be applicable to a number of classical open problems in discrete geometry, including the problem of bounding from above (resp. from below) the number of  unit (resp. distinct) distances determined by a point set, the k-set problem of Erdos and Lovasz etc, and they are also related to some deep questions in algebraic geometry. Some existing bounds on crossing numbers  have direct applications in the theory of geometric graphs (i.e., graphs  drawn by straight-line segments), the other main subject of the present  proposal. The investigator plans to develop some general theories for  geometric graphs, analogous to the rich and fruitful fields of Extremal Graph  Theory and Ramsey Theory for abstract graphs. <br/> <br/><br/> Many basic problems in robotics and in computer graphics lead to  deep mathematical questions about arrangements of segments in the plane.

To address these problems, the investigator and his colleagues have developed  some new techniques combining combinatorial and topological ideas. As a  by-product, they obtained some surprising results to estimate the crossing  number of a graph (network), a parameter known to be intimately related to  the minimum chip area required for its VLSI layout. The aim of the proposed research is to better understand and to improve these estimates by utilizing more involved topological tools.

The best example of this is the attempt to obtain the powerful Decomposition Theorem for a class of spaces and mappings wider than morphisms of algebraic varieties.<br/><br/>When mathematicians look for examples of geometric spaces, they often turn to those that are the set of solutions of a polynomial equation in any number of variables, or more generally, the simultaneous solutions of a number of such equations.  These spaces are the building blocks of the branch of mathematics known as algebraic geometry, whose spaces are called algebraic varieties.  Although varieties are described in a fundamentally direct manner, it is often hard to see how this information gets converted to the significant geometric properties of the space.  When W.V.D. Hodge came up with the theory that bears his name, it was primarily intended for applications in algebraic geometry.  The research proposed by Professor Zucker will be on spaces having continuous symmetries, and on the algebraic varieties that are made by conceptually simple contructions on those spaces.<br/><br/>"

The proposers request funding in order to ensure participation by leading researchers from Europe and Australia and to assist graduate students and recent PhD recipients.  The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for merging theory and practice of computations with groups.  It is expected that this will result in increased understanding of the deeper mathematical issues that underlie group computations, and that these will have important algorithmic implications as we move toward the the next generation of computer architectures.  That this objective is likely to be met is evidenced by previous related workshops on ``Groups and Computation'' held at DIMACS (in Rutgers University) in 1991 and 1995.  A primary goal of those workshops was to foster a dialogue between researchers studying the complexity of group computations and those engaged in the development of practical algorithms.  There were many comments by participants, both during  and afterwards, that this goal had been achieved beyond the organizers' expectations, and had led to new perspectives and new collaborations.  As a direct result, practical versions were devised for algorithms initially developed by theoreticians to improve worst case asymptotic running times; some of these have been implemented in the major computational group theory systems. Providing opportunities for graduate students and younger researchers, both as participants and as speakers, was another  of the many successful aspects of  previous workshops, and will be an important feature of this one as well.<br/><br/>Computational group theory is an interdisciplinary field involving the use of groups to solve problems in computer science and mathematics.  The conference will explore the interplay of research which has taken place in a number of broad areas: symbolic algebra, theoretical computer science, group theory, and applications of group computation.  In addition to talks on a wide variety of mathematical and computer science issues, at past conferences on this subject there have been numerous talks on links to statistics, circuit design, digital signal processing, and the uses of parallel architectures within this branch of symbolic algebra.  The major computational group theory systems employed internationally have had impacts on research within mathematics as well as its applications; based on previous experience, fast new approaches will come out of the proposed conference and will be implemented in these systems.<br/>"

Technically, they arise as maximal orders in division algebras, but they can also be understood as being generated by a finite number of elements together with a finite number of relations. For example, the usual polynomials are generated by the variables (in degree one) with the relations saying that the variables have commutative multiplication (i.e. xy = yx). In fact, some of the motivating examples for this project, the Sklyanin algebras in degree 3, have properties very similar to the usual polynomials in three variables (except being noncommutative) and therefore give what is called a ""quantum plane"". The Sklyanin algebras were introduced by Sklyanin in his work on the Yang-Baxter Equation and the quantum inverse problem, and their theory has been extensively developed during the past decade using the tools of noncommutative geometry.<br/><br/>This project blends modern techniques from number theory, algebraic geometry, and K-theory. The mathematical problems in this project were motivated originally by physics problems for which there are no visual geometric pictures. This project will develop ways to transform these ""noncommutative"" geometry problems into better understood and more classical ""commutitive"" geometric problems. Geometric problems have long been encoded in a mathematical construction called an algebra. An algebra can be described by equations. The equations describing important geometric algebras are often known only ""in theory"", but the techniques used in this project can determine the equations explicitly. Moreover, these equations can then be directly related to the curves which were used in defining the original algebras. Using this information, the analysis of many noncommutative (""quantum"") questions can be reduced to commutative questions producing the visualizations that help produce answers."

Automorphism groups of curves in positive characteristic will be investigated using sophisticated group theory -- especially the theory of primitive permutation groups and properties of finite simple groups. The investigator intends to reduce many of the questions to the case of almost simple groups and investigate the almost simple groups. Recent examples suggest that in positive characteristic, a special role will be played by Chevalley groups in that characteristic. In joint work with Shareshian, symmetric and alternating groups acting on curves in all characteristics will be studied. This has already led to very detailed information about coverings by generic curves of a given genus -- a problem first studied by Zariski. The analog of the Guralnick-Thompson conjecture regarding composition factors of covers of by genus g curves in characteristic zero will be investigated. Detailed probabilistic and asymptotic properties of finite groups will be investigated using detailed information about the subgroup structure of almost simple groups. Algebraic groups will also be investigated from this point of view. Results on algebraic groups often shed light on the finite case, and one can often use results in one setting to obtain similar results in the other setting.<br/><br/>The activities supported in this proposal should shed some new light on automorphism groups of curves in positive characteristic as well as curves with special properties (e.g., curves with few points or many points or the median value number of points). The investigator hopes to move closer to the complete classification of exceptional polynomials over finite fields (essentially bijective polynomials) which will have consequences in coding theory and cryptography. The probabilistic group theory aspects of the proposal should lead to improvements in computational methods in group theory. In particular, these methods should allow for probabilistic means of determining when random elements from a finite group generate a proper subgroup as well as identifying the group generated by a collection of elements. Another goal of the project is to classify coverings of generic genus g curves in characteristic 0 and to find the correct analog in positive characteristic. The techniques needed for this should prove useful in many sorts of covering curve problems."

The predominant object of study of this proposal are ideals, and especially sets of ideals which are related to each other in some natural way, such as ordinary, Frobenius, or symbolic powers of a particular ideal.

For functions on families of convex sets, the property of being a valuation has been found to be very useful. The combination of these two ideas should result in a fruitful study of many interesting open problems in combinatorial geometry. The notion of a ""linearly varying"" function on uniform oriented matroids provides a means of combining the two ideas. Examples of linearly varying functions include the number of ""k-sets"" in a configuration of points, the number of k-faces of a simplicial convex polytope, and the number of crossings in a rectilinear drawing of the comlete graph with n vertices. The investigator will study the extremal properties of linearly varying functions on uniform oriented matroids, with the expectation that substantial knowledge about these and other linearly varying functions will be obtained. Additionally, the investigator will explore the possibility of extending the notion of linearly varying functions to oriented matroids which are not necessarily uniform.<br/><br/> An example of a problem in combinatorial geometry is the following. Suppose n points in the plane are given, and no three are on a common line. If all of the line segments joining these points two at a time are drawn, how many crossings must there be? When n exceeds 10, no one knows what the least possible number of such crossings is. An abstract framework for studying this and other problems of combinatorial geometry in two and higher dimensions is provided by the notion of an ""oriented matroid."" Oriented matroids were first described about twenty-five years ago, simultaneously by several different mathematicians, and their use has been fruitful. The investigator intends to use this abstract framework in conjunction with another fruitful idea, that of a ""valuation,"" with the expectation of solving some problems in this area. Solutions of problems in combinatorial geometry often lead to better algorithms for computational geometry, and occasionally to improved designs for computer chips."

The objective of this proposal is to continue with the development of an analogous subject, termed algebraic geometry over groups, which applies specifically to group theory. A number of new ideas have arisen which allow us to not only develop a general theory for groups, akin to that in algebraic geometry, but also to look at various classes of groups in a new way. In particular there are groups which in a sense are the counterpart to curves, so-called one-relator groups, which can now be studied from a very different vantage point. In addition, techniques from computational group theory come into play as well and we plan on exploiting them also, in the tenure of this proposal.<br/><br/><br/>The notion of symmetry is familiar to most of us. For example, wall-paper patterns, the beautiful arrangements of naturally occurring chrystals and the floor tilings of many old churches are but a few examples of symmetry. Mathematicians have invented a highly abstract object, called a group, which allows them to capture and measure symmetry. The general investigation of such objects, called group theory, has been carried out with this in mind. This theory has applications to much of modern mathematics as well as to physics, chemistry, biology, to the theory of computing, to cryptography as well as to our physical world of three and four dimensions. It is to the further development of this general theory of these groups that this proposal will be devoted."
