In               particular, it will focus on a collection of torsion-free abelian               groups called Butler groups.  The principal investigator will                   investigate the construction and the structure of these groups by               using set theoretic methods.                                                         This research is in the general area of abelian group                      theory.  The current trend in abelian groups is to utilize set                  theory and logic in determining questions on structure.                         Mathematical logic enters into this context since scholars in                   this subject have discovered that certain research problems in                  this area are either undecidable in ordinary set theory or else                 require further set-theoretic axioms for their resolution.  This                project will concentrate on a subclass of abelian groups called                 Butler groups."

There are two general areas               of problems which will be studied.  The first is concerned with                 basic decision problems which arise when an inverse monoid is                   presented by generators and relations.  In particular, the word                 problem and the E-unitary problem will be studied, with initial                 emphasis focussed on the one relator case.  Many of the geometric               techinques from combinatorial group theory as well as basic                     results from language theory and automata theory will be used.                  The second problem is concerned with a study of the closed                      inverse submonoids of the free inverse monoid and related                       problems.  In particular, the relationship between the closed                   inverse submonoids of a free inverse monoid, the topology of                    finite graphs, the rational and recognizable subsets of a free                  inverse monoid and the dot depth of a finite aperiodic inverse                  monoid will be studied in detail.  In addition, an attempt will                 be made to begin a computational theory of finite inverse                       semigroups of partial one-one transformations.                                       This research concerns the theory of monoids, the simplest                 of the abstract algebraic objects introduced in the last century.               The particular ones that the investigators are interested in are                precisely those structures arising in automata theory and the                   theory of formal languages in computer science.  Their techniques               range from group theory to geometry to computations.  Their                     approaches to the problems are imaginative.  This proposal should               make important contributions to both mathematics and computer                   science."

A fundamental                   aspect is the use of supercomputers.  Algorithms are designed                   that use a mix of algebraic and combinatorial methods.  The                     results of these computations give valuable insight into the                    solutions of the ongoing research problems described now.  The                  first problem is to compute the Lie algebra cohomology of the                   tensor product of a finite dimensional complex Lie algebra L with               a certain polynomial quotient ring.  If L is semisimple, a                      solution to this problem would imply the Macdonald root-system                  conjectures.  Partial results and strong computer evidence points               to a complete solution when L is either semisimple or nilpotent.                The second problem is to determine the algebra structure of the                 symplectic and orthogonal centralizer algebras defined by Richard               Brauer.  These algebras are fundamental to the representation                   theory of the symplectic and orthogonal groups and are rich in                  combinatorial structure.  Again, strong computer evidence and                   partial results suggest that a complete solution to this                        structure problem will have and elegant combinatorial statement.                     This research investigates the combinatorial structure of                  algebraic problems.  Many of these questions can be described as                determining certain coefficients of certain polynomials which on                the one hand are defined in a complicated algebraic way but on                  the other hand have a simple combinatorial interpretation.                      Hanlon has in his short career become one of the world's leading                authorities on this important subject.  His use of the                          supercomputers to aid this work is very innovative.  His research               will certainly have the most profound affect."

The basic theme is                the extension of techniques which are successful for the A root                 system to the other root systems.  Kadell has extended Aomoto's                 proof of Selberg's integral to the q-case and proved the q-                     MacDonald-Morris conjecture for BC root system.  This should                    extend to treat the remaining root systems.  A number of results                for Schur functions related to the A root systems have been                     proven combinatorially.  Kadell will attack some related problems               associated with the B root system.  Finally the q-Selberg                       polynomials extend the Schur functions, the little q-Jacobi                     polynomials and the zonal polynomials and it is hoped that a                    theory of these polynomials, including a combinatorial                          representation, can be based on a conjectured orthogonality                     relation.                                                                            This research focuses on the theory of combinatorial                       identities, an important subject that combines combinatorial                    ideas with deep problems and techniques from algebra and                        analysis.  The subject has recently become even more important                  with the discovery with important ties to physics.  The MacDonald               conjectures and their many variants have been the central focal                 point of this area for years.  Kadell is making significant                     progress on these deep problems and will continue to make                       exciting contributions during this research."

The specific objective of the research is to give a                     cohomology data on a surface which is sufficient to reconstruct a               surface itself.  By stating precisely what such a cohomology data               should be and relating it to the the usual IVHS, one can infer                  sufficient conditions for the generic Global Torelli Theorem for                certain irregular surfaces of general type, one of the main                     motivations of the research.                                                            The ""heart"" of the research is a new method of relating IVHS            to the geometry of a surface.  The essence of the method is to                  interpret part of the data of IVHS as a set of equations defining               the zero-locus of a holomorphic 1-form on a surface.                                    This method itself is an important part of the research:  it            not only enables one to resolve the specific objectives described               above, but also is an effective mechanism which ties together                   three important aspects of study of an algebraic surface:  IVHS                 of a surface; vector bundles of rank 2 on a surface; and                        effective 0-cycles on a surface.                                                        This research is in the general area of complex algebraic               geometry.  It uses algebraic and analytic tools to obtain                       information on geometric objects.  It is an extremely important                 branch of mathematics, and Reider shows potential to add                        significantly to knowledge in the field."

The main                 one involves the geometry of the period space.  In the first part               of this problem the P.I. will attempt to construct a smooth                     analytic compactification of period space in arbitrary weight.                  The boundary components should have an interpretation as period                 spaces for mixed Hodge structures and the gluing should reflect                 several fundamental results on degeneration of Hodge structures.                This compactification should make it possible to recast much of                 Hodge theory in a more geometric form and help in the study of                  Shimura varieties.  In the second part of this problem the                      Cartan-Kahler theory of regular integral elements for exterior                  differential systems will be applied to obtain dimension bounds                 and local invariants for the image of the period map as well as                 its intersection with Shimura varieties.  The second problem                    deals with moduli spaces of Lax structures.  Here the research                  will focus on the study of the moduli space of Lax structures for               a given integrable Hamiltonian system as the fundamental algebra-               geometric invariant of the system replacing the less natural                    though common notion of spectral curve.  Applications are                       envisaged to a series of classical systems in the form of theta-                function parametrizations which are completely natural to their                 systems rather than working only up to isogeny.                                      This research will focus on problems in algebraic geometry                 and applications to partial differential equations.  Not only                   then will the geometric objects arising as the set of solutions                 of simultaneous polynomial equations be studied for their own                   sake but attempts will be made to apply this deep theory to other"

The second will be the                  study of the distribution of the Frobenius map acting on the                    Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves over a finite field and thereby               study the distribution of the divisor class groups of such                      curves.  This is connected with the Cohen-Lenstra conjecture in                 number fields.

The proposer brings to bear a wide variety of tools to               perform this research.  Using analysis and geometry the study of                lower bounds of one of the crucial invariants in algebraic number               theory, the regulator, will be studied.  The study of the                       distribution of divisor class groups involves a study in                        probability concerning these geometric objects.  The problem on                 the Iwasawa involves a heavy use of algebra techniques.  The                    principle has a firm command of these diverse tools and will                    contribute a great deal to the theory."

The first is an investigation of                  the coefficients in the Fourier-Jacobi expansion of a holomorphic               automorphic form on G which is an eigenfunction of all Hecke                    operators.  The coefficients, which are theta functions on an                   abelian variety with complex multiplication by E, are determined                by the eigenvalues of the Hecke operators, but no explicit                      formula is known.  It is suggested that the coefficients are                    related to special values of L-functions.  The second topic                     concerns the study of automorphic forms on G and their Fourier-                 Jacobi expansions over rings of integers.  The third topic is an                investigation of the Galois representations associated to                       automorphic representations of G.                                                    This research will concentrate on those areas of number                    theory concerning automorphic forms of many variables and abelian               varieties.  The former are functions which encode much of the                   information on the number theoretic problem to be solved allowing               one to use the powerful techniques of analysis in the solution.                 The latter are geometric objects which are relevant to the number               theory problem.  Together these objects form powerful tools to                  solve the very deep problems of number theory.  This P.I. is a                  master of these tools and so much of great interest will result                 from this research."

The additive theory is based on exponential sums of primes and typically uses characters and Dirichlet L-functions in order to express additive characters as sums of multiplicative functions. The overlap between these two areas is what is being studied in this research. Some specific topics to be examined are pair correlation of zeros of zeta functions, prime pairs and their connection with Kloostermann sums and Barban-Davenpoort type theorems, small gaps between zeta zeros, the function S(T) and Siegal zeros. This research concerns prime number theory, that is, the distribution of the prime numbers in the integers. Certain complex analytic functions, called zeta functions, contain this information and so they are studied uses tools from analysis.
