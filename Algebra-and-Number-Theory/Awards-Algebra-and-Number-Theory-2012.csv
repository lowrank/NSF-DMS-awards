Freed, Dan F. Knopf, Alan W. Reid<br/><br/>The University of Texas Geometry/Topology Research Training Grant (RTG) is a vertically integrated program to enhance the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates at the University of Texas and, through publication on the web, beyond.  The thirteen faculty members will build on the success of our previous RTG grants and also initiate new activities.  The latter include a Directed Reading Program pairing undergraduate students and graduate mentors; a new Journal Seminar for all graduate students in geometry and topology; a new series of First Cut Lectures on a variety of core topics, to be disseminated on the web; a new yearly Undergraduate Mathematics Conference; and a new series of Graduate Winter Schools for graduate students and postdocs.  All RTG activities are designed around a unified perspective on geometry and topology.  They include a healthy mix of ideas from low dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, global linear and nonlinear analysis, geometric group theory, geometric representation theory, and homotopy theory; often concepts and inspiration from theoretical physics play an important role as well.  The RTG training activities are designed to promote this unified view of geometry and topology and, more broadly, of mathematics and science to young mathematicians.<br/><br/>Mathematics, the study of Number and Space, lies at the foundation of science and technology.  Geometry, the study of Space, has long had connections with and applications to the real world.  Topology investigates, very roughly, global geometric properties of spaces which do not rely on local structure. There is great interplay between Geometry and Topology-there is not a sharp boundary between them.  In the ancient world measurement was introduced to facilitate commerce; more advanced concepts, such as trigonometry, were introduced to understand the stars.  In our modern world advanced ideas in Geometry underlie abstract theories in physics and also have more immediate practical implications, for example in navigation, computer graphics, etc. The large scale structures studied in topology appear in biological and physical science; there are new applications to data analysis and signal processing as well.  Effective training of the next generation of Geometers and Topologists is vital for the continued development of these ideas, both within mathematics and for external applications.  The University of Texas Geometry/Topology Research Training Grant promotes a unified view of the field.  An open attitude towards ideas from all directions is essential for success with the challenges facing mathematics and science today.  Through local activities in Austin, and via dissemination on the web, the RTG will enhance training at all levels."

The Langlands program studies the interrelations between several subjects, including the representation theory of reductive groups (both over local fields and over the adeles of a global field), automorphic forms, global Galois representations, and L-functions.  Each of these subjects has a p-adic aspect:  one may consider p-adic or adelic groups acting on topological p-adic vector spaces, p-adic automorphic forms (or their close cousins, cohomology classes with p-adic coefficients on arithmetic quotients of symmetric spaces), p-adic representations of Galois groups and their deformation theory, and p-adic L-functions.  The proposed investigation will encompass all these.   Some of the particular results expected to follow from this investigation are: new results regarding the structure of p-adically completed cohomology on arithmetic quotients of symmetric spaces, and new results relating special values of L-functions attached to modular forms to the arithmetic properties of the associated Galois representations.<br/><br/>Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies phenomena related to properties of whole numbers.  A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest. The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions.  The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures(or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form.  (Number theorists refer to Langlands conjectured relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ""reciprocity law"".)  Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic methods to study his conjectures.  These are methods that exploit the many symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics known as ""the Langlands program"".  A more recent approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods.  These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms and L-functions.   Recently, the representation theoretic methods and p-adic methods have begun to be unified into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program"". The proposer aims to develop new results and methods in the  p-adic Langlands program, and to use them to establish new results about L-functions, and to develop tools for establishing new reciprocity laws."

Over a point, the bundles are naturally described as conformal blocks, vector spaces that arise as basic objects in rational conformal field theory.   The projects in this proposal are focused on three general themes, aimed at developing our understanding of vector bundles of conformal blocks bundles and their interplay with cycles on the moduli space.  The first project aims to show the Chern classes of so-called ""critical level bundles"" are subject to ''strange identities'',  given by interchanging roles of level and rank.  The second project explores properties of conformal blocks divisors, including their corresponding morphisms, questions of finite generation, and applications.  The third project is concerned with cones of positive cycles on varieties, illustrated for the moduli space of stable n-pointed rational curves via conformal blocks.<br/><br/><br/>Moduli spaces of stable curves with marked points occupy a unique and prominent position in the algebro-geometric universe. As moduli spaces, they give insight into the study of smooth curves and their degenerations, and as special varieties, they have played an important role in developing general theory. Recent work has revealed that many combinatorial aspects of the spaces are reflections of underlying geometric structures embodied by vector bundles of conformal blocks. The projects in this proposal aim both to use the features of these vector bundles to discover the nature of the moduli spaces, and also to use the architecture of the moduli spaces to reveal underlying relationships between the vector bundles."

For commutative algebra, early on, its roots in algebraic geometry and number theory provided the major influences, while representation theory was partly motivated early on by problems in physics.  More recently there has been significant interaction between these two areas. Some of this interaction goes back to the work of Auslander, his students and collaborators in the 1970s, but the last decade or so has seen a striking resurgence of new ideas and research in the overlap, as exemplified by recent work of Avramov, Buchweitz, Burban, Huneke, Iyama, Reiten and Yoshino, to name only a few.<br/><br/><br/>There have been relatively few joint meetings in the U.S. allowing researchers in commutative algebra and representation theory and their students to interact. It is vital to support the continued interactions between the areas by bringing together top researchers to report on their findings and to establish new cross disciplinary collaborations. Equally important is a gathering where recent doctorates, graduate students, and faculty from primarily teaching institutions can learn about recent developments and establish research connections with other workers across the two fields. To address these issues, the investigators plan a three-day conference at Syracuse University. The conference will take place on April 13-15, 2012. Leading researchers from both commutative algebra and representation theory will speak on their findings. Ample time for discussions will also be available to provide an opportunity for the participants, including the speakers, to establish new cross-collaborations. We intend to recruit an audience in which graduate students and recent doctorates are significantly represented. The URL for the conference is  http://www.commalg.org/ROBfest/"

Algebraic geometry has significant applications in coding, industrial control, and computation. But the topics of this project are more closely related to applications in theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as a piece of the fine structure of our universe. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli theory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often manifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own right. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of ""organisms"" as itself being an ""organism"" is not just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. The other topic studied in this project is birational geometry, which is devoted to a certain abstract relationship, called birational equivalence, among algebraic varieties, which lies at the foundation of algebraic geometry."

Many of the proposed topics of research are inspired by homotopy theory, which also serves as a source of intuition, and of techniques, for dealing with them. Broadly speaking, the recurrent theme in the project is the interplay of three topics: commutative algebra; differential graded algebras and modules; and triangulated categories. While differential graded algebras and triangulated category methods have long been used successfully in commutative algebra, the PI and his collaborators, among others, have been adapting classical constructions and methods from commutative algebra (for example, local cohomology, and derived completions) to the context of differential graded algebras and triangulated categories, with striking returns in the representation theory of finitely dimensional algebra, notably, group algebras, and in commutative algebra itself. This proposal seeks to further develop these, and in new directions.<br/><br/>A number of rather diverse algebraic structures---this means, loosely speaking, not directly involving any notions from calculus like continuity or rate of change---have been developed in mathematics to model phenomenon in the (physical) world. Two examples particularly relevant to this proposal are groups and their representations, that are remarkably well-adapted to capture phenomenon involving symmetry, and rings, especially those that arise as rings of functions on various geometric objects like manifolds or solution sets of polynomial equations. However, it was only a few years ago that it was realized that if we enhance a ring by the most primitive structure from calculus, namely, a derivative, then it becomes possible to uniformly capture much of the information encoded in these various algebraic structures. Interestingly, these still rather mysterious hybrid structures, called differential graded algebras, emerged as important tools in algebraic topology already in the early 1950s. Differential graded algebras can be seen as bridges that relate various algebraic and geometric contexts in mathematics and mathematical physics. This has had the effect that methods developed in one field have profoundly influenced a host of others, and new connections among them have been discovered. Differential graded algebras are, in general, rather complicated, but there are interesting classes that appear to be amenable to methods developed in commutative ring theory, a classical topic with a large and well-developed body of tools and techniques. The broad aim of this proposal is to investigate differential graded algebras from this perspective. Besides deepening our knowledge of them, the proposed research is expected to have impact on commutative algebra, representation theory, and related fields."

The PI proposes to prove much more precise relations that identify more or less exactly the missing algebraic factors. Such relations would have applications to the theory of special values of L-functions. In addition, the methods used to study this problem are expected to yield new constructions of algebraic cycles. Another project involves studying the relations between cycles and p-adic L-functions, especially for unitary groups.

It is such a basic problem in mathematics that finding new insights into it is likely to have many applications, not just to other parts of mathematics but also practical in nature. Some of the key objects that will be studied, namely elliptic curves, have many practical applications to coding theory and cryptography. The projects in the proposal will lead to not just a better theoretical understanding of such objects, but also develop new computational tools to study them."

The PI wants to study various aspects of local cohomology and their applications to both F-singularities and homological conjectures and to investigate a characteristic-free notion of holonomicity.<br/> <br/>This project is mainly concerned with questions in commutative algebra and their applications to algebraic geometry. Algebraic sets are sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Commutative algebra studies functions over algebraic sets (in commutative algebra, these algebraic sets can be over any commutative rings); while algebraic geometry studies the geometric or topological aspects of algebraic sets (in algebraic geometry, these algebraic sets are very often over a field). These two areas are closely related and are mutually beneficial. Questions in this proposal can be considered as questions about the existence of solutions to systems of polynomial equations and the topological or geometric nature of the solution sets."

For example, Mel Hochster's direct summand conjecture, which posits the existence of some fundamental properties of regular rings, has been an important open problem in commutative algebra for over four decades; the solution to the equal characteristic case (due to Hochster from the 70s) is responsible for large swathes of modern commutative algebra, while the p-adic case remains tantalizingly open. The PI recently discovered that some ideas from p-adic Hodge theory (due to Faltings) can be used solve certain unknown cases of this conjecture. The PI intends to pursue this direction further by using powerful recent techniques --- chiefly Scholze's beautiful theory of perfectoid spaces --- from the fast evolving subject of p-adic Hodge theory to approach the direct summand conjecture and other purely algebraic problems. Conversely, previous work of the PI on the direct summand conjecture, coupled with some derived algebraic geometry, has recently proven instrumental in arriving at a significant simplification of certain geometric aspects of p-adic Hodge theory; the PI plans to develop the derived aspects more thoroughly to conceptualize the picture better.<br/><br/><br/>The study of solutions of polynomials with integer coefficients dates back to antiquity. An extremely useful technique here is to study ""approximate"" solutions first, i.e., solutions modulo primes, and then modulo powers of primes. The idea is that as the power of prime increases, the approximation becomes better. Grothendieck's revolutionization of mathematics in the last half century not only allows one to not only attach a precise meaning to the previous statement, but also provides a beautiful geometric context --- the world of p-adic geometry ---- to study such approximate solutions. This context has been at the heart of numerous recent advances in mathematics (such as Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem and other recent milestones in the Langlands program). The PI plans to contribute further to underlying geometric theory as well as develop applications to purely algebraic problems."

In the second part of his project the PI suggests to attack several (mathematically well-posed) problems related to 4-dimensional gauge theory. Both subjects can be reformulated in terms of various questions about G-bundles on algebraic surfaces. The PI believes that above questions may also be connected to the (not yet formulated) 2-dimensional geometric Langlands duality.<br/><br/>The proposed research lies on the border of such fields as number theory, algebraic geometry, representation theory and mathematical physics; succesful implementation of the project might shed some new light on the connection between these fields. For example, number theory is perhaps one of the oldest mathematical subjects and one of its most important parts is called the Langlands program. Recently it has been realized that geometric aspects of the Langlands program have many connections with modern mathematical physics (such as 4-dimensional quantum field theory). The proposed research project should confirm the existence of such links as well broaden and generalize them."

This builds on previous work of the PI and Matthew Emerton that has had applications to the Langlands program for global fields; in particular it plays a role in Emerton's proof of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture and is likely to be important for generalizations of this result.

One of the unifying ideas underpinning the proposal is the study of hidden gradings ubiquitous in many important situations in representation theory, as well as a related idea of categorification of quantum objects. Several of the projects are concerned with the representation theory of KLR algebras, which were introduced to categorify quantum groups. In particular the PIs will initiate a study of homological algebra of KLR algebras of finite type, and study a new phenomenon of imaginary Schur-Weyl duality arising from KLR algebras of affine type. Completion of these projects will lead to substantially better understanding of these algebras both in characteristic zero and in positive characteristic. Other projects are concerned with graded category O for the general linear Lie superalgebra, Deligne's category Rep(GL_delta), graded representations of spin symmetric groups, and the Aschbacher-Scott program of classifying maximal subgroups in finite classical groups. The proposal is expected to have applications to several other areas of mathematics including finite group theory (and its applications), Lie theory, combinatorics, representation theory, knot theory and category theory. <br/><br/>Representation theory is a core topic in pure mathematics, with many connections to other areas of mathematics, mathematical physics, computer science, chemistry and even biology. In the last few years the subject has been influenced heavily by ideas from higher category theory, leading to the introduction by Khovanov, Lauda and Rouquier of some remarkable new structures known as KLR algebras. These algebras encode higher symmetries underlying a large part of combinatorial representation theory, including classical objects like symmetric and general linear groups. The goal of the project is to build further the theory of these algebras and apply it to improve our understanding of these classical objects. The basic research in this project has potential future broader impacts in computer science and theoretical physics. More directly this award will have important educational impact through the training of graduate students and the on-going efforts of both PIs in mentoring other young researchers in this area. The award will indirectly support the promotion of knowledge of the methods and results of this beautiful subject area both nationally and internationally, through the active involvement of both PIs as organizers of major conferences and as editors of leading specialist journals."

In this part, PI will illustrate the striking new results that emanate from this framework for algebraic surfaces. The methods developed are not restricted to the case of surfaces alone, but apply to varieties of general type of arbitrary dimension. Many of the questions have been open for a long time even for the case of algebraic surfaces. They are compelling for many reasons that include applications to moduli problems. One such long standing open question, posed by Enriques in the 1940's, is to find methods of constructing the so-called canonical surfaces, that is surfaces of general type with birational canonical map. This question has attracted a lot of attention from geometers down the years. We accomplish this task. The new methodology, involving very current mathematical technology, has already yielded several new results on the deformation, construction and the moduli, of varieties of general type. For instance, the methods allow us to describe components of infinitely many moduli spaces of surfaces of general type. The question of description of the moduli components is so basic, these are found in graduate texts on algebraic surfaces. The PI proposes to pursue this project. Recent results indicate that the methods PI has developed with his coauthors are capable of handling deformation of canonical maps of varieties of general type of arbitrary dimensions. This in turn will have implications to their moduli, which are being explored. Applications include new results for linear series on Calabi-Yau threefolds and their deformations, settling a 14 year old conjecture and on the moduli space of CY-threefolds.<br/><br/><br/>The topic of holomorphic convexity of the universal cover of a projective variety has attracted considerable interest and is usually referred to as Shafarevich conjecture. One of the reasons is due to the fact that it is a higher dimensional analogue of the much celebrated uniformization theorem of Riemann and Kobe. The uniformization theorem says that any simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of the three: the open unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere. Examples show that a pursuit of exact analogues of this great theorem is out of question. The best one can hope for in algebraic geometry is the holomorphic convexity of the universal covering of a projective variety, which goes under the name of Shafarevich conjecture. There are two approaches to this problem, one is constructing a general theoretical framework that shows interconnections and the other involves solving hard open cases that also have a compelling presence in different aspects of algebraic geometry. Even for the case of surfaces only elliptic surfaces has had a satisfactory and complete answer. With his co authors PI deals with these problems for much larger class of surfaces fibered over a curve, open questions for which there was until now no solution, via the fundamental groups of algebraic surfaces. The methods of PI and his coauthors, which are new and conceptual in the context, yield a stronger form of Shafarevich conjecture on holomorphic convexity and also provide an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Nori on fundamental groups of surfaces fibered over a curve. Besides this, the results have application to second homotopy groups of these varieties. It must be mentioned here that the classes of surfaces the PI and coauthors deal with for which Shafarevich conjecture has been very much open have a huge moduli and appear ubiquitously in the geometry of surfaces of general type and higher dimensions.. The results of the PI and a more recent one in progress also contain surprising elements concerning the bounds on the multiplicity of the multiple fibers. This result contrasts sharply with the famous results of Kodaira on the multiple fiber of an elliptic fibration. PI's recent results show the power of the methods that is used to attack these circles of problems and the PI wants to pursue the new ideas to more general fibrations for surface and higher dimensional varieties."

A major effort is proposed to understand non-commutative crepant resolutions in broader classes of rings, and to answer several questions concerning the concept of height.<br/><br/>The proposed research concerns the theory of commutative rings, which are higher abstract systems where one can add and multiply. The rings arising in this proposal usually comes from a system of polynomial equations. The ring is a type of abstract model where solutions to the equations exist. By studying the properties of this model, one can then better understand the original system of equations. There are two main methods.One is to understand the theory of modules over such rings. Modules are a type of special representation of spaces where the equations hold. Studying these models has been an extremely effective way to study equations. The other main technical method is to study the same basic equations in rings which are reduced modulo a prime number. In such a system, arithmetic becomes easier. For instance modulo 2 means that every even number is thought of as 0, and all odd numbers as 1. This has a number of profound advantages which are used in this proposal."

Both topics are related via the notion of cohomological invariants of algebraic groups. The first topic that the PI proposes to investigate is the essential dimension of various algebraic objects. The essential dimension measures the complexity of a given class of algebraic objects. In particular, the PI proposes to compute the essential dimension of certain classes of algebraic groups and give applications in the theory of simple algebras and quadratic forms.

Each  theme will continue throughout the conference. A volume of proceedings, intended to make these results more accessible and applicable, will be produced. Additional information can be found at the conference website: <br/>http://www.math.yale.edu/automorphicforms2012<br/><br/>Automorphic forms are one of the most fascinating and mysterious of the many branches of number theory. Despite their complexity, they have had remarkable and widely varied applications. Results from the theory of automorphic forms were used in the recent proof by A. Wiles and R. Taylor, of ""Fermat's Last Theorem"" -- the statement that the sum of two perfect nth powers of whole numbers cannot be a perfect n-th power, if the power n is greater than 2 -- a problem that had been unsolved for over 300 years. Automorphic forms and L-functions are deeply related to prime numbers, which are whole numbers larger than one that have no factors except 1 and themselves. They are the building blocks for multiplication of whole numbers. Prime numbers have recently been used decisively in ""public key cryptography"", which is the basis of secure transactions on the internet. Prime numbers occur very irregularly among all whole numbers, and the subject of their distribution has attracted an immense amount of research. The Riemann zeta function, which offers a path to a refined understanding of the distribution of prime numbers among all positive integers, is the first example of an L-function. L-functions also provide a means of expressing subtle ""reciprocity laws"" that govern the solutions of polynomial equations. Automorphic forms are also the source of some of the most beautiful formulas in mathematics, for example, Jacobi's formula for the number of ways to express a whole number as a sum of four perfect squares. Finally, there are remarkable connections between the theory of automorphic forms and physics. The same mathematical structure that is foundational to quantum mechanics (the Heisenberg Canonical Commutation Relations), is also the setting for one of the most important methods for constructing automorphic forms. In addition, a variety of formulas from theoretical physics and related mathematics have been discovered in recent years to have strong connections to the theory or automorphic forms. I. I. Piatetski-Shapiro was a world leader in the theory of automorphic forms. The heart of his contributions involved establishing close connections between automorphic forms and L-functions, especially through his ""Converse Theorem"", which gave detailed conditions for a family of L-functions to be related to an automorphic form. This conference offers an opportunity to synthesize, disseminate, and build on Piatetski-Shapiro's work, to increase our understanding of these fascinating ideas."

The Workshop on Geometric Methods in Lie Theory will take place March 18-29, 2013, the Spring School and Workshop on Torsors, Motives, and Cohomological Invariants will be held May 6-17, 2013, and the Conference on Torsors, Nonassociative Algebras, and Cohomological Invariants will conclude the program on June 10-14, 2013. The theory of torsors and the associated linear algebraic groups has recently seen two fundamental advances. The first is the proof of Milnor's conjecture by V. Voevodsky (Fields Medal, 2002), based on the computation of the motivic cohomology of the norm quadric. Among other things, this inspired an intensive study of quadratic forms, e.g. torsors for orthogonal groups, their motives and cohomological invariants, surveyed by Karpenko's ICM 2010 lecture). The second discovery is due to Z. Reichstein and deals with the notions of essential and canonical dimensions of linear algebraic groups (Reichstein's ICM 2010 lecture). Roughly speaking, these numerical invariants characterize the complexity (splitting properties) of a torsor. There are several classical open conjectures in algebraic geometry which are closely related to torsors (Grothendieck-Serre, Serre II). This is the central theme of the Spring School and Workshop on Torsors, Motives and Cohomological Invariants. The theory of nonassociative (Lie, Jordan, etc) algebras have many applications in representation theory, combinatorics and theoretical physics. Many interesting infinite dimensional Lie algebras can be thought as being finite dimensional when viewed as algebras over their centroids, instead as algebras over the given base field. From this point of view, the algebras in question look like twisted forms of simpler objects. The quintessential example of this type of behavior is given by the celebrated affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras which have particular importance in theoretical physics, for example conformal field theory, and the theory of exactly solvable models. Much of the recent activity in the area has been devoted to extended affine Lie algebras, roughly speaking higher-dimensional analogues of the affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras. The impact of the algebra-geometric ""forms"" point of view on the theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras will be one of the central theme of the Workshop on Geometric Methods in Lie Theory. The bridge between torsors and nonassociative algebras, which is the central theme of the final conference on Torsors, Nonassociative Algebras and Cohomological Invariants, is provided by various cohomological invariants, e.g. de Rham and Galois cohomology, motives, Chow groups, K-theory, algebraic cobordism. This provides a strong connection between the theory of nonassociative algebras and torsors. For instance,the celebrated Rost-Serre invariant of exceptional Jordan algebras gives a cohomological invariant in Milnor K-theory and is related to the (3,3)-case of the Bloch-Kato conjecture.<br/><br/>The theory of nonassociative algebras and the theory of torsors are well-established areas of modern mathematics. The first deals with the study of nonassociative algebraic structures (Lie, Jordan, alternative algebras). The second studies and classifies so-called twisted forms of algebraic objects, e.g. groups, algebras, algebraic varieties. Both have many applications in engineering, computer science and mathematical physics. For instance, the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras is used in particle physics to describe the different quantum states of elementary particles; the theory of transformation groups plays an important role in describing the 2D and 3D-motions; the compact form of the Lie group of type E_8 appears in the Ising model for magnetic interactions. To describe and classify nonassociative algebras and torsors one uses the language of cohomology theories and cohomological invariants. The latter has been a central theme of algebraic geometry for decades, e.g. the Hodge Conjecture, whose proof is one of the Millennium Prize problems established by the Clay Mathematical Institute, concerns the structure of the cohomology ring of an algebraic variety. The purpose of the program is to bring together specialists and young researchers working in these areas to discuss recent developments and results, to provide an overview of the current research and applications, and to stimulate new advances.

Following seminal work of Daniel Quillen, cohomological support varieties have been studied and seen numerous applications to the development of the representation theory of a wide array of structures: finite groups, Lie algebras (and superalgebras), finite group schemes, Hopf algebras, small quantum groups, and general self-injective algebras. In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in unifying the theories for different structures.  Further, the notion of ""support"" itself has evolved considerably from its initial definition in terms of the cohomology of a finite group to a much more  category theoretic concept.  The workshop ""Cohomology and Support in Representation Theory and Related Topics,"" following on the footsteps of the summer school on the same topic, will be an opportunity to summarize the history of this theoretical tool, to report on recent progress on multiple fronts, and to prepare a new cadre of mathematicians to continue the extensive development and applications of supports in many different areas of mathematics.  Additional information on the workshop can be found at http://www.math.washington.edu/~pischool/<br/><br/><br/>The workshop ""Cohomology and Support in Representation Theory and Related Topics"" will bring mathematicians from different areas together to foster interaction and find new connections between multiple fields united by their use of the concept of ""support"" and will introduce a new generation of young researchers to the field.   The organizers of the workshop are Christopher Bendel (University of Wisconsin-Stout), Henning Krause (Universitat Bielefeld), and Julia Pevtsova (University of Washington).  There are twenty four confirmed/tentatively agreed speakers which include leading researchers  in several different areas of representation theory, commutative algebra, and triangulated categories from around the world. The workshop will follow directly on the footsteps of a summer school for graduate students and recent PhDs to be held  one week prior at the same location.  The summer school will present three series of lectures introducing young mathematicians to several active directions of research within the broad field to be covered more deeply during the workshop.  Such a juxtaposition will provide the junior participants with a valuable opportunity to take the foundational knowledge they acquire during the summer school and  use it to delve into current problems during the workshop.  Taken together, the summer school and the workshop are aimed to be both a thorough survey on the exciting recent developments in the field and the venue for an active discussion of future prospects and open problems."

In this direction, Lazarsfeld will continue his work with Ein on the asymptotic structure of the syzygies of higher-dimensional varieties as the positivity of the embedding line bundle grows. Lazarsfeld will also work on a number of questions concerning the positivity properties of higher-codimension algebraic cycles. Growing out of his work with Debarre, Ein and Voisin, the idea here is to explore the higher-codimension analogues of classical notions of positivity for cycles of codimension one. <br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, one of the oldest and most central fields of mathematics, studies geometric properties of solutions to systems of polynomial equations in several variables. It makes connections with many other fields of mathematics, ranging from number theory to topology, algebra, and complex analysis. Algebraic geometry has also found important applications to problems in such diverse areas as coding theory, theoretical physics and the mathematics of computation. In a first series of problems, Lazarsfeld will study the properties of the equations cutting out a fixed geometric locus. It is hoped that this research will open up new points of contact between the fields of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. Lazarsfeld will also work on some conjectures concerning the manner in which smaller geometric loci can sit inside larger ones."

Algebraic statistics exploits algebraic geometry and related fields to solve problems in statistics and its applications. Methods from algebraic statistics have been successfully applied to address many problems including construction of Markov bases, theoretical study of phylogenetic mixture models, ecological inference, identifiability problems for graphical models, Bayesian integrals and singular learning theory, social networks, and coalescent theory. In addition to algebraic statistics' successes in solving statistical problems, its research objectives have driven theoretical developments in algebra.<br/><br/>Traditionally, applied mathematics has focused on branches of mathematics including differential equations and analysis.  Instead, algebraic statistics advocates algebraic geometry, a well-developed and ancient field of mathematics, as a tool for solving problems in statistics and its applications.  Many statistical models have the structure of algebraic varieties.  This observation catalyzed rapid growth in this area over the past fifteen years.  Over this time it has become clear that algebraic structures are ubiquitous in statistics.  Hence advanced tools from algebra profitably address statistical questions. The purpose of this grant is to support a seven day conference and summer school Algebraic Statistics in the Alleghenies at the Pennsylvania State University, June 9-15, 2012. More than 100 participants are anticipated, which would make this the largest meeting yet on Algebraic Statistics that had been held in the US or abroad."

Famous examples are calculus via Newtonian mechanics and differential geometry via Einstein's theory of general relativity. During the last twenty years, there has been a great deal of activity devoted to building a so-called string-theoretic model of the universe, which incorporates some of the most sophisticated mathematics. The subject of Gromov-Witten theory was born twenty years ago  during a period of intensive interaction between mathematics and physics.  Since then Gromov-Witten theory has established itself as a central area in both geometry and physics.  At the same time, it has expanded greatly in its scope to many diverse areas of mathematics, ranging from the classical topic of Hurwitz theory to the modern area of Donaldson-Thomas invariants (the sheaf-theoretic counterpart of Gromov-Witten theory). Despite its success, many central problems remain unsolved. Two notable examples are the computation of higer genus Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and the precise relation between Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The resolution of these problems is of great importance for geometry and physics. In this proposal, a team of the best experts in the world is assembled to attack these central problems. In addition, the PIs propose to develop technology to study a variety of questions relating Gromov-Witten theory to enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and mathematical physics.  The PIs hope to make important and substantial contributions to these areas of mathematics, and their interrelations.<br/><br/>This project is interdisciplinary in nature, in that both physical and mathematical ideas play central roles.  In this sense it adds to the current trend of interaction between mathematics and physics. This project emphasizes teamwork and collaboration. Through research seminars, organizing and participating in national and international conferences, this proposal will also enhance the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows. There will be a number of research publications that will help in introducing students to this exciting area of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number theory and the Topology programs of DMS."

For example local cohomology provides a way of proving otherwise inaccessible results on the topology of algebraic varieties while D-modules provide a way of proving otherwise inaccessible finiteness properties of local cohomology modules. While considerable progress on this circle of ideas has been made, a lot remains to be done. It is proposed to continue to study these (and some other) questions by using methods that have been successful in the past as well as developing some new methods. <br/><br/>The discovery of a connection between two different areas of mathematics holds a potential for enriching both of them by making available new sets of techniques for attacking old problems.

More precisely, he will investigate the Fourier-Whittaker coefficients of metaplectic Eisenstein series induced from parabolic subgroups. When the degree of the cover is trivial, this reduces to the case of Eisenstein series on linear algebraic groups as studied by Langlands, Shahidi, and others, which have been instrumental in formulating and proving portions of the Langlands program. By studying metaplectic forms in families ranging over all finite covers (including the trivial one), surprising new structure emerges. Brubaker and his collaborators have demonstrated that the resulting Fourier-Whittaker coefficients contain Dirichlet series in several complex variables (so-called ``multiple Dirichlet series'') whose coefficients are described in terms of crystal graphs. These crystal graphs encode information about representations of quantum groups, which are deformations of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. In this situation, the relevant Lie algebra is associated to the Langlands dual group of the group on which one builds the Eisenstein series. The proposal seeks to develop this theory more completely and explore the novel connections it suggests between number theory, quantum groups and combinatorial representation theory. <br/><br/>Langlands' program was initially conceived as a stunning collection of conjectures relating functions with interesting arithmetic properties (e.g., counting the number of integer solutions to an equation) to functions with good analytic properties (e.g., having symmetries and being the solution of a natural differential equation). But similar kinds of duality have been observed in geometry and mathematical physics, leading to geometric and quantum versions of the Langlands programs, respectively.  In short, these dualities have become a lens through which a large portion of modern mathematics and mathematical physics can be organized and understood. However, the explicit underlying mechanisms which relate, for example, arithmetic functions to analytic functions remain largely a mystery. In these projects, Principal Investigator Brubaker with his collaborators and students will use the data provided by the above special examples to attempt to find such a mechanism and attempt to better understand the relationships between various incarnations of the Langlands program in arithmetic, geometry, and physics. An equally important component of the projects is the training of students at all levels by creating a tiered system of mentoring. To bolster these efforts, a set of course materials will be developed to reflect the changing emphasis in modern number theory on analytic techniques, focusing on computational approaches and example-based learning to reinforce concepts"

The structure constants of this ring are ruled by deep and beautiful combinatorics, and their study falls in the intersection of several mathematical disciplines.  For example, when X is a Grassmann variety, these structure constants are the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients that also describe tensor products of representations of GL(n), products of symmetric polynomials, and play a role in numerous other areas ranging from linear algebra to statistics and complexity theory in computer science.  The celebrated Littlewood-Richardson rule expresses any Littlewood-Richardson coefficient as the number of certain combinatorial objects called tableaux.  A more general combinatorial formula, conjectured by Allen Knutson, states that the structure constants of a two-step flag variety are equal to the number triangular puzzles with specified integer labels on the sides.  The investigator hopes to prove this conjecture.  Earlier work of the investigator has established that the structure constants of two-step flag varieties specialize to the Gromov-Witten invariants of Grassmannians, and therefore count the number of rational curves of a fixed degree that meet three Schubert varieties in general position. The Gromov-Witten invariants also determine the structure of the(small) quantum cohomology ring, whose definition is inspired by physics and has relations to mirror symmetry.  A proof of Knutson's conjecture will therefore establish the most precise description of this ring as a fact.  The investigator will also study other questions concerning the K-theory and quantum K-theory of flag manifolds.<br/><br/>A typical question in classical algebraic geometry is to identify the complete list of geometric figures of some type that satisfy a list of conditions.  While it can be difficult or impossible to identify the individual figures, it is in many cases possible to say how many there are.  Enumerative geometry is the study of such counting problems as well as methods to solve them.  Powerful techniques have been developed that can translate an enumerative geometric problem into an algebraic problem, so that the number of solution figures is the result of a computation.  However, the combinatorial aspects of an enumerative problem are in most cases best understood in the presence of a formula that makes it clear that the number of solutions is non-negative.  For example, such positive formulas are much more useful for proving general statements about which enumerative problems have any solutions at all.  Surprisingly, positive formulas are significantly more difficult to discover and prove than non-positive formulas.  In return the positive formulas tend to surround themselves with deep combinatorial structures and methods that provide even more insight into the geometric problem than the formulas themselves.  The investigator will attempt to prove a number of positive formulas of this type.  He also plans to write a computer program capable of computing the solutions of a large family of enumerative problems. Examples of this type are important for making progress in the field, and are at the same time very useful for students or others who would like to learn the subject.  Finally, the investigator will continue to engage graduate and undergraduate students in his research."

The speakers have made and continue to make major contributions to the field, and are responsible for a vast web of connections of representation theory with other areas of mathematics and physics.  The aim of the conference is to present current progress on the following (interrelated) topics: vertex operator algebras and chiral algebras, conformal field theory, the (geometric) Langlands program, affine Lie algebras, Kac-Moody algebras, quantum groups, crystal bases and canonical bases, quantum cohomology and K-theory, geometric representation theory, categorification, higher-dimensional Kac-Moody theory, integrable systems, quiver varieties, representations of real and p-adic groups, and quantum gauge theories. Thus the conference will be an occasion to discuss representation theory in the context of its connections with numerous other subjects, and to discuss some of the most recent advances in representation theory, including those which occurred thanks to application of techniques in other areas of mathematics and physics, including ideas from quantum field theory and string theory.  Further details can be found on the conference website at <br/><br/>http://www.math.yale.edu/frenkel60<br/><br/><br/>Algebra is one of the oldest areas in mathematics. It encompasses a wide range of subjects from simple algebraic equations and polynomials to linear and abstract algebra. The study of symmetries is related to a branch of algebra called 'representation theory'.  Representation theory has a vast array of applications in other areas of mathematics and physics.  It is often through the study of representations that we learn about the innermost workings of our physical universe.  While the origins of representation theory are algebraic, modern representation theory incorporates ideas from other branches of mathematics such as geometry, combinatorics, and category theory (a theory whose aim is to organize mathematical structure).  These connections to new fields have both increased our knowledge in the area of representation theory as well as developed new applications of its ideas.  The conference ""Perspectives in representation theory"" will be a gathering of some of the world's leading experts in this exciting field."

By using methods of Geometric Invariant Theory, deformation theory, and enumerative geometry, the investigator will pursue several projects in order to elucidate the geometry of well-studied moduli spaces and to adopt new approaches to less studied ones. In the first project, the investigator will continue the study of finite Hilbert stability of embedded curves with the goal of advancing the log minimal model program for the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of stable curves. In the second project, the investigator will approach fundamental open questions about effective and ample divisors on this moduli space and its variants. The study of singularities is an important ingredient of these two projects. In the third project, the investigator will extend recent results in the theory of curves to certain classes of higher-dimensional varieties (e.g., K3 surfaces) and their moduli spaces.<br/><br/>An algebraic variety is a collection of solutions to a system of polynomial equations. Algebraic varieties are fundamental objects of study in mathematics and, in particular, in the field of algebraic geometry, to which this proposal belongs. Variation of the polynomials' coefficients gives rise to a moduli space for a given class of varieties. The study of moduli spaces is essential to understanding algebraic varieties themselves and, ultimately, to solving systems of polynomial equations. The investigator proposes to study moduli spaces of algebraic varieties depending on one or two free parameters using both classical and modern techniques. The broader impacts of the proposal include advancing an active research program and co-organizing workshops on moduli spaces and related problems."

In the first and most important main line, Nicolas Bergeron and Colette Moeglin (both of the University of Paris) and the PI will try to generalize to the unitary groups SU(p,q)  their result that the Poincare duals of classes carried by totally geodesic cycles in  the locally symmetric spaces of simple arithmetic type associated to the orthogonal groups SO(p,q) span the cohomology groups of low degree and special refined Hodge type, see ""Hodge type theorems for arithmetic manifolds associated to orthogonal groups.""  Also, the PI proposes generalizing to the unitary case his earlier joint work (comprising five papers) with Jens Funke (from Durham University) on the boundary values of special cohomology classes associated to orthogonal groups.  The second main line deals with the ring R of projective invariants of n  ordered points on  complex projective m space and the equivariant symplectic geometry of the corresponding moduli spaces and their toric degenerations. All of the completed work referred to above was supported by the NSF grant DMS-0907446.  The third main line is an attempt to generalize to Kac Moody Lie algebras the PI's previous work  with Michael Kapovich (and in parts with Thomas Haines, Shrawan Kumar, and Bernhard Leeb) dealing with the generalized triangle inequalities and related (saturation) problems from reductive Lie algebras. This project was the subject of the PI's earlier FRG grant DMS-0554254 with Prakash Belkale, Thomas Haines,  Michael Kapovich and Shrawan Kumar.  The problem  looks difficult but there  is a test example that will indicate whether  the earlier  theory will generalize. That example is affine SL(2). <br/><br/>The PI proposes three main lines of research all within the general framework of reductive algebraic groups and geometry. The first part of the proposal deals with a remarkable and unexpected  interaction between geometry, analysis and two different areas of  representation theory (the oscillator/Weil representation and the work of James Arthur on the Selberg trace formula based in part on ideas of Robert Langlands). This work should have applications to number theory along the lines described by Steven Kudla in his 2002 International Congress of Mathematicians talk. The second and third parts of the proposal are motivated in part because they are related to much studied problems going back to the beginning of invariant theory in the late nineteenth century. The earlier work of the PI on the third part deals with basic problems in representation theory, e.g. decomposing tensor products and branching formulas which are much used in a number of disciplines. The current proposal outlines an extension of this work to other settings.  All the above projects are in collaboration with other mathematicians from within the USA or abroad. In the last four years, the PI has had collaborations with ten mathematicians continuing a history of extensive collaboration (over fifty joint papers)."

A crystal here is a combinatorial object (a set along with some operations) associated to each highest weight representation of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. Kashiwara's construction makes heavy use of the associated quantized universal enveloping algebra, but the crystals themselves can often be realized by other means. Some such realizations are purely combinatorial, and others use non-trivial geometry. In finite type, one realization which has generated a lot of interest uses the Mirkovic-Vilonen (MV) polytopes developed by Anderson and by Kamnitzer. Along with his collaborators, the P.I. is currently developing a version of this combinatorics for symmetric affine types, using quiver varieties. Affine MV polytopes have been sought since the finite type polytopes first appeared, so their construction is itself an important development. The P.I. will investigate the connection between these new polytopes and various algebraic and geometric structures related to affine algebras. This work may also lead to a notion of MV polytope in all (not necessarily symmetric) affine types. The proposed research also considers ways of extracting other combinatorial realizations from the geometry of quiver varieties, and develops applications of crystal theory to Macdonald polynomials and Demazure characters.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses important questions in the theory of affine algebras, and will be of interest to a number of people in that field. Affine algebras are important in mathematical physics, so there is potential for cross-disciplinary impact.

There are several questions related to this research that can be studied in terms of explicit realizations of crystals. These are ideal for undergraduate research projects, as only a limited amount of background is required in order to approach the questions, yet they can provide an entry point into a rich representation-theoretic story.

The PI aims to establish a number of cases of a conjecture of Sarnak and Xue on these multiplicities, and give sharp asymptotics for the growth rate of Betti number of arithmetic manifolds in congruence towers.<br/><br/>The PI's second proposed investigation is into the concentration of higher rank eigenfunctions on compact locally symmetric spaces, and in particular the question of how large the L^p norms of such an eigenfunction or its restriction to various subspaces can be.  The first step of this is to derive the correct 'convex bounds' for these L^p norms, which will be sharp in the case of non-negative curvature and for spectral clusters in the general case, by combining techniques from semiclassical analysis and representation theory.  The second component is to improve these convex bounds (in particular, to produce a saving in the exponents) in as many cases as possible by introducing arithmetic amplification as in the work of Iwaniec and Sarnak.<br/><br/>Arithmetic manifolds are central objects in number theory, as they encode information about objects which were first studied by the Greeks such as prime numbers and the solutions of polynomial equations in integers or rational numbers.  They also allow one to study special cases of questions in geometry, analysis and mathematical physics using powerful tools from number theory.  An example of this is the recent progress on the Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture of Rudnick and Sarnak, which helps us to understand the way in which quantum mechanics starts to resemble classical mechanics at high energies.  The PI's proposed investigation of the concentration of eigenfunctions would improve our understanding of this phenomenon.  In addition, the `non-tempered' automorphic forms that the PI will study play an important role in many problems of counting and dynamics, and the project may have interesting consequences in these areas."

In particular, groups are used to describe symmetries of  mathematical objects, they play a fundamental role in studying solutions of equations.  Nowadays, when mathematics gets ever more complex, equations alone cannot describe subtleties of scientific phenomena; new problems require much more powerful means and more powerful languages.  Most of the essential properties of objects that occur in everyday mathematical practice can be described in a very particular but universal language, so called first-order logic.

In a separate project the PI will use modified trace and dimension functions arising in low-dimensional topology to prove the generalized Kac-Wakimoto conjecture for classical Lie superalgebras, and to investigate the tilting modules of algebraic and quantum groups. Although these tools have individually proven to be fundamental to new developments in the field, relatively little work has been done using them in conjunction. This project is in the area of mathematics known as representation theory.<br/><br/><br/>Algebraic structures such as groups and Lie algebras arise in nature as the symmetries of some object.  The ``super'' versions of these are the ones which involve both symmetries and anti-symmetries.   These so-called supersymmetries play a fundamental role in physics and mathematics.  Representation theory is devoted to understanding how these structures interact with other objects.  Because of the intricate nature of these objects, it is productive to use geometric and topological tools to extract new information about these systems.   This is the approach taken in this proposal.    It is expected that the research conducted in this proposal will shed new light on these areas. Because of the insight representation theory provides regarding the underlying structure and symmetries of an object, it has proven valuable in other areas of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, cryptography, quantum computing, computer graphics, and art.  Gains in understanding in representation theory can be expected to pay dividends in these other fields. In terms of broader impacts, the PI has been active in the promotion of integrating research and education. The PI will continue to lead a vertically integrated group of undergraduate and early-career graduate students on research related to this proposal.  He will also continue to take a leadership role in engaging younger students in mathematics.  This includes co-organizing the University of Oklahoma Math Day, leading the departmental Math Club, and authorship of the OU Math Club Blog.  It is noteworthy that the Blog has over 100 visitors per day from around the world.  He will also continue his efforts to mentor junior mathematicians through formal and informal collaborations.  The PI will promote the  development of algebraic, geometric, and topological tools in representation theory as an invited speaker in the U.S. and abroad and as an organizer of conferences in the area."

The proposer will study the distribution of zeros of the derivative of the zeta-function near vertical lines to the right of the critical line by new methods.  Empirical studies suggest that the distribution function of these zeros has the peculiar feature of possessing two local maxima. It may be that the theoretical and numerical studies proposed here will explain this phenomenon.  A second project is to prove the recent conjectures of H. L. Montgomery and the proposer concerning large values of the zeta-function at its critical points. These conjectures arose in their study of the geometry of the level curves of the zeta-function through these points. The proposer will also investigate the distribution of a-points of L-functions on the critical line and the proportion of simple a-points to the right of it. A goal here is to support Selberg's conjecture that there are only finitely many a-points on the critical line by showing that, in any case, at most an infinitesimal proportion are. Other problems are to determine the pair correlation function of the zeros of the real and imaginary parts of the zeta-function and to determine how it changes as one approaches the critical line; to calculate discrete moments of the derivative of the zeta-function using the proposer?s hybrid formula for the zeta-function and random matrix theory modeling; to determine the connection between the Alternative Hypothesis for the zeros of the zeta-function and an ?alternative? twin prime conjecture; and, finally, to improve significantly the proposer's recent work on moments of finite Euler products by extending these results to very long products.<br/><br/>The projects described in the proposal are all concerned with fundamental issues in analytic number theory, namely, the analytic and geometric properties of the Riemann zeta-function and other L-functions in the Selberg class. Progress will advance the development of the theory of the zeta-function and these other L-functions in both traditional and new directions. Some of the proposed methods are new and may well have applications to other areas since most of the problems have connections with harmonic analysis, probability theory, and complex function theory. There are also direct connections with questions in random matrix theory such as the distribution of zeros of the derivative of characteristic polynomials of random matrices.  <br/> <br/>"

Orbits of points under iterates of maps are among the most important objects in dynamics.  In the study of algebraic dynamics, the map is typically a polynomial or rational map in one or more variables.  One natural question is what kinds of algebraic relations the forward orbits of points can satisfy.  When the orbits are infinite (corresponding to so-called ""wandering points""), one natural question corresponds to the well-known Mordell-Lang conjecture for abelian varieties.  When the orbits are finite (corresponding to ""preperiodic points'), a natural question is an analog of the Manin-Mumford-Bogomolov conjecture for abelian varieties.  The primary purpose of this project is to advance knowledge about these two questions, via a combination of techniques from p-adic analysis, geometry, and diophantine approximation.<br/><br/><br/>This project focuses on the interaction between algebraic maps and algebraic equations. An algebraic map is a function such as f(x) = 2x+3.  Applying the map repeatedly to a single number gives what is called the orbit of that number under f.  For example, if f(x) = 2x+3 and we start with the number 1, then the orbit is 1, 5, 13, 29, 61, and so on.  One can also form orbits out of pairs, triplets, and n-tuples of numbers by allowing f to be an algebraic map in more than one variable.  An algebraic equation is simply a more general version of the familiar quadratic polynomials one encounters in beginning algebra, except that it may have more variables and have higher degree terms.  These orbits exhibit many interesting properties.  On the one hand they have so little structure that they may be good engines for the generation of random numbers; on the other, one might hope that their algebraic and arithmetic properties may give rise to new analogs the theories of fractals and chaos, which in many cases arose from the consideration of geometric and analytical properties of orbits."

The PI will study several problems along the lines of the local-global principle, including the Alperin weight conjecture, Brauer's height zero conjecture, and some further conjectures concerning rationality and divisibility properties of complex and Brauer characters of finite groups. The PI will also continue his long-term project to classify modular representations of finite quasisimple groups of low dimension. He will then apply his results to achieve significant progress on a number of applications, including Waring-type problems for quasisimple groups, Aschbacher's conjecture on subgroup lattices, the Kollar-Larsen problem on exterior powers (with application in algebraic geometry), and the Guralnick-Holt conjecture on second cohomology groups for finite groups and their presentations, and representations of finite quasisimple groups with special properties (with application in the subgroup structure of finite simple groups).<br/><br/>The main area of research in this proposal is group representation theory.

The representation theory allows one to study groups via their actions on vector spaces which model the ways they arise in the real world. It has fascinated mathematicians for more than a century and has many important applications in physics and chemistry, particularly in quantum mechanics and in the theory of elementary particles. Finite groups and their representations have already proved valuable in coding theory and cryptography, and are expected to continue to play an important role in the modern world of computers and digital communications.

It was initially  motivated by the existence of several different  notions of cohomology for algebraic varieties and the quest for an underlying universal structure.  It has since developed into a very complex and fascinating subject of pure mathematics, which is currently still at the center of much ongoing investigation and which, over the years, gave rise to many deep results in arithmetic and algebraic geometry. Given its original motivation and its historic development, the theory of motives appears very far remote from the world of theoretical physics. However, in recent years, explicit computations carried out by physicists working in perturbative quantum field theory, followed by an increasing number of precise mathematical results, have uncovered a deep connection between periods of motives (numerical invariant that, in an appropriate sense, measure the complexity of a motive) and amplitudes of Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory.  This project is focused on the role of motives in various branches of theoretical physics, starting from the Feynman amplitudes, by investigating the relations between different models (the parametric Feynman integrals on one side, and the twistor based computations of Feynman amplitudes on the other), but also by using the algebraic varieties that  occur in quantum field theory as a testing ground for new theories in algebraic geometry such as the so-called ""geometry over the field with one element"". Moreover, part of this project investigates the occurrence of motives and periods in statistical physics, through the algebro-geometric properties of the partition function of Ising models and their generalizations, the Potts models. Another part of this project deals with the development of a new theory of ""noncommutative motives"" and its role in string theory and quantum field theory.<br/><br/>This is an interdisciplinary project that bridges between a very abstract field of pure mathematics, the theory of motives, and concrete mathematical models in high-energy physics, statistical physics, and string theory. The research project described  above will  have the effect of importing  new mathematical tools  into some fast developing areas of physics, and will also, at the same time, lead to new mathematical results, and the further  development  of some new branched of pure mathematics, within the research areas of algebraic and arithmetic geometry, through a new input of ideas, motivation,  and intuition  from physical theories.

Some critical cases have been settled recently in joint work with Lyubeznik and Walther; these in turn, lead to new vanishing theorems for local cohomology modules. Hochster's monomial conjecture remains unresolved for rings that do not contain a field, such as those arising in number theory; the PI will pursue an approach to this via local cohomology.

In particular, noncommutative projective geometry uses a localization of the category of graded modules over a  noncommutative graded ring as a substitute for a category of coherent sheaves.  A major goal of this project is to advance the classification of noncommutative projective surfaces.  We continue to study surfaces in the birational classes of noncommutative projective planes, especially those of Sklyanin type. Calabi-Yau algebras are an important class of noncommutative algebras with good homological properties, which are related to commutative Calabi-Yau varieties.  For example, in certain cases they can be seen as providing noncommutative resolutions of singular varieties.  In this project, we also propose to study certain classes of graded Calabi-Yau algebras which are closely connected to noncommutative projective geometry.<br/><br/>The set of all functions from a geometric space to the real numbers has a natural addition and multiplication.  A set with an addition and multiplication is called a ring, and the example above is called the coordinate ring of the space. Its algebraic properties often reflect and give information about the underlying geometry of the space. The goal of noncommutative geometry, which is the subject of this project, is to generalize to rings which do not directly arise as coordinate rings of spaces, because the product of two elements in these rings depends on the order you multiply them. Though there is no underlying space, the algebra of these rings can have deep structure that allows one to still study them in a geometric way.  As an example, certain noncommutative rings can be thought of as giving a noncommutative resolution of a singular commutative space (the space is not smooth but has sharp points, and the resolution smooths it out).  Our main project concerns the classification of noncommutative surfaces (2-dimensional spaces) and the structure of Calabi-Yau algebras, which are noncommutative rings motivated originally by string theory in theoretical physics."

The simpler appellation 'Theory X' emphasizes how little is known.  The projects undertaken here have two overall goals.  First, we will make inroads on the structure of Theory X by applying the detailed and profound mathematical understanding of topological and conformal quantum field theories obtained over the past 25 years.  Second, we will use expected properties of Theory X and its compactifications to lower dimensions to deduce new conjectures and new organizing principles in geometric representation theory.  The rapidly developing web of interactions between the six-dimensional quantum Theory X and a host of central topics in twenty-first century geometry, topology, and geometric representation theory indicates that we are seeing the beginnings of a new revolution, one in which Theory X plays the dominant physical role. Progress towards unraveling its structure and its consequences will have broad ramifications.<br/><br/>Physics has long fueled developments in mathematics, and the past 30 years have been a particularly fruitful period.  The depth of mathematics which enters fundamental physical theories has steadily intensified, and at the same time the structure and predictions of these theories have had increasingly profound impacts on mathematics.  This project is one of many efforts to mine this intellectually fertile mix of ideas.  Our pursuit of Theory X will inevitably illuminate a much broader circle of ideas and contribute to the mathematical understanding of contemporary physics.  The work of past generations at the mathematics-physics interface fuels the modern world: our computers, GPS systems, transportation, sophisticated medical tools, and much more owe their existence to basic research in this area which stretches back well over a century.  While we cannot predict how current basic research will impact the future, we can say with certainty that the effect will be far-reaching."

Famous examples are calculus via Newtonian mechanics and differential geometry via Einstein's theory of general relativity. During the last twenty years, there has been a great deal of activity devoted to building a so-called string-theoretic model of the universe, which incorporates some of the most sophisticated mathematics. The subject of Gromov-Witten theory was born twenty years ago  during a period of intensive interaction between mathematics and physics.  Since then Gromov-Witten theory has established itself as a central area in both geometry and physics.  At the same time, it has expanded greatly in its scope to many diverse areas of mathematics, ranging from the classical topic of Hurwitz theory to the modern area of Donaldson-Thomas invariants (the sheaf-theoretic counterpart of Gromov-Witten theory). Despite its success, many central problems remain unsolved. Two notable examples are the computation of higer genus Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and the precise relation between Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The resolution of these problems is of great importance for geometry and physics. In this proposal, a team of the best experts in the world is assembled to attack these central problems. In addition, the PIs propose to develop technology to study a variety of questions relating Gromov-Witten theory to enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and mathematical physics.  The PIs hope to make important and substantial contributions to these areas of mathematics, and their interrelations.<br/><br/>This project is interdisciplinary in nature, in that both physical and mathematical ideas play central roles.  In this sense it adds to the current trend of interaction between mathematics and physics. This project emphasizes teamwork and collaboration. Through research seminars, organizing and participating in national and international conferences, this proposal will also enhance the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows. There will be a number of research publications that will help in introducing students to this exciting area of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number theory and the Topology programs of DMS."

The proposal also proposes to use geometric methods of Laumon, Ngo, etc. to prove orbital integral identities (Fundamental Lemmas) in relative trace formulae and to construct explicit automorphic forms (sheaves) for function fields and their Hecke eigenvalues (local systems), especially those with wild ramifications. e.g., Kloosterman sheaves for general reductive groups. Finally the proposed project also plans to study  Koszul duality patterns for sheaves on generalized flag varieties.<br/><br/>This project naturally sits at the intersection of algebraic geometry, representation theory, number theory, and mathematical physics. In these subjects as well as in understanding our physical world, symmetry is a central theme. Group theory is a uniform way to study such symmetries, and representation theory is trying to classify the actions of groups on vector spaces. As often happens, the most interesting representations come from geometric objects with symmetries, which in turn appear in physics. This is why geometric methods are so powerful in solving representation-theoretic problems.<br/>Through this project, the PI hopes to shed light on hard problems in representation theory and number theory, and to discover more symmetries that appear in geometry."

In particular, groups are used to describe symmetries of  mathematical objects, they play a fundamental role in studying solutions of equations.  Nowadays, when mathematics gets ever more complex, equations alone cannot describe subtleties of scientific phenomena; new problems require much more powerful means and more powerful languages.  Most of the essential properties of objects that occur in everyday mathematical practice can be described in a very particular but universal language, so called first-order logic.  In this project we study  properties of groups, in all their entirety, that can be described in the first-order logic.

First, it is to develop further the connection between the Langlands Program and the electro-magnetic duality, generalize it to a broader context, and use it to obtain new mathematical results. Second, to study further the geometric trace formulas developed by the PI in collaboration with R. Langlands and B.C. Ngo, and to apply them to the Langlands functoriality conjecture.

The KUMUNU conference has a strong tradition of playing an important  mentoring role for graduate students, recent PhD's and early career faculty in four year colleges in the extended midwest/great plains region.  KUMUNU provides an annual venue for these groups to come together with senior researchers at KU, MU and NU along with two or three senior researchers from some institutions which are not so near.  KUMUNU stimulates interactions by having a series of 6 talks on current research by established researchers and three talks by students expecting their doctorates this year, with ample time and opportunity for interaction outside of talks in an informal and friendly setting. In addition to faculty and students from KU, MU and NU, and other institutions from Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, KUMUNU draws participants from neighboring states such as Colorado,  Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma and  North Dakota. Travel and lodging support, especially for graduate students and recent PhD's, is a key element for the success of KUMUNU in achieving one of its main goals of showcasing research of young faculty, helping enrich the research programs of recent PhD's and graduate students in commutative algebra and related fields by both formal and informal mentoring from experienced researchers.   In addition, KUMUNU serves to enhance the existing strengths at these three institutions.    The conference website is  http://kumunu.missouri.edu  For further information, one can also contact kumunu@missouri.edu <br/><br/>The KUMUNU conference will provide an opportunity for mathematicians to interact and establish research connections with each other; in particular, the participants will benefit from the interaction and from seeing recent developments in the field and its relationships with other areas.  The primary impacts of the conference will be its dissemination of recent ideas on an important topic: commutative algebra and algebraic geometry and the stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of the students and early career participants. Participants will take ideas from the conference back to their colleagues and students, stimulating further research and mathematical enrichment at their home institutions. The relatively small size of the meeting and its geographic and disciplinary focus will be particularly effective at enabling participants to establish productive collaborative relationships.  Encouragement and mentoring that begins at the conference will significantly contribute to the success and professional development of early career mathematicians whether in research institutions or primarily teaching institutions."

The main idea is the construction of natural complex-analytic extension spaces, which make it possible to apply differential-geometric and topological methods to the above problems, and which can also be used to define numerical invariants. To date, the PI has successfully carried out one portion of this, namely the construction of complex-analytic Neron models. He proposes to use his results to describe graph closures of admissible normal functions, to carry out a local study of singularities, and to obtain a classification theorem. The PI also proposes to introduce Poincare bundles of Neron models, both to define numerical invariants for pairs of normal functions and to make progress on the question of the existence of singularities.<br/><br/>The proposed work is connected with the program of M. Green and P. Griffiths, and bears on the Hodge conjecture. The general philosophy is to understand the geometry of a complex algebraic variety with the help of differential geometry and topology. The proposed methods can be used, for instance, to study Noether-Lefschetz loci on Calabi-Yau threefolds; this example is interesting because we have very intriguing numerical predictions made by physicists for these loci."

Using his results with Hulek on the locus of intermediate Jacobians of cubic threefolds, the PI will attempt to define an extended tautological ring for compactifications of the moduli space of abelian varieties, and to study the classes of natural loci in it, as a possible inductive approach to degenerations of abelian varieties. The PI will also aim to obtain an explicit solution to the classical Schottky problem in genus 5, by using motivation and his results on string scattering amplitudes. Further, the PI will attempt to use his characterization, with Krichever, of Prym varieties to approach the Prym-Torelli problem.<br/><br/>In algebraic geometry, one basic question is to describe the set of all objects of a given type. Given an algebraic variety (a zero set of a system of polynomial equations), one can try to deform it, by deforming the defining equations, and ask what is the space of deformations, or ask what is the space of varieties that can be deformed to a given one. These parameter spaces for varieties are called moduli spaces, and turn out to often have a rich geometric structure themselves. Moreover, in many instances there are constructions associating to a variety of one kind a variety of a different kind (for example the Jacobian of a Riemann surface), and these constructions define maps of one moduli space to another. It is natural to ask whether these maps preserve all the information (that is, whether the image determines the source - whether the map is injective; this is known as the Torelli problem) and whether all varieties can be obtained by such a construction (that is, whether the map is surjective; if not, describing the image is the Schottky problem). The proposed project aims to provide a better understanding and more explicit description of the structure of these geometric moduli spaces and relations among them. The PI proposes to work on some longstanding open questions in moduli theory, and will also work on developing new tools and techniques for studying moduli spaces."

This location is approximately one hour outside of Ft. Collins, CO, USA.  The Brauer group is an abstract algebraic group studied by mathematicians with a wide variety of interests. Algebraists often study the Brauer group in its role as a directory of division algebras over a field, ultimately with the goal of understanding arithmetic complexity in fields. Open questions relate to simplicity of description, expression in terms of cyclic classes,  and the search for a reasonable definition of dimension for fields and for algebraic groups such as PGL(n). Algebraic geometers study the Brauer group as an important invariant of a scheme arising from etale cohomology. This point of view goes back to the 1960's and Grothendieck, who suggested problems that are still actively being investigated. Recently deep connections have arisen between Brauer groups of schemes and stack theory, and these are being used not only to attack some longstanding open problems, but to serve as inspiration for new problems and approaches.  <br/><br/><br/>The primary goal of this conference is to bring together established and beginning researchers from all of these perspectives to collaborate and share insights on problems of interest involving the Brauer group in its many forms. The conference will serve to both unify viewpoints and diversify methods, and will yield not only progress on problems and increased levels of collaboration, but the initiation of new researchers into the Brauer groups community. Formal talks will be given by senior level researchers as well as by young researchers, including graduate students, post-docs and young faculty.  Time will also be allotted for informal collaboration and open problem sessions in hopes of encouraging new research questions and collaborations.

Most of the objects under consideration arise from algebraic geometry, corresponding to sets of solutions of polynomial equations. Homological commutative algebra has to do with finding relations between these solutions, and iterating the process by finding relations on relations, etc., thus giving rise to possibly infinite resolutions. The PI also uses positive characteristic methods in most of her work. In a positive characteristic setting, the ring is endowed with an additional structure called the Frobenius homomorphism. The PI's work takes advantage of this additional structure to show that it gives rise to interesting new phenomena that do not occur in its absence."

This correspondence is still largely conjectural but there has been much progress in recent years. The proof of the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture has been considerably generalized to rather general potential automorphy theorems that apply to Galois representations of arbitrary dimension.  Such results have led, for example, to a proof of the Sato-Tate conjecture. On the other hand, these results have the restriction that they apply only to Galois representations with distinct Hodge-Tate weights. This restriction rules out some well known examples of Galois representations such as Artin representations and the Tate modules of abelian varieties of dimension greater than one. The principal goal of this project is to develop modularity results that apply to Galois representations with repeated Hodge-Tate weights.<br/><br/>Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics and has a very rich history. Modern number theorists are interested in the field of algebraic numbers (numbers that satisfy a polynomial equation with rational coefficients) and its group of symmetries (which is an example of a Galois group). The conjectures of Langlands and Fontaine-Mazur then predict that representations of this group are intimately related to objects from distinct branches of mathematics such as representation theory, analysis and algebraic geometry. Progress on these conjectures has led to some spectacular results such as Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and has been a driving force for much development in neighboring fields. Objects of fundamental interest in this theory, such as elliptic curves, play a large role in cryptography and internet security."

The local Langands correspondence is a mysterious conjectural relationship between two kinds of symmetries -- a geometric one, offered by groups of matrices with coefficients in real, complex, or p-adic fields, and an arithmetic one, offered by the Galois group of the real or a p-adic field. The last decade has seen a tremendous progress in this area, but the theory is still largely conjectural. The PI and his collaborators will attempt to establish new cases of the conjectural correspondence through the use of type-theory, as well as to elucidate the connection between types and the cohomology of Rapoport-Zink spaces, in particular in the case of low-rank unitary groups. The already existing constructions will be investigated more deeply using the theory of endoscopy. Furthermore, the PI and his collaborators will study both the local and the global Langlands correspondences for unitary groups of arbitrary rank, using the trace-formula techniques developed by Arthur.<br/><br/>The Langlands program brings together several areas of mathematics, including arithmetic, geometry, analysis, and symmetry. By establishing deep and surprising ties between them, it provides the means for answering very hard questions about the arithmetic of numbers, as exemplified by the recent proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. A sophisticated understanding of the arithmetic of numbers is in turn fundamental to many recent technological developments, including error-correcting codes, compression, encryption and secure communication. This project aims at deepening our understanding of the Langlands program by exploring connections between several approaches to it, as well as by exploiting techniques which have only recently become available."

The current proposal attempts to generalize the Gross--Zagier formula to high dimensions, i.e., systems of more variables and more equations.

Rapoport and Th. Zink.<br/>A conjecture of R. Kottwitz predicts that the cohomology groups in question realize local Langlands correspondences.

The theory of Rigid-Analytic Spaces provides a framework to relate these two theories.<br/> <br/>The project's main theme is that of symmetries, families of symmetries (i.e., groups), about relating different kinds of symmetries, and studying symmetries in terms of the geometry of spaces (and vice versa). This is a classic approach, but is done for a class of symmetries and spaces that, so far, have not been well understood. The projects aim at unifying and better understanding theories that have been considered as separate branches so far. This is the case for the so-called smooth representation theory, and the representation theory of Lie algebras. The results will also help to understand the geometry of moduli spaces which are defined by polynomial equations with integral coefficients, e.g., integral models of Shimura varieties, and as such, are expected to deepen our knowledge about these fundamental objects in Geometry and Number Theory."

The emphasis is on the interplay between harmonic analysis and ergodic theory. The primary focus is the analysis of Whittaker periods. Whittaker periods of automorphic forms occur very frequently in many problems. Our goal is to have a complete theory and to prove sharp results. The proposal contains three closely related projects. A project motivated by the geometry of number concerns the uniform distribution of the skewness of integral flags in euclidean space. A related analytic problem is to estimate global Whittaker periods. We shall improve significantly previous results in the literature using global methods from ergodic theory. The third problem concerns local Whittaker functions. We want to establish the conjectural asymptotic behavior of Whittaker functions at infinity. There are several outcomes of proving this conjecture as well as applications to automorphic forms. The PI will apply methods from geometry and representation theory.<br/><br/><br/>Number theory is among the oldest branches in mathematics and basic arithmetic is taught in elementary school. Applications to technology are prevalent: communication systems, data processing, cryptographic algorithms. L-functions capture fundamental information about prime numbers which appear everywhere. The Langlands program is a vast network of conjectures and results motivated by the interplay between representation theory and number theory. The proposed research will provide a new bridge between the Langlands program and several topics in analysis and representation theory. This will deepen our understanding and knowledge through identifying profound analogies and stimulate collaboration between experts in different fields. Because of its history the interface between analysis and number theory has plenty of longstanding problems; the analysis of periods and L-functions is a central theme and driving force. <br/>The proposed research provides theoretical results which can be used as prospective tools in many different problems: numerical investigations by different teams, vanishing of special values and arithmetic cycles, moments, period bounds and subconvexity problems. The PI will continue to teach and mentor students research projects: junior papers, senior and PhD thesis, disseminating knowledge and discoveries while promoting learning through the investigation of open problems."

The SouthEast Regional Meeting On Numbers is a larger regional meeting that has been in effect since the late 1980's.  These meetings inspire collaboration and  broaden the scope of existing research interests within the general subject of number theory.  One objective of these meetings is to involve number theorists at all career stages and types of institutions at minimal cost.  Speakers include graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty.  The meetings have, in particular, provided an important service to students and young researchers in this region working in number theory, strengthening their knowledge of this research area and allowing them to disseminate their work while at the same time obtaining insightful input from other participants.

The automorphic objects of interest include modular and Jacobi forms, as well as mock modular and Jacobi forms, which have seen a great deal of recent interest thanks to work of Borcherds, Bringmann, Bruinier, Funke, Ono, Zagier, and Zwegers.  Mock modular forms are of particular interest due both to their connections with harmonic Maass forms, as well as their famous history as objects of mystery dating back to Ramanujan and Watson.  As an example of the interplay between automorphic forms and other topics, the PI and Bringmann recently used combinatorial probability bounds for gap-avoiding sequences (that first arose in Holroyd, Liggett, and Romik's study of finite-size scaling in bootstrap percolation) in order to prove a cuspidal asymptotic expansion for a family of hypergeometric q-series considered by Andrews.<br/><br/>Due to its scope, this research program has the potential for wide-ranging applications.  An underlying theme is the universality of the tools and techniques of modern number theory, whose best-known uses include cryptography and cellular communication.  This research will also illustrate applications to high-energy physics (where wall-crossings and black holes are described by mock theta functions), and biological 'growth' processes (where the the large-scale behavior of cellular automata is determined by the asymptotic expansions of modular forms)."

Access to working mathematicians at Mathcamp helps meet an intellectual need for the students, many of whom do not have the mathematical resources at home to pursue their interests.<br/><br/>This award has two components.  The first component of the award is a ""Research in Pairs"" program, which will support visits to Mathcamp by pairs of mathematical collaborators.  In addition to teaching a class, these visitors will work on their research during their stay, with two main goals: (1) achieving progress on research, and (2) making the production of new mathematics visible to our students.  The second component of the award provides scholarships for U.S. students from target outreach groups (girls, underrepresented minorities, and students from underrepresented communities of origin, economically disadvantaged backgrounds or underperforming schools).

Moreover, in the past two or three decades, applications of number theory to cryptography and coding theory have provided a safer and more secure environment for our country.  A generation or more ago, these applications could not have been envisioned.  It should be emphasized that the applications arose out of fundamental research that had been previously conducted without knowledge of the applications that would be made further down the road. Even within number theory, the boundary lines among different disciplines within the subject are not as fixed as in the past. Thus, students specializing in number theory must be familiar with a wide range of areas within the subject. In selecting speakers for Number Theory Day, which precedes the Graduate Student Number Theory Conference at the University of Illinois, the organizing committee has attempted to recognize the wide expanse of the subject.  Moreover, as students listen to the lectures of other students in number theory from neighboring universities, they will further be exposed to the enormous breadth of the subject.<br/> <br/>Additional information is available on the conference website: http://www.math.illinois.edu/mntcg9/"

The relationship between singularities and global aspects of the function, such as minima and maxima, is only the tip of the iceberg. Rimanyi studies singularities of functions between higher dimensional spaces, and their relations with global aspects of the spaces. A key notion of his research is the equivariant cohomology class represented by a geometrically relevant variety. Natural infinite series of these classes often display remarkable properties. The PI proposes a new approach to prove a positivity result for an interesting set of equivariant classes, the so-called quiver polynomials. He also plans to study the positivity of another class: the Thom polynomials of Morin singularities, in connection with the Green-Griffiths conjecture on the holomorphic maps to projective varieties. His new approach is based on the flexibility of Iterated Residue descriptions of equivariant classes. Another area the PI proposes to study is the very promising interplay between equivariant cohomology, differential equations, and physics. Namely, equivariant classes often satisfy physically inspired differential equations. Based on earlier works with Varchenko, Rimanyi proposes to find the topological aspects of quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov differential equations, and study why equivariant cohomology classes satisfy them. As an application quantum Selberg type integrals with topological ingredients are expected.<br/><br/>In the physical sciences, one very challenging problem is the understanding of sudden changes caused by smooth alterations of parameters. Rimanyi is working on the mathematical aspects of these physical phenomena. An essential aspect of his proposal is its educational component. Rimanyi proposes to continue a Geometry Learning Seminar for the graduate students at UNC, providing a critical source of communication between faculty and interested graduate students. By continuing to involve some bright Chapel Hill high school students in mathematics research, the proposer is creating new opportunities and new channels of communication between different institutions. He also proposes to broaden participation of undergraduates in the mathematical life of the department by advising students as they begin their honors theses. He will continue running a weekly problem solving/competition preparation seminar for undergraduates---where the students get not only math olympiad type training, but experience research firsthand. He continues to advice master and PhD student. Rimanyi proposes to set up an online Thom polynomial portal, where scattered results of Thom polynomials would be collected and organized for the benefit of scientists."

Five experts will be invited to give talks on different pertinent subjects, which in total present the complete story behind the local correspondence: introductory material; C. Bushnell and P. Kutzko's type theory; M. Strauch's Jacquet-Langlands correspondence via the Lefschetz trace formula; Weinstein's aforementioned results on the stable reduction of the Lubin-Tate tower, and his joint work with M. Boyarchenko on the geometry of the special fiber.  The workshop will be held on May 12-13, 2012.  More information can be found at the conference website: http://math.uchicago.edu/~lxiao/workshop_site/<br/><br/>Number theory is the branch of pure mathematics devoted to the study of whole numbers and their relations; a particular goal is often to understand whether a given algebraic equation has a whole number solution. The apparent simplicity of such problems belies their complexity, and a box of intricate tools has been collected over the past 400 years to attack them. Chief among them is a 'correspondence' proposed by R. Langlands in the 1960s which, once established, would allow number theorists to exploit methods from a wide range of other, seemingly unrelated mathematical fields. For example, the 300 year old problem 'Fermat's Last Theorem' was successfully tackled by A. Wiles in the 1990s by establishing part of Langlands' correspondence. Now, although the correspondence remains mysterious in general, it can be split into pieces which can be studied 'one prime at a time', called 'local correspondences': since prime numbers are the atoms of the whole numbers, a common approach in number theory is to attack a problem one prime at a time. These local correspondences can be investigated using geometry and are much better understood; the main intent of the organizers is to host a weekend workshop where graduate students and young researchers can learn about the latest developments in the field."

Famous examples are calculus via Newtonian mechanics and differential geometry via Einstein's theory of general relativity. During the last twenty years, there has been a great deal of activity devoted to building a so-called string-theoretic model of the universe, which incorporates some of the most sophisticated mathematics. The subject of Gromov-Witten theory was born twenty years ago  during a period of intensive interaction between mathematics and physics.  Since then Gromov-Witten theory has established itself as a central area in both geometry and physics.  At the same time, it has expanded greatly in its scope to many diverse areas of mathematics, ranging from the classical topic of Hurwitz theory to the modern area of Donaldson-Thomas invariants (the sheaf-theoretic counterpart of Gromov-Witten theory). Despite its success, many central problems remain unsolved. Two notable examples are the computation of higer genus Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and the precise relation between Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The resolution of these problems is of great importance for geometry and physics. In this proposal, a team of the best experts in the world is assembled to attack these central problems. In addition, the PIs propose to develop technology to study a variety of questions relating Gromov-Witten theory to enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and mathematical physics.  The PIs hope to make important and substantial contributions to these areas of mathematics, and their interrelations.<br/><br/>This project is interdisciplinary in nature, in that both physical and mathematical ideas play central roles.  In this sense it adds to the current trend of interaction between mathematics and physics. This project emphasizes teamwork and collaboration. Through research seminars, organizing and participating in national and international conferences, this proposal will also enhance the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows. There will be a number of research publications that will help in introducing students to this exciting area of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number theory and the Topology programs of DMS."

The representation theory of finite groups has been driven in a large part by the conjectures of Alperin and Brou'e in the last twenty years. The proposal will bring new topological directions in the area, and new conjectures. The basic idea is to replace actions on vector spaces by actions on topological spaces. Higher representation theory, the study of actions of a given monoidal category on categories, is a much more recent area of research. It has been developed mostly in relation with Kac-Moody algebras. A recent construction is that of tensor structures. Our proposal will bring homotopical methods in the theory. It aims also at bringing higher representation theory in the area of geometers working on counting invariants and topologists working on invariants of four-manifolds, in the continuation of Khovanov.<br/><br/>The project will bring new topological insight in algebra, and in particular in representation theory, the study of symmetries. A major problem is to understand global symmetries from local symmetries. We will approach and recast this within a wider topological setting. The project will also produce methods to build objects in algebra, as a counterpart of the classical constructions of spaces in geometry as families or ""moduli spaces"". This should lead to an understanding through algebra of some properties of three and four-dimensional geometry."

Second, the PI is concerned with arithmetic statistics for in finite families of automorphic representations and their L-functions. Third, the PI is involved in a joint project to classify the automorphic representations of unitary groups with arithmetic applications in mind. Some projects will be carried out in collaboratiton with Kaletha, Minguez, Scholze, Templier and White.<br/><br/>  The proposed projects stem from basic questions that ancient Greeks were trying to answer, such as studying properties of prime numbers and finding systematic solutions to polynomial equations in integers or rational numbers. The trace formula may be viewed as a twentieth century invention to tackle such fundamental problems effectively. Automorphic forms and the Langlands program become increasingly important in theoretical physics and would possibly shed light on our understanding of the universe.

Now a family of six-dimensional quantum field theories is emerging as an object of acute mathematical interest.  This Focused Research Group brings together researchers working in diverse parts of mathematics and physics to study these theories.  They originally arose as limits of string theories and are usually called 'superconformal (2,0)-theories' to call attention to their symmetries.  The simpler appellation 'Theory X' emphasizes how little is known.  The projects undertaken here have two overall goals.  First, we will make inroads on the structure of Theory X by applying the detailed and profound mathematical understanding of topological and conformal quantum field theories obtained over the past 25 years.  Second, we will use expected properties of Theory X and its compactifications to lower dimensions to deduce new conjectures and new organizing principles in geometric representation theory.  The rapidly developing web of interactions between the six-dimensional quantum Theory X and a host of central topics in twenty-first century geometry, topology, and geometric representation theory indicates that we are seeing the beginnings of a new revolution, one in which Theory X plays the dominant physical role. Progress towards unraveling its structure and its consequences will have broad ramifications.<br/><br/>Physics has long fueled developments in mathematics, and the past 30 years have been a particularly fruitful period.  The depth of mathematics which enters fundamental physical theories has steadily intensified, and at the same time the structure and predictions of these theories have had increasingly profound impacts on mathematics.  This project is one of many efforts to mine this intellectually fertile mix of ideas.  Our pursuit of Theory X will inevitably illuminate a much broader circle of ideas and contribute to the mathematical understanding of contemporary physics.  The work of past generations at the mathematics-physics interface fuels the modern world: our computers, GPS systems, transportation, sophisticated medical tools, and much more owe their existence to basic research in this area which stretches back well over a century.  While we cannot predict how current basic research will impact the future, we can say with certainty that the effect will be far-reaching."

The mathematical techniques under development could make it possible to exactly compute the predicted masses of particles in increasingly realistic string models, and better understand how the observed forces and interactions in nature can arise from grand unified theories which include quantum gravity.

Goals are to better understand certain aspects of the numerical data and compare and contrast the predictions of different models.

The primary intellectual merit of the proposal is that it will increase our understanding of each of these important areas of mathematics and unearth new relationships between them. The main unifying theme behind these problems is that our proposed strategies for solving them all involve potential theory, both in the classical and non-Archimedean setting.  In recent years, a surprisingly robust non-Archimedean analog of classical complex potential theory has been developed by  the PI and others.  In addition, the PI has helped to develop a number of general techniques for comparing Berkovich analytifications and tropicalizations of algebraic varieties, showing that one can profitably view tropical geometry a `bridge' between Berkovich's theory of non-Archimedean analytic spaces and classical convex geometry.  The PI proposes to develop new methods for constructing semistable models of curves via tropical geometry, to prove a non-Archimedean Berkovich space version of the Mumford-Neeman equidistribution theorem, to apply Berkovich's theory to the study of component groups of Neron models, and to explore arithmetic and geometric properties of post-critically finite rational maps within the moduli space of all rational maps.<br/><br/>The classical subject of  complex potential theory first arose in physics, where it was used to describe gravitational and electromagnetic interactions.  It has subsequently found a wealth of applications to various areas of mathematical research, including complex analysis and complex dynamics (where it is used to study fractals such as the celebrated Mandelbrot set).     Non-Archimedean analysis is a crucial part of modern number theory which first arose in the early twentieth century work of Kurt Hensel on the famous 'p-adic numbers'.  In non-Archimedean potential theory, one replaces the classical complex ``Riemann sphere'' by a p-adic counterpart, called the Berkovich projective line, which was introduced by Vladimir Berkovich in the 1980's.  Berkovich's theory has since become an important tool in modern number theory and algebraic geometry.  Tropical geometry is a relatively new and active area of research with applications to many fields of mathematics. One can think of tropical geometry as a piecewise linear approximation of classical algebraic geometry in which an ``algebraic variety'' (which is, roughly speaking, the set of common solutions to a system of polynomial equations) is replaced by a polyhedral complex (thought of as the set of common solutions to a system of linear inequalities).   Surprisingly -- and rather mysteriously -- the tropical approximation remembers much more information about the original variety than one might originally expect."

Given a Lie algebra one can define a numerical invariant of 3-manifolds called the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant. It is an open problem to lift these to homological invariants of 3-manifolds. This is analogous to the way (singular) homology of topological spaces lifts the Euler characteristic. In earlier work of the PI jointly with Joel Kamnitzer they were able to do this for complements of links inside the 3-sphere when the Lie algebra is sl(n) and the link labeled by fundamental representations. To do this they used certain (derived) categories of coherent sheaves on flag-like varieties and the hope is to generalize this approach to other 3-manifolds. Their constructions were algebro-geometric but used many techniques from representation theory. Inspired by representation theory the PI plans to develop other tools to study varieties and their categories of coherent sheaves. For example, he plans to study actions of the Heisenberg Lie algebra on categories of sheaves on Hilbert schemes.<br/><br/>The simplest example of a 3-manifold is the 3-dimensional world we live in. A little more complicated is what you obtain by cutting out a doughnut or perhaps an object with more holes. However, there are even more complicated 3-manifolds which are harder to describe. A fundamental problem in low-dimensional topology is how to tell whether two given 3-manifolds are ""the same"" or not (""the same"" has a very precise mathematical definition in this case). A 3-manifold invariant is a tool for doing this. Their construction leads one to study other fields of mathematics and theoretical physics such as representation theory (the study of matrices) and algebraic geometry (the study of systems of polynomial equations). This rich connection to other fields is one of the attractive features of this problem. <br/>"

In fact, a unique correspondence is obtained only after the root numbers and L-functions attached to tensor products of representations of Weil group are shown to equal to those defined by Rankin product factors for corresponding representations of two GL(.,F). There are some other instances where these objects are defined for representaions of GL(n,F) such as exterior square and symmetric square representations of GL(n,C), as well exterior cube when n is less than or equal to 8 by means of the Langlands-Shahidi method.

He will also study certain representation theoretic consequences of functoriality.  Next he will continue his joint work on studying p-adic L-functions through the Langlands-Shahidi method, and pursue Langlands new ideas on Beyond Endoscopy and Reciprocity, as well as the possible generalization of the method to loop groups and covering groups.<br/><br/>The proposal involves training of graduate students and postdocs and includes specific problems for them. The investigator expects several new students to join him and other members of the Number Theory group at Purdue and is involved in teaching high level courses (e.g.,p-adic L-functions, automorphic forms, representation theory of real Lie groups) to train them. Theory of Artin L-functions and its connection with reciprocity law (correspondence) of Langlands is one of the most beautiful parts of number theory which the investigator hopes can be studied by students of different level in different seminars. On another level, he is involved in organizing conferences as well as serving in editorial boards of several prominent journals as well as panels. Moreover, he remains involved in mentoring and minority hiring and currently serves on the Department's Graduate Recruitment Committee with emphasis on recruiting women and minority students."

The first part is aimed at problems in Poisson Lie groups and cluster algebra aspects of representations of quantized universal Lie algebras. The results of this investigation will be used to construct and study invariants of knots and invariants of 3-manifolds. The goal of the second part is the development of the semiclassical quantization of classical field theories. It has two major directions: the first one is the definition of the partition function for space time manifolds with boundaries, the second one is the verification of locality of quantum field theory through the gluing operation for partition functions. This portion of the project is focused mainly on topological gauge theories, in particular on the Chern-Simons theory. The third part of the proposal is focused on problems in equilibrium statistical mechanics. The PI plans to continue to investigate the behavior of correlation functions and of the partition functions for models with fixed boundary conditions on states and, in particular, scaling limits of semiclassical type. Such semiclassical limits appear in the study of correlation functions of `long operators"" in the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.<br/><br/><br/>Significant portion of the first part of the proposal is aimed at providing algebraic tools for constructing quantum topological gauge theories. One of the fundamental problems in particle physics is to construct a theory which explains the dynamics of experimentally detected particles and would explain their variety. The Standard Model is a candidate for such theory. One of the key aspects of this theory is that its classical counterpart has infinite dimensional internal symmetry known as gauge symmetry. This makes the construction of the quantum theory incredibly complicated. Strictly speaking, mathematically the theory is still in its childhood. The second part of the proposal is aimed at resolving such problems in a simpler case of topological gauge theory, where the dynamics is much simpler but the symmetry is exactly the same. The last part of the proposal focuses on the study of phenomena very similar to large deviations in probability theory (estimate the probability that a coin will fall xN times on one side and (1-x)N times on the other side in N trials for large N) and to the stochastic origins of hydrodynamics (we know that the motion of water is deterministic at large scale, but is random at the molecular scale). The PI will continue to study similar phenomena in a number of two dimensional models."

In the past ten years, it has become clear that Berkovich spaces, a certain class of technical objects in non-archimedean analysis, are essential for the non-archimedean theory.  In particular, the construction of a probability measure invariant under the dynamical system requires the use of Berkovich spaces.  Also in the past decade, our understanding of ramification of functions on Berkovich spaces has grown, and with it has grown our ability to apply the existence of invariant measures to certain problems in non-archimedean dynamics.  In addition, the use of one-parameter families has been used to great effect in constructing pathological examples of non-archimedean dynamical systems.  Using all these newly available tools in tandem, the PI plans to study several open questions that have resisted previous less sophisticated attacks.  The proposal draws on tools from both complex dynamics and non-archimedean analysis, and the problems to be studied have applications to the theory of arithmetic dynamics over global fields and hence to certain problems in Diophantine geometry.<br/><br/>This project joins together the very different realms of dynamical systems and of number theory.  On the one hand, non-archimedean dynamics is a subfield of arithmetic dynamics, which concerns a particular class of Diophantine geometry problems.  Such problems, i.e., understanding the set of rational number solutions to a naturally arising set of polynomial equations, have been a major theme in number theory from the ancient Greeks through Fermat and into the present day.  On the other hand, the study of dynamical systems, and especially of complex dynamics, has arisen far more recently, exhibiting not only a purely mathematical beauty but also spectacular computer drawings of fractals and related sets.  This project's proposed study of non-archimedean dynamics thus draws on, builds on, and joins together both fields, the ancient and modern alike.  In addition, as in two earlier successful projects, the PI plans to supervise some students in an REU summer research project to aid in their mathematical training.  Depending on the interest of the students, the REU may involve some intensive computer computations to generate interesting examples; if so, any relevant data generated will be published or posted on the web, for the benefit of the larger research community.  Naturally, any results will also be disseminated via websites such as ArXiv and publication in mathematical journals.<br/>In addition, the PI is currently writing a graduate-level textbook on dynamics in one non-archimedean variable, as the field has too few expository texts today."

The PI will use recent results concerning ACC for the log canonical threshold to attack termination.  A related project is to study birational boundedness of Fano varieties, especially the conjecture of Borisov-Alexeev-Borisov.  Birational geometry also offers a potential way to study vector bundles on projective space, to be used as a means to attack Hartshorne's conjectures.  Finally, the PI also plans to study the connection between birational geometry, foliations and the abundance conjecture.<br/><br/>Algebraic Geometry is one of the oldest and most challenging of areas of research in mathematics, which combines some very classicial geometry, for example that of conic sections and the more modern techniques of algebra.  There has been a lot exciting recent work in higher dimensional geometry.

By a suitable modification of the basic notions  (like order, marked ideals and etc) introduced in the algorithm in characteristic zero the investigator plans to approach the problem of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic. In particular, the investigator plans to apply the resolution algorithm to some special classes like locally binomial varieties. Already in this case the existence of canonical embedded resolution is highly nontrivial and it is a good testing ground for the general approach. On the other hand by using the theory of Deligne Weight filtration  on the cohomology groups the investigator plans to study new invariants of singularities describing the cohomological properties of the fibers of resolutions of singularities and their links. The investigator plans also to study generalizations of the Weak factorization theorem from the point of view of its further potential applications. The theorem allows to factor any birational maps between nonsingular varieties into a sequence of blow-ups and blow-downs with smooth centers. It is  a very useful tool, especially for studying, so called, birational invariants. The problem is that  the resolution of singularities is not unique. The Weak factorization theorem can be thus used to compare the invariants resulting from the desingularization process. The technique of a generalized Weak factorization theorem was used also in the recent study of the invariants of the fibers of resolutions.<br/><br/><br/>Studying the singularities is of critical importance in many areas of Mathematics. The Hironaka theorem on resolution of singularities plays a central role  in Algebraic Geometry. It constitutes a basis  of proofs of many theorems not only in Algebraic and Analytic Geometry. The theorem on desingularization is proven in characteristic zero and is known only in special cases in positive characteristic. This is a major drawback for many theorems which rely on desingularization and which can be proven in characteristic zero only. The project deals with studying new ideas and developing new relatively simple approach to the resolution problem in positive characteristic. It also opens some new possibilities in general topic of singularities in positive characteristic. On the other hand the investigator plans to study new interesting topological invariants describing the resolutions of singularities in characteristic zero. He also plans   to further develop and generalize birational techniques (like the Weak factorization theorems) relevant for studying  topological properties of the resolutions."

The study of local group theory proved of fundamental importance in the study of finite groups; it has recently resurfaced in the study of fusion systems and related topological ideas. The classification of finite simple groups is having profound influence in a number of areas of mathematics. At the same time, there is considerable amount of work on the revision of the classification, with significant streamlining and new ideas being brought to bear. The connections to algebraic groups have played central role in the study of groups of Lie type, as well as representation theory in the study of groups and algebras. Developments in all these subjects will be discussed at the conference.<br/><br/>Thompson revolutionized group theory, starting in the late fifties and having central influence ever since then. His odd order paper with Feit, his series of N-group papers and other papers of lasting importance introduced new concepts and ideas which played essential role in the monumental achievement in the subject, the classification of finite simple groups. Thompson won a number of awards, including The Fields Medal, The Abel Prize, and the National Medal of Science. The aim of this research conference is to bring together leading researchers and young mathematicians in these areas. The speakers will include Aschbacher, Capdeboscq, Glauberman, Kessar, Liebeck, Malle, Robinson, Serre, Sin, Smith, Tiep and Thompson.

Ideally, such criteria involve numerical data, like multiplicities, that only depend on the individual members rather than the total space of the family. In prior work the investigator established a sufficient condition for the Whitney equisingularity of families of arbitrary isolated singularities, using the new notion of epsilon multiplicity as numerical invariant. Now he wishes to prove the necessity of his condition for equisingularity, which would result in a fiber-wise numerical characterization of Whitney equisingularity in the case of isolated singularities. In addition, he intends to advance the general theory of epsilon multiplicity beyond the context of equisingularity theory. The investigator proposes a program to study rational curves in projective space, most notably rational plane curves, through the syzygy matrix of the forms parametrizing them. Solely from the syzygy matrix, he wishes to extract local information about the singularities of the curve and understand the global positioning of these singularities. In particular, he proposes to set up a correspondence between the types of singularities on the one hand and the shapes of the syzygy matrix on the other hand, and to use this correspondence to stratify the space of rational plane curves of a given degree. The investigator plans to continue his work on Rees algebras of ideals by studying the implicit equations of such algebras. Understanding or finding these equations is a fundamental and difficult problem in elimination theory that is wide open even for the simplest of ideals. The investigator intends to focus on ideals whose generators parametrize projective varieties. In order to bound the degrees of the implicit equations and to understand the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the Rees algebra, he wishes to prove that the Rees algebra and the homogeneous coordinate ring of the variety have the same regularity. The investigator has the long-term goal to determine the defining equations explicitly if the parametrized variety is a rational plane curve.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed research is in the area of Commutative Algebra, a field of mathematics that has its roots in the qualitative study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Commutative Algebra has close ties to geometry, a connection that is prominent in the investigator's projects on equisingularity and rational curves. Systems of polynomial equations also arise in numerous applications outside of mathematics. The investigator's project on implicit equations of Rees algebras encompasses this applied aspect. In particular, the problem of finding implicit equations of surfaces defined parametrically has relevance in geometric modeling and computer-aided design, where it is known as implicitization problem."

In the twenty first century, Auslander's work has become even more popular with the many fields that are applying and using this theory; particularly important is the fact that the cluster theory of Zelevinsky and Fomin, which is connected to so many different fields, is also intimately related to the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. The proposed Maurice Auslander International Conference plans to bring together mathematicians from representation theory and related areas of combinatorics, invariant theory, non-commutative algebra, commutative algebra, homological algebra, etc. With support from the National Science Foundation, this successful yearly event will expand its participation, extend support to more graduate students and be extended to six days. There will be expository and research lectures about such topics as generalized cluster categories, including those related to surfaces, Poisson structures and their relation to cluster algebras, Brauer-Severi variety of Sklyanin algebras, universal deformation rings, quiver Grassmannians, Calabi-Yau algebras, Christoffel words and Markov numbers, Hopf algebra actions, twisted Plucker coordinates and combinatorial perfect matchings, higher Auslander algebras, MV polytopes and Nakajima quiver varieties. Many breakthrough have been presented at this conference, for example a proof of the well-known Strong No Loop Conjecture was presented for the first time in 2010.<br/><br/>The proposed Maurice Auslander International Conference is intended to be a center of activity for this area of algebra in the United States. The conference will be a combination workshop/conference/student presentation event. Each day of the conference will start with an expository lecture by known international experts in various fields of algebra. This will be followed by at least one student presentation explaining results related to their PhD theses. The rest of the lectures will be traditional conference talks. The goal of the expository talks and student talks is to make current research in algebra accessible to graduate students and postdocs and to give beginning researchers a platform to display their achievements. We also want to introduce international leaders in our field to the young talent that we have in the US. The intent is that our young researchers will become better known in the world and will make outside contacts. Also, there is a strategic national goal that will be furthered. The US is already the leading country in many areas of mathematical research. However, it is lagging in new branches of algebra which are being developed largely in other countries. The proposed conference will help to reverse this trend.

The investigator will combine spectral methods with formulas which relate these quantities to periods of automorphic forms to establish asymptotic formulas with strong bounds on the error terms. In project 1 the investigator will establish a new asymptotic formula for the Hardy-Ramanujan partition function and thus provide an alternative approach to computing large partition numbers. In project 2 the investigator will use traces of weak Maass forms to construct new examples of mock modular forms and establish asymptotic formulas for their coefficients. In project 3 the investigator will establish asymptotic formulas for moments of L-functions and apply these results to various non-vanishing and subconvexity problems.<br/><br/>Modular forms and L-functions are objects of fundamental importance in number theory. For example, the Fourier coefficients of modular forms contain arithmetic and combinatorial information, while central values of L-functions are related to invariants of elliptic curves. The proposed research will result in a greater understanding of these objects and pave the way for new applications. One such application involves computing large partition numbers, which have important uses in scientific computing and cryptography. The proposed research will also lead to problems suitable for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows. Some of these problems will be studied by undergraduates advised by the investigator through the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program."

Famous examples are calculus via Newtonian mechanics and differential geometry via Einstein's theory of general relativity. During the last twenty years, there has been a great deal of activity devoted to building a so-called string-theoretic model of the universe, which incorporates some of the most sophisticated mathematics. The subject of Gromov-Witten theory was born twenty years ago  during a period of intensive interaction between mathematics and physics.  Since then Gromov-Witten theory has established itself as a central area in both geometry and physics.  At the same time, it has expanded greatly in its scope to many diverse areas of mathematics, ranging from the classical topic of Hurwitz theory to the modern area of Donaldson-Thomas invariants (the sheaf-theoretic counterpart of Gromov-Witten theory). Despite its success, many central problems remain unsolved. Two notable examples are the computation of higer genus Gromov-Witten invariants of compact Calabi-Yau manifolds and the precise relation between Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants. The resolution of these problems is of great importance for geometry and physics. In this proposal, a team of the best experts in the world is assembled to attack these central problems. In addition, the PIs propose to develop technology to study a variety of questions relating Gromov-Witten theory to enumerative algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry and mathematical physics.  The PIs hope to make important and substantial contributions to these areas of mathematics, and their interrelations.<br/><br/>This project is interdisciplinary in nature, in that both physical and mathematical ideas play central roles.  In this sense it adds to the current trend of interaction between mathematics and physics. This project emphasizes teamwork and collaboration. Through research seminars, organizing and participating in national and international conferences, this proposal will also enhance the training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows. There will be a number of research publications that will help in introducing students to this exciting area of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number theory and the Topology programs of DMS."

Now a family of six-dimensional quantum field theories is emerging as an object of acute mathematical interest.  This Focused Research Group brings together researchers working in diverse parts of mathematics and physics to study these theories.  They originally arose as limits of string theories and are usually called 'superconformal (2,0)-theories' to call attention to their symmetries.  The simpler appellation 'Theory X' emphasizes how little is known.  The projects undertaken here have two overall goals.  First, we will make inroads on the structure of Theory X by applying the detailed and profound mathematical understanding of topological and conformal quantum field theories obtained over the past 25 years.  Second, we will use expected properties of Theory X and its compactifications to lower dimensions to deduce new conjectures and new organizing principles in geometric representation theory.  The rapidly developing web of interactions between the six-dimensional quantum Theory X and a host of central topics in twenty-first century geometry, topology, and geometric representation theory indicates that we are seeing the beginnings of a new revolution, one in which Theory X plays the dominant physical role. Progress towards unraveling its structure and its consequences will have broad ramifications.<br/><br/>Physics has long fueled developments in mathematics, and the past 30 years have been a particularly fruitful period.  The depth of mathematics which enters fundamental physical theories has steadily intensified, and at the same time the structure and predictions of these theories have had increasingly profound impacts on mathematics.  This project is one of many efforts to mine this intellectually fertile mix of ideas.  Our pursuit of Theory X will inevitably illuminate a much broader circle of ideas and contribute to the mathematical understanding of contemporary physics.  The work of past generations at the mathematics-physics interface fuels the modern world: our computers, GPS systems, transportation, sophisticated medical tools, and much more owe their existence to basic research in this area which stretches back well over a century.  While we cannot predict how current basic research will impact the future, we can say with certainty that the effect will be far-reaching."

Jointly with Mark Gross and Sean Keel, the PI has described an explicit construction of the mirror partner to a non-compact Calabi--Yau manifold of complex dimension 2. The PI will pursue two related projects: an algebraic description of the symplectic cohomology ring of a non-compact Calabi-Yau manifold, and the construction of a canonical basis of global sections of an ample line bundle on a K3 surface, analogous to theta functions for polarized abelian varieties.<br/><br/>The PI will study the classification of certain 4-dimensional geometric spaces and the ways in which such a space can be continuously deformed or undergo a ""degeneration"" given by a subset of the space collapsing to a point. In prior work the PI related such degenerations to the classification of bundles of linear spaces over the given geometric space. He will study this correspondence in detail, in particular its connection with work of Donaldson motivated by theoretical physics. Mirror symmetry is a mysterious correspondence between pairs of geometric spaces called Calabi-Yau manifolds arising in string theory. The PI will pursue two projects inspired by mirror symmetry. The first is a description in explicit terms of an algebraic structure built from counts of area-minimizing surfaces inside a Calabi-Yau manifold. The second is the construction of natural functions on Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the simplest case of a torus (the surface of a donut) these functions were known classically and are important in many areas of mathematics."

Symmetric varieties (De Concini, Procesi) are closely related to algebraic monoids.<br/><br/>Algebraic combinatorics studies discrete structures arising from an algebraic context. It is a broad and important discipline of mathematics with applications in quantum chemistry, statistical biology, statistical physics, theoretical computer science and so forth. In recent years there has been a tremendous progress on the combinatorial aspects of the above mentioned embedding theories, relating their underlying algebraic structures to the classical notions in algebraic combinatorics.<br/><br/>The workshop will provide a unique opportunity to bring together some of the principal investigators from different countries, junior researchers, and graduate students. It will outline future directions of research on algebraic monoids, group embeddings, and algebraic combinatorics.

It allows one to measure and compare groups on a large scale and has numerous applications in geometry, topology, analysis, probability, dynamics and other areas of mathematics. The growth of a group can be polynomial, exponential or intermediate between polynomial and exponential. The class of groups of intermediate growth is mysterious. Milnor's question as to whether this class is empty was open for more than 15 years. In 1983 the PI constructed uncountably many groups of intermediate growth with different types of growth. This led to the first construction of uncountably many quasi-isometry classes of 2-generated groups and gave the first explicit construction of a Cantor subset in the space of marked groups. Despite these successes in the study of groups of intermediate growth, there are still many fundamental open problems. The main open problems include: the question about the existence of finitely presented groups of intermediate growth, and the question (Gap Conjecture) about the size of  the ""gap"" between polynomial growth and intermediate growth. Among other important problems are the questions about the existence of hereditary just-infinite groups and of simple groups of intermediate growth. This proposal addresses these and other related questions. The PI has a reduction of the Gap Conjecture to  just-infinite groups, which includes the consideration of the above two classes and the class of branch groups. Techniques include  group actions on rooted trees and the methods of dynamical systems.<br/><br/>Growth of finitely generated groups is related with the theory of random walks, the geometry of fractals, crystals and quasi-crystals, coding theory, formal languages, dynamics of finite automata and cellular automata, modeling of communication networks, Kolmogorov complexity and many other topics. Results obtained as a part of the current research have potential implications for these areas, and for the scientific and technological understanding of communication networks, cryptography, and transportation systems. Schreier graphs and fractals constructed on the basis of self-similar groups of intermediate growth may be relevant for our understanding of some processes studied in biology, chemistry and demographic studies. Algorithms arising from the study of groups of intermediate growth are different from those used before, and have applications in science and technology.  In mathematics, the notion of growth is important not only for Geometric Group Theory, but also for Operator Algebras, Topology, Geometry, Dynamical Systems, Functional Analysis, Probability Theory, Discrete Mathematics, Differential Equations and other fields. The subject of growth is very suitable for graduate and even undergraduate courses, since it touches on many relevant topics in modern mathematics. The PI will disseminate the results of this research through peer reviewed publication and by giving seminar and colloquium talks, invited lectures and presentations to various types of audiences both domestically and internationally."

A sub-project involves refinements of the Kodaira vanishing theorem using algebraic methods.<br/><br/>Hodge theory lies at the core of this proposal. It is the part of algebraic geometry (the  study of algebraic varieties or sets of solutions of systems of algebraic equations) that interacts most closely with differential geometry, topology and to a lesser extent, mathematical physics.

The main intuition is that the semi-regularity map should be a part of the so-called open-closed map that appears in the study of open-closed topological conformal field theories.

There are three long-term goals: the study of projective rational plane curves; the description of the defining equations of Rees algebras; and the investigation of cores of arbitrary ideals. More precisely, Polini proposes to investigate local and global information on the singularities of a given curve; to set up a correspondence between the types of singularities and the shapes of the syzygy matrices of the forms parametrizing them; and to stratify the space of all rational plane curves of a fixed degree according to the configuration of their singularities. Rees algebras are instrumental in multiplicity theory and intersection theory, in the study of integral closures of ideals, and in the context of blowing up a variety. Although blowing up is a basic operation, an explicit understanding of this process is still an open problem. Most notably, it is difficult to describe the defining equations of the resulting variety. Reductions play a crucial role in the study of Rees algebras, multiplicities, and Hilbert functions. To investigate all reductions at once one considers the core, defined as the intersection of these reductions. The core is related to multiplier ideals, an essential tool in birational geometry due to their importance in vanishing theorems. The core detects uniformity properties of schemes, such as the Cayley Bacharach property of finite sets of points. Although cores have been studied extensively, they remain somewhat mysterious objects that are difficult to compute in general.<br/><br/>Commutative algebra deals with solutions of many polynomial equations in many unknowns. Fundamentally, it is the study of abstract objects called rings of polynomial functions defined on the set of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Commutative algebra provides the tools for understanding many problems in pure and applied mathematics and, as of more recently, physics as well. In many applied problems, polynomial equations and hence commutative algebra play a crucial role. Applied areas where results from commutative algebra have been used include geometric modeling, operations research,computer science, robotics, control theory, coding theory and cryptography,to mention a few. In fact, most of the problems described in this researchproposal are not only important for commutative algebraists or algebraicgeometers but are of interest to applied mathematicians as well. For instance,the study of curve (or surface) singularities via their parametrizations have applications in geometric modeling theory. In computer aided geometric design, curves are often given parametrically and their singularities are pointswhere the shape of the graphic gets more complicated. Thus, understanding the nature of these singular points is extremely important."

The algebraic structures studied in this project are certain associative algebras mostly arising in Quantum Mechanics: finite W-algebras, symplectic reflection algebras or quantum groups.

A crystal here is a combinatorial object (a set along with some operations) associated to each highest weight representation of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. Kashiwara's construction makes heavy use of the associated quantized universal enveloping algebra, but the crystals themselves can often be realized by other means. Some such realizations are purely combinatorial, and others use non-trivial geometry. In finite type, one realization which has generated a lot of interest uses the Mirkovic-Vilonen (MV) polytopes developed by Anderson and by Kamnitzer. Along with his collaborators, the P.I. is currently developing a version of this combinatorics for symmetric affine types, using quiver varieties. Affine MV polytopes have been sought since the finite type polytopes first appeared, so their construction is itself an important development. The P.I. will investigate the connection between these new polytopes and various algebraic and geometric structures related to affine algebras. This work may also lead to a notion of MV polytope in all (not necessarily symmetric) affine types. The proposed research also considers ways of extracting other combinatorial realizations from the geometry of quiver varieties, and develops applications of crystal theory to Macdonald polynomials and Demazure characters.<br/><br/>This proposal addresses important questions in the theory of affine algebras, and will be of interest to a number of people in that field. Affine algebras are important in mathematical physics, so there is potential for cross-disciplinary impact. The proposal will also fund undergraduate research projects, and more generally contribute to the training and developing of young mathematicians. There are several questions related to this research that can be studied in terms of explicit realizations of crystals. These are ideal for undergraduate research projects, as only a limited amount of background is required in order to approach the questions, yet they can provide an entry point into a rich representation-theoretic story.

The long term research objective of this program is proving the conjecture of the PI and his collaborators that there is a duality operation on symplectic singularities. At moment, the most important property of this proposed duality is its effect on the representation theory of associated algebras: ""categories O"" attached to the singularities should be Koszul dual (that is, induce a very special equivalence of categories). Many special cases of this duality are well-understood, but what links them remains to be investigated. This research is also tied up in the exploration of individual examples of these singularities; in these our proposal would be a ""geometrification"" and ""categorification"" of well-known dualities in mathematics, such as Schur-Weyl duality, rank-level duality and Gale duality. Our perspective also provides a fruitful approach to topics as diverse as the representation theory of symplectic reflection algebras and the Rouquier-Khovanov-Lauda categorification of quantum groups, and has applications as far afield as low-dimensional topology. <br/><br/>One of the most shocking discoveries of the 20th century was the discovery of quantum mechanics, and the introduction of non-commuting observables into physics.  Mathematicians have built on these observations to create an abstract theory of ""deformation quantization"" and ""noncommutative geometry."" The PI's work is about the relationships between the geometry of classical limits of noncommutative spaces on one hand, and state spaces that could describe related physical systems on the other.  The PI further proposes an educational component which creates a website platform for mathematical exposition, based on Wordpress. This will make blogs, wikis, and a whole range of of websites that don?t quite fit in those categories, and more closely resemble a dynamic version of a homepage freely and easily available to the mathematical community in a professional setting.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Topology program."

Approximately 30 researchers will attend the workshop.  The main objective is to implement algorithms in the following three rapidly growing areas: enumerative geometry, numerical algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and algebraic statistics.  These areas have significant applications in fields as diverse as computational biology, data analysis, statistics, and theoretical physics.  It is the expectation, therefore, that the packages developed through this workshop will advance our knowledge and understanding across multiple disciplines.  Some emphasis will also be placed on enhancing the multithreaded capabilities of Macaulay2.<br/><br/>Macaulay2 is one of the leading computer algebra systems for research and teaching in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. The ability to perform increasingly complicated computations in more areas of these two fields continues to revolutionize both research in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and the breadth of the applications of these fields to other areas of research.  Most of the other related computer algebra systems are based in foreign countries and continued competitiveness of Macaulay2, a leading United States--based program, depends on both a broad community contributing to its development and the funding to support this community through intensive workgroup meetings.<br/><br/>The participation of both experienced and novice researchers from a variety of institutions is crucial to the work of these workshops. These intensive workshops are also a great opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to enhance their package-writing skills early in their careers, taking advantage of the experience and research expertise of the more senior researchers as well as sharing their own expertise with the group.  A strong presence from young researchers also helps the base of mathematicians programming for Macaulay2 to grow over time. Travel and lodging support for these workshops are critical to both the intensive nature of the workshop and to the future development of Macaulay2."

Recently, Homological Mirror Symmetry has transformed from a phantasy to a leading field in modern geometry. This was achieved in part due to constant exchange of information among the leaders of the field of Homological Mirror Symmetry (Kontsevich, Soibelman, Orlov, Auroux , Abouzaid, Fukaya, Seidel, Zaslow, Pantev, Gross, Siebert, Mikhalkin, Zharkov, Thomas, Smith, Katzarkov, Bridgeland, Frenkel, Okounkov, Bezrukavnikov, Bridgeland, Pandharipande)with physicists (Vafa, Hori, Gukov, Kapustin, Neitzke, Douglas, Diaconescu). This exchange was mainly done during month-long activities taking place every winter in Miami. In addition, many young people were attracted to this field: Sheridan, Preigel, Izik, Pandit, Favero, Kerr, Ballard, Diemer, Dykerhoff. This conference will enable these fruitful exchanges to continue.<br/><br/>While mirror symmetry initially arose from phenomena in string theory, this very active subject at the interface between mathematics and physics has acquired increasing mathematical stature. Numerous works have shown the relevance to mirror symmetry of new and subtle mathematical structures. This conference will extend the success of previous activities by branching out in a new field of dissemination - creating a new University of Miami, Cinvestav, Campinas institute featuring two conferences per year and exchange of postdocs and students. These  conferences will be happening in winter and will be partially supported by University of Miami, Cinvestav, and Campinas."

By using methods of Geometric Invariant Theory, deformation theory, and enumerative geometry, the investigator will pursue several projects in order to elucidate the geometry of well-studied moduli spaces and to adopt new approaches to less studied ones. In the first project, the investigator will continue the study of finite Hilbert stability of embedded curves with the goal of advancing the log minimal model program for the Deligne-Mumford moduli space of stable curves. In the second project, the investigator will approach fundamental open questions about effective and ample divisors on this moduli space and its variants. The study of singularities is an important ingredient of these two projects. In the third project, the investigator will extend recent results in the theory of curves to certain classes of higher-dimensional varieties (e.g., K3 surfaces) and their moduli spaces.<br/><br/>An algebraic variety is a collection of solutions to a system of polynomial equations. Algebraic varieties are fundamental objects of study in mathematics and, in particular, in the field of algebraic geometry, to which this proposal belongs.

The study of moduli spaces is essential to understanding algebraic varieties themselves and, ultimately, to solving systems of polynomial equations. The investigator proposes to study moduli spaces of algebraic varieties depending on one or two free parameters using both classical and modern techniques. The broader impacts of the proposal include advancing an active research program and co-organizing workshops on moduli spaces and related problems."

A decade ago, the question of a p-adic/mod p component of this program was raised, motivated by natural questions of p-adic arithmetic geometry. As of now, only very few cases are understood, but they have already had spectacular consequences such as the proof of most cases of the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. Because of unexpected and poorly understood phenomena, statements of a general p-adic/mod p local Langlands conjecture remain elusive. The proposal aims to study the mod p representations of p-adic reductive groups in order to understand the right terms of a mod p Langlands correspondence. The PI's previous work has shown that studying  mod p representations of Hecke algebras is a promising approach, because it suggests that a mod p Langlands correspondence does exist. The proposal outlines strategies to study families and complexes of mod p representations of p-adic reductive groups and their associated Hecke algebras. At the heart of this proposal is the wish to go beyond the  (so far most investigated) focus on irreducible objects and give a homological approach to the representations. It goes along with exploring the possibility of a mod p principle of functoriality and shedding a geometric light on the potential mod p Langlands correspondence. <br/><br/><br/>The p-adic/mod p Langlands program holds profound prospects for modern number theory with deep ramifications in arithmetic algebraic geometry. It is a new, fertile area involving tools and objects that were still completely abstruse a few years ago. The proposal aims to give a geometric incarnation to the objects that appear naturally in the mod p framework. The outcome of this work will most likely be naturally connected to other areas of mathematics influenced by the Langlands conjectures, such as the geometric Langlands program, and its links with geometric representation theory. The proposal describes strategies towards such connections."

One notable direction is the theory of higher symplectic structures, which brings out the duality between the ``stacky'' directions and the ``derived'' directions of most moduli problems in algebraic geometry. Exploiting the full depth of these structures will require a careful study of the moduli of various kinds of categorical and  higher categorical entities. This is one of the main areas of expertise of all the PIs. Kontsevich introduced one of the main tools, derived schemes.  Katzarkov came up with the idea that moduli of LG models and its monodromy can be interpreted as stability conditions and spectra.<br/><br/>These activities fit into a more general and global philosophy designed to accompany Geometry in the 21st Century. The study of Geometry in the 20th Century was devoted, in large part and with astounding success, to the classification and parametrization of geometrical objects. However,these objects, of various kinds, were uniformly viewed somehow as ``sets of points''. Along the way, the relationship with categorical structures grew steadily, leading to the many inputs into our program as discussed above. The PIs themselves played a pivotal role in much of the progress that was made at the turn of the century. With PI Kontsevich's introduction of HMS, a subtle change was introduced, in that ``Geometry'' began to be seen  within a categorical structure. And the concurrent development of the theory of higher stacks meant that geometric structures were no longer viewed just as ``sets of points'' but rather as objects enclosing a higher structure. This project is highly connected with theoretical physics. As we head into the second decade of the 21st Century, elementary particle physics is on the crux of a profound revolution to be brought about by the new experimental results coming out of the LHC at CERN. These will serve to identify which of the multitude of theoretical possibilities which are currently open, best address quantum field theory at the high energy scale. And for those theories, to tell which are the right parameters. So there will soon be a lot of work to do on the theoretical side, and this will surely require new tools and a new approach.  With the relationship between HMS and supersymmetric theories, with the relationship between higher categories and TQFT, with the relationship between partition functions and nonabelian cohomology, the kinds of geometrical objects which we are going to investigate in this project are becoming crucial for understanding these new panoramas in theoretical physics. The project has an  educational component - conferences and educating postdocs, This component has been hugely successful in the past and with more funding we plan to bring it to  the next level."

There is an extensive web of extraordinary conjectures (for instance the Artin conjecture, the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Langlands' conjectures,Serre's conjecture and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture) linking these three seemingly very different subjects (which relate to analysis, algebra and geometry respectively). Progress on these conjectures is currently very exciting.  Under previous NSF grants the PI, with various collaborators, completed the proof of the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture; proved the local Langlands conjecture for GL(n) over a p-adic field; proved the Sato-Tate conjecture for elliptic curves over totally real fields; proved the first general automorphy lifting theorems and potential automorphy theorems for Galois representations of arbitrary dimension; and proved that the L-function of any polarized, regular, irreducible motive over a CM field has meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane and satisfies the expected functional equation. The PI proposes to continue to improve the currently available automorphy lifting and potential automorphy theorems; to relate the cohomology of Rapoport-<br/>Zink spaces to the local Langlands conjecture for groups other than GL(n); with Kevin Buzzard and Joe Rabinoff to prove the Artin conjecture for odd degree two representations of the Galois group of a totally real field in which 5 splits completely; and to think about more speculative problems relating Galois representations and automorphic forms, for instance how to understand the case of very degenerate Hodge-Tate numbers/infinitesimal character. In addition the PI will continue his work with post-docs and, particularly, with graduate students.<br/><br/>This circle of ideas is the one that led to Andrew Wiles' celebrated proof of Fermat's last theorem after over 300 years. They fall into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks."

Over fields of characteristic zero the Hecke symmetries govern modular forms and their higher dimensional generalizations, and p-adic properties are often reflected in the geometric properties of these symmetries in characteristic p. Hecke symmetries which fix a given point in a moduli space give rise to the local stabilizer subgroup of the given point. The action of this group on the local moduli space contains crucial information about the Hecke symmetries in general. However it was unclear how to extract these information in the case of positive characteristic p. Recently the PI made some progress in the first non-trivial case of the above general problem, and found what can be thought of as an asymptotic expansion of the action of the local stabilizer subgroup in the case of two-dimensional Lubin-Tate space in characteristic p.  The PI proposes to extend such asymptotic expansion to other moduli spaces, and to show that every Hecke orbit of a point in the generic open Newton stratum is dense in certain modular varieties associated to unitary groups. The latter problem is known as the Hecke orbit conjecture, which was inaccessible before. This proposal also contains two projects related to Hecke symmetries over fields of characteristic zero.  One of them continues the PI's prior supported research on CM lifting; the other is related to another supported research on aspects of the Andrea-Oort conjecture.<br/><br/>The concept of symmetry originated from our basic aesthetic sense and is of fundamental importance in modern science. In mathematics the major source of symmetry is crystallized by the abstract definition of a group. The main object of study in this proposal is a certain families of systems of polynomial equations admitting a large collection of symmetries, called Hecke symmetries; they are of fundamental importance in number theory. In the proposal, the PI establishes an approach which will reveal certain hidden pattern about the Hecke symmetries not previously known. It is expected that these patterns will enable us to solve many cases of an open problem known as the Hecke orbit conjecture.  This approach to a qualitative understanding of these symmetries is completely new since the work of Lubin and Tate in the middle 1960's."

Toward this end, they initiated an annual workshop series. The first three workshops were held at member institutions: North Carolina State University (NCSU) (2009), University of Georgia (UGA) (2010) and University of Virginia (UVA) (2011) with a follow up workshop to be held at North Carolina State University during April 21-22, 2012. Based on the success of these workshops the PIs plan to continue this series with a workshop at College of Charleston (CoC) in 2012 and one at Louisiana State University (LSU) in 2013. The research themes for these two workshops will be: ""Vertex Algebras, Conformal Field Theory, and Integrable Systems"" (2012, CoC) and ""Noncommutative geometry and representation theory"" (2013, LSU). <br/><br/>This funding will provide the needed support to organize these two workshops. Each workshop will feature one or two main speakers, giving 2-3 expository talks in the theme area, accessible to graduate students and postdocs. In addition, there will be 3-4 invited talks by other researchers. There will be ample time for informal discussion among participants. Considerable time will be devoted for informal discussion among participants in small groups (following the ""AIM Model"") to work on specific research problems led by invited team leaders chosen from among the participants.  The consortium and workshop series has and will continue to stimulate and enhance research collaboration in Lie theory in the southeastern region of the U.S. In the long run, the proposed activity will foster a strong regional tradition of research and education, in turn helping mathematics departments attract more minorities and underrepresented groups to mathematical sciences in general.

The first topic is a global theory of finite-dimensional representations of a semisimple Lie algebra. The classification of such representations is classical, but only offers a local theory, giving criteria for when two finite-dimensional representations are isomorphic. By considering the theory of finite-dimensional representations, the project seeks to study the representations called pseudo-finite dimensional representations, because they satisfy in the formal language all the theorems of finite-dimensional representations. These nonstandard representations will be used to study varieties of finite-dimensional representations, and thus lead to a global theory of finite-dimensional representations. The second activity of the project is to study the precise nature of the relationship between the Model Theory of Modules over a ring and the K-theory} of that ring. One hopes to establish a precise relationship between these two areas in terms of a theory of homology introduced to study formulae in the formal language of representations. Finally, a theory for complete exact categories is to be developed not by using the techniques of model theory directly, but rather by mimicking in a categorical setting the intuition used in the model theory of modules to study purity.<br/> <br/>The project will be devoted to a close examination of the relationship between activities carried on by algebraists most interested in applications to geometry and physics, but using the formal methodology of mathematical logic. These activities will use the language to study the symmetries that arise in algebra, and conversely, apply these symmetries to formal language. In other activities of the project, the PI will continue to act as consultant to professional development programs offered to elementary and middle school mathematics teachers in Northwest Central Ohio."

Second, they appear through the categorification program, also known as ""higher representation theory."" In many examples of categorification, the categories in questions have geometric interpretations involving sheaves on symplectic algebraic varieties.  This grant will provide funding for U.S. researchers to participate in a conference that addresses both of these topics.

This approach has its roots in the early 1980s when it was used to prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture, an outstanding problem in algebra that, superficially, had nothing to do with geometry.  The field has experienced enormous growth in the past decade, and this conference will allow researchers from around the world to keep abreast of recent work."
