In the first, problems will be considered which are                   related to a conjecture by Lech concerning the behavior of the                  Hilbert function under faithfully flat morphisms of local                       noetherian rings. In the second, the principal investigator                     will study stability properties of the divisor class group                      CL(R) where R is a local normal excellent henselian ring.                            This research is concerned with the geometric properties                   of commutative rings which arise in algebraic geometry. One of                  the problems to be considered is a conjecture by Lech which has                 been unsolved for twenty-five years."

Dr. Gustafson has proposed to develop the theory of                 hypergeometric series that are very well poised on semisimple Lie               algebras, as well as the corresponding theory of beta and Mellin-               Barnes integrals on compact Lie groups and the associated Lie                   algebras.

One part concerns geometries whose                    basic planar unit is an affine plane. A critical side issue of                  that study has been the determination of the geometric                          hyperplanes of the Lie incidence geometries. In this connection                 a geometric characterization of alternating k-linear forms                      seems imminent. This would show that all hyperplanes of                         Grassman spaces arise from such forms.

The goal of the Center is to tie these               differently perceived fields together under the unifying topic of               geometry and geometric representation on the computer.  The                     Center's scientific program is based on a core of scientific                    investigations whose origins are in ""pure"" mathematics as well as               models of physical phenomenon.  It is organized into five groups:               topology; geometry and symmetry dynamics; geometric optimization;               computation, geometry and graphics; and fractal geometry.  The                  proposed research includes a range of high-level mathematics                    centered on geometry utilizing high-level computer science centered             on geometry, in the environment of a high-quality laboratory for                computation, graphics, and visualization.  Through the common                   thread of visualization, the research forms a coherent body.

This project has its roots in the theory of abelian groups.                Abelian groups are algebraic objects having a commutative                       multiplicative operation. They arise in a number of areas of                    mathematics. This research has two basic thrusts. One may have                  implications for commutative algebra; the second involves the use               of logical techniques in the study of abelian groups."

Professor Billera's work is unusually interdisciplinary                    within mathematics, with roots in the applied field of spline                   functions as well as in the most abstract parts of commutative                  and homological algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. A               spline is a thin strip of metal or wood that one may grasp at                   both ends and manipulate to form a smooth curve that not only                   passes through two points (the places where it is held), but does               so in a given direction at each point. The spline functions of                  concern to Professor Billera generally describe smooth shapes of                dimension greater than one, and with a smoother junction at the                 edges than can be gotten, in the case of physical splines, by                   holding the two strips together in the hand. They are of interest               not only within mathematics, but in design, especially of                       automobiles and airplanes, and in solving problems in computer                  graphics."

This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.

The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis, dependent on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in calculus.

Many important representations in Lie theory have finite length and lie in categories of finite length modules. These categories carry a great deal of additional algebraic structure, such as translation functors or a filtered character theory. Professor Irving will study these features and their consequences in greater detail. Any time there are operations that may be undone as well as done, there is a group present. Groups were first studied systematically in the last century, and when the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie showed that group theory applied in a very natural way to the study of differential equations, the strength and significance of group theory became recognized by all mathematicians. The work supported here is a modern continuation of that first pioneering work of Lie."

Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active. This field is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its historical roots. The work of Professor Li is in this tradition, but extends beyond the traditional boundaries of the theory of modular forms in a particularly interdisciplinary thrust."
