The investigator and his collaborators bring to bear a point of view on triangulated categories fashioned in algebraic topology to establish new results on, and unearth surprising connections among, classical invariants of modules over commutative rings. Another aspect of the proposed research concerns derived categories as a whole, and is inspired by recent spectacular developments in the representation theory of finite dimensional algebra, due to Rouquier: extending earlier work of Konstevich, Bondal and Van den Bergh, and others, on derived categories of coherent sheaves, Rouquier settled a long standing question concerning Auslander's representation dimension, and also an important conjecture of Benson concerning modular representations of finite groups. To this end, Rouquier introduced a notion of a dimension for derived categories, and demonstrated its relevance to representation theory and algebraic geometry. A crucial step Rouquier's work is a lower bound on the derived category of the exterior algebra on a vector space over a field of characteristic two, which is an example of a zero-dimensional commutative complete intersection ring.  The project will investigate the dimension of derived categories of general commutative rings, with emphasis on locally complete intersections. This brings in, and contributes to the study of, Hochschild cohomology of commutative algebra.  The results obtained will serve to clarify that relationship between dimension and classical invariants of rings. Techniques developed here would have an impact on developments in representation theory and algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>It has long been recognized that derived categories, which were introduced by Verdier in the mid-sixties and in the context of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, provide a convenient milieu for doing homological algebra. However, it has been realized over the last fifteen years that derived categories, and more generally, triangulated categories, are also exceptionally well-suited for expressing (and proving!) results in diverse subjects in mathematics and mathematical physics.  This has had the effect that methods developed in one field have often profoundly influenced a host of others, and generated new interactions among them. One of the main components of the research outlined in this proposal seeks to exploit a elementary notion arising in algebraic topology, namely, the idea of `building' objects out of a given collections of objects in a triangulated category, and bring them to be bear on problems in commutative algebra. The project promises to have an impact on the study of derived categories in general, and, in particular, on geometry, representation theory, and algebraic topology.<br/>"

The project includes using connections between the representation theories of these different objects to obtain new results. The ordinary representation theory of the symmetric group is closely related to that of the general linear group through classical work of Schur and others. Recently this relationship has been extended to the modular representation theory, and even more recently to the corresponding cohomology. Although this interplay can lead to new results in either direction, it is especially useful in studying the symmetric group, where many of the basic problems remain completely open.  The investigator will continue to refine and improve techniques to exploit this important relationship in order to obtain results in both areas. Recently Parshall and Scott proved that the celebrated Lusztig conjecture, in the case of the general linear group, is equivalent to a problem entirely in the realm of symmetric group representation theory. Meanwhile breakthroughs by Brundan and Kleshchev, Ariki, Grojnowski and others have led to a ``Lie-theoretic"" approach to the symmetric group theory which is very different from the original approach of Gordon James and others. Together these developments suggest the next few years will be very exciting indeed in this field.<br/><br/>This project is in an area of mathematics known as representation theory, in particular the representation theory of finite groups.

LDPC codes come equipped with an iterative message-passing<br/>algorithm which operates on a certain bipartite graph associated to<br/>the code.  The algorithm acts locally on the graph, and this results<br/>in both its greatest strength (low complexity) and its greatest<br/>weakness (nonoptimality).  The PI's focus is on understanding this<br/>weakness.  Because the algorithm acts locally, it cannot distinguish<br/>if it is acting on the graph itself or on some finite unramified cover<br/>of the graph.  This leads to the notion of ""pseudo-codewords"", which<br/>arise from codewords in codes corresponding to the covers and which<br/>compromise the decoder.  Thus to understand the performance of LDPC<br/>codes, we must understand these pseudo-codewords; most of the problems<br/>the PI considers stem from the desire to understand pseudo-codewords<br/>of LDPC codes.  In previous joint work, the PI has given two<br/>characterizations of the pseudo-codewords of an LDPC code: via the<br/>so-called ""fundamental cone"" and via the edge zeta function of a<br/>certain graph attached to the code.  While the fundamental cone<br/>characterization is valid for all LDPC codes, the zeta function<br/>characterization is satisfactory only in the special case of cycle<br/>codes.  The PI will further her study of the fundamental cone and the<br/>development of a zeta function characterization for pseudo-codewords<br/>of general LDPC codes.  Additional targets of study are non-binary<br/>LDPC codes and their pseudo-codewords as well as the connections<br/>between LDPC codes and another class of graph-based codes: turbo<br/>codes.<br/><br/>Whenever information is transmitted across a channel, errors are bound<br/>to occur.  By adding redundancy to the data, many of these errors can<br/>be corrected.  If the information is thought of as strings 0's and 1's<br/>of fixed length, then the codewords are strings of 0's and 1's of<br/>length some longer length, where the difference in lengths represents<br/>the amount of redundancy which was added.  A collection of codewords<br/>is called a code.  A large part of classical coding theory is<br/>concerned with finding the trade-offs between three fundamental<br/>parameters of a code: its length, its number of codewords, and its<br/>minimum Hamming distance, i.e., the minimum number of positions in<br/>which any two distinct codewords differ.  While any code can correct<br/>all errors of weight at most rougly half its minimum distance, most<br/>codes can correct many errors of substantially higher weight.  It is<br/>the goal of modern coding theory to find those representations of<br/>codes that admit decoding algorithms that allow for correction of all<br/>the error patterns that the code can correct --- not only those which<br/>have weight at most roughly half the minimum distance.  One of the<br/>greatest achievements of modern coding theory so far is the discovery<br/>and subsequent development of the class of Low Density Parity Check<br/>(LDPC) codes.  The usefulness of these codes stems from the fact that<br/>they come equipped with a very efficient decoding algorithm which<br/>operates on a certain bipartite graph associated to the code.  The<br/>main goal of this project is to further the understanding of the<br/>theoretical performance of this decoding algorithm, especially through<br/>the study of the so-called ""pseudo-codewords"" which arise from codes<br/>associated to finite covers of the bipartite graph.<br/>"

In particular, he intends to employ the morphic Abel-Jacobi map, defined using Lawson homology, to better understand the group of cycles on a smooth, complex variety that are algebraically equivalent to zero and to better understand the behavior of Griffiths' Abel-Jacobi map on such cycles. (Some of this research may be carried out in collaboration with Andreas Rosenschon.) For example, the PI seeks to use the morphic Abel-Jacobi map to find counter-examples to the so-called ""universality"" of Griffiths' Abel-Jacobi map and to better understand the torsion subgroup of the Chow group.  A related project will employ Lawson homology, morphic cohomology, and the morphic Abel-Jacobi map to better understand the (still hypothetical) category of mixed motives.  The PI will also study cycles on and the K-theory of real algebraic varieties. One goal in this direction is to define and study higher algebraic K-groups for real varieties. These groups ought to be real algebro-geometric invariants, depending only on the set of real points cut out by a system of equations.  Another project concerns developing a morphic cohomology analogue of 1-motives and 2-motives. Finally, the PI, in collaboration with Christian Haesemeyer and Eric Friedlander, hopes to extend the definitions of morphic cohomology and Lawson homology to ground fields other than the real and complex numbers.<br/><br/>An algebraic variety is a geometric object defined by a collection of polynomial equations. For example, one can define a circle using one such equation involving two variables, but, in general, an algebraic variety is given by any number of equations in possibly a great many variables, and the resulting geometric object might not fit inside our usual three-dimensional world. A basic question in algebraic geometry is whether two given systems of polynomials equations actually determine the ""same"" (i.e., isomorphic) algebraic variety. Ideally, one would like a list of invariants that uniquely determine when two varieties are isomorphic, but despite its apparent reasonableness, this goal is completely unrealistic. Rather, one hopes to find invariants that classify broad categories of varieties in some geometrically meaningful way. Algebraic cycles, K-theory, and motivic cohomology are examples of such invariants, and there have been tremendous advances in recent years in our understanding of these fundamental invariants. Perhaps the most famous one is Voevodsky's proof of the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjecture at the prime 2, for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 2002.  For all the recent successes, there is still much we do not understand about these basic invariants, even for smooth, projective complex varieties. The Hodge<br/>conjecture (which is one of the seven Millennium Problems sponsored by the Clay Mathematics Institute) and Bloch's conjecture concerning zero-cycles on surfaces, both of which remain unsolved, are two such examples.  The PI will pursue several research projects aimed at further understanding the fundamental invariants of algebraic varieties, typically focusing on smooth, projective complex varieties. Most of his projects focus on the study of cycles on such<br/>varieties, often by using the relatively new invariants of Lawson homology, morphic cohomology, and the morphic Abel-Jacobi map.<br/>"

First, the Principal Investigator will address a finiteness conjecture of Ih, which asserts that for any dynamical system associated to a rational function over a number field, there are only finitely many preperiodic points which are integral with respect to a fixed non-preperiodic point.  The attack involves proving an analogue, for preperiodic points, of Baker's theorem on linear forms in logarithms.   Second, using a recently-developed Arakelov theory for the Berkovich projective line, P.I. will study the no-wandering domains conjecture for rational maps over nonarchimedean local fields.  Third, the P.I. will investigate pluripotential theory on Berkovich spaces of arbitrary dimension, with the goal of defining a nonarchimedean Monge-Ampere operator and using it to create an adelic arithmetic intersection theory.   In these investigations, the P.I. will collaborate with other members of an emerging group in arithmetic dynamics.  He will also mentor University of Georgia graduate students and recent number theory Ph.D.'s in the southeastern United States.   <br/><br/> This project involves research at the interface of two branches of mathematics, analysis (the study of functions) and dynamics (the study of iteration), with a focus on questions related to number theory.  One of the scientific goals of the project is to prove a general finiteness conjecture for dynamical systems attached to rational functions.  Two important cases of the conjecture, for roots of unity and for torsion points on elliptic curves, were proved under the P.I.'s previous NSF grant.  The planned attack involves generalizing a fundamental arithmetical tool used in the earlier proof, to the context of dynamical systems.  A second goal is to complete the classification of dynamical systems for rational functions defined over p-adic fields, showing that an analogue of the well-known ""no wandering domains"" theorem of Sullivan, proved for rational functions over the complex numbers, holds in the nonarchimedean locally compact case as well.  A third goal is to extend a theory of subharmonic functions on the p-adic projective line, developed by the P.I., to higher-dimensional p-adic varieties.  This will be used to construct an Arakelov theory for higher-dimensional varieties which treats archimedean and nonarchimedean contributions in a parallel, analytical way.  In carrying out this research, the P.I. plans to collaborate extensively with other mathematicians, both junior and senior;  one of the infrastructure goals of the project is to strengthen an emerging interdisciplinary research group focusing on number-theoretic aspects of dynamics.   Another infrastructure goal is to mentor current University of Georgia doctoral students, and to main ties with and encourage graduates of the UGA number theory program who are now teaching at small colleges in the southeastern United States.<br/>"

Such properties include the geometry of the Cayley and, more generally, Schreier graphs, expanding properties, actions on rooted trees and cubic complexes and various finiteness conditions. Further, asymptotic properties of automaton groups are studied. Such properties include growth, amenability, Property T of Kazhdan, spectral properties, L2-cohomology, etc. A special attention is paid to the famous combinatorial problem know as Hanoi Towers Problem. The proposers have devised an algebraic approach to this problem by constructing groups (Hanoi Towers groups) that serve the role of renormalization groups. A complete classification of 3-state automaton groups over a 2-letter alphabet is expected.<br/><br/>The idea of self-similarity is one of the most basic and fruitful ideas <br/>in mathematics of all times and populations. In the last few decades it <br/>established itself as the central notion in areas such as fractal <br/>geometry, dynamical systems, and statistical physics. Recently, mainly <br/>through the work of the proposers and their collaborators, <br/>self-similarity started playing a role in algebra as well, first of all <br/>in group theory. The methods developed in relation to the study of <br/>self-similarity in group theory have been successfully applied in recent years in the solution of many longstanding open problems and conjectures in mathematics (General Burnside problem, Milnor Problem on growth, Day-von Neumann Problem on amenability, Zelmanov Problem on finiteness of width, Atiyah Strong Conjecture, to name a few). The proposed study of automaton groups, which constitute a class of self-similar groups, has unlimited potential for further continuation of this positive trend. In addition to advancements in basic research in several areas of mathematics the proposed research has applications in computer science (expanders are indispensable tool in algorithm de-randomization and reliable network design), coding and information theory (automata can be used to construct codes with extremely good characteristics), and combinatorial game theory (the proposers have modeled some of the most outstanding combinatorial problems by using finite automaton groups).<br/><br/>"

The second project continues previous work on self dual sheaves compatible with the intersection chain sheaves on reductive Borel-Serre compactifications of locally symmetric spaces. The goal is to see if such sheaves exist for compactifications of certain unitary Shimura varieties and to see to what extent these sheaves can be used in analysis of the Lefschetz numbers of Hecke correspondences.

One<br/>important thread in these connections has been algebraic geometry, a very old subject that dates back at least to ancient Greece. Algebraic geometry is a subject in which solutions of many variable polynomial equations are studied as geometric objects. The proposed projects use tools from algebraic geometry to solve problems in noncommutative algebra. In noncommutative algebra, the main objects of study are polynomials in which the xy is not the same as yx. Such noncommutative algebras are of interest to physicists as well. The second project of this proposal is at the intersection of three subjects: number theory (where number systems are studied), representation theory (where symmetries are studied), and topology. In topology those properties of spaces are studied which do not change under elastic deformations such as twisting and stretching. The spaces to be studied in this project encode number theoretic information. These spaces have some natural symmetries. The goal is to investigate fixed points of these symmetries. The last project is at the intersection of combinatorics and algebraic geometry. The goal is to understand the number of ways in which a sphere can be covered by similar geometric objects called algebraic curves with specified restrictions.<br/>"

Quantum uncertainty is always modelled by the mathematical notion of non-commutativity,  which is the idea that AB need not equal BA when A and B are abstract variables.

Rings graded by other groups are less frequently used.<br/>The PI will broaden this algebraic foundation by using rings graded by an arbitrary finitely generated abelian group to solve some problems in non-commutative algebraic geometry and stacks. The PI will use commutative rings graded by an arbitrary finitely generated abelian group as a tool to study stacks that are global quotients by diagonal subgroups of the general linear group.  The ring acts as a homogeneous coordinate ring of the quotient stack and using it as one uses the ordinary homogeneous coordinate ring of a projective scheme allows one to avoid some of the more technical aspects of stacks.<br/>Among the stacks amenable to such an approach are toric stacks, especially weighted projective stacks, and some stacks relevant to parts of string theory. By using such an approach the PI has simpler proofs about the Grothendieck group and Picard group for toric stacks. Within non-commutative projective algebraic geometry the PI will use rings graded by a finitely generated abelian group to extend the range of that subject, to provide new examples, and to simplify some of the methods. Stacks can be viewed as mildly non-commutative spaces and it is important for non-commutative geometry to treat them as such.<br/>Although this is an important part of Connes's non-commutative geometry program (for example, orbifolds) it has not played a role in non-commutative algebraic geometry.<br/>It is anticipated that this algebraic approach to some stacks will make this subject more accessible to non-commutative algebraic geometers and show that stacks are intimately related to their own concerns.<br/>The proposed research builds on previous work of the PI and interacts with the recent research of others working in non-commutative algebraic geometry.<br/><br/><br/>One of the great and grand themes of physics and mathematics is the study of space.<br/>Not outer space, but space itself, the arena in which all activity and inactivity occurs. For over two millennia mathematics and physics have been driven by this quest. There seems no end to it: technological and mathematical advances answer old questions but each new vantage point prompts new questions. Space always proves stranger than imagined.<br/>Our present understanding is still inadequate. One remarkable new idea is non-commutative geometry. Noncommutative geometry reverses the usual roles of algebra and geometry. Traditionally one has a geometric object and taking various measurements on the space produces an algebraic object, a ring of functions on the space. In that tradition the ring is commutative: <br/>the product xy is equal to the product yx. This is because the measurements x and y are numbers and the order in which multiplies two numbers does not affect the answer---we say that x and y commute. However, if x and y are matrices,  not numbers, the order of multiplication matters---xy need not be the same as yx. We then say the algebra is non-commutative. Traditionally the position of n particles in 3-dimensional space is encoded by 3n numbers. <br/>It has been proposed that one might better encode that data  by three n-by-n matrices. When the three matrices commute with one another they can be simultaneously diagonalized and the n diagonal entries in them give the traditional 3n numbers.<br/>But when the matrices do not commute something fundamentally different is obtained, a non-commutative algebra. The goal then is to understand what this non-commutative algebra is telling us about space. The proposed research concerns  the geometric aspects of non-commutative algebra.<br/>It is closely modeled on traditional algebraic geometry, the paradigmatic blending of algebra and geometry,  which has been at the  center of mathematics since ancient times.<br/>"

One example of applications impact is the value of algebraic and combinatorial structures such as Clifford algebras to cross layer design of multiple antenna wireless communication systems. The value of engaging the mathematical sciences community is to realize the promise of multiple antenna systems without exceeding the signal processing complexity of single antenna systems. Another example comes from the emerging area of multiple antenna radar, where the<br/>design of the waveform and the subsequent processing of the return determine the ability of the radar to discriminate targets from clutter, to discriminate closely spaced targets, and to detect small targets in complex scenes.

The conference will feature recent examples where this synergy is present, specifically space-time codes for wireless communication and Clifford algebras, quantum information theory and quantum error correcting codes, radar and sequence design. The evolving applications context helps to define new areas of theory and provides measures for what is considered interesting.

When one has many equations in many unknowns, one can think of the solutions algebraically, by forming an abstract system called a ring in which the equations are forced to hold, or geometrically, as a set that is contained  in a possibly high dimensional space. The latter construction generalizes the notion of graphing an equation.   When one has information about two solution sets, one wants to understand their intersection:  the common solutions of both sets of equations. In particular, its dimension, which represents the number of degrees of freedom one has in choosing a solution, is of great interest. Many of the questions considered can be thought of as follows:  given algebraic information about two solution sets, e.g., special properties of the corresponding rings, what quantitative and qualitative conclusions can one reach about the intersection?  A major focus of the conference will be on very subtle and deep theorems and conjectures in this area.<br/>"

In the theory of overconvergent classical modular forms,  the canonical subgroup of Lubin and Katz (for a p-adic analytic family of elliptic curves) has been an important tool. The recent interest in p-adic modular forms beyond the classical case has motivated several different constructions of canonical subgroups for abelian varieties,<br/>and recent work of the PI has led to another higher-dimensional theory <br/>that, at least in its geometric aspects, has a wider range of applicability than the other approaches. The PI proposes to use deformation-theoretic methods to make explicit certain abstract estimates in the theory, and to draw <br/>arithmetic consequences for p-adic families of automorphic forms.<br/>In another direction,  the PI and co-workers have used methods from <br/>deformation theory and rigid-analytic geometry to develop a theory of a <br/>new global parity obstruction to randomness properties of prime <br/>specialization of inseparable irreducible polynomials over<br/>certain coordinate rings of curves over finite fields.  This has given <br/>rise to families of elliptic curves with unexpected rank behavior<br/>over global function fields (under some standard conjectures) and seems <br/>likely to have further Diophantine applications<br/>to Mordell--Weil ranks for families of abelian varieties over global <br/>function fields. The PI proposes to develop a better<br/>understanding of this basic arithmetic phenomenon and to work out some <br/>further consequences for ranks in families.<br/><br/>Number theory is among the oldest subjects in mathematics, since it is <br/>ultimately concerned with the relatively concrete<br/>problem of studying properties of whole numbers.  Such problems can <br/>take on the form of finding whole number solutions<br/>to systems of equations in many variables, or problems relating to <br/>properties of primes, and so on. Typically one has to bring in some deeper structural information (provided by geometric, algebraic, or analytic ideas) to make progress on such questions, and in the last several decades a very wide range of sophisticated geometric techniques have been developed to attack these problems.  Moreover, though the initial motivation comes from within pure mathematics, security of<br/>electronic telecommunications has come to be related in an essential way to many of these number-theoretic problems (such as<br/>prime factorization and studying points on curves over finite fields) <br/>and the geometric concepts used to attack them.  This proposal focuses<br/>on both geometric and prime factorization questions that arise in <br/>several number-theoretic settings, aiming to develop some<br/>new theoretical methods and to apply them to specific problems.  In <br/>addition, the PI proposes to continue his long-standing tradition of supervising high-level number theory research by talented high school students and giving talks to larger groups of students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.  He will also complete two books that, together with assorted freely available notes already posted on his web site, will provide useful references for graduate students who wish to learn about some fundamental topics in arithmetic geometry.<br/>"

First, in arithmetic geometry, the proposer applies diagonalization techniques to investigate the density of rational points on complete intersections of high dimension, applies the large <br/>sieve inequality to study the Hasse principle in algebraic families of complete intersections, and combines the circle method with descent techniques so as to investigate rational points on varieties of intermediate dimension. On the interface with harmonic analysis, the proposer investigates the Fourier transform of the solution set of polynomial diophantine inequalities in many variables, with intended applications to uniform distribution and polynomial ergodic results. Third, on the interface with additive combinatorics, the proposer seeks to establish a novel version of the <br/>circle method that exploits Gower's quadratic and higher uniformity ideas. In one direction,applications here would impact questions in arithmetic geometry, and in another the proposer seeks quantitative improvements in the work of Gowers and Green-Tao by applying techniques from the modern theory of  the circle method.<br/><br/>This proposal investigates the interface between three areas of mathematics: number theory (and more specifically diophantine problems), harmonic analysis and additive combinatorics. Number Theory studies the properties of integers (``whole numbers''). Since Antiquity, the study of diophantine equations (equations to be solved in integers) has formed a core component of Number Theory, and has recently influenced the development of codes and cryptosystems (applied, for example, in data storage systems such as compact disks and DVDs, communications systems and internet and web-based commerce). Harmonic analysis investigates generalizations of Fourier analysis, which in the larger setting plays a crucial role in electrical engineering and communications.  Additive combinatorics seeks to understand the underlying structure in quite general (and seemingly, therefore, unstructured) sets, particularly as these sets are modified <br/>by arithmetic operations. This proposal applies a fundamental technique known as the circle method to transfer technology between these three areas, both enhancing our knowledge in each area and increasing the scope of the circle method as a basic tool of arithmetic harmonic analysis.<br/>"

Roughly speaking and by analogy with the commutative situation, the category of graded modules modulo torsion over a noncommutative graded ring of quadratic, respectively cubic growth should be thought of as the noncommutative analogue of a projective curve, respectively surface. This intuition has lead to a remarkable number of nontrivial insights and results in noncommutative algebra. Indeed, the problem of classifying noncommutative curves (and noncommutative graded rings of quadratic growth) can be regarded as settled and the motivating theme behind  much of this proposal will be to understand noncommutative surfaces. A large class of these algebras can be classified in terms of the ``naive'' blow-ups developed in collaboration with Keeler and Rogalski. Although these blow-ups are constructed in a manner reminiscent of  commutative blowups, and depend upon geometric data, their structure is quite unlike the classical objects. A major portion of the project will be to further understand these objects and to extend their applications. The other major theme of the project will be in applications of this general theory to specific classes of algebras. A particularly useful technique, here, is to ``complete'' the category of modules over a noncommutative algebra to those over a graded algebra and then to apply noncommutative projective geometry. This has, for example, been used to relate rational Cherednik algebras in type A to Hilbert schemes,  and to Haiman's work on the n! conjecture. The project will continue this research to gain a deeper understanding of these important algebras and their relation to other areas of mathematics, for example to integrable systems and to the study of invariant eigendistributions on symmetric spaces.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, which is one of the oldest areas of modern mathematics, has its origins in the study of polynomial equations; for example a plane curve is the set of solutions of a polynomial equation in two variables. This leads to a rich interplay between that geometric object and the (commutative) algebra of  the associated polynomials. Noncommutative algebra, which is a much younger subject, also has its origins in the theory of equations, in this case matrix equations, and in recent years has become increasingly important in many areas of mathematics (for example the theory of differential equations) and physics (Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a classic illustration, but more subtle non-commutativity occurs, for example,  in string theory). It has become apparent in recent years that there are definite, though often rather subtle, geometric structures hidden in these noncommutative objects and the interplay between the two has led to a rich theory, actually several theories, in their own right. These are collectively called noncommutative geometry.<br/>"

The first project seeks to use the boundary value distributions of automorphic forms to establish analytic properties of Langlands L-functions.  The PI and Schmid have developed an alternative method for proving the holomorphy of Langlands L-functions which bypasses some obstacles existing methods face, and which has resulted in new examples of entire Langlands L-functions (such as the exterior square L-functions on GL(n,Z)\GL(n,R)).  The project involves extending these results to wider families, and generalizing to number fields and nonarchimedean places.  The second project uses results from analytic number theory and representation theory to analyze and create cryptographic schemes, in particular ones related to elliptic curves, isogenies, expander graphs, and modular forms.  <br/><br/>L-functions are a central topic in modern number theory, arising from problems as diverse as classical questions about solving polynomial equations with integer solutions, to studying the properties of waves on curved surfaces.  Langlands' deep functoriality conjectures assert that these L-functions are all connected to automorphic forms, highly symmetric functions on matrix groups. In particular, they predict the L-functions should be analytic on the complex plane.  The proposed research involves establishing more cases of such analytic continuations.  The analyticity, once proven, is then known to imply strong results about the original object.  Such information can be used, as in the second project, to give explicit bounds and parameter estimates for cryptosystems.  In fact, preliminary work of the PI and Venkatesan on the second project has recently been released into security products by the Microsoft Corporation.  Modern cryptosystems are very often based on difficult mathematical topics, such as factoring integers and elliptic curves over finite fields.  The use of analytic number theory and in particular L-functions is typically essential in gaining both concrete and theoretical understanding of their security.  <br/>"

The field explores algorithms and models that arise in<br/>both the study of physical systems and the mathematical structures<br/>arising from the fields of combinatorics and theoretical computer<br/>science, with an emphasis on analogous behavior such as phase<br/>transitions.  The current project seeks to foster and speed the<br/>development of this interdisciplinary field and to bring to it<br/>coherence as well as rapid scientific development.  The project will<br/>be organized around a series of workshops, tutorials, research working<br/>groups, and a visitor program, all intended to facilitate new<br/>interactions.  Workshops allow a cross-fertilization of ideas and<br/>techniques from the disparate disciplines.  Less formal groups of<br/>researchers will convene for concentrated collaborative research on<br/>specialized topics, and additional working groups will evolve during<br/>the project.  Exploration of new areas of application of Discrete Random<br/>Systems will be enhanced by parallel DIMACS programs in Biology,<br/>Epidemiology, the Social Sciences, and Homeland Security. The ideas<br/>developed in this project will have impact on a myriad of fields and<br/>create many new cross-disciplinary connections. A visitor program will<br/>encourage senior and junior researchers, including students, to<br/>participate in collaborative research spawned by the workshops and in<br/>the work of the working groups. Each workshop will have a fund for<br/>support of graduate students and postdocs and workshops will have a<br/>substantial educational component through significant tutorial<br/>components.  The topic lends itself well to undergraduate research and<br/>participating faculty will coordinate topics with an undergraduate<br/>research program (REU program) already in existence.  The project is<br/>expected to have a long-term impact well beyond its two year duration<br/>since the workshop, working group, visitor, and dissemination<br/>components of the project will allow the ideas developed to reach<br/>hundreds of people nationwide and worldwide.  The project should<br/>significantly influence the careers of a large number of outstanding<br/>junior researchers and it should play an important role in the<br/>training and development of scientists who are well-prepared to become<br/>leaders in the field of Discrete Random Systems.<br/>"

Vu<br/><br/>In this proposal, the PI addresses some of the deepest and most<br/>important issues in probabilistic combinatorics, including sharp<br/>concentration inequalities and the semi-random method.  The PI and his<br/>collaborators plan to develop new sharp concentration inequalities and<br/>apply them, together with the powerful semi-random (Rodl nibble) method<br/>to attack several well-known and long standing conjectures in<br/>combinatorics. Among others, the PI will study a series of minimax<br/>problems in finite geometry, raised in the fifties. Another topic is the<br/>study of geometrical properties of random objects. Here is a typical<br/>question: how many points does one need to pierce n random d-dimensional<br/>boxes, where a random box is obtained as the Cartesian product of d<br/>random subintervals of the unit interval ?  The PI  also plans to use<br/>methods from probabilistic combinatorics to attack problems arose from<br/>very practical fields such as coding theory and the study of<br/>""real-world"" graphs. For educational purposes,  he intends to write a<br/>textbook on sharp concentration inequalities and its applications in<br/>combinatorics and theoretical computer science. He also plans to design<br/>and teach a graduate course at UCSD on the probabilistic methods. <br/><br/>In the last twenty years, probability has become one of the most<br/>powerful weapons in discrete mathematics and computer science.  The<br/>first main reason is that randomness helps us to overcome algorithmic<br/>and existence problems which cannot be solved deterministic means. The<br/>second main reason is that many important real-life objects (such as the<br/>internet) can be modeled by a random process.  On the other hand, in<br/>many situations, the problems are so complex that traditional results<br/>from probability theory cannot be applied. The PI plans to develop new<br/>probabilistic tools which would have a break-thought impact on many such<br/>problems, some of them have been open for decades. Among others, these<br/>new tools would help us to design very efficient randomized algorithms,<br/>to prove the existence of interesting objects, and to analyze<br/>complicated processes.

The recent solutions by Klyachko of the eigenvalues of a sum of Hermitian matrices problem and by Knutson and Tao of the saturation and Horn conjectures are of particular relevance to this proposal. Both these problems are associated to the group of invertible n by n matrices. The discovery of quantum cohomology and the quantum Schubert calculus led to the solution of analogous problems for the group of unitary n by n matrices. The PIs P.Belkale, T. Haines, M. Kapovich, S. Kumar and J. Millson propose to attack for a general reductive group G the problems previously solved for the groups of invertible unitary n by n matrices. The history of Lie theory has shown that it is of critical importance to understand in the context of general Lie groups results proved initially for the group of invertible n by n matrices.<br/><br/>A large part of mathematics and physics has been involved with the study of eigenvalues, for example determining the modes of vibration of a violin string or the energy levels of an atom amounts to finding eigenvalues of a Hermitian linear operator. A fundamental problem is to determine the possibilities for the eigenvalues of the sum of two operators given the eigenvalues of each one. Another fundamental problem with its roots in physics is the problem of studying the representations of an abstract group as a group of matrices. This problem in turn has been organized into subproblems. One of the most important of these is the problem of decomposing (tensor) products of representations as sums of representations. The point of this proposal is that these two basic problems, the eigenvalue of the sum problem and the decomposing (tensor) products problem are very closely related. The authors propose to pin down this relationship (already well-understood for special cases) for the general case. This FRG grant will play a fundamental role in the further development of a national group of scientists working on the area common to Lie theory, topology, algebraic and symplectic geometry, combinatorics and the theory of buildings. A class of young mathematicians especially graduate students and postdocs in the mid-Atlantic area (including Washington and Chapel Hill) and the greater (San Francisco) bay area (including Davis) will have the opportunity to learn about and work on exciting and fundamental problems through the Meetings and Workshops envisaged by the PIs. This class already includes the nine graduate students presently advised by the PIs.

Recent applications of secant <br/>varieties in algebraic statistics have brought both new techniques and new <br/>questions to the forefront. <br/><br/>In the undergraduate mathematics curriculum the objects of so-called <br/>""modern"" algebra, groups, rings, fields, and modules, have a reputation <br/>for being very abstract.  Indeed, the names ""modern algebra"" and ""abstract <br/>algebra"" are often used interchangeably.  The power of the abstraction <br/>only becomes evident when one sees how these ideas enable us to discuss an <br/>increasingly large variety of applications in a common framework.  <br/>Computational algebra is an area that is useful to pure mathematicians in <br/>algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.  It is also able to bridge the <br/>divide between abstract algebra and many concrete applications including <br/>integer programming, enumeration problems in statistics, and geometric <br/>modeling.  Sidman's first project connects computational algebra with <br/>algebraic geometry.  The questions she proposes to study related to secant <br/>varieties are also related to algebraic geometry, but were motivated by <br/>work in the emerging field of algebraic statistics.  Thus, the proposed <br/>work reflects the ways in which pure and applied mathematics influence <br/>each other, often in unexpected ways.<br/>"

Prior results have already been applied to generalize Schreier's formula in Galois cohomology and establish connections with the cohomological dimension of pro-p quotients of absolute Galois groups, with Demuskin groups, and with the Elementary Type Conjecture. Undergraduate components, including the continued involvement of undergraduates in research and the offering of MAA minicourses on the teaching of Galois theory to undergraduates, will enhance the national curricular infrastructure. A co-authored text, providing an accessible transition from Kummer theory to Galois module structure, will introduce the subject to a wider audience, treating the structure first of the multiplicative groups of fields modulo a prime and then more generally of Galois cohomology and Milnor K-theory.<br/>The disciplines of algebra and number theory reach back as far back as the Greeks and still offer substantial challenges in understanding the number systems, called fields, used today.  Although the sheer variety and complexity of fields is daunting, their structure can be studied by investigating their rearrangements: the possible ways in which one number in a field may be substituted for another, without altering the conclusions of certain calculations. A startling fact is that from no more than the knowledge of these possible rearrangements, a great deal may be learned about the fields themselves. This point of view, going back less than two centuries, leads today to the search for all logically possible rearrangements of each field. For the discipline of algebra, the completion of this quest is much like the classification of the living world into genera and species, the determination of the periodic table of elements, or even the understanding of all existing genes. Over twenty years ago, some simply stated---but nevertheless fairly mysterious---logical limitations on the structure of fields were conjectured in the last century by Bloch and Kato. Very recent work has established that these limitations do in fact hold, making them something like a regulation manual for the internal operation of fields. As a result, this is an exciting time for field theory, and the eventual consequences will include not only the solution of other problems in mathematics proper but also new perspectives in related disciplines, such as cryptography.<br/>"

The original theorem of Gross and Zagier <br/>expresses the arithmetic intersections of complex multiplication points <br/>on modular curves in terms of Fourier coefficients of a certain <br/>explicit modular form.  Gross and Zagier use this to deduce a  relation between the Neron-Tate heights of Heegner  points on modular Jacobians <br/>and derivatives of L-functions.    Results and conjectures of Borcherds,  Gross-Kudla, Hirzebruch-Zagier, Kudla-Rappoport-Yang, and Zhang suggest that the Gross-Zagier theorem is merely the simplest cases of a much broader theory relating arithmetic intersections of special cycles on Shimura varieties to Fourier coefficients of modular forms.   Such a theory would yield results toward  generalized forms of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, e.g. the  Bloch-Kato conjectures. Toward this end, the principal investigator is studying <br/>two generalized forms of the Gross-Zagier theorem.  The first project <br/>is to extend the original Gross-Zagier theorem to include intersections <br/>of special points on modular curves with additional level structure.  <br/>Such a result would yield new cases of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer <br/>conjecture for abelian varieties attached to modular forms with nontrivial nebentype.  The second project is a part of a vast series of conjectures of Kudla concerning the arithmetic intersections of special cycles on Shimura varieties of orthogonal type.  The case of interest to the principal investigator involves the computation of  intersection multiplicities on a class of Shimura surfaces which includes the classical Hilbert modular surfaces, and the comparison of these intersection multiplicities with Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms.<br/><br/>In the field of arithmetic geometry certain there are certain curves, <br/>surfaces, and higher dimension analogs which play a central role.  <br/>These objects are called Shimura varieties, and are interesting at <br/>least in part because they encode arithmetic information (i.e. properties of the integers and rational numbers) in a geometric form.  These Shimura varieties contain inside them many interesting objects of lower dimensions.  For example the one-dimensional Shimura varieties come equipped with a family of special points, the two-dimensional Shimura varieties come equipped with both special points and special curves on the surface, three-dimensional Shimura varieties have special points, curves, and surfaces inside them, and so on.  One way in which the geometry of these objects encodes arithmetic information is through ntersection theory.  If, for example, one takes a Shimura surface and two special curves lying on the surface, then one may simply count the number of times that the two curves intersect one another.  Work of Hirzebruch and Zagier, dating back to the 1970's, shows that these <br/>geometrically defined intersection numbers agree with sequences of <br/>numbers arising in arithmetic.  This connection between geometry and <br/>arithmetic was later exploited by Gross and Zagier to prove fundamental <br/>results about elliptic curves, objects of great importance both in pure <br/>math (e.g. to the proof of Fermat's last theorem) and in cryptography.  <br/>The principal investigator is working to extend some of the theory to <br/>higher dimensions by computing the intersection numbers of a surface <br/>with a family of curves, all inside of a three-dimensional Shimura variety, and comparing these with numbers arising from arithmetic.  The principal investigator expects that this will lead to proofs of special cases of some long-standing and important conjectures in number theory.<br/>"

Its principal aim is to develop the complex hyperbolic geometry  of the moduli space of cubic threefolds, and the locally symmetric geometry of the moduli space of cubic fourfolds.  It will also develop the geometry of the moduli space of the corresponding real cubic hypersurfaces, which is assembled from real hyperbolic pieces in the case of threefolds, and of products of real hyperbolic pieces in the case of fourfolds.   This geometry arises from suitable period maps, and its complete understanding  involves a quite detailed study of singularities and a deeper understanding of the discriminant.  It  is thus expected to bring new insights into singularity theory, as well as into the theory of discrete groups.   For the case of cubic curves, the study of the geometry of the moduli space has been a central area of mathematics, with many applications and ramifications.  For cubic surfaces this geometry has been developed recently, both in the complex and the real domains,  by the investigators and Allcock.  Applications of this geometry to arithmetic questions and to representations of discrete groups acting on non-positively curved spaces look very promising and will be developed in this project. <br/><br/>This general area of research concerns the study of spaces known as moduli spaces.  The central  idea is that a collection of geometric objects is itself a new entity with its own geometry.  This new entity is called the moduli space of the original objects.  There is a rich interplay between the geometry of the original objects and the geometry of the moduli space, for example the symmetries of one reflect themselves in the symmetries of the other.  The simplest example would be the shapes of triangles in the plane: each shape is determined by the ratios of the sides, the moduli space is the collection of these ratios, a triangle in the plane with its own geometry.  This example in essence describes a very classical and central object, the moduli space of cubic curves, which, historically, has been the most important moduli space.    The relation is that cubic curves are topologically tori, and tori are built by doubling triangles in the plane.  The thrust of the present project is to develop the geometry of moduli of higher dimensional objects defined by cubic equations.  The reason for studying cubic equations is that it is the lowest degree where the shapes of their solutions can vary continuously.  Their moduli spaces are known in some cases to have a very special geometry (technically called locally symmetric, in some cases hyperbolic).  It seems that this should be true through dimension four.  The reasons for the presence of this  special geometry of the moduli of solutions of cubic equations are not as transparent in higher dimensions as  they are in the case of cubic curves.  This makes their study more difficult, but in the long term it is expected to have many interesting applications."

Besides these discrete<br/>groups, there are a number of other important groups involved, like the<br/>fundamental groups of hyperplane complements, and certain quotients of<br/>these fundamental groups (perhaps including the monster).<br/><br/>The study of symmetry is called group theory; a group is the collection<br/>of all self-transformations of a picture, pattern, etc., that leave the picture, pattern, etc. alone.  The focus is on the transformation, for example, the act of rotating a picture around a<br/>point in the plane.  If the picture looks exactly the same before and after the rotation, then it has rotational symmetry.  To emphasize this point of view we say that the group ""acts"" on the picture.  There are lots of different sorts of objects with group actions, including some<br/>that are difficult of visualize but are still very important in physics and mathematics.  One of these difficult-to-visualize objects is called<br/>complex hyperbolic space, and the possible ways that groups can act on<br/>complex hyperbolic space have been studied by many mathematicians since<br/>the 19th century.

The first problem is to better understand the distribution of values of the local and global Mahler measure of polynomials with coefficients restricted to either algebraic number fields or their completions.  The main technical tool used to accomplish this is to study the Mellin transform of the distribution function associated to Mahler's measure.  Then Mellin inversion techniques from analysis are used to obtain estimates or explicit<br/>formulas for the distribution functions.  A further aspect of the research is to interpret the results in terms of the heights of algebraic numbers.  The second problem is to consider the Wronskian of a collection of linearly independent polynomials with coefficients in an algebraic number field or the completion of such a<br/>field.  We seek an inequality which relates the local and global Mahler <br/>measures of the Wronskian with the local and global Mahler measures of the original set of linearly independent polynomials.  This is well understood for two polynomials, but only approximate results are known for a  collection of three or more polynomials.  Again<br/>there is an interpretation in terms of the heights of the roots of the <br/>polynomials, and this turns out to be related to the ABC-inequality of Stothers and Mason.  A further aspect of this research is to work out applications to certain Diophantine problems.<br/><br/>A Diophantine equation is an equation to be solved in integers.  The study of such equations is one of the oldest parts of number theory and continues to attract some of the best mathematical researchers.  The tools developed in modern mathematics to study Diophantine equations can be extremely technical, and often involve related issues that can be described under the general title of ""Diophantine problems"". For example, one might study inequalities to be solved in integers, or to be solved in polynomials with integer coefficients.  The research considered in this proposal is directed at exactly such Diophantine inequalities for polynomials.  In all fields of science there is generally a great intellectual distance between the highly technical efforts of pure researchers and the eventual applications to business, technology or engineering.  We do know that the area of Diophantine problems has important applications to computer problems, to the construction of encryption systems, and to other technological questions.  A solution to the problems contemplated in this proposal would further our understanding of pure mathematical questions which belong to this important field.  Also, this proposal will fund the research of several graduate students at the University of Texas.  These students will benefit from the opportunity to concentrate on the research efforts, to travel and talk about their work at scientific meetings, and to consult with other researchers working on related problems. A further important goal of this work is the completion of a monograph written by the PI with the title ``Heights, Mahler measure and Diophantine inequalities"".  Over a period of many years the PI has written notes for graduate students in classes on this topic that the PI has taught at the University of Texas.  These notes will be collected, edited and somewhat expanded into a monograph.<br/>"

One such system, using the so--called braid group, was developed in part by Michael Anshel (a member of the City College of New York Computer Science Department and CAISS, the Center for Algorithms and Scientific Software, a research center at CCNY), in 1999, and can be viewed as a group--theoretic analogue of the famous key-exchange idea of Diffie--Hellman. Today, as already indicated, a great deal of research is being carried out in this general area of group theory and cryptography. The Graduate Center of the City University of New York hosts  the famous New York Group Theory Seminar, where current research in group theory is discussed on a weekly basis. There is also now a seminar devoted to cryptography at the Graduate Center and the Stephens Institute in Hoboken has a team of researchers working in part on cryptography. So a conference at this time in this general area seems particularly appropriate and important.<br/><br/>One tends to marvel at the intricate patterns that one sees in the tiled floors of St. Marks cathedral in Venice and the remarkable symmetry of everyday crystals. Such symmetry also arises in the study of elementary particles and also in knot theory, which surprisingly arises in physics. They also play a part in efforts to understand the intricacies of the three--dimensional world that we live in. There is an algebraic structure known as a group which captures the notion of symmetry in a highly sophisticated way, allowing for the classification of different types of crystals and provides a means for studying and describing the minute particles which make up the material of everyday life.<br/>These groups can encode in a remarkably simple way, a huge amount, indeed an infinite amount, of information. Such encodings are often hard to decode and so are extremely promising tools in obtaining secure new ways for hiding and transmitting information.<br/>Thus they offer novel means for safe electronic communication.<br/>With the birth of the internet and the explosion of commerce over the net, secure transmission of information is now a critical aspect of today's world. The proposed conference will be devoted to bringing some of the ideas involved to the wider mathematical community in the hope that it will lead to broader understanding and application of them.<br/>"

Cryptographic protocols have become a key element of information systems, protecting data and communications to ensure confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of data. While most symmetric key systems have relatively modest mathematical requirements, asymmetric or public key cryptosystems have become increasingly mathematically sophisticated, and, in particular, the emerging ``non-commutative cryptography"" exploits various properties of non-commutative infinite groups in very non-trivial ways.

For example<br/>one expects that the best solutions of technical problems are symmetric (an archetypical<br/>example here is the wheel -- highly symmetric shape that is so useful in our everyday<br/>life). On a deeper level it is expected that all the physical laws should be symmetric with<br/>respect to a change of point of view and this appears to be the guiding principle of<br/>many modern physical theories (starting with Einstein's Relativity Theory). It is quite a<br/>nontrivial problem to express the idea of symmetry in mathematical terms; but we<br/>have a great progress in this direction. Actually there are at least three levels of abstraction<br/>in the solution of this problem: groups, Hopf algebras, tensor categories. The first part<br/>of this project is related with highest level of abstraction in this list, that is with tensor<br/>categories. Despite of this high level of abstraction the theory is useful in the applications:<br/>in physics the language of tensor categories is used in theoretical study of phase<br/>transitions and surface phenomena (and this is important if we want to produce more<br/>efficient computers); on the other hand the tensor categories are used in computer<br/>science as a working tool for the constructing of the ""quantum computer"", a new<br/>conceptual approach to the computer architecture. So one expects that the study of<br/>tensor categories would be useful in the development of modern technologies.<br/>Thus it is suggested to study the tensor categories<br/>focusing on the construction of new interesting examples<br/>and the solution of classification problems.<br/>The second part of the project is devoted to the representation theory. One can think<br/>about representation theory as about the study how a symmetry can be realized in<br/>mathematical equations. Thus for a given symmetry (which is described by group,<br/>Hopf algebra etc) representation theory aims to describe all the ways this symmetry<br/>can show up in mathematical models. In the second part of the proposal it is suggested to<br/>study certain questions of representation theory of groups using insights<br/>from the theory of tensor categories (thus we would like to employ symmetry<br/>for studying symmetry and this is indeed one of the guiding principles of the theory).<br/><br/>More technically, in the first part of the projectit is suggested to find new examples<br/>of fusion (= semisimple tensor) categories by studying fusion categories graded by<br/>finite groups and by constructing new examples of module categories (then dual<br/>categories will provide new examples of tensor categories).

A precise relation between topological string amplitudes (or Gromov-Witten invariants) of the Calabi-Witten computations were performed and found to be in complete agreement with the conjecture.  It is proposed to provide the foundations of this new theory and greatly expand on these new connections between geometry and string theory, in the process enriching both fields.  <br/><br/>In the past few years a deep connection has been found between microscopic constituents of black holes and cycles with minimal volume inside manifolds.  This connects puzzles of black holes to many mathematically interesting questions, including special Lagrangian submanifolds, holomorphic curves, etc.  These are broadly known as topological strings.  The project is an attempt to more deeply understand the link between topological strings and black holes. This will very likely have important ramifications both for physics and mathematics.

One such object, the partition function, is particularly simple to define: it counts the number of ways to write a positive integer as a sum of smaller positive integers. However, as is often the case in number theory, many of the natural questions on the arithmetic of the partition function have proved to be rather difficult.  Major advances in our understanding of this function rely on sophisticated modern techniques in modular forms, such as those suggested by the proposed research.<br/>"

By studying the Rees product of two very simple posets,  the PI and John Shareshian have discovered some remarkable enumerative and algebraic identities.

In Part 4,  the PI proposes to obtain a k-analog of a well-known relationship between the homology of the partition lattice and the homology of the complex of  graphs that are not connected.

The recent solutions by Klyachko of the eigenvalues of a sum of Hermitian matrices problem and by Knutson and Tao of the saturation and Horn conjectures are of particular relevance to this proposal. Both these problems are associated to the group of invertible n by n matrices. The discovery of quantum cohomology and the quantum Schubert calculus led to the solution of analogous problems for the group of unitary n by n matrices. The PIs P.Belkale, T. Haines, M. Kapovich, S. Kumar and J. Millson propose to attack for a general reductive group G the problems previously solved for the groups of invertible unitary n by n matrices. The history of Lie theory has shown that it is of critical importance to understand in the context of general Lie groups results proved initially for the group of invertible n by n matrices.<br/><br/>A large part of mathematics and physics has been involved with the study of eigenvalues, for example determining the modes of vibration of a violin string or the energy levels of an atom amounts to finding eigenvalues of a Hermitian linear operator. A fundamental problem is to determine the possibilities for the eigenvalues of the sum of two operators given the eigenvalues of each one. Another fundamental problem with its roots in physics is the problem of studying the representations of an abstract group as a group of matrices. This problem in turn has been organized into subproblems. One of the most important of these is the problem of decomposing (tensor) products of representations as sums of representations. The point of this proposal is that these two basic problems, the eigenvalue of the sum problem and the decomposing (tensor) products problem are very closely related. The authors propose to pin down this relationship (already well-understood for special cases) for the general case. This FRG grant will play a fundamental role in the further development of a national group of scientists working on the area common to Lie theory, topology, algebraic and symplectic geometry, combinatorics and the theory of buildings. A class of young mathematicians especially graduate students and postdocs in the mid-Atlantic area (including Washington and Chapel Hill) and the greater (San Francisco) bay area (including Davis) will have the opportunity to learn about and work on exciting and fundamental problems through the Meetings and Workshops envisaged by the PIs. This class already includes the nine graduate students presently advised by the PIs. We expect to include other graduate students and postdocs associated to the very strong programs in representation theory and geometry at the University of Maryland, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California at Davis.

Meanwhile, with the goal of making it easier for graduate<br/>students and newcomers to work on these problems, de jong intends to run a<br/>web-site where collaborative development of introductory texts on the<br/>topics is done.<br/><br/>The area of mathematics that this proposal finds itself in has seen a<br/>lot of progress in the last decade. Nonetheless there are many<br/>important problems outstanding. Perhaps the most exiting of these is<br/>Artin's conjecture mentioned above. Among other things it implies the<br/>Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for elliptic curves over function<br/>fields of curves over finite fields. An example of such a field is the<br/>field of rational functions in one variable over a finite field. Many<br/>famous classical number theoretical questions have their analogue for<br/>such function fields, and a number of these, such as the Riemann<br/>Hypothesis, have been shown to be true in the function field case. The<br/>reason for this is that people can study curves and more generally do<br/>algebraic geometry over finite fields, to prove the conjectures. In<br/>this project we will study geometric approaches to Artin's conjecture,<br/>for example by thinking about moduli of vector bundles over curves and<br/>surfaces over finite fields."

Two theories which have proved to be particularly well-suited<br/>to study such questions are the spectral theory of automorphic forms,<br/>which is closely related to the theory of L-functions, and the theory <br/><br/>of dynamical systems, particularly the study of unipotent and more<br/>general flows on these homogeneous spaces.

The problem of scheduling two real sequences so as to minimize their maximum pairwise sum leads to a preorder on sequences, called the ``worm order.''  Remarkably, for any submodular function on a finite distributive lattice, there is a maximal chain whose function values are minimum in the worm order relative to all paths from 0 to 1 in the lattice.  One consequence is explicit representation of the theta function for a form of coordinate percolation, in which random reals are assigned to axis points on the plane grid, and grid points inherit the sum of the two reals assigned to their coordinates.  Points whose value exceeds some bound are deleted, and the theta function measures the probability that one can walk to infinity on what remains of the grid.<br/><br/>The proposed line of research aims to better understand percolation, originally a model for physical processes such as water seeping through a porous material.  However, a variety of additional applications arise when a complex process must be scheduled, and the issue is whether backward steps are needed. For example, if the components of a computer system must be upgraded, is it possible that a temporary downgrade will be needed at some point to keep things running smoothly?  If a line of searchers are sweeping a forest in search of a lost child, can they do so without covering any area more than once?  The proposed work will identify conditions under which one can guarantee that, if the process can be accomplished at all, then it can be done without retreating.<br/><br/>"

As<br/>with other great mathematical ideas, it turned out there are many<br/>other reasons for studying motives. The most spectacular recent<br/>success of the idea of motives was Voevodsky's proof of the Milnor<br/>conjecture for which he received the Fields medal in 2002. There<br/>have been several other important applications of motives to problems<br/>in algebraic geometry and, as a language, the theory has a much<br/>broader impact reaching into algebraic number theory and representation<br/>theory via the Langland's program. Furthermore, recent developments<br/>indicate connections between motives, periods, and physics. The<br/>proposed conference intends to bring together researchers from<br/>different areas that use motives. To our knowledge, this is the<br/>first conference of this kind.<br/><br/><br/>The theory of motives provides a framework that has proved to be a<br/>fundamental tool in clarifying and explaining some of the most<br/>difficult unsolved problems in algebraic geometry and mathematical<br/>physics. In recent years there has been dramatic progress in this<br/>direction and motives have evolved from a largely conjectural theory<br/>to a theory that is concrete enough to provide a tool for answering<br/>problems. The proposed conference intends to have leading experts<br/>speak on their various areas of research emphasizing the connections<br/>between different fields. The immense progress in the study of motives<br/>and the many interactions of this theory with other branches of<br/>mathematics has led to a certain degree of inaccessibility, especially<br/>for graduate students and non-specialists. We intend to bridge these<br/>gaps by having a number of distinguished speakers give survey talks<br/>on different subjects.

The first aim is the study of the representation theory of the real quantum group. The quantization of the theory of real (algebraic) reductive groups is a new and important subject. The project proposes using quantum D-modules to study quantum Harish-Chandra modules thus making the classification an accessible task. The classical theory of Harish-Chandra modules might benefit from this study of its deformations. The second aim is to give a geometric proof of Lusztig`s conjectures concerning characters of nonrestricted representations of reductive Lie algebras in positive characteristic. The proof will use quantum differential operators on the quantum flag variety at a root of unity. Lusztig`s conjectures are only proven for the restricted case by a very computational method. The project proposes to give a proof for the general case of these conjectures using the geometry of the Springer resolution. The project also suggests showing the equivalence of the category of representations of the nonrestricted quantum group at a root of unity and the category of representations of the affine Lie algebra at the critical level by connecting both categories to the Springer resolution. The third aim is to give a geometric construction of the double affine Hecke algebra and to prove a quantum version of the twisted Harish-Chandra homomorphism. This should help study the representation theory of this algebra at a root of unity and connect it to the representation theory of the trigonometric Cherednik algebra in positive characteristic.<br/><br/><br/> This project lies in the meeting point of representation theory, noncommutative algebraic geometry, geometry in positive characteristic, infinite dimensional geometry and conformal field theory. It will hopefully help clarify the close relations between loop space geometry and noncommutative geometry that is observed in string theory and will open new pathways for research. The methods it offers to use should be useful in other cases as well, making noncommutative geometry an important tool in representation theory and in algebraic geometry. <br/>"

The basic algebraic structure underlying these questions is the algebra of quasisymmetric functions, which generalizes the classical algebra of symmetric functions.  Early results have shown that a generalization of a fundamental enumerative invariant for counting faces in convex polytopes - the cd-index - also provides a convenient way of representing the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of a Bruhat interval in terms of classical polynomials arising in the enumeration of lattice paths.  A focus of the project is to study the behavior of this generalized cd-index over the class of Bruhat intervals.  An unrelated area of interest is the geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees.  A goal here is to determine an efficient scheme to compute distances between trees in this space. <br/><br/>The study of the basic properties of polyhedra has been with us since the Greeks.  One fundamental question, studied for hundreds of years, has to do with the relationship between the numbers of sides, edges and corners in such an object.  Similar questions exist for high-dimensional analogs of polyhedra, which occur naturally in the analysis of methods to solve optimization problems arising in diverse areas such as resource allocation, industrial production and the design of communication networks.  This project is focusing on techniques to analyze these counting problems.  Recently it has been shown that these techniques are also useful in the study of fundamental properties of objects arising in the study of symmetry, for example, in theoretical physics.  An unrelated direction is the study of phylogenetic trees, which are of basic interest in evolutionary biology.  Here the aim is to develop methods to compute the distance between two such trees, a basic step in recently developed techniques to apply statistical methods to the profusion of tree data now being derived from the study of the structure of DNA in various species.

Mirror Symmetry,<br/>Quantum Cohomology and Gromov-Witten theory lie at the heart of<br/>the intersection of contemporary geometry and theoretical<br/>physics. Great strides have recently been made in our<br/>understanding of these subjects, including a complete<br/>determination of the Gromov-Witten theory (and Donaldson-Thomas<br/>theory) of local curves, and of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and<br/>new proofs of Witten's conjecture; announced results include the<br/>computation of the quantum cohomology of certain Hilbert schemes<br/>of basic importance, and a construction of the Equivariant<br/>Vertex, determining the Gromov-Witten theory of all toric<br/>threefolds. A number of important conjectures drive the field,<br/>including Chern-Simons/Gromov-Witten duality, the<br/>Donaldson-Thomas/Gromov-Witten correspondence, and the Crepant<br/>Resolution Conjecture. The speakers at this symposium will<br/>announce accomplishments and also discuss new directions of<br/>research. Specifically, Jim Bryan will discuss Topological<br/>Quantum Field Theories, Robin Wilson will discuss knots and<br/>three-manifolds, and Vincent Bouchard will discuss the Standard<br/>Model of particle physics, and its relation to geometry.<br/><br/>This symposium will enable and encourage students and other<br/>scientists to pursue research in areas related to the interaction<br/>of theoretical physics and mathematics, provide the opportunity<br/>for scientists to interact and foster collaboration and new<br/>research, and disseminate knowledge to a wide and extraordinarily<br/>diverse audience.  While the reasons for organizing a scientific<br/>symposium on geometry and theoretical physics are many, there is<br/>additionally an acute need to do so for an audience of<br/>underrepresented minorities. There is at this time significant<br/>underrepresentation of minorities in the mathematical sciences;<br/>this underrepresentation is evidently severe in Gromov-Witten<br/>theory and other fields relating to the interactions of geometry<br/>and physics. There are very important questions that need to be<br/>addressed in Gromov-Witten theory, and it is necessary to attract<br/>a broad and diverse audience to work on these<br/>problems. Gromov-Witten theory and related fields have been<br/>extremely successful in solving outstanding problems, some over<br/>100 years old, in several branches of mathematics and physics. It<br/>is predicted that underrepresented minorities will become the<br/>majority of United States Citizens; as such, it is in the long<br/>term interest of geometry and physics to have increased<br/>participation from members of these groups.  Moreover, given the<br/>importance of geometry and theoretical physics to mathematics and<br/>science in general, it is in our National interest to work<br/>against the underrepresentation of minorities conducting research<br/>in these fields.  This symposium has been approved and scheduled<br/>by SACNAS. In addition, funding has been secured from SACNAS to<br/>cover the speakers' and organizers' travel, lodging and<br/>conference registration fees.

While most symmetric key systems have relatively modest mathematical requirements, asymmetric or public key systems, as well as cryptographic protocols, have become increasingly mathematically sophisticated. Such systems rely for their security on the difficulty of specific mathematical problems such as integer factorization and the modular discrete logarithm problem. No rigorous mathematical proof of security has ever been given for any of these systems.  The difficulty of these problems is usually established anecdotally through frequent and unsuccessful attempts by specialists to provide computationally efficient solutions to them.  Indeed, several problems thought to be very difficult have recently been shown to be less intractable than previously believed.  Furthermore, the possibility of quantum computing becoming practical would change this picture dramatically. If realized, most of the problems on which the security of public key cryptosystems rely drop from exponential complexity to polynomial, rendering currently deployed cryptographic systems useless.  While the likelihood of this occurring in the short term is remote, this is an exciting area of research which may well lead to revolutionary advances in computation and secure information communication. This special meeting will attempt to make progress on these and other related problems.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The program will take place at the Fields Institute, which will mount an intensive program on Cryptography during the period June - December 2006.  This program will engage and stimulate interaction between the cryptographic and mathematical communities. NSF funding will enable young U.S. researchers to participate in this program, and in doing so it will expose young researchers to a wide range of problems at the interface between mathematics and cryptographic applications. It will increase the degree of collaboration between cryptographers and theoreticians in attacking the important problems at the boundaries between the fields, and will impact on both cryptographic theory and practice.<br/>"

The expected results will have applications to other fields, such as geometric number theory, integer programming (via Groebner bases of binomial ideals) and, potentially, physical sciences (algebraic structure of physical units). The first group of problems concerns the Hilbert bases of polyhedral cones - distinguished lattice point configurations in discrete geometry for which no satisfactory geometric characterization is known to date. Very concrete working conjectures are made on Caratheodory ranks in higher dimensions, an effective uniform version of Knudsen-Mumford's result on unimodular triangulations, and point configurations with extremal arithmetic properties. Despite much effort in recent years the current state of the art is that positive results are very difficult to obtain as the dimension of the space increases, and in higher dimensions only a few striking counterexamples are known. Verification of the proposed conjectures would shed much light on the global picture. The second group of problems is more related to algebraic geometry. The problems concern sophisticated homological and high K-theoretical aspects of lattice point configurations, such as Koszul property of projective embeddings of smooth toric varieties and K-homotopy invariance of toric singularities. Related algorithmic issues include analysis of smooth polytopes and factorization of invertible matrices over monomial algebras. The project also aims at a deeper understanding of the category of polytopes (mapping, tensor and cofiber objects).<br/><br/>Combinatorics is the science of organizing, arranging and analyzing discrete data. An illustrative example is the set of integer points in a convex polygon in the plane or in a convex polytope in the space. Algebraic combinatorics studies such point configurations to encode important constructions in algebra, geometry, and topology, while combinatorial methods are well suited for related computations. The interaction of combinatorics and abstract mathematical techniques (which is the leitmotif of this research) over the last two decades has resulted in a number of fundamental theorems in a variety of disciplines. Applications range from algebraic geometry (the science of solution sets to systems of multidimensional polynomial equations) to integer programming, computer science, probability theory, physics, cryptography etc. The progress would have been unimaginable without computer assisted investigation and experimentation, the increasing importance of which is related to the demand for explicit or algorithmic understanding of discrete structures. The latter aspect makes the project especially well suited for engaging beginning graduate students in the research.<br/>"

A published proceedings of Ord06/UF is planned.<br/><br/> For as long as there has been academic training of <br/>mathematicians, research and instruction have sought to abstract <br/>as a means towards understanding of the concrete and the particular. <br/>Thus, the arithmetical properties of numbers became abstracted to <br/>the theory of groups and rings, these being algebraic constructs <br/>invented to ``explain'' why the real numbers, for example, behave <br/>the way they do. Another school of researchers seized upon the <br/>geometric notion of distance between numbers or points in space to <br/>develop the abstract concept of a topological space, which establishes<br/>a sense of proximity without measurement of distance. In both of these <br/>generalizations the aim has consistently been to capture a greater <br/>catalogue of phenomena by the act of abstraction, and not to create <br/>an esoteric replica of the instance that prompted the abstraction. <br/>In this spirit the Ordered Algebraic Structurist has taken the <br/>natural ordering of real numbers, together with its arithmetical <br/>and topological aspects, and developed the lattice-ordered group <br/>and ring. The contributors to Ord06/UF, broadly, have in common <br/>an interest in how a lattice-ordered group may best be described by <br/>functions which take on most of their values in the real numbers, and <br/>in which features of the construct are carried over to the algebra of <br/>functions. In this tracking of properties, topological spaces and <br/>their generalization to frames have increasingly played an important <br/>role. The notion of an algebraic frame, in particular, has a dual <br/>identity, enabling one to simultaneously capture topological and <br/>arithmetical properties, and, moreover, how one set of properties <br/>influences the other.<br/>"

In addition to the lectures, the conference will consist of student projects, group discussions, question and answer times, problem sessions and workshop periods. The objective of the summer school is to educate graduate students and faculty about the most recent developments in computational number theory and mathematical cryptography. The summer school will provide participants a cutting-edge survey of computational number theory and the consequences in modern day cryptography.  Topics to be covered include: Primality and Integer Factorization, Arithmetic of Algebraic Number Fields and Algebraic Function Fields, the Discrete Logarithm Problem and related algorithms, Public Key Cryptography, Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography, Pairings, and Multivariate Cryptography. Plenary lecturers include Eric Bach, Dan Bernstein,  Renate Scheidler, Joseph H. Silverman, and Hugh C. Williams.<br/><br/>The impact of the program and further goals are to enhance the general population's understanding  of the important role that mathematics  plays in their lives through information security in practice, and to help middle school and high school teachers develop lessons for their classrooms. This will help students begin to understand and enjoy some of the basic mathematical and computational issues that arise in cryptography.

In particular the categorical quotient reduces to a point. One way to go around this difficulty is to shift focus from the study of invariant functions to the study of the ``non-effective descent data'' for the equivalence relation.<br/> Stack theory and non-commutative geometry are both examples of this strategy. In previous work, the PI proposed a rather different approach. The idea is to enlarge the repertoire of functions of algebraic geometry by adjoining a ``Fermat quotient operator''; the new  functions in the repertoire<br/>(which should be viewed as arithmetic analogues  of non-linear differential operators) turn out to be sufficiently flexible to sometimes provide interesting invariants. The new resulting geometry can be referred to as arithmetic differential geometry. This is a commutative geometry and  can be viewed as an arithmetic analogue of the Ritt-Kolchin differential algebraic geometry. There is an arithmetic differential geometry for each prime number. The main conjecture proposed by the PI is that if one is given an algebraic curve over a number field and a correspondence on it  satisfying a certain natural density condition then the categorical quotient of the curve by  the correspondence is non-trivial in arithmetic differential geometry for almost all primes  if, and only if, over the complex numbers, the correspondence admits a ``complex analytic uniformization''. One can complement the conjecture above by predicting that in most cases the corresponding quotient spaces are ``rational''. Previous work of the PI led to confirmation of the conjecture in a number of basic examples. The present research project proposes to continue the work on this conjecture, to extend this work to the higher dimensional case and to the ``partial differential case"", and to exploit the interactions of this theory with other theories.<br/> <br/>The construction of quotient spaces is a central problem in geometry. There are natural situations when quotients, in a given geometry, exhibit fundamental pathologies. This prompts one to<br/>seek extensions of classical geometries where the quotient pathologies can be avoided. The proposal puts forward a  new extension of algebraic geometry which seems well suited to treat<br/>pathologies arising from arithmetical problems.<br/>"

Zeros near the central point in families of L-functions are well modeled by scaling limits of <br/>eigenvalues near 1 of a classical compact group. For elliptic curves the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture relates zeros at the central point to the size of the group of rational solutions. Thus one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank over Q(T) should provide an accessible <br/>laboratory for investigating the effect of multiple zeros. In addition to studying special families of L-functions (with emphasis on how zeros of the twist of two families of L-functions and families of L-functions with high vanishing at the central point behave), the research will include <br/>developing random matrix theory models for ensembles with high multiplicity eigenvalues, as well as writing computer programs and algorithms for numerical investigations. This will be accomplished by analyzing Legendre sums related to elliptic curves (for by the explicit formula sums over zeros of an L-function are related to sums over primes of its coefficients), analysis of the Satake parameters of Rankin-Selberg convolutions, and developing combinatorial formulas to handle the random <br/>matrix theory calculations. As conjectures on the behavior of zeros are related to standard conjectures in number theory, this work provides an opportunity to test such claims (for example, the dependence of the error term on the residue class for primes in arithmetic progression). Finally, <br/>Professor Miller and A. Kontorovich recently proved that values of L-functions near the critical line, values of characteristic polynomials of random matrix ensembles and iterates of the 3x+1 map satisfy Benford's law for digit bias. These connections will be further explored in additional systems of number theoretic interest.<br/><br/>Zeros of L-functions have been related to arithmetic problems since Riemann; standard conjectures on their distribution imply numerous results in number theory, with applications ranging from optimal error terms in counting primes to constructing efficient algorithms in cryptography. In <br/>the last few decades connections have been observed with high energy nuclear physics and random matrix theory as well. Thus investigations in one of these topics can be fruitfully used in the others. Studying digit bias in number theoretic and dynamic systems highlights key features of <br/>these problems, and is another example where different systems behave similarly. Deriving techniques to detect and understand digit bias have enormous applications; such methods have been used to test for data integrity. Many of these projects have components that are amenable to <br/>numerical experimentation; these and tractable special cases will be investigated in conjunction with undergraduate research assistants.<br/>"

Among the topics expected to be covered are quiver varieties and their role in representation theory;  representations of groups over local fields and fields of positive characteristics; quantum groups; and character sheaves.<br/><br/>Representation theory can be thought of as a natural extension of linear algebra.  A representation of an algebraic object is a collection of matrices (possibly infinite dimensional) which encode properties of the algebraic object.  Geometric representation theory refers to the program of using techniques from geometry to construct representations.  The advantage of these constructions is that it is often easy to prove a property of the representation that would not be apparent otherwise; for example, that the representation has a nice basis or that certain matrix elements turn out to be positive integers.  George Lusztig is a leading researcher in geometric representation theory, and the conference being supported will bring together many of the most distinguished scholars in the field to honor him.

It has fascinated mathematicians for more than a century and had many important applications in physics and chemistry,<br/>particularly in quantum mechanics and in the theory<br/>of elementary particles. Finite groups and their representations have already proved valuable<br/>in coding theory and cryptography, and are expected to continue to play an important role in the<br/>modern world of computers and digital communications. The investigator's research will lead to<br/>important advances in understanding the representation theory of finite groups and help achieve significant progress in a number of its applications.<br/>"

The first<br/>is an attempt<br/>to build on recent joint work between Haiman, Loehr and the PI which gives a<br/>combinatorial formula for type A nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials.<br/>The existence of this formula in the type A setting suggests that similar<br/>formulas exist for other root systems; the discovery of such formulas<br/>would open up the subject significantly, as very few explicit identities of<br/>any kind have been discovered beyond the type A case.  The second project<br/>attempts to build on<br/>the combinatorial formula for (type A) symmetric Macdonald polynomials,<br/>which was discovered empirically by the PI and proved in subsequent joint<br/>work<br/>with Haiman and Loehr.  The main open problem in this regard is to find<br/>a combinatorial formula for the coefficients in the<br/>Schur expansion; as a step in this direction<br/>the PI describes a new conjectured formula for the special case of<br/>augmented hook shapes.<br/>The third project involves trying to prove a conjectured<br/>formula for the monomial expansion of the<br/>character of the space of diagonal harmonics, due to Haiman, Loehr, Remmel,<br/>Ulyanov and the PI.  This conjecture,<br/>which led the PI to the empirical formula for symmetric<br/>Macdonald polynomials mentioned above,<br/>has a number of implications to enumerative combinatorics and<br/>representation theory.<br/><br/>Orthogonal polynomials are families of polynomials which satisfy an<br/>orthogonality condition, typically meaning that the integral of any<br/>two different elements of the family,<br/>against some given weight function, is zero.<br/>The study of orthogonal polynomials is several centuries old,<br/>and they have quite a number of applications throughout mathematics and<br/>science.<br/>Symmetric functions are polynomials in several variables which are<br/>invariant under any permutation of the variables.  They have a large number<br/>of applications to several branches of mathematics such as representation<br/>theory and<br/>the roots of polynomial equations.<br/>In 1988 Macdonald introduced a new family of orthogonal polynomials,<br/>which depend on a set of variables X and two extra parameters q,t.  They are<br/>symmetric functions in the variables X, and<br/>contain most useful symmetric functions as special cases.<br/>They were immediately recognized as being important to several area of<br/>mathematics<br/>including combinatorics and special functions.<br/>In 2000 Haiman proved they have a complicated interpretation in terms of<br/>an advanced,<br/>abstract and theoretical branch of<br/>mathematics known as algebraic geometry.<br/>Macdonald's construction is indirect however, and neither it nor<br/>Haiman's interpretation<br/>give a way of easily describing these polynomials.<br/>Recently the PI discovered, and with Haiman and Loehr proved, a simple<br/>combinatorial formula for Macdonald's polynomials.  The PI is trying to<br/>apply this result to answer some of the open questions surrounding them.<br/>Macdonald and Cherednik now have a much more general construction which<br/>contains almost all<br/>previously studied symmetric functions and orthogonal polynomials as<br/>special cases.<br/>The PI, in collaboration with Haiman, is trying to extend the<br/>simple combinatorial formula to this more general construction.<br/>"

The PI suggests three different<br/>approaches to calculation of volumes and Ehrhart polynomials of such polytopes.<br/>He introduces new mixed Eulerian numbers with remarkable combinatorial<br/>properties.

The PI with collaborators have recently<br/>resolved several open Schur positivity problems that attracted a lot of<br/>attention, including Fomin-Fulton-Li-Poon's conjecture and Okounkov's<br/>conjecture.  They plan to apply their techniques to prove several other<br/>prominent conjectures.

These problems involve counting or<br/>enumerating various discrete mathematical objects, say, vertices of a polytope<br/>or pieces in a decomposition of a complicated geometrical object into simpler<br/>objects.  These problems would help to understand, clarify, and simplify<br/>nontrivial mathematical concepts and constructions.  The proposed research<br/>project would have impact in several fields, including algebraic geometry<br/>(which studies geometrical objects using algebra), representation theory (which<br/>studies symmetries), theory of convex polytopes, and theoretical physics.  The<br/>educational part of the proposal includes plans for a new course on modern<br/>applications of combinatorics.  The PI is planning to encourage graduate and<br/>undergraduate research.  Combinatorial problems are appealing for undergraduate<br/>students because these problems are intuitive and easy to formulate but yet<br/>quite challenging.

These<br/>questions regarding equidistribution can be approached from many<br/>angles. Two theories which have proved to be particularly well-suited<br/>to study such questions are the spectral theory of automorphic forms,<br/>which is closely related to the theory of L-functions, and the theory<br/>of dynamical systems, particularly the study of unipotent and more<br/>general flows on these homogeneous spaces. Recently there has been<br/>considerable progress involving tools such as special value formulae<br/>for L-functions, and (partial) classification results for measures<br/>invariant under higher rank torus actions. Particularly exciting is<br/>the possibility, already realized in some instances, of combining<br/>these techniques. The purpose of the proposed FRG is to investigate<br/>further this circle of ideas, which we believe has the potential to<br/>impact many other problems related to the above. The result of these<br/>investigations will be a deeper understanding of the dynamics of group<br/>actions on homogeneous spaces, of the analytic theory of automorphic<br/>forms, and the (sometimes unexpected) applications to problems of<br/>arithmetic nature.<br/><br/>The present project is concerned with a surprising link between two<br/>classical fields of mathematics of quite disparate origin: number<br/>theory and dynamics. The study of number theory began thousands of<br/>years ago, motivated, in significant part, by questions about prime<br/>numbers.  On the other hand, ergodic theory and dynamics are<br/>mathematical fields of more recent provenance, which arose from<br/>studying the long-term evolution of complicated deterministic<br/>processes -- such as planetary motion. It is a striking fact (which<br/>has only recently begun to be heavily exploited) that, in certain<br/>contexts, ideas from ergodic theory interact very deeply with classical<br/>problems in number theory.  This project will enhance our<br/>understanding of this inter-relation and how we can combine knowledge<br/>from both of these fruitful disciplines effectively.<br/>"

Several problems are proposed: study of the walls of cones of weights of rings of semi-invariants of quivers and the multiplicities of  their weight spaces, characterizing finite type and tame quivers in terms of semi-invariants, connections between quiver representations and cluster algebras and an expected connection between the orbit closures for Dynkin quivers of codimension three and four and the structure of perfect ideals of codimension three and Gorenstein ideals of codimension four. The part involving cluster algebras includes studying connections with the theory of pictures of Igusa-Orr and studying the mutations of quivers with superpotential.<br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with interactions between the representations of quivers, commutative algebra and representation theory - different branches of algebra. The representations of quivers give a nice combinatorial tool for coding the linear algebra problems, i.e. problems involving vectors and matrices. Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry are branches of mathematics studying the sets defined by polynomial equations. Some of the interactions the PI proposes to study were discovered recently and provided new insights to all these areas. In the present proposal the possible new unanticipated connection between quivers and the structure of perfect and Gorenstein ideals will be explored. If this part materializes, it could have fundamental consequences in commutative algebra. <br/>"

The focus of the proposal is on the theory of<br/>blowup algebras. These algebras appear naturally in many<br/>constructions both in algebra and geometry. For example they arise<br/>in the process of resolution of singularities. An essential tool in<br/>their study is the concept of reduction of an ideal. Several key<br/>invariants emerge in this context such as the reduction number,<br/>which among other things controls the Cohen-Macaulay property of<br/>blowup algebras. To study all reductions at once one considers the<br/>core of an ideal, defined as the intersection of these reductions.<br/>This object, related to coefficient, adjoint and multiplier ideals,<br/>plays a crucial role in Brian\c{c}on-Skoda type theorems. A main<br/>thrust of this proposal is to give a combinatorial description of<br/>the core of monomials ideals, to clarify the connection of the core<br/>with the reduction number, the first coefficient ideal and the<br/>adjoint or multiplier ideal, to investigate the core in arbitrary<br/>characteristic and to establish formulas that were previously known<br/>only in characteristic zero. In addition, the project also studies<br/>other areas such as integral closures of ideals. The concepts of<br/>integral extensions and integral closures of rings and ideals are<br/>central to much of commutative algebra. One of the goals of the<br/>project is to find a priori measures for the complexity of computing<br/>integral closures.<br/><br/>Often real life problems involve many unknown parameters that are<br/>related by equations which are impossible to solve exactly.<br/>Nevertheless, using commutative algebra methods, much valuable<br/>descriptive information can be gained about the potential sets of<br/>solutions, if not the exact solutions themselves.
