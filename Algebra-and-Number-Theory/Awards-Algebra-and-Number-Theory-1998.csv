Included here is the problem of discovering new optimal linear codes and describing them in a meaningful way. All of this is part of the ongoing development of a computer language Split, which facilitates the mechanical verification of proofs about linear codes.      This research concerns optimal error-correcting codes, which play a ubiquitous role in modern technology, because they make possible the  transmission of information across noisy channels.  For example, such codes  facilitate earth-satellite communications (in spite of atmospheric  disturbances), and such codes facilitate the reading of compact disks (in spite of dust and damage to the disk's surface). Codes are abstract mathematical objects.  Those that are are most effective for transmitting information are called optimal.  It is an open mathematical problem - and the subject of this research - to determine just how effective a code can be.  This problem can be converted into a computational problem called ""linear programming"", which is also used by many industries (such as the airline industry) to optimize their use of resources.  As existing linear programming software is not good enough to answer the problems arising from coding theory, new software will be developed.  In addition, software which allows for the  mechanical verification of assertions about codes will provide a ""front end"" to  these linear programming calculations.  All such software (including source  code) will be made freely available to the public."

These problems come from, and are motivated by, geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory. The PI  plans to consider several questions related to Schubert varieties, in particular, a geometric positivity conjecture motivated by conjectures of Peterson and Billey, which is possibly related to work of Fulton and Lazarsfeld on positive polynomials in Chern classes.  Another Schubert variety problem is to find a Pieri formula in the equivariant K-theory of the flag variety, generalizing work of Fulton and Lascoux for the general linear group.  Besides Schubert varieties, the PI plans to investigate other directions where equivariant methods can be applied. One direction is to extend localization formulas in equivariant Chow groups to higher Chow groups, and use localization to investigate the Chow groups of interesting spaces.  Another is to relate an equivariant Riemann-Roch theorem to results on the Chow groups of quotients; this is joint work with Dan Edidin.  Finally, equivariant methods have been used to study multiplicities in representations; the PI would like to make these results more explicit, especially for the general linear group.

Professor Merkurjev intends to compute the K-groups of algebraic varieties with large automorphism group.  As an application of this certain K-cohomology groups, such as Chow groups, will be computed.  The investigator will also develop a theory of cohomological invariants of algebraic varieties and compute the group of cohomological invariants with coefficients in a given module.     A powerful method in the modern mathematics is to study an object by studying its symmetries.  Mathematicians have developed rather sophisticated ways of  measuring symmetry, and they use a mathematical object called a group to keep track of them. Very often the groups can be stacked into a tower of increasingly complicated symmetries. By looking at the tower, they can get a great deal of information about the basic object. Algebraic K-theory is a version of this method of grouping.  Professor  Merkurjev has new ideas about how to compute these towers for certain kinds of objects.  He hopes to use these computations to study algebraic varieties and algebraic groups.  These are the mathematical names for a collection of solutions to a set of equations and for particular collections of matrices.  The results of this project will add to our understanding of many basic pieces of mathematics."

Under his plan Galois cohomology will provide information about Selmer groups.  Selmer groups are key ingredients in our understanding of the arithmetic of elliptic curves. Professor Greenberg is ultimately interested in those points on elliptic curves that can be pinpointed using algebraic numbers.  Algebraic numbers are numbers that can be developed in a finite way from the integers we all learn in school.  The Selmer Group is specifically designed to study these points.    In one view, elliptic curves are shaped like the surface of a donut.  In this view, simpler curves are like the surface of a sphere, a donut without a hole, and more complicated curves are like the surface of a donut with several holes.  The arithmetical properties of the simple curves have been extensively studied since ancient times.  The more complicated curves have such a restrictive arithmetic structure that simply counting the points on one is a difficult research problem.  The one hole donuts are, however, just right. They have a rich and mysterious structure which this project will explore. Their beautiful mathematical structure makes elliptic curves very useful in such practical problems as the digital encoding of information and the security of communications."

Twenty years ago, S. Bloch gave his famous lecture series on the theory of dilogarithms in Irvine. These insightful lectures laid the foundation of a theory that combined Grothendieck's theory of motives with algebraic K-theory and number theory. Remarkably, each topic and example from Bloch's original treatment has become an active area leading to new discoveries or growing into a subject in its own right.  Two major programs have recently emerged in the boundary zone between algebraic geometry, algebraic K-theory and Hodge theory. The first is stable homotopy theory of algebraic varieties, and the second is non-abelian Hodge theory.  Twenty years later is a good time to look back and see where the fields stand. By gathering researchers in all of these fields, the organizers hope to stimulate a creative atmosphere that will lead to many new exciting discoveries.

Andrews will focus on problems related to the theory of partitions and q-series. Recently, Andrews showed that MacMahon's Partition Analysis has great potential for new discoveries; this project will be continued and greatly expanded. In collaboration with A. Berkovich, Andrews established an analog of Bailey's Lemma for q-trinomial coefficients. There are several promising possible extensions here that will be explored including ties between Bailey's Lemma and Partition Analysis. In addition, Andrews has recently found a new aspect of Schur's 1926 partition theorem which should allow a more efficient proof and vast generalization of his theorems (joint with Beesenrodt and Olsson) for application to modular representation theory. Brownawell will focus on problems in transcendence theory. He proposes to further investigate transcendence properties in the Drinfeld setting. In joint work with L. Denis, he plans to obtain and extension of known results on the linear independence properties of the logarithm of a separably algebraic number involving the divided derivatives of it and of quasi-periodic functions. He will look at the situation that Sinha exploited so strikingly in his thesis, and he will also look into the possibility of applying interpolation considerations for the Carlitz exponential functions. In other projects, Brownawell will look at two problems relating differential equations and transcendence. One is an old and neglected question of Siegel's. The other is a new question that arose in recent work of Nesterenko; a positive answer here would base a new proof of Nesterenko's marvelous theorems on a criterion of algebraic independence due to the co-PI. Brownawell will investigate a Lojasiewicz inequality that will improve even further the current impressive work of Berenstein and Yger on the Nullstellensatz. Finally, he will develop a multi-homogeneous Nullstellens atz.    This research falls into the general mathematical field of number theory. Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems."

The Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture predicts that all elliptic curves defined over the rational numbers occur through such an association.  This means that the arithmetic of elliptic curves can be studied using tools from modular forms. There has been a substantial progress very recently building on A. Wiles celebrated proof that the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture holds for a large class of elliptic curves.  Professor Diamond will continue his successful investigations along these lines.  He will attempt to prove certain Galois representations arise from modular forms and to study related questions about special values of L-functions and congruences between modular forms.      This is research in the area of mathematics known as number theory, and in particular the study of elliptic curves.  Many important problems in number theory involve finding the solutions to certain equations using only ratios of integers. These equations can be associated with their graphs and thought of as curves.  Geometrically curves can be classified by a number called the genus.  The simplest curves have genus zero and their rational solutions have been studied since ancient times, to the point where mathematicians consider them well understood.  About 15 years ago, G. Faltings showed that any curve with genus greater than one could have only finitely many rational solutions.  The remaining curves have genus one and are called elliptic.  The collection of rational solutions to an elliptic curve can be finite or infinite, and always has a interesting mathematical structure in its own right. In his recent proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, Andrew Wiles also gave mathematics a powerful new tool for the study of the arithmetic of elliptic curves.  In this project Professor Diamond will further develop this  new method."

The study of analytic aspects of these topics has progressed over the last twenty years and now constitutes one of the most rapidly expanding areas of modern analytic number theory. This project will address central questions of this subject. In particular, issues surrounding the old controversy about the existence of Siegel zeros form part of the proposal. A new line of investigation on this difficult unsolved problem is proposed using automorphic theory. Another aim is to broaden the scope of analytic number theory by implementing its techniques in novel ways in the arithmetic theory of elliptic curves, number fields, and modular forms.  This will be accomplished through a series of new interdisciplinary problems about L-functions, division fields, and exponential sums associated to modular curves.  The project also aims to have  educational impact  at several levels. It is a significant benefit for a young student to gain experience conducting research and presenting mathematics before his or her dissertation begins. When done in a collaborative and supportive environment it provides a needed bridge between the phase of learning foundational mathematics to that of thinking independently and creatively, as is required to write a good dissertation. The investigators plan to provide several students with an opportunity to engage in such research before their thesis.      This research falls into the general mathematical field of number theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it  has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems."

The theory of random structures is well developed. The interesting interface of randomness with discrete mathematics, however, is the use of random or quasi-random methods to deterministic problems.  The PI's have developed a number of statistical methods, including the Regularity Lemma, the Blow-up Lemma, and certain relaxations of Turan's theorem. They are all based on some kind of approximation of deterministic structures with random-looking ones. The present project goes beyond these tools and extends the methods to sparse graphs and hypergraphs. These methods are strong enough to help attack several hard classical problems in graph and hypergraph theory.     This research is in the area of combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods for manipulating and enumerating discrete collections of objects.

Commutative algebra studies the solutions of such polynomial or power  series equations by forming an algebraic object, called a ring, which  consists of the 'generic' solutions.  The algebraic properties of  these generic solutions then give insight into the geometric and algebraic  nature of the equations. The field combines techniques from a number of  other areas including combinatorics, topology, and analysis."

Elliptic curves play a central role in many parts of mathematics including its most applied areas.  The investigator is interested in how certain points appear on this curve, in particular those points that can be pinpointed using simple fractions.  Fractions involve the integer arithmetic we all learn in school, so these points embody the arithmetic aspect of the curve.  To get at this arithmetic,  Professor Rubin will use all the geometric and analytic information about elliptic curves available.    In one view, elliptic curves are shaped like the surface of a donut.  In this view, simpler curves are like the surface of a sphere, a donut without a hole, and more complicated curves are like the surface of a donut with several holes.  The arithmetical properties of the simple curves have been extensively studied since ancient times.  The more complicated curves have such a restrictive arithmetic structure that simply counting the points on one is a difficult research problem.  The one hole donuts are, however, just right. They have a rich and mysterious structure which this project will explore.  The insight gained from this project will guide mathematicians for a long time to come."

First, the PI hopes to complete work in progress on estimating the number of solutions for non-degenerate quartic norm form inequalities in three variables. The results would be similar to those obtained recently by the PI for cubic Thue inequalities. This will use recent advances in Diophantine approximation, in particular new estimates for a quantitative version of Schmidt's subspace theorem, and estimates for volumes associated to decomposable forms proved by the PI and M. Bean. More substantially, the PI hopes to extend his work on cubic Thue inequalities to forms of higher degree. This will entail a deeper investigation into rational approximations of algebraic numbers and possibly a reformulation of a quantitative version of Roth's theorem. Ultimately, it is hoped that the methods thus developed will yield fairly sharp estimates for the number of solutions of general non-degenerate norm form inequalities. Second, the PI will attempt to prove an ""effective"" version of the absolute Siegel's lemma. He also hopes to find improved bounds for the absolute Hermite constant and investigate possible connections to sphere packings, finite groups, and error-correcting codes. The methods to be employed include standard Euclidean and adelic geometry of numbers.       This research falls into the general mathematical field of number theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems."

The study of these algebras has led to important discoveries in statistical mechanics, quantum groups, particle physics, and invariants of knots and 3-manifolds.  The main focus is to answer important questions from representation theory and geometry using discrete, combinatorial constructions. The primary example of a Coxeter group is the symmetric group of permutations of the numbers 1,2, ..., n.  This group arises naturally in many physical settings, such as the study of the chemical structure of molecules and the physics of subatomic particles. Many important questions regarding the representation theory  of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of the symmetric group have recently been answered combinatorially.  These questions extend naturally to general Coxeter  groups, their (finite) Iwahori-Hecke algebras, and the (infinite) affine Hecke algebras. A main thrust of this project is to answer these questions in these general settings. One focus of this research is to understand the relationship between different bases of the irreducible matrix representations of these algebras, in particular to produce explicit combinatorial descriptions of the transformation matrices between these bases.  A second focus is to explore a representation of the Hecke algebra on cosets of a Borel subgroup of a finite Chevalley group.  The trace of this representation counts fixed points in the flag variety of the group, determines a Frobenius formula for characters of the Hecke algebra, and, at least in type-A, provides a natural pairing between conjugacy classes of the underlying Weyl group and unipotent classes of the Chevalley group. This project incorporates a collection of undergraduate research projects that study algebras that are generalizations of the symmetric group.  Students will derive character algorithms and compute characters relations for these algebras.  They will implement and  analyze character algorithms for the Hecke algebras and use the implementations to study further questions in character theory.     This research is in the general area of combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying ways that discrete collections of objects can be arranged and used to concretely model abstract or complex phenomena. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important in modern communications and is used in the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems."

The first one is to look for a construction of a linear algebraic object that is canonically associated to a projective variety X and calculate the cohomology of all local systems on X together with their Hodge structures whenever the latter makes sense. The second concerns the non-abelian Hodge conjecture on curves and provides an intrinsic geometric characterization of the locus of motivic local systems.

The understanding of these questions is essential for unifying various linearization procedures in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.

Specifically, based on the solution the PI found for an open spanning tree enumeration problem posed by Stanley, the PI intends to extend the ideas in his previous work on the factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs to obtain similar factorizations for characteristic polynomials of graphs and, as a consequence, for spanning trees. Furthemore, the  PI intends to use ideas from his work on the complementation theorem for perfect matchings to classify periodic weightings of the Aztec diamond that lead to nice enumeration formulas. This would give a unified perspective on several results of Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen and Propp, B. Y. Yang, Stanley and the  PI. In addition to the core research program outlined above, the  PI intends to pursue three additional problems. First, the  PI will pursue extending comparison results of Diaconis and Saloff-Coste to non-reversible Markov chains. This would allow one to deduce the rapid mixing of the elementary move Markov chain on certain three dimensional ``lozenge'' tilings, considered by the  PI as an analog of the two dimensional situation studied by Luby, Randall and Sinclair. Second, the  PI will continue his investigations of the three dimensional dimer problem by considering, besides the simple cubic lattice, other lattices of comparable interest (e.g., the body-centered cubic lattice or the face-centered cubic lattice), as well as some other problems likely to be suitable for such an analysis (e.g., three-colorings of the cubic lattice). And third, the  PI intends to extend his joint work w ith C. Krattenthaler on enumeration of lozenge tilings of certain regions of the triangular lattice to more general (possibly weighted) regions relevant to plane partition enumeration.        This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged.

The focus is on two specific applications.  Modular symbols for congruence subgroups are integrals over closed cycles of a differential one-form, which are, by a theorem of Shimura, integral linear combinations of periods of  the Jacobian variety associated to the congruence subgroup.  The PI has previously conjectured that such integral coefficients have a polynomial growth in the level and that this implies the abc-conjecure.  New types of automorphic forms (twisted by modular symbols) are introduced to study the moments of modular symbols.  In particular, the investigation of the second moment may lead to progress in the direction of the abc-conjecture.  The second application involves the celebrated Gross-Zagier formula for critical values of L-functions associated to modular forms.  Recently, the PI and S. Zhang have found a much simpler and very direct proof of the L-value computation of Gross-Zagier.  The central idea is to compute the base change of a holomorphic Poincare series.  It is proposed to generalize this proof to the case of Hilbert modular L-series  over totally real fields.  The ultimate goal is to obtain new results in the direction of the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.<br/><br/>This research falls into the general mathematical field of number theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.<br/>"

Of particular interest is the case where the tree is homogeneous of two possible degrees,each a power of a prime plus one.  For certain degrees of bi-homogeneity, the tree is then the Bruhat-Tits building of a rank 1 simple Lie group over anon-archimedean local field.  Broadly speaking, we are interested in constructingnon-uniform lattices contained within such rank 1 Lie groups, comparing them with general tree lattices, further questions of existence of non-uniform lattices, their covolumes and questions of arithmeticity. The proposer is also studying the edge-indexed quotient graphs of non-uniform tree lattices, which give new examples of infinite expanding diagrams.<br/><br/>This is a study of infinite 'trees', which are connected graphs in which there are no closed circuits, and the algebraic structure of their symmetries.

The symmetries of locally finite trees that give finite quotient graphs have been understood for some time, and it is also known that these give rise to infinite families of finite expander graphs, which are fundamental building blocks for certain  communication networks in computer science.

In this proposal three particular directions of study are suggested: 1) Construction of automorphic sheaves for  GL(n) using a geometric analog of the Whittaker model; 2) The study of automorphic sheaves that correspond to local systems induced from the maximal torus, i.e. the case of Eisenstein series;  3) Construction of automorphic sheaves for GL(2) that correspond to 2-dimensional ramified local systems. Progress in each of the above directions will contribute to a better understanding of the general structure of the Langlands correspondence and of the related number-theoretic and representation-theoretic problems.<br/><br/>This proposal is in the part of mathematics known as the Langlands program. The Langlands program is part of number theory. Number theory is the study of the  properties of the integral numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the outset, problems in number theory have furnished a driving force in creating new ideas in all areas of mathematics. The Langland's program is a general philosophy that connects number theory with calculus; it embodies the modern approach to the study of integral numbers. The object of this proposal is to explore the applications of geometric techniques within the Langlands program.<br/>"

Coleman's ""eigencurve"" provides a new view of some of the most studied mathematical objects in modern number theory. If only a part of the planned project is completed, it could change the face of 150 year old branch of Number Theory.  The experts are eagerly awaiting the first reports from this work.    When mathematicians first used the techniques of calculus to study modular forms, they were interested in their interesting analytical properties. Modular forms were first seen as mathematical functions with incredibly strong symmetries. While these aspects of modular forms are still of intense interest, modern number theorists are mainly interested in the arithmetical information that modular forms contain.  Modular forms encode information about the size of other mathematical constructions that at first (and even second) glance are totally unrelated.  Numbers you can obtain from modular forms have a meaning quite separate from the forms themselves.  Basically, modular forms count things.  A large part of Number Theory in the second half of the twentieth century has been devoted to understanding why and how this strange counting works.  Professor Coleman has some very new ideas about modular forms that should increase our understanding of a major mathematical mystery."

Unfortunately there are no known methods for calculating parts of the table, and producing such methods is the major part of the project.  The development of computer algorithms should shed as much light on hyperelliptic curves as the tables these algorithms are used to produce.      In one view, curves are shaped like the surface of a sphere with handles attached.  In this view, the simplest curves are like the surface of a sphere without a handle; elliptic curves have one handle, and more complicated curves have several.  The simple curves have been extensively studied since ancient times and are pretty well understood.  Elliptic curves have a very rich structure that is still rather mysterious. Today there are extensive systematic lists of elliptic curves tabulated with information about their most important features.  The main goal of this project is to start building tables for a class of more complicated curves. Hyperelliptic curves share many properties with elliptic curves, but have more handles.

Part of the research is closely coupled with the study of very large graphs in connection with many combinatorial problems arising in massive data sets.

Work that addresses this question would lead to a better understanding of the geometry of moduli spaces parameterizing plane curves, which are basic objects of study both in classical and modern algebraic geometry. The PI expects that degeneration techniques can be successfully used to approach these issues; in fact modern tools (such as semistable reduction and deformation theory) make degeneration methods much more powerful today than they were ever in the past. There are many open problems regarding the geometry of curves on algebraic varieties, of which the one described here is an example.

Questions considered involve enumerative properties of general polytopes and arrangements of hyperplanes and structures on the set of all subdivisions.  A major focus will be to move closer to a characterization of the numbers of faces and chains of faces in polytopes and arrangements, as well as to obtain information on the structure of the set of all triangulations of a fixed point set.  The type of enumerative information being sought here has been of use in the design of geometric algorithms for problems in robotics and motion planning, and recently has come into play in the analysis of randomization schemes for the management of data.  Questions involving the structure of all triangulations have been raised repeatedly in  a variety of practical settings, ranging from condensed matter physics to computer-aided design.<br/><br/>This research is in the area of combinatorics.  One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods for manipulating and enumerating discrete collections of objects.  The behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications.  For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research."

Part 1 of the project consists of the study of a birational duality among moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces arising from the Brill-Noether stratification of these symplectic moduli spaces. The interaction of this duality with a representation of the Heisenberg algebra on the total cohomology of sequences of moduli spaces is investigated. In Part 2 of the project the theory of integrable systems will be used to compare the boundary of the compactified Picard of an algebraic curve with planar singularities to the boundary of coadjoint orbits of loop algebras. This is research in the field of algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics."

He hopes both to extend existing techniques based on lowering operators, and to exploit newly understood connections between branching rules and decompositions of tensor products. A parallel project is to generalize existing results on completely splittable representations for general linear groups to orthogonal and symplectic groups. The research supported concerns the representation theory of various algebraic objects including general linear groups and symmetric groups. Representation theory is an important method for determining the structure of these objects. This work has implications for a number of areas of mathematics including ring theory, group theory, topology and the study of Lie algebras."

The principal investigator will compare the prime ideals of a Hopf crossed product with the prime ideals of the underlying algebra on which the Hopf algebra acts. More generally, she will compare the primes in a Hopf Galois extension. She will also study ""duality problems"" involving both the action of a Hopf algebra and of a suitable dual Hopf algebra, in order to look at the prime ideals for infinite dimensional Hopf algebras. Problems on classifying finite-dimensional Hopf algebras will also be considered in the context of Yetter-Drinfeld categories. Finally some problems concerning algebras graded by groups will be considered. This research is concerned with an algebraic object called a Hopf algebra. While the area is quite technical, Hopf algebras are becoming of increasing interest, even to nonmathematicians. Hopf algebras are useful for studying the type of knot theory that appears in molecular chemistry. Certain types of Hopf algebras are now referred to as quantum groups in recognition of the applications in physics. Hopf algebras are used to study differential operators and to make combinatorics more like calculus."

The two main series of conjectures which together would give a proof of the Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture in general, have been formulated and applied to prove by elementary means the non-trivial Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture for homogenizations of simplicial polytopes. These conjectures are the PSM conjectures and the IC conjectures. The PSM conjectures describe analogues of principal series modules from Lie theory in terms of data related to shellings of the weight poset. The IC conjectures assert that certain spaces arising naturally in the representation theory have properties closely analogous to those of the intersection cohomology spaces of complex projective varieties. The main object of this research is to prove the PSM and IC conjectures in general.<br/><br/>Representation theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups, initially developed at the turn of the century, studies the structure of symmetries and their realizations. This theory encompasses many areas in mathematics and has fundamental applications to theoretical physics. In the past twenty years, the study of representation theory of a special class of affine Lie algebras and Lie groups led to many new unexpected discoveries in mathematics and theoretical physics, as well as to a synthesis of many established areas in both disciplines. In particular, it yielded a pure mathematical description of a simplest quantum field theory -- a prototype theory of fundamental interactions. It is expected that representation theory of new classes of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups might substantially deepen our understanding of mathematics and theoretical physics during the next decade."

The goal is to analyze likely and unlikely behavior of large combinatorial structures such as random graphs, trees, permutations, and partitions of sets and integers. This research will develop new approaches based on combinatorial-algebraic principles and ideas and analytical methods of probability and random processes. The connection between combinatorics and probability is well known. It played a major role in the early stages of development of probability theory, and some classical problems of a combinatorial nature are traditionally used to illustrate how the general theorems work in application to combinatorics. Among them are random walks and allocations of particles among cells (boxes), the latter being quite popular in various models of statistical mechanics. During the last 30-35 years, there has been a tremendous outpouring of research in combinatorial probability motivated by new problems in statistical mechanics (percolation theory, for instance), polymerization theory, computer science (probabilistic analysis of combinatorial algorithms), population genetics, etc. The terms random permutations, mappings, graphs, partitions, etc. have become household names for many researchers who have discovered the importance of analysis of random combinatorial structures. The related theory of random graphs, inaugurated by Erdos and Renyi in the early sixties, has been found indispensable in many important applications. Characteristically, the deepest results have come via a combination of fine combinatorial techniques and powerful probabilistic methods. Besides the problems directly related to random graphs, the investigator will study an optimal assignment problem with random costs, a possible connection between the evolving random graph and the Diaconis- Shahshahani algorithm (""card shuffling"") for generating a r andom permutation, and various problems on random partitions of sets and integers. The accent will be made on searching for probabilistic and analytic methods which can be used for other combinatorial structures important in applications."
