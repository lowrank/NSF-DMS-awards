While algebraic geometry<br/>has contributed applications in coding, industrial control, and<br/>computation, the topics of this project are more closely related to<br/>applications in theoretical physics, where physicists consider<br/>algebraic varieties as components of the fine structure of our<br/>universe. This is especially true with the first topic, moduli<br/>theory. This theory studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the<br/>collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often<br/>manifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own<br/>right. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a<br/>community of ""organisms"" as itself being an ""organism"" is not just a<br/>metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. Sometimes a collection<br/>of algebraic varieties manifests itself as a slightly more general<br/>object, called a stack, rather than a variety.

It is the goal of coding theory to find efficient ways to<br/>encode the information so that these errors can be corrected.<br/>Algebraic coding theory seeks to do this using techniques from areas<br/>such as linear algebra, group theory, and algebraic geometry.  This<br/>project involves four main problems within algebraic coding theory:<br/>the search for an efficient decoding algorithm for algebraic geometric<br/>codes over certain rings, the study of exponential sums over certain<br/>rings and their connections to coding theory, the study of codes from<br/>a structural standpoint, and the construction of quantum codes in<br/>characteristics greater than 2.  Much of this project involves work<br/>the PI will do with her graduate and postdoctoral students.  In<br/>addition, she will continue her history of being extremely active in<br/>mathematical activities outside her research.  These activities<br/>include organizing a week-long summer math camp for high school girls<br/>and a national research conference for undergraduate women<br/>mathematicians.  While previously supported by NSF, the PI was the<br/>undergraduate lecturer at the IAS/Park City Mathematics Institute<br/>Mentoring Program, and during the term of the current project, she<br/>will be the principal lecturer at a ""Reconnect"" workshop for faculty<br/>from primarily teaching-focused institutions.<br/><br/>More precisely, the problems included in this project are described as<br/>follows.  In previous work, the PI introduced algebraic geometric<br/>codes over local Artinian rings and proved several foundational<br/>results about these codes.  Two portions of this project build on this<br/>prior work.  First, in joint work with R. Koetter, the PI intends to<br/>find an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes.  This algorithm<br/>will decode with respect to the squared Euclidean and homogeneous<br/>weight measures.  The design of the algorithm will depend both upon<br/>Sudan's list decoding algorithm and the Koetter-Vardy soft-decision<br/>version of Sudan's algorithm.  Second, the PI will build upon her past<br/>work with exponential sums along curves over rings and their<br/>relationship to codes.  While her previous work (joint with<br/>J.-F. Voloch) has focused on Weil exponential sums and their<br/>applications to homogeneous and squared Euclidean weights of algebraic<br/>geometric codes over local Artinian rings, other types of sums have<br/>proven valuable in the study of codes over finite fields and the PI<br/>will now study the ring analogues of these other sums and their<br/>applications.  The third area of this project builds on the PI's prior<br/>work on a structural approach to coding theory.  She previously used<br/>this approach to revisit the classification of binary self-dual codes,<br/>and in addition to continuing this work, she will look at ternary<br/>self-dual codes as well as additive GF(4)-codes from this point of<br/>view.  The fourth and final main area of this project is that of<br/>quantum algebraic-geometric codes arising from algebraic curves.<br/>Together with J.-L. Kim and T. Marley, the PI intends to construct<br/>good algebraic geometric quantum codes in characteristics greater than<br/>2.<br/><br/><br/>"

In recent years deep and unexpected connections have been seen between algebraic combinatorics and probability theory, in particular, stochastic processes. It is the primary objective of the investigator to explore such connections and to develop new methods and techniques based on algebraic-combinatorial principles, as well as analytic methods of probability and random processes. The project focuses on four main areas. The first is to apply the theory of branching processes and stochastic analysis to the enumeration of combinatorial objects, and to analyze the distributive asymptotics for families of random structures, including random trees, random forests, random sequences, and various random walks. The second is to investigate the enumeration of statistics with an Airy type oflimit distribution.  The third is to study the algebraic properties and the applications of sequences of polynomials in enumerative combinatorics, which would extend the classical theory of binomial enumeration. Finally, several problems on geometric random graphs and various combinatorial games will also be investigated.<br/><br/>This research is in the general area of combinatorics. One of the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods for arranging, enumerating, and manipulating discrete collections of objects.<br/>The proposed research addresses these goals with a combined algebraic and probabilistic approach. There are far-reaching applicationsto other areas of pure mathematics, including algebra, analysis, number theory, statistics, and topology, as well as to areas of applied sciences such as computer science, electrical engineering, and management science.

One example of the first aspect of the project is the proposed study of the asymptotic behaviour of Betti numbers of the Frobenius endomorphism. The paradigm for the results sought is Kunz's theorem: local ring of non-zero characteristic is regular precisely when the Frobenius endomorphism is flat.  A second example concerns Koszul algebras: the investigator will build on recent work with Herzog that was motivated by results of Eisenbud, Floystad, and Schreyer on the relationship between linear strands of resolutions over a polynomial ring and modules over its Koszul dual exterior algebra. Some of the techniques proposed are derived from rational homotopy theory, and a guiding light in this endeavour is the ""Looking glass principle"" of Avramov and Halperin. However, many of the crucial results that govern it have not been pinned down in the desired level of detail. Avramov and the investigator propose a manuscript that fills this gap in the literature. The project will also investigate the role of cellular approximations, staple to topologists, in the context of commutative rings.<br/>In the second half of the 19th century, David Hilbert discovered a close relationship between geometric objects called varieties, and certain types of functions defined onthem. The latter form algebraic gadgets called commutative rings. Over the last century, commutative rings have arisen in combinatorics, topology, and other branches of mathematics.  They have also found applications in diverse fields like cryptography, pattern recognition, and theoretical physics. This project seeks to apply techinques from 'homological algebra' to study commutative rings.  Topology has been a major force in the development of homological algebra, although some of its roots can be traced to geometry. Homological methods have proved remarkably efficacious in tackling problems in commutative algebra; in turn, this has infused new ideas into the subject.<br/><br/>"

The lecture honors the contributions of UK faculty members Thomas Hayden and Henry Howard, by bringing an outstanding mathematician to the University of Kentucky each year to deliver a colloquium lecture on research at the forefront of modern Mathematics. The additional conference will consist of ten lectures - accessible to an audience of graduate studens - given by internationally known mathematicians working in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry: Prof. Shreeram Abhyankar (Purdue), Prof. Stephen Dale Cutkosky (Columbia, Missouri), Prof. Shankar Dutta (Urbana-Champaign), Prof. William Heinzer (Purdue), Prof. Melvin Hochster (Michigan), Prof. Joseph Lipman (Purdue), Prof. Juan Migliore (Notre Dame), Prof. Claudia Polini (Notre Dame), Prof. Bernd Ulrich (Purdue), Prof. Wolmer Vasconcelos (Rutgers). Among the areas to be covered we list: resolutions of singularities, liaison theory, Hilbert functions, tight closure and its applications. We propose that at least 20 graduate students and young researchers within three years from their Ph.D. receive funds to support their participation in these events. The amount requested will be sufficient for travel as well as local expenses.<br/><br/>Commutative Algebra is of central importance among the various branches of Modern Algebra because of the power and efficiency of its structures, which put it in contact with a variety of disciplines, such as Computational Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, Control Theory, and Robotics. During the academic year 2002-03, Commutative Algebra is also receiving particular attention because of a year long program, which is currently held at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley under the direction of Professor Huneke. These facts have led the Mathematics Department at the University of Kentucky to select Professor Huneke to deliver the third Hayden-Howard lecture. There are also at least three long term goals that we expect to achieve by organizing the additional Bluegrass Algebra Conference. In first place, we are seeking to increase the collaboration among the strong Algebra groups at nearby major institutions. Our second goal is to encourage and foster scholarly interests within the smaller Algebra groups at the regional institutions in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Finally, we are seeking to expose our<br/>graduate students to current trends of research in Algebra and at the same time have them interact with fellow graduate students at other institutions.

Outside of mathematics, these results may have applications in theoretical physics, computer graphics, and the study of Bucky balls (Carbon-60 molecules).

The first concerns Schubert calculus, <br/>a boolean lattice's worth of problems whose minimal element is the (now <br/>extremely well-understood) intersection theory on Grassmannians. Its <br/>extensions include equivariant intersection theory (recently solved by Knutson <br/>and T. Tao), K-theory (recently solved by A. Buch), quantum cohomology (unsolved, but a very solid conjecture exists), replacing the Grassmannian by larger flag manifolds, and analogues for arbitrary Lie groups (for these last two almost nothing is known). Since the submission of the proposal, much progress has been made (by Knutson and R. Vakil) towards one more level in this lattice, the equivariant K-theory of Grassmannians, but all other combinations remain. The second part is a generalization of Littelmann's path model in representation theory, which one should regard in this context as providing a flat degeneration of the flag manifold to a union of toric varieties. In the generalization, the only property used of the flag manifold is that it carries an action of the circle  with isolated fixed points. Many other varieties should thus have a ""path model"" for their coordinate ring, such as toric varieties (a testbed, where the theory is rather trivial), wonderful compactifications, and Hilbert schemes. As an example application, this would provide a ppositive formula for Haiman's generalization of the (q,t)-Catalan numbers (where positivity is known for vanishing-cohomology reasons, but there is no formula).<br/><br/>The first of Dr. Knutson's two projects concerns a 19th-century intrusion<br/>of combinatorics into algebraic geometry: counting the number of lines (or <br/>planes, or chains consisting of a point inside a line inside a plane etc.)<br/>satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions. The first interesting <br/>such question is ``Given four generic lines in space, how many other lines touch <br/>all four?'' (The answer is 2.) There are many generalizations of this problem; <br/>one of the newest and most exciting is quantum intersection theory, in which there may be no single solution to all the conditions, but rather the solution may ""quantum tunnel"" between the requirements, while paying a well-defined ""penalty.""(In physical terms, this penalty means the occurrence is impossible classically, but in the quantum world is only very rare.) There already exist formulae to solve any one of this huge family of problems, but they are extremely unsatisfying, as they determine the count by adding and subtracting many numbers. Such cancelative formulae are essentially useless for proving that a general class of intersection problems has an answer, and moreover they are computationally very inefficient. Dr. Knutson and his collaborators have provided noncancelative formulae for some of these generalizations, and have conjectures about others. His other project is not directly related, though it also uses combinatorics to control algebraic geometry, building on work of P. Littelmann. Littelmann showed how to use the very great symmetry of certain algebraic spaces, such as the set of all k-planes in n-space, to compute the space of functions on them in terms of lattice points inside a union of large-dimensional tetrahedra. This second proposal is based on recent work of Dr. Knutson's indicating that this large degree of symmetry is unnecessary -- a single circular symmetry, plus a technical (but common and easily checked) condition, seem to be enough to be able to make use of this lattice-point machinery. Such algebraic spaces with symmetry are endemic in mathematics and physics.<br/>"

The proposal comes in several parts. The theme of the first part is the application of methods of commutative algebra to the cohomology of groups. This work centers on several conjectures. The first conjecture says that for a finite group, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the cohomology ring of a finite group is always zero. This remarkable conjecture should be a manifestation of a duality discovered by Benson and Carlson about fifteen years ago. This conjecture is expected to generalize to compact Lie groups, where the regularity is taken as minus the dimension of the group as a manifold; and to virtual duality groups, where the regularity is the virtual cohomogical dimension. Another conjecture says that the depth of the cohomology ring of a finite group should equal the minimal dimension of an associated prime. The second part of the proposed research is closely connected with this, and concerns a conjecture relating two different constructions of infinite dimensional modules for a finite group. The conjecture can be viewed as a sort of Grothendieck duality for the stable module category. A recent collaboration of Benson and Greenlees has come up with a way to translate this problem into the language of algebraic topology, using recent machinery of Dwyer, Greenlees and Iyengar. It looks as though they should be able to solve the problem there, although there are formidable technical difficulties involved. The third part of the project involves generalizing the concept of the nucleus of the principal block of a finite group to nonprincipal blocks. Benson has proposed a definition, but the statement that it works analogously to the way the principal block works is still a conjecture. The fourth and final part of the proposal is a joint project with Kathryn Lesh to try to understand the cohomology of the symmetric groups at odd primes. This involves rehashing the work of Ben Mann (which by no means gives a complete treatment), and relating it to the structure of the Dyer-Lashof algebra from algebraic topology.<br/><br/>Representation theory is the study of how to represent abstract groups as groups of matrices. Group cohomology theory provides a description of how matrix representations can fit together to form larger representations. A great deal of information about how groups can act on manifolds and on more general topological spaces can be gleaned from the representation theory and cohomology of the group. These ideas are central to most of pure mathematics and mathematical physics. Professor Benson's research centers around group cohomology and representation theory, and its interactions with commutative algebra and algebraic topology. These subjects provide fruitful interactions for other areas within pure mathematics. The main areas of application are algebraic topology, group actions, and algebraic number theory. <br/><br/>"

CombinaTexas'03, to be held at Southwest Texas State University on April 5-6, 2003, will focus on Graph Theory <br/>and its Applications. The program is built around seven one-hour talks delivered by internationally recognized researchers on topics including Computational Graph Theory, Topological Graph Theory, Random Graphs; and their applications to Algorithms, Geometry, and Number Theory. There will also be short communications, poster sessions and social events to encourage communication and collaboration among participants. To be consistent with the goal of building research infrastructure, the target audience is advanced graduate students and junior faculty. The 2004 and 2005 conferences will be formatted similarly; the 2004 conference will focus on Algebraic Combinatorics and Algorithms, and the 2005 conference will focus on Probabilistic Methods and Combinatorial Number Theory.<br/><br/>The recent progress in graph drawing, random graphs, and computer-aided microchip design has been dramatic. Continuing research in graph theory and its applications will contribute advances in internet modeling, algorithm design, and bioinfomatics; each area is of independent and intense interest. The CombinaTexas series has become a major regional research and educational activity in the above areas, which is welcomed <br/>and supported by its participants and beneficiaries.

It turns out that,<br/>in many situations, it is possible to describe a canonical way<br/>of reducing the equations modulo p. When A/K<br/>is an abelian variety, this canonical reduction is called the N\'eron model<br/>of A/K. This reduction is the object of study in <br/>Lorenzini's first three research projects in this proposal. <br/>For instance, attached to any Neron model<br/>is a finite group called the group of components.

The investigators study the interplay between<br/>the topology of a manifold X and certain algebraic structures<br/>related to X.  From a theoretical standpoint, such an undertaking<br/>involves a mainstream question of algebra, geometry, and<br/>topology: how geometric, topological, or combinatorial aspects of<br/>a manifold manifest in algebraic properties of objects such as<br/>the cohomology ring, fundamental group, and resonance varieties.<br/>The focus is on the case where X is the complement of an<br/>arrangement of lines or rational curves in the projective plane,<br/>or a configuration space.  The investigators develop a software<br/>package of algorithms to study the aforementioned algebraic<br/>invariants of X.  The software is used to generate tables of<br/>arrangements (similar to the tables used in knot theory),<br/>providing an extensive list of examples and invariants.  The<br/>investigators use these tables to search for counterexamples to<br/>open conjectures, and to spot patterns leading to theorems.

For example, in approximation theory one can<br/>approximate a function of several variables, say k of them in a<br/>k-dimensional region, by dividing the region into pieces and on<br/>each piece approximating the function by polynomials; the<br/>resulting piecewise polynomials are called splines.  Technically,<br/>the region is divided into simplices using hyperplanes; the set<br/>of splines on the resulting simplicial complex is an algebraic<br/>object that depends strongly on the geometry of the chosen<br/>hyperplanes.  In robotics, arrangements arise in motion planning<br/>(finding a collision-free motion between two placements of a<br/>given robot among a set of objects).  Configuration spaces show up<br/>in multidimensional billiards (describing the periodic<br/>trajectories of a mass-point in a domain in Euclidean space).<br/>Information about the structure of the cohomology ring translates<br/>into bounds on the complexity of the motion planning problem, or<br/>bounds on the number of periodic trajectories.  Thus, finding fast<br/>algorithms to compute algebraic invariants associated to<br/>arrangements and configuration spaces could have real world<br/>applications.  The problems the investigators study are also well<br/>suited to introducing graduate (and undergraduate!) students to<br/>research and the use of computational tools.

Tobias Stafford <br/>Proposal Number: 0245320<br/>Institution: University of Michigan Ann Arbor<br/><br/><br/>NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY AND RINGS OF DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS<br/><br/><br/><br/> PROJECT ABSTRACT: There are two main themes to Professor Stafford's research project. The first concerns the theory of ""noncommutative projective geometry"", or the application of projective algebraic geometry to the study of noncommutative graded rings. The underlying project is to appropriately classify noncommutative surfaces (equivalently, noncommutative graded algebras of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 3), thereby extending the classification, by Professors Artin and Stafford, of noncommutative curves (graded algebras of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension 2).  In particular Professor Stafford intends to study noncommutative analogues of blowing up and down. Jointly with Professors Keeler and Rogalski, Professor Stafford has used projective algebraic geometry to create noetherian connected graded algebras that are not strongly noetherian. The algebraic geometrical perspective may lead to further insights regarding such algebras. Professor Stafford will also work on classifying moduli spaces of vector bundles and modules over various noncommutative algebras. The second main theme, the study of rings of differential operators and their invariants, includes applications to the representation theory of Lie algebras. The techniques developed in this project should be useful for understanding the rational Cherednik algebras and their spherical subalgebras, as introduced by Professors Etingof and Ginzburg.<br/><br/>Much of mathematics is inherently noncommutative; perhaps the most famous example is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: Measuring the position and then measuring the momentum of a particle gives a different answer than first measuring the momentum of the particle and then the position.  This noncommutativity naturally leads to the study of noncommutative algebras. Much of Professor Stafford's research and of the present project is in the area of noncommutative geometry, a theory that uses the techniques and intuition of algebraic geometry to study such algebras. This theory has led to a classification of noncommutative analogues of curves, and the motivating question behind the present project is to extend those results to provide a deeper understanding of noncommutative analogues of surfaces.<br/>"

The PI plans to study tensor categories, in particular fusion categories and categories arising from quantum groups, that can be used to construct 3-manifold invariants.  The PI also plans to study perturbative quantum invariants (due to Vassiliev and Kontsevich) and the related problem of deformation theory of tensor categories.  In the area of quantum information theory, the PI plans to study analogues of foundational results in probability theory such as the central limit theorem, as well as possible applications of representation<br/>theory and quantum groups.<br/><br/>One of the foundations of modern mathematics and physics is non-commutative algebra, which is the study of abstract formulas in which multiplication does not commute (although addition still does). Non-commutative algebra is the essence of quantum mechanics, and it is also fundamental for understanding symmetry, The purpose of this project is to further apply non-commutative algebra to quantum computation and 3-dimensional topology.  Quantum computation is at once an important theoretical elaboration of quantum mechanics and a possible future technology.  Topology is the study of knots, links, and abstract geometric spaces.  It is closely related to symmetry and it has applications to many other areas of mathematics, as well as to questions in physics and economics and even to the study of DNA.<br/>"

The conference will bring together many of the leading researchers in these fields to lecture on the latest developments. In addition to these advanced lectures the conference will also feature survey lectures and discussion sessions aimed for<br/>graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>The combination of the mathematical fields of number theory and arithmetical geometry is concerned in part with the study of counting solutions to algebraic equations (such as Fermat's equation) where the solutions are to be whole numbers. The study of such problems requires some of the most sophisticated modern mathematical theories. The payoff for mastering and developing these theories is great. For instance, there are far-reaching applications to other areas of pure mathematics as well as to areas of applied discrete mathematics such as computer science, to the design of optimally efficient networks and to cryptography. This 4-day conference will feature this important mathematics, especially those aspects closest to the interests of N. M. Katz who is a world leader in these areas.

While computations of the genus zero<br/>invariants have been quite successful, leading to proofs of physicists'<br/>Mirror Symmetry - based predictions in that case, there has been no<br/>progress so far in higher genus. The main obstacle has been a lack of<br/>concrete understanding of the virtual fundamental classes of the moduli<br/>spaces of higher genus stable maps. In recent work, the PI and Kapranov<br/>have developed an approach to virtual classes via differential-graded (dg)<br/>manifolds. Dg-manifolds appear as derived versions of algebro-geometric<br/>moduli spaces. The PI and Kapranov constructed such a structure on the<br/>moduli spaces of stable maps. The greater flexibility of the dg-point<br/>of view restores some of the features that facilitated the genus zero<br/>computations. The ultimate goal is to prove the higher genus ``mirror<br/>theorem'', as predicted by the physicists Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri,<br/>and Vafa. A crucial part of the program involves a novel construction of<br/>a virtual class in situations outside the reach of earlier approaches.<br/>This is of great independent interest in algebraic geometry, as it allows<br/>to extend the theory of virtual classes to all moduli spaces, as opposed<br/>to just the (rather small) subset to which it currently applies.<br/>Ciocan-Fontanine also proposes to establish a relationship between the<br/>genus zero Gromov-Witten theory of a GIT quotient X//G by a reductive<br/>algebraic group G, and that of the associated abelian quotient X//T,<br/>where T is a maximal torus in G. Precise conjectures are made on what the<br/>relationship is, inspired by results obtained recently by the PI and his<br/>collaborators in the case when X is a complex vector space and G is the<br/>general linear group. They are  consistent with expectations on how the<br/>physical theories associated to X//G and X//T are related and will be of<br/>interest to physicists, as well as to algebraic geometers.<br/>The third problem proposed by the PI is to give a proof of a combinatorial<br/>formula for the three-point, genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of complex<br/>Grassmannians. This is the only outstanding unsolved problem remaining in<br/>``Quantum Schubert Calculus.''<br/><br/>This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, which is one of the<br/>oldest branches of modern mathematics. In recent years, the methods and<br/>ideas of algebraic geometry, especially the study of moduli spaces, have<br/>been employed in string theory, a very active part of theoretical physics.<br/>Developments in string theory have  sparked a fruitful interaction between<br/>the two communities of researchers and have led to the discovery and study<br/>of many unexpected new phenomena. The theory of Gromov-Witten invariants<br/>and Mirror Symmetry are particularly striking examples.<br/>"

In particular, the principal investigator continues his research into non-commutative algebraic geometry, investigating particular non-commutative spaces and using the intuition obtained from examination of those particular examples to simultaneously develop the foundations of the subject. Among the particular examples examined are quadric hypersurfaces and, more generally, complete intersections of quadrics, in non-commutative analogues of projective n-space. Another family of particular examples is the rational Cherednik algebras of Etingof and Ginzburg viewed as (possible) non-commutative resolutions of important and naturally occurring deformations of quotient singularities. Recent work of M. Van den Bergh has shown many situations in which certain non-commutative rings provide ""resolutions"" of the singular variety corresponding to their centers: for example, the derived categories of the non-commutative rings are equivalent to the derived categories of a crepant resolution of the center. The principal investigator's research develops and extends this idea to other varieties, particularly the varieties that arise in several papers by string theorists.<br/><br/>Non-commutative algebra arises from the need to solve equations where the solutions are matrices, or more generally linear operators, rather than simply numbers. Such equations arise throughout science. Motivated in part by the wonderfully fruitful interaction between algebra and geometry that lies at the heart of algebraic geometry, there has been great interest in developing a geometry that is an appropriate counterpart to non-commutative algebra. This theme, in both an algebraic and analytic version, has been developed with some vigor and success for more than a decade now. There is growing evidence, provided by developments in string theory, that the universe in which we live is in part governed by a mildly non-commutative geometry. The proposed research can be thought of as an exploration of toy models of this universe, and also as developing basic tools and concepts for understanding non-commutative spaces.<br/>"

The investigator has the hope that this approach will provide a conceptual link between p-adic L-functions, p-adic Galois representations, and p-adic automorphic forms, in the same way that the classical Langlands correspondence does for complex L-functions, automorphic forms, and ell-adic representations. <br/><br/>One principal of current research in number theory is the Langlands program, which proposes a deep relationship between certain complex analytic functions related to algebraic groups called ""automorphic forms"" and the number of integer solutions to classes of polynomial equations, through the medium of functions called ""zeta functions."" The power of this idea was strikingly demonstrated by Wiles' proof of Fermat's theorem, which proceeded by establishing one very special case of the Langlands conjectures.  A second important  principal  in this field is the idea that a full understanding of number theory requires the study, not only of the geometric behavior of equations over the real and complex numbers, but also over the less widely known fields of p-adic numbers. Indeed, many of the important classical objects of number theory, such as modular forms andL-functions, that are important in the Langlands project, have p-adic versions.  These p-adic versions capture important information not accessible from the classical situation.  This project proposes to extend our understanding of the p-adic versions of automorphic forms and zeta functions by extending the philosophy of the Langlands program to the setting of p-adic analysis.  <br/>"

A classical problem due to Langlands and others which motivates much of this research is the description of the Hasse-Weil zeta function of a Shimura variety in terms of automorphic L-functions.  The former is an object defined using cohomology which is expected to contain deep arithmetic and geometric information about the Shimura variety (e.g., the Bloch-Kato and Beilinson conjectures).  The automorphic L-functions are functions of a complex variable with amazing symmetry properties, whose analytic behavior is better understood than that of the zeta functions,  and which can therefore be used (via the hoped-for description) to uncover mysterious properties of the latter.  A complete description of the zeta function requires one to consider primes of bad reduction.<br/>Shimura varieties have historically played an important role in establishing ""higher reciprocity laws"" which are at the heart of the Langlands program, which in general posits an important link between arithmetic (Galois representations) and analysis (automorphic forms).  The study of their bad reduction is little understood in general, but is often crucial: for example, it played a key role in the proof of the local Langlands conjecture for the general linear group over a p-adic field, due to M. Harris and R. Taylor.  The PI proposes to study bad reduction of parahoric type, where many of the issues which complicate the general picture (describing the reduction modulo p, problems with combinatorics and endoscopy, monodromy questions) arise, but where progress is possible by relating the singularities to those in affine flag varieties, and by applying the theory of perverse sheaves and other techniques useful in  geometric representation theory.<br/>"

Properties of moduli spaces are ``universal facts'' about the objects in question. Ideas behind moduli spaces are quite old, dating back to the nineteenth century (at least). In the last thirty years, we have learned a powerful way of studying moduli spaces, thanks to the insights of Grothendieck's school. The last decade has opened up powerful new ways of understanding these spaces. Surprisingly, the impetus often came from other fields, such as theoretical physics or combinatorics. This proposal seeks to approach many pressing problems using techniques from algebraic geometry, highly motivated by insights from other fields. The results in turn should have strong applications in other fields. The investigator also seeks to attract talented high school and undergraduate students into the mathematical sciences, by exposing them to exciting and advanced yet accessible ideas, for example through problem solving; this will be done primarily through the Stanford University Math Camp, a problem solving seminar at Stanford, the Berkeley Math Circle, and various writings. In particular, the goal is to attract students from previously untapped pools of talent. Second, at the graduate level, the investigator will build a center for algebraic geometry at Stanford, by providing resources for graduate students and postdoctoral students, developing new courses, inviting visitors, and sponsoring seminars and conferences, often jointly with other institutions. Third, the investigator will continue to bring sophisticated mathematical ideas (of all levels) to a wider audience through expository writing. The investigator is an algebraic geometer whose primary interest is in intersection theory on moduli spaces. The investigator's goal is to approach many open and classical questions in geometry and related fields using both insights from other fields and modern machinery. The investigator proposes to broaden and deepen his research, by undertaking two longer-term projects, dealing with two of the most important moduli spaces in mathematics: the moduli space of curves, and the Grassmannian and its generalizations. The first project will use modern techniques to illuminate the conjectural and known combinatorial structure behind the ``geometrically natural'' part of the cohomology (or Chow) ring of moduli space of curves (the ``tautological ring''). The second project will use algebro-geometric ideas to solve classical open questions about the structure (algebraic, arithmetic, geometric, enumerative, and more) behind Littlewood-Richardson rules, Schubert problems, and generalizations to other groups. The first project relates to physics, topology, combinatorics, integrable systems, and symplectic geometry; the second involves combinatorics, representation theory, and arithmetic geometry.  Thus both will involve developing a base of knowledge in a broad array of different fields, as well as lifelong working relationships and collaborations with researchers in these fields.<br/><br/>This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Here, ""special"" means that <br/>they may be described as quotients of Hermitian symmetric spaces by discrete <br/>groups.  (There are surprisingly many examples of these spaces.)  The first <br/>specific goal is to understand the topology of a large family of these spaces <br/>that includes the moduli spaces of polarized smooth K3 surfaces and several other <br/>examples arising in singularity theory.  By ""understand the topology of"" we mean <br/>that we beleive these spaces have contractible universal covers, and we want to <br/>prove this.  The idea is to use tools from the theory of negatively-curved metric <br/>spaces that generalize the idea of a negatively-curved Riemannian manifold.  The <br/>second specific goal is to complete a joint project with J. Carlson and D. Toledo, <br/>to prove that the moduli space of cubic hypersurfaces in 4-dimensional projective <br/>space is isomorphic to a quotient of the complex 10-ball by a certain discrete <br/>group.  The third specific goal is to close the last open aspect of Hilbert's <br/>14th problem, by showing that there is a representation of the 2-dimensional <br/>additive group for which the ring of invariants is not finitely generated. <br/><br/>The project addresses concrete problems in algebraic geometry concerning the <br/>classification of various objects like curves and surfaces.  Algebraic geometry <br/>as a subject deals with curves and surfaces that can be defined by means of <br/>equations, and also with higher-dimensional versions of these curves and surfaces.  <br/>An example giving the flavor of the classification problem is that a circle is <br/>essentially the same as an ellipse, because one of them can be got from the other <br/>by stretching the plane in one direction.  An ellipse is also essentially the same <br/>as a parabola, because you can imagine keeping one end of the ellipse fixed and <br/>pushing the other off to infinity.  You can go even further and push the end off <br/>past infinity, so that it reappears on the other side of the plane, and you see a <br/>hyperbola.  An algebraic geometer expresses these ideas by saying that any two <br/>conics are ""projectively equivalent"".  What these shapes all have in common is <br/>that they are defined by simple equations--two variables, and only terms of degree <br/>two or less.  A major part of modern algebraic geometry is studying similar <br/>questions but with the number of variables increased, or the complexity of the <br/>equations increased to allow higher-degree polynomials.  For example, it turns <br/>out that not all curves in the plane that are defined by degree three equations <br/>are projectively equivalent.  The ways in which these curves can differ from each <br/>other is very important for many fields of mathematics and even physics.  This <br/>example was understood in the 19th century, but similar problems remain open.  <br/>One purpose of the current proposal is to gain an understanding of how the <br/>projective equivalence classes of the degree-three ""surfaces"" in four-dimensional <br/>space can vary.  We believe that this may be described in a beautiful and <br/>surprising way using the unit sphere in 10-dimensional complex space.  This result <br/>would be similar to a classical result for degree three curves in the plane.  We <br/>want to prove that our intuition is right.  Another problem to address is that of <br/>finishing a part of Hilbert's 14th problem, one of the celebrated problems posed <br/>by David Hilbert at the beginning of the 20th century.<br/>"

The outstanding algorithmic questions: Is there an algorithm to determine whether the quasi-equations valid in a finite algebra F are finitely based?  Is there an algorithm to determine if the quasi-variety generated by F possesses a natural duality?  Is the class of finite algebras possessing a finite equational basis recursively enumerable?  Is the class of finite algebras generating a residually large variety recursively enumerable?  Among the important structural questions: What collection of algebraic properties is necessary and sufficient for a finitely generated variety to be finitely decidable, or to have few models?  <br/><br/>Purely theoretical research in this branch of general algebra is driven today not by the likelihood of supplying any pressing practical needs, but rather by the sheer difficulty of the intellectual challenge and the tremendous sense of satisfaction that accompanies success.  However, this work, like all of algebra, spawns a constant stream of algorithms, many of which, though feasible, are extremely difficult to implement efficiently on a computer, providing a severe test of the state-of-the-art in hardware and software and programming skills.  The current theorem-proving programs for equational logic are a good example of this phenomenon.  There appears to be a growing realization in the theoretical computer science community that general algebra is the mathematical language in which they most need to be fluent.  The principal investigator believes that research into the interplay between, on the one hand, the existence or nonexistence of algorithms to recognize fundamental properties of finite algebras, and on the other hand, the levels of structural complexity manifested in the algebras---what this project is all about---has the potential not only to expand our understanding of the structural possibilities in finite algebraic systems (which it has already done), but to produce, some day, superior codes and ciphers for secure information transfer.<br/><br/><br/>"

Firstly, Friedlander<br/>proposes to investigate algebraic K-theory and algebraic cycles on<br/>algebraic varieties, with the expectation that his investigation will<br/>contribute both specific computations and general properties of these<br/>fundamental invariants.

In particular, Friedlander plans to investigate further the<br/>semi-topological K-theory of varieties and its connections with algebraic<br/>and topological K-theory.

Thompson defined a fascinating family of groups, which appear in a wide range of mathematical disciplines, including logic, homotopy theory and the measure theory of discrete groups.  Thompson's groups are often the simplest or only known examples of a number of strange group-theoretic phenomena.  Despite a great deal of study by a number of researchers, many properties of these groups are poorly understood.  This project investigates the metric structure of Thompson's groups by developing a better understanding of the Cayley graphs of these groups.  This research builds upon earlier results of the researchers, working together in some cases and separately in others, relating to various metric properties of Thompson's groups.<br/><br/>This award supports US-Spanish cooperative research in mathematics.  It provides travel support for Sean Cleary of The City College of New York and Jennifer Taback of the University at Albany to visit Jose Burillo of the Universitat Politecnia de Catalunya in Barcelona. This mathematical research lies in the area of group theory. A group is an abstract structure, which can often be visualized as a collection of symmetries of a geometrical object. Some common properties of a set of such symmetries can be made abstract in systematic ways.  In this research, groups themselves are studied as geometric objects, and geometric insight can help to understand the algebraic structure of some groups more effectively. This research focuses on a family of groups known as Thompson's groups, after the researcher who first defined them. Thompson's groups can be understood geometrically using pairs of binary trees, an approach that relates this group to questions in theoretical computer science. The broader impacts of this project include these applications to algorithmic questions in computer science related to the shape of binary trees, international involvement and exchange between researchers interested in similar projects, and possible student involvement in research.<br/>"

In the traditional local Langlands correspondence one wishes to describe smooth representations of a reductive group over a local non-archimedian field, such as the field of formal Laurent power series over a finite field, in terms of the Galois group of the local field and the Langlands dual group. When we replace the finite field by the complex field, we are naturally led to loop groups and loop Lie algebras and the central extensions of the latter, i.e., the affine Kac-Moody algebras. The principal investigator wishes to describe the categories of Harish-Chandra modules over an affine Kac-Moody algebra in terms of geometric data associated to the dual group. More specifically, the principal investigator intends to prove that the derived category of a certain category of modules over an affine algebra is equivalent to the derived category of the category of quasicoherent sheaves on the Springer fiber of a nilpotent element of the Langlands dual Lie algebra. In addition, the principal investigator proposes the construction of an extension of the W-algebra associated to an arbitrary simple Lie algebra to a vertex algebra, which carries an action of the dual group by vertex algebra automorphisms. He intends to prove that the category of representations of this vertex algebra is equivalent to the category of representations of a quantum group associated to the Langland dual Lie algebra. Finally, he intends to compute the cohomology of the vacuum representation over an affine Kac-Moody algebra and to relate it to the cohomology of the sheaf of differential operators on the moduli stack of bundles on an algebraic curve.<br/><br/>A lot of effort has been made over the last thirty years in the development of the Langlands Program which ties together seemingly unrelated structures in number theory, automorphic representations and algebraic geometry. The principal investigator expects that uncovering the Langlands duality patterns in the new setting of affine Kac-Moody algebras and more general vertex algebra will significantly enhance our understanding of the Langlands correspondence, which to this day remains a mystery. In particular, the Langlands correspondence is elevated in this case to the level of categories and therefore one can see a much finer structure than was previously possible. It is hoped that the interdisciplinary nature of this proposal will serve to advance discovery and understanding of representation theory of affine Kac-Moody algebras and vertex algebras by relating them to the Langlands Program, and at the same time will stimulate the development of the Langlands Program by bringing in new insights from geometry.<br/>"

The arithmetic version of this integral takes values in a ring of virtual Chow motives.  Many objects that occur naturally in the representation theory of p-adic groups, including characters of representations, orbital integrals, Shalika germs, and Fourier transforms of orbits have conjectural descriptions in terms of points on varieties over finite fields, or more generally as the trace of Frobenius operators on motives.  The research of this proposal will make use motivic integration to affirm that many of these objects have geometric descriptions of the conjectured type.<br/>For many years, mathematicians have dreamed that some ofthe fundamental objects of study in algebra should have a uniform description.  Until recently, it was not possible to carry out this dream, or even to give precise meaning tothe words.  However, by combining three different branches of mathematics -- algebra, geometry, and logic --  it now seems possible to bring this dream to fruition.  This field of research relies on methods of mathematical logic to give a geometric interpretation of what was previously considered through pure analysis.  Specifically, mathematical logic gives a geometric interpretation (called motivic integration) of integral calculus and measure.   The research supported by this grant will use this new tool to give a uniform description of some of the fundamental objects in modern algebra, including symmetry through the mathematics of group representations and their characters.<br/>"

In particular, string dualities suggest<br/>unexpected relations between these diverse areas, many of which<br/>have been proven mathematically.  Recent advances in matrix model<br/>techniques suggest further relations in mathematics.  It can now<br/>be expected that number theory will become related as well.  It<br/>is proposed to investigate unifying themes in duality symmetries<br/>in search of a deeper understanding of these symmetries.  It is<br/>also proposed to work on a range of mathematical problems which<br/>these dualities inspire.  Particular dualities include mirror<br/>symmetry, originally elucidated in the context of Gromov-Witten<br/>theory, and S-dualities, which are duality symmetries of<br/>supersymmetric gauge theories and string theories.  More recently<br/>both have been related to Matrix integrals.  In the case of<br/>supersymmetric gauge theories this gives a relation between<br/>perturbative Feynman diagrams on the one hand and certain<br/>computations on moduli spaces of instantons on the other, which<br/>the PIs propose to elucidate further.  In the particular case of<br/>Gromov-Witten theory, connections have been found with knot<br/>theory.  This leads to a complete computation of the<br/>corresponding invariants for non-compact toric Calabi-Yau<br/>threefolds. The PIs propose to extend these ideas to the compact<br/>case.<br/><br/>The PIs will be exploiting existing connections and forging new<br/>ones between physics and mathematics to address a wide range of<br/>cutting-edge open problems in both fields.  These ideas are<br/>expected to create new links between diverse areas of<br/>mathematics, as certain ideas in physics are equivalent to<br/>important unsolved problems in mathematics.  The techniques<br/>introduced into mathematics are expected to have a revolutionary<br/>influence on core areas of mathematics as related techniques have<br/>in the past.  This project occurs at the same time as an ongoing<br/>effort by the string theory community and will help set future<br/>directions in that field.  String theory seeks to unify the force<br/>of gravity with the electromagnetic and nuclear forces; this is<br/>the problem that eluded Einstein.  It is anticipated that<br/>numerous diverse areas of mathematics will become related to each<br/>other in unexpected ways and that this will have profound<br/>consequences for mathematics and physics.  Due to the broad scope<br/>of the project, a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional<br/>approach is indicated.  The PIs will be bringing together their<br/>networks of collaborators, postdocs, and graduate students and<br/>directing an intense collaborative effort in these areas.  An<br/>interdisciplinary math/physics curriculum will be created to<br/>train future leaders in areas at the interface of mathematics and<br/>physics.

The proposal establishes several new unexpected links between seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics, such as noncommutative algebra, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and physics. Specifically, given a finite dimensional symplectic vector space and a finite group of symplectic automorphisms of that vector space, the authors study symplectic resolutions and symplectic deformations (both commutative and noncommutative) of the corresponding orbifold. This gives a new approach, through Hochschild cohomology, to various  ""stringy"" topological invariants of the orbifold. Thus, one of the main ideas of the proposal is to approach the algebraic geometry of an orbifold via the techniques of noncommutative geometry. The ""symplectic reflection algebras"" provide a basic tool for implementing this idea. A systematic use of symplectic reflection algebras leads to various new results in conventional ""commutative"" algebraic geometry, which have been inaccessible by purely ""commutative"" methods. <br/><br/><br/>   The proposal opens up a wide variety of independent directions for research. One of the basic goals of the proposal is in applying the methods and results developed in one branch of mathematics to a totally different area of mathematics. For example the proposal involves systematic applications of various algebraic techniques to problems in geometry and representation theory. Thus, the proposal enhances the idea of ""unity"" of mathematics. This proposal also has far reaching applications not only in various areas of mathematics, but also has applications in modern mathematical and theoretical physics, especially in quantum physics. Mathematical science as a whole makes a profound contribution to society. The current proposal goes a long way toward promoting interactions between different disciplines and enhancing scientific understanding.<br/>"

As a first step we construct compactifications.  A<br/>generalized Azumaya algebra is a perfect object in the derived<br/>category of the surface, endowed with a multiplication. It turns out<br/>that these objects can be used to give completely canonical<br/>compactifications. There is also a natural way to define stability of<br/>generalized Azumaya algebras (depending on some auxiliary<br/>choices). The result is what we would like to call a GIT stack<br/>compactifying the moduli space of Azumaya algebras. The project<br/>proposes to study these spaces and to use them to define ``Donaldson<br/>type invariants''. In addition the geometry of the moduli spaces will<br/>be studied for particular types of surfaces, e.g., elliptic surfaces<br/>and K3 surfaces. <br/><br/>A complex projective surface can be viewed as a 4 dimensional space<br/>which is endowed with a lot of additional structure. The most<br/>important of these is a choice of a rotation map on the tangent<br/>spaces; it is a rotation over 90 degrees. A lot of research has been<br/>done to classify four dimensional spaces which are endowed with such a<br/>structure. This is usually done by defining invariants (for example<br/>numbers) of complex projective surfaces which can be used to tell them<br/>apart. A very basic example are the Betti numbers, which are<br/>dimensions of cohomology groups. To give you an idea, an element of<br/>the second cohomology group corresponds to a 2 dimensional subspace of<br/>the 4-fold. Of course we are not simply enumerating these; we use a<br/>coarser equivalence relation (deformation equivalence).  <br/>   Here is a question: How many of these 2 dimensional subspaces have<br/>the property that the tangent space at any point is preserved by the<br/>rotation that defines the complex structure on our 4-fold? Such a<br/>subspace is called a complex curve on the complex surface. This<br/>question has been much studied, and is related to the Hodge<br/>conjecture. However, in this project we go the other way. Namely, we<br/>look at other objects: Complex projective bundles over our 4-fold<br/>determine a degree 2 cohomology class as well, and they are typically<br/>not those which can be represented by complex curves. It turns out<br/>that by looking at all possible complex projective bundles<br/>representing the given cohomology class we get a new space which, if<br/>we can understand it, tells us a lot about the original 4-fold. All<br/>kinds of new invariants of the original complex projective surface can<br/>be defined in terms of these moduli spaces. It is the geometry of<br/>these moduli spaces that will be studied in this project. There is a<br/>lot of techincal machinery that has to be developed before we can<br/>begin the exploration of more geometrical properties and part of the<br/>project will be devoted to developing this machinery.<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>"

Friedlander and Daniel R. Grayson<br/><br/>This grant will contribute to the support of four research conferences in algebraic K-theory over a 3-year period.  One conference, a 5-day conference, is to take place in Canada at the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques on the campus of the Universite de Montreal.  The majority of the funding for that conference is expected to come from Canadian sources.  The other three conferences will be the 10th, 11th, and 12th in the series of annual ""Great Lakes K-theory"" weekend conferences occurring at American universities.  These conferences will focus on exhilarating progress and expected new developments in settling long-open conjectures.  In August, 2002, Voevodsky was awarded the Fields Medal at the ICM in Beijing in recognition for his fundamental contributions, which have yielded important results modulo 2: the Milnor conjecture and the Bloch-Kato conjecture.  The proof of the Milnor conjectures tells us something remarkable and special about fields: that the Galois cohomology ring modulo 2 is presented by explicit generators in degree 1 and explicit relations in degree 2.  Work of Rost and Voevodsky already in hand is expected to lead to the proof of the Bloch-Kato conjecture at odd primes, which by work of Suslin and Voevodsky will imply the Beilinson conjecture relating motivic cohomology to etale cohomology, which in turn is expected to lead to a proof of the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture using work of Grayson, Friedlander, and Suslin or of Bloch, Lichtenbaum, Friedlander, and Suslin, that relates algebraic K-theory for varieties to motivic cohomology.  The Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjecture has been the driving force for research in K-theory since the early 1970s, and has been the focus of the interplay between related areas of geometry, number theory and topology.  A consequence will be an explicit computation of the K-groups of the ring of integers, covering the p-primary parts for prime numbers p for which the Vandiver conjecture is known.  The Vandiver conjecture is an old conjecture from number theory, has been checked by computations for all prime numbers smaller than 12 million, and recent theoretical progress using algebraic K-theory has been made on it by Kurihara and Soule.  The conferences to be supported by this grant will contribute to the dissemination of dramatic new developments in the subject as well as introduce this important mathematical subject to the next generation of American mathematicians.  Because of K-theory's influence in much of modern mathematics, we expect that these conferences will make a significant contribution to the American mathematical community's efforts to maintain its world leadership in fundamental<br/>mathematics.<br/><br/>K-theory is a relatively new field of mathematics which has grown and prospered in the past 40 years.  One now finds that K-theory plays an important role in mathematical physics (e.g., various conformal field theories), classical actions of groups on vector spaces, number theory, and especially number theory.  K-theory is a way of examining features of systems of polynomial equations by considering the possible ways to associate flat planes (or spaces of any dimension) to each solution. As a concrete example, imagine that the solutions are the points on the surface of the earth, and for each point consider the plane containing that point and the horizon.  In general, these planes or spaces may twist and turn as one moves from one point to another, nearby or far away, so a proper understanding of the possibilities requires the use  of topology, the study of gradual change.  Motivic cohomology is another way to glean information about solutions of equations that uses homotopy theory and topology in a different way.  One examines the possible ways to augment the original system of equations by new ones that have one or more free parameters.  The conferences supported by this grant  will continue a strong tradition of delivering the highest quality research talks to the mathematical community, including graduate students and junior mathematicians in postdoctoral positions.  These conferences should encourage a new generation of younger American mathematicians to participate in various research programs concerning algebraic K-theory. With many issues still unsettled, the field is ripe for further exciting developments.<br/><br/><br/>"

Tight closure theory was developed by Hochster and Huneke, and leads to the notion of F-regular rings. This class of rings includes well-studied examples such as determinantal rings and normal monomial rings, but several questions about F-regular rings remain unanswered. The theory of local cohomology has applications to fundamental questions such as determining the minimal number of equations needed to define an algebraic set. Local cohomology modules often have useful finiteness properties, and the investigator proposes to continue his work on Lyubeznik's conjecture, which states that local cohomology modules of regular rings have finitely many associated prime ideals. The work on intersection multiplicities will focus on the recently developed theory of Roberts rings: these rings provide a framework in which intersection multiplicities have several desirable properties. Some of the questions described in the proposal create possibilities for students to be involved in research by performing computer verifications to suggest answers and plausible approaches. The investigator will also be involved in curriculum development in areas related to this proposal, and intends to enhance opportunities for students interested in algebra in the Deep South.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with questions in commutative algebra. This is a field closely related to algebraic geometry: while algebraic geometry focuses on the geometry of solution sets of polynomial equations, in commutative algebra the main objects of study are certain functions on these solution sets. It continues to develop a fascinating interaction with several other branches of mathematics, and is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in engineering, coding theory, cryptography, and other applications of strategic interest. <br/>"

Y. Yildirim has over the last three years determined the correlations of a short divisor sum which approximates the prime numbers. The corresponding correlations for primes were conjectured by Hardy and Littlewood in 1923 and are now referred to as the prime r-tuple conjecture. The proof of this conjecture is probably far beyond our current state of knowledge, but the corresponding result for the short divisor sum is now available. Further, using the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem one can also obtain all the correlations when one of the divisor sums is replaced by the primes. These two types of correlations together with positivity allow us to obtain information about primes in the form of lower bounds on certain sums over primes. The first and main aim of this project is to apply these new correlation results to the problem of  finding small gaps between  primes. The main question to be answered is whether one can prove that there are infinitely many prime gaps shorter than any small multiple of the average gap size. At present it is only known that there are small gaps of size less than 0.248 times the average spacing. The method we use is based on moments for short divisor sums in short intervals. Preliminary work indicates we should be able to substantially improve on all previous results. There are many possible refinements and a variety of ways to apply the moment results which will be investigated. The second aim of this project is to refine the correlation results so far obtained and extend their range of applicability. A third aim is to seek further applications of the method to primes in arithmetic progressions and zeros of the Riemann zeta-function.<br/><br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with proving results on the distribution of primes. The primes have been a topic of interest since the Greeks who first proved both the infinitude of primes and the unique factorization of all integers into primes. The primes are intimately connected with the Riemann hypothesis and are fundamental objects in both number theory and mathematics. New results and methods concerning primes have been used in many areas of mathematics, physics, and computer science. To cite a recent example, the celebrated proof that primality testing can be done in polynomial time depended on the existence of primes   p   with  p - 1 having a large prime factor, a result proved by Fouvry 17 years ago which up to this year had only an esoteric application to the first case of Fermat's last theorem.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The proposed projects are: 1) the study of higher Massey products on derived categories of coherent sheaves on projective varieties; 2) the determination of the rings of algebraic cycles on Jacobians of curves modulo algebraic equivalence; 3) the study of intersection theory on the moduli spaces of higher spin curves in connection with the generalized Witten's conjecture; 4) the study of categories of holomorphic vector bundles on noncommutative tori; 5) the study of minimal representations of p-adic groups and their relation with the theory of automorphic forms.<br/><br/>A significant part of this proposal is motivated by mathematical conjectures originating from physics. In particular, one of the five projects is motivated by a conjecture of Kontsevich, the ""homological mirror conjecture"", which is an attempt to give a mathematical foundation to mirror symmetry phenomena discovered in string theory. Another of the projects is devoted to the study of geometric objects relevant for a certain conjecture of Witten in connection with the theory of gravity. From a mathematical point of view, this proposal belongs to the fields of algebraic geometry and representation theory. Algebraic geometry is the part of mathematics studying geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. The richness of this area is due to the fact that it combines algebraic techniques with geometric intuition. Representation theory is essentially the study of symmetries given by linear transformations. Because of the ubiquity of symmetries of this type, representation theory is relevant for many other fields, including number theory and physics.<br/><br/>"

The  main topics of the conference are q-hypergeometric functions, Rogers-Ramanujan identities, exactly integrable models and quantum field theory; alternating sign matrices and determinants; quantum computing; and the Riemann zeta-function, random matrices and quantum correlators.  Each of these topics has been enriched by interactions between mathematics and physics. For example, deeper understanding of the alternating sign matrix conjecture of combinatorics was recently found when it was connected with the XXZ spin 1/2 model (on an odd number of sites) from statistical mechanics.  In another recent example, Di Francesco and collaborators were able to exactly compute meander configuration exponents using methods of conformal field theory.  The main goal of the conference is to bring mathematicians and physicists together to discuss and learn recent developments in these current topics. This interaction should help foster new developments in both mathematics and physics. There are eleven plenary speakers: George E. Andrews, Robert Calderbank,  Philippe Di Francesco, Daniel Gottesman, Michio Jimbo, Barry McCoy, Tetsuji Miwa, James Propp, Michael Rubinstein, Xavier G. Viennot, and F.Y. Wu. There are thirteen 20 minute speakers. A number of graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s are participating. <br/><br/>Number Theory is concerned with properties of integers and is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. In the last 20 years Number Theory has had  important applications to cryptography. The security of some modern cryptographic methods depends on the complexity of factoring integers. In 1994, Peter Shor showed theoretically how this complexity could be drastically reduced using a quantum computer. A quantum computer is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and is at present only a theoretical device.  The concept of a quantum computer was first introduced by the Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman in his famous course on computation given at Caltech, 1983-1986. It is believed that in the next 20 years the new generation of computers will be quantum computers. This will necessitate synthesis of mathematics, quantum field theory and technology. This conference, Number Theory and Combinatorics in Physics, hosted at the University of Florida, is a forum where progress on such a synthesis can be made.<br/>"

The main tool of this investigation is the relative trace formula, the study of which was initiated by the PI. One of the main difficulties is a conjectural combinatorial identity (the fundamental lemma). Recently, the PI has obtained the identity in question is an interesting case. The method may apply to other cases as well.<br/><br/>From a broader perspective, Langlands program deals with the harmonic analysis of certain linear operators on the spaces of automorphic functions defined on reductive groups.

Invariant theory, with roots in the 17th century, has<br/>proven to be a robust area of mathematical endeavor.  Over the<br/>course of the last 50 years, it has found new applications in<br/>algebraic topology, representation theory, algebraic geometry, as<br/>well as many traditional areas such as number theory and<br/>commutative algebra.  Professor Lesh is on the scientific<br/>organizing committee for Ingo2003, which is an initiative of<br/>research groups in Aberdeen, Manchester, and Goettingen working<br/>in the areas of algebraic topology, representation theory, and<br/>commutative algebra. These scientists have found that<br/>communication across narrow specialty boundaries can bring great<br/>scientific benefits. A central theme of the conference will be<br/>the many connections of invariant theory to other fields. In the<br/>past, conferences organized around the topic of invariant theory<br/>have tended to be rather specialized, for example, concentrating<br/>on computational aspects, or emphasizing interaction with at most<br/>one other subject area, such as algebraic topology. Ingo2003 is<br/>being organized with a much broader scientific base and will be<br/>interdisciplinary in a global sense, as well as having a specific<br/>focus on younger researchers. Some of the topics represented in<br/>discussions will be modular representation theory, coinvariants<br/>and the ""hit problem,"" algebraic topology, and Hasse-Schmidt<br/>differentials and differential Galois theory.<br/><br/>One aspect of invariant theory is studying the question of what<br/>elements of a changing situation must in fact remain fixed. For<br/>example, the points along the axis of a spinning globe remain in<br/>the same position as the globe turns. The point at the center of<br/>the spindle of a tape player stays fixed while other points on<br/>the spindle turn around it. More surprisingly, rotating a circle<br/>around its center and then flipping the circle over any line<br/>through its center must leave a different line in a fixed<br/>position.  The search for such ""invariant"" or ""fixed"" elements of<br/>a situation can be very subtle, and it arises in a wide variety<br/>of mathematical problems and physical applications. The goal of<br/>the Ingo2003 conference is to allow mathematicians from differing<br/>mathematical disciplines to learn techniques from each other, and<br/>to disseminate sets of mathematical tools developed in one<br/>discipline to other disciplines that might find them useful.<br/>"

Witherspoon studies representations of these algebras as linear transformations on vector spaces, and their cohomology, which measures properties of the algebras and their representations. Witherspoon will compute the Hochschild cohomology of certain crossed product algebras arising from group actions on spaces. There are expected connections to some new theories of cohomology of orbifolds, and Witherspoon's research will inform the effort by many mathematicians to understand these cohomology theories. At the same time it will be of interest to quantum group theorists as Witherspoon expects, based on her current work, that deformations of these crossed product algebras come from representations of certain quantum groups on these algebras. Related work that Witherspoon proposes will involve progress on some basicquestions about Hopf algebras and quantum groups, such as finite generation of cohomology, and three-manifold invariants arising from finite quantum groups. Another project involves fundamental questions about how representations of an algebra are related to those of a subalgebra. Witherspoon will continue her work in generalizing Clifford theory from groups to certain types of algebras, with the goal of finding constructive answers to these questions, and will apply such a theory to answer questions about representations of algebras.<br/><br/>Algebra is the expression of physical objects as equations or functions. A curve or surface is the graph of an equation, and its physical properties may be determined directly from the equation. More general algebraic systems such as collections of many functions, called algebras, encode information about more complicated physical objects. For example, if an object (such as a crystal or a molecule) exhibits symmetry, this symmetry is expressed in its corresponding algebra. Many such examples are well understood, and the mathematics involved is exploited in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. However there are many systems that are less well understood, such as the quantum groups that arose in mathematical physics less than two decades ago. Witherspoon's work involves the study of properties of such algebras and their representations as physical objects. One technique that is used frequently in Witherspoon's work is cohomology. Witherspoon will compute the cohomology of various types of algebras, as well as use other methods to study them and their representations. Witherspoon's proposed activities will result in a collection of publications on a wide range of topics within algebra that will also impact fields outside algebra such as geometry and mathematical physics. Most of the activities address questions, in which many mathematicians are currently interested, while others are new ideas that will find an interested audience upon publication.<br/><br/>"

Specifically, the conference will emphasize two areas where there have been significant advances in recent years, namely 1) geometry and physics, and 2) representation theory. The discussion of advances in geometry and physics will focus on new ideas coming from quantum field theory and string theory, and their geometric consequences. This discussion will involve diverse topics, such as mirror symmetry, Seiberg-Witten theory, twisted K-theory, chiral algebras, noncommutative Yang-Mills theory, formality theory, intersection theory on moduli spaces, etc. The discussion of advances in representation theory will focus on the interactions between representation theory and geometry; these interactions have recently led to the development of powerful new methods of studying representations. Some of the methods are the geometric Langlands program, quiver varieties, geometric realizations of quantum groups and their representations. <br/><br/>The conference ``Unity of Mathematics'' is designed to bring together a diverse group of leading senior mathematicians and young researchers for a discussion of the most important recent developments in mathematics, with the focus on the topics ""geometry and physics"", and ""representation theory"". The first topic involves developments in geometry that were triggered by recent breakthroughs in quantum field theory (which describes the motion of elementary particles) and string theory (which attempts to unify quantum field theory and Einstein's general relativity). Although string theory has not yet made successful experimental predictions, it is striking that it did make successful predictions in geometry. These predictions are the first example in the history of science when geometry served as a ``lab'' for theoretical physics, and provide as much evidence that string theory is ``correct'' as an experimental verification would be. The second topic involves developments in representation theory (a branch of algebra that could be very roughly defined as  spectroscopy of symmetry), which have resulted from systematic use of deep ideas from geometry and topology (theory of shape). The conference will attract numerous mathematicians working in different fields, as well as many theoretical physicists. Young researchers are expected to find the conference especially useful because it will discuss developments occurring at boundaries between fields. This may well be an epiphany to those trained in a narrow specialty. The meeting will be a unique occasion; prominent mathematicians will not only review recent advances but will discuss their broad implications for mathematics. Special provisions will be made to encourage young researchers, graduate students, women and minorities to participate. <br/>"

The first involves Temperley-Lieb and Jones algebras.    Temperley-Lieb algebras appeared initially in statistical mechanics as transfer matrices between physical states.  Later they were discovered to provide important invariants of knots and links.  Similarly, the Jones algebras are related to knots and links on an annulus.  Results in knot theory are playing an ever more significant role in such topics as DNA analysis and protein folding.  The proposed work is to study certain algebras of matrices that commute with the Temperley-Lieb and Jones algebras. The goal is to understand the associated combinatorics and its applications in addressing a variety of problems in areas such as knot theory and group theory.  The second project studies down and up operators on sets with a partial order.  Such operators have appeared in many different contexts -- for example, in physics where they are often interpreted as creation and annihilation operators on particles.  The algebra generated by these operators reveals much information about the set; it encodes essential combinatorial data; and it contributes to the understanding of such things as random walks on the set.  The final project investigates certain reflections in hyperplanes (mirrors) related to extended affine root systems, their combinatorics, and their actions on various spaces.  All the projects involve the representation theory of algebras and groups.<br/><br/>The goal of representation theory is to ``represent'' an abstract algebraic object as explicit matrices (rectangular arrays of numbers) that describe its action on a space.  The algebraic object might be acting as the symmetries of a crystal or as rotations of a physical system.  Representation theory has had an enormous impact on particle physics, on the study of crystals in chemistry, and on mathematical research ever since the pioneering work of mathematician Issai Schur and physicist Hermann Weyl in the 1920's. Its continuing vitality is evidenced by much current activity and many open problems.   Combinatorial representation theory takes the concrete realization one step further by associating to such representations, combinatorial objects that can be manipulated and counted explicitly.  The subject has had an explosion of activity in recent years with numerous important applications in diverse areas of mathematics and physics. This proposal seeks to understand the combinatorics of certain algebras called Temperley-Lieb algebras and various other related algebras.  Temperley-Lieb algebras first arose in statistical mechanics where they were used to describe the transfer of energy between physical states. In the 1980's, Vaughan Jones showed that they are related to the study of knots.  By studying various properties of them, the project seeks to develop new ways of distinguishing knots and links.  This has potential applications to such subjects as DNA analysis and protein folding.   Some components of these projects can be undertaken by undergraduate and beginning graduate students, as combinatorics provides an excellent vehicle to introduce students to research because of its concrete nature.  The principal investigator, Georgia Benkart,  feels it is important to expose students to mathematical research and to convince them that they can understand and take an active role in research.  Students will participate in the project in essential ways and will conduct their own research projects related to the ones proposed here.<br/>"

This aspect and its direct relation to robotics and vision will be discussed by several of the Principal Lecturers at the Advanced Study Institute conference.  Group theory, beginning with the work of Burnside, Frobenius and Schur, has been influenced by even more general problems. As a result, general group actions have provided the setting for powerful methods within group theory and for the use of groups in applications to physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and signal processing. These aspects, too, will be covered in detail by many of the Principal Lecturers.<br/><br/>The fusion of algebra, analysis and geometry, and their application to real world problems, have been dominant themes underlying mathematics for over a century. Geometric algebras, introduced and classified by Clifford in the late 19th century, have played a prominent role in this effort, as seen in the mathematical work of Cartan, Brauer, Weyl, Chevelley, Atiyah, and Bott, and in applications to physics in the work of Pauli, Dirac and others. The topics of the Advanced Study Institute conference, geometric algebras and computational group harmonic analysis, have emerged as key tools for resolving the ever expanding conceptual and computational demands on signal and image processing as it rapidly grows in importance. Signal and image processing is used in remote sensing, micro and unmanned vehicles, biological processing and neural and quantum computing. The ASI will bring together world leaders from both academia and industry with extensive multidisciplinary backgrounds for an interactive forum; they will initiate new efforts and intensify existing efforts towards a unified computational framework for the advancement of a broad range of applications. The forum will provide opportunities for young scientists and engineers to learn more about problem areas and about the crucial role played by new mathematical insights from recognized experts in this vital and growing area of both pure and applied science. The team-authored proceedings, to be written by the lecturers, will offer these insights to those unable to attend.  A key feature of both the ASI and the proceedings will be the presentation of problems and applications that will shape the twenty-first century computational technology base. <br/>"

The investigator intends to extract combinatorial structure from the non-semisimple representations of these algebras, a key example of which is the crystal graph structure on the irreducible representations of the affine Hecke algebra of type A. The representation theory of Hecke algebras has applications in many areas of mathematics. Hecke algebras appear naturally in the representation theory of semisimple p-adic groups and are also a tool in the study of the modular representation theory of reductive groups over finite fields. They have intimate connections to quantum groups, statistical mechanics, and knot theory. Double affine Hecke algebras were defined by Cherednik and used by him to prove certain conjectures of Macdonald. They have connections to harmonic analysis of symmetric spaces and the classical theories of hypergeometric functions and q-hypergeometric functions.<br/><br/>This is a project in representation theory, which is the study of symmetry.  Representation theory gives us the tools to solve problems about any system that exhibits symmetry, and so has wide applications in chemistry, physics, computer science, and even within other areas of mathematics. The investigator will study the most basic objects whose symmetries are encoded in a structure called the Hecke algebra. One of her primary methods is to ""glue"" these basic objects together in such a way that their global controlling structure is apparent---much in the same way that organizing the elements into the periodic table gives us information about the shared chemical properties of halogens (or other groups).<br/><br/>"

It is concerned with understanding systems with symmetry by representing them in matrix form. One of the most difficult areas of representation theory is that of groups over p-adic fields, which has strong connections with number theory. One of the main tools in the study of these groups is the use of affine Hecke algebras. G. Lusztig proposes to continue the study of affine Hecke algebras with unequal parameters and in particular to establish a geometric interpretation for their canonical basis. Also it is proposed to establish the existence of the corresponding asymptotic Hecke algebras. This should give new information on the representation theory of groups over p-adic fields. It is also proposed to further investigate the analogue of the Deligne-Lusztig theory in the case where finite fields are replaced by certain finite rings. This again should have applications to the representation theory of groups over p-adic fields. It is proposed to further investigate the canonical bases of quantized enveloping algebras from the point of view of perverse sheaves. It is also proposed to continue the study of character sheaves on reductive groups. Progress in these topics is expected to have applications to various parts of mathematics and theoretical physics.<br/><br/>The theory of group representations attempts to study the idea of symmetry by means of matrices, which are more amenable to computation. One of the oldest applications of representation theory is the theory of Fourier series, widely used in engineering and applied science. More recently, ideas from representation theory have been used in chemistry (study of crystals) and physics (theory of elementary particles). G. Lusztig's research is concerned with applications of methods of algebraic topology (study of shapes by means of algebra) and algebraic geometry (geometric study of equations) to obtain new results on group representations which could not be obtained by other methods. <br/>"

One major theme of the proposal is to extend the theta lift introduced by Kudla and Millson to the full cohomology of locally symmetric spaces of orthogonal and unitary type and to cohomology with non-trivial coefficients. The other major theme is based on recent work of the PI in collaboration with Bruinier establishing a duality result between the Kudla-Millson lift and the singular theta lift first introduced by Borcherds. Based on this, the main goal is to establish (further) generalizations of the Borcherds lift with applications to arithmetic algebraic geometry and Riemannian geometry.<br/><br/>This proposal deepens the relationship between several different areas of mathematics related to number theory, the most classical discipline in mathematics. More precisely, it involves an interaction between representation theory (the study of symmetries) on one hand and geometry on the other. Interesting in their own right, these subjects have contributed to advances in cryptography and physics, among others. Specifically, parts of this project are concerned with certain aspects of the work of Fields medalist R. Borcherds that turned out to be important in string theory. It is therefore not unreasonable to expect applications of the proposed work to theoretical physics. The collaborations outlined in this project are part of a larger network of researchers working in these kind of mathematical problems nationally and internationally. Through these collaborations, the proposed work strengthens this infrastructure, which has been effective in facilitating research progress and dissemination of results."
