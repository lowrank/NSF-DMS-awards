Three of these projects<br/>study families of noncommutative algebras arising naturally in various<br/>branches of algebra. The first project is to study finite dimensional<br/>irreducible representations of Clifford algebras of forms of higher<br/>degree. The approach in studying these algebras is to work on a<br/>reformulation of the questions in terms of moduli spaces of certain<br/>reflexive sheaves on hypersurfaces. Another goal is to investigate<br/>arithmetic applications of these results. The second project (joint<br/>with D. Chan) is continuation of previous work on sheaves of maximal<br/>orders on complex, projective, algebraic surfaces. The main goal is to<br/>classify various classes of such sheaves of maximal orders. This work<br/>follows recently developed ideas in noncommutative algebraic<br/>geometry. The third project (joint with A. Ram) is to investigate<br/>whether the Springer correspondence can be set up for rational<br/>Cherednik algebras along the lines of single graded Hecke<br/>algebras. Another goal is to investigate whether these algebras can be<br/>related to N. Wallach's approach to the Springer correspondence. The<br/>last project (joint with M. Banagl) is to investigate whether there<br/>exist self-dual sheaves compatible with the intersection chain sheaves<br/>on reductive Borel-Serre compactifications of locally symmetric spaces<br/>associated to semisimple algebraic groups defined over rational<br/>numbers. <br/><br/>In the last few decades, the interaction between various branches of<br/>mathematics and theoretical physics has proved to be especially<br/>enriching for all the fields. One important thread in these<br/>connections has been algebraic geometry, a very old subject that dates<br/>back at least to ancient Greece.  Algebraic geometry is the area of <br/>mathematics that studies solutions to multi-variable polynomial <br/>equations as geometric objects.  It has found applications not only in<br/>mathematics, but also in computer science, coding theory, robotics and<br/>string theory in physics to name a few areas impacted by it. The first<br/>two projects of this proposal use tools from this subject to study<br/>""algebras"" that are of interest to a wide range of mathematicians and<br/>physicists. It is useful to describe the whole family of such classes<br/>of algebras as a geometric object, and a goal of this project is to<br/>obtain such descriptions.  The third aspect of this research is part<br/>of a subject called representation theory. The main objects of study<br/>here are ""representations"", processes which encode information about<br/>symmetry in nature. The last part of this proposal stands at the<br/>intersection of three subjects: number theory (where number systems<br/>are studied), representation theory, and topology. In topology spaces<br/>are studied to determine which properties do not change under elastic<br/>deformations such as twisting and stretching.  The spaces to be<br/>studied in this research encode number theoretic information. The goal<br/>is to investigate whether there are invariants of these spaces which<br/>themselves satisfy some symmetry."

The Hilbert  correspondence generalizes De Rham theory, and establishes a deep connection between the topology of a given complex algebraic variety (as encoded in the category of perverse sheaves on the variety) and the behavior of systems of differential operators defined on the variety (which are encoded as D-modules on the variety;  that is, as sheaves of modules over the sheaf of rings of differential operators on the variety).  The  proposed p-adic analogue would perform a similar function for varieties over the p-adic numbers.  It would yield an equivalence between the (currently conjectural) category of ``crystalline perverse sheaves'' on such a variety, and the (again conjectural) category of weakly admissible filtered D-modules equipped with a Frobenius operator.  The category of crystalline perverse sheaves is believed to carry both geometric and also arithmetic information about the variety  to which it is attached, and would for example be a natural ingredient in a p-adic analogue of Beilinson's theory of regulators.  This gives some hint of the important role that such a category of sheaves can be expected to play in the local analysis at p of systems of Diophantine equations.<br/><br/>The problem of solving equations is one of the most basic in mathematics, going back at least to the mathematicians of ancient Greece, such as Diophantus.  He studied the problem of solving equations in whole numbers; such equations are now known as Diophantine equations. Since the work of Descartes and Fermat, it has been understood that geometry provides a powerful tool for analyzing systems of equations, even if one is at first more interested in the equations from an arithmetic point of view.  For this reason, the development of powerful geometric tools is important for progress in the theory of Diophantine equations.  In this project, the investigator and his collaborator intend to develop such tools, by extending known techniques in the usual so-called archimedean geometry to the context of non-archimedean, or p-adic, geometry. This geometry, which has a strong arithmetic  flavor, provides a crucial geometric setting for the analysis of Diophantine equations, and these techniques are expected to yield several new developments in that analysis.  Such developments are important not only because they enrich what continues to be one of the center pieces of the mathematical tradition, but because the theory of Diophantine equations has deep interconnections with the theory of discrete processes, and especially with the theory of codes, so that progress in theory of Diophantine equations can be expected to yield progress in these fields."

This extends Knudson's previous work on the homology of rank one groups over such rings.  In addition, a new homology theory based on algebraic cycles in the product of a scheme with the simplicial classifying scheme of an algebraic group is constructed and its properties investigated.  The hope is that this construction will lead to a proof of the Friedlander-Milnor conjecture concerning the homology of algebraic groups made discrete.  Also, the investigator's previous work on the structure of special linear groups over integral Laurent polynomial rings is used in the study of the Burau representation of the braid groups.  This representation is known to be faithful for three strings and unfaithful for five or more strings; the remaining case of four strings is singled out for study in this project.

A seemingly unrelated part of this project concerns the so-called Burau representation of the braid groups which is intimately connected with knot theory.

Selmer groups have traditionally been an important tool<br/>for studying the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve over a number<br/>field. They have also played an important role in proving special cases<br/>of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture which provides a relationship<br/>between arithmetic properties of an elliptic curve E and the behavior of<br/>the Hasse-Weil L-function for E.  In recent years it has become clear that<br/>certain natural generalizations of the Selmer group should provide similar<br/>conjectural relationships to the behavior of much more general kinds of<br/>L-functions. Iwasawa theory provides a framework for studying these<br/>conjectures by allowing the L-functions to vary in families defined by<br/>congruences modulo powers of a prime p. This leads to the notion of a<br/>p-adic L-function and to the formulation of analogous conjectural<br/>relationships relating the behavior of such p-adic L-functions to the<br/>corresponding Selmer groups. The investigator, together with several<br/>collaborators, intends to study this kind of conjectural relationship in<br/>some new settings: (1) p-adic analogues of classical Artin L-functions,<br/>(2) families of L-functions associated to certain families of Galois<br/>representations of varying dimension. In addition, the investigator<br/>intends to study relationships between Selmer groups associated to modular<br/>forms and ideal class groups of certain number fields and to study some<br/>unresolved questions about the derivatives of p-adic L-functions.<br/><br/>One of the fundamental questions in the theory of numbers is the study<br/>of solutions of an algebraic equation. The difficulty of this question<br/>depends on the degree of the equation and the number of variables. It<br/>has been understood since antiquity how to study this question when the<br/>degree is one or two and the number of variables is also one or two.<br/>However, the question becomes much more subtle when one considers<br/>equations of degree three, even if the number of variables is just two.<br/>A fundamental conjecture concerning this kind of equation was formulated<br/>in the 1960s by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. Although considerable progress<br/>has been made since then, the conjecture remains unresolved. Such equations<br/>define a class of curves known as ""elliptic curves."" The study of their<br/>properties has proved to be of importance in crytography - designing codes<br/>for the secure transmission of information. Professor Greenberg intends to<br/>continue his study of ""Selmer groups"" which have been a traditional tool in<br/>understanding the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and in studying<br/>the conjecture of Birch and Swinnnerton-Dyer.

Some examples are sets of values x having an (x,y)<br/>with entries in the field that satisfy the relation. One of these is the<br/>Davenport's problem of determining equivalence classes of polynomials<br/>according to their value sets over finite fields. Describing complex<br/>multiplication fields, generated by those x with (x,y) a special<br/>elliptic curve torsion point, is a variant. A relation with a data<br/>variable x produces a permutation group G: The Galois group. The<br/>investigator treats these as cases of the Inverse Galois<br/>Problem (IGP). One goal is to decide, from certain lists<br/>of relations, if some have the rational numbers as definition field.<br/>Serious group theory helped solve Davenport's 1965 problem and Schur's<br/>exceptional polynomial problem (1919; see below). Further, modular<br/>curves reveal complex multiplication to be a version of Schur's<br/>problem. Having command of all finite simple groups has many<br/>applications. One is to list those groups attached to exceptional<br/>polynomials. Knowing many characters of Chevalley groups showed Thompson<br/>and Voelklein where to find series of solutions to the IGP. Yet, it will<br/>require more than massive group theory to solve the whole IGP. The<br/>investigator uses Modular Towers, a modular curve generalization, to<br/>finesse unknowable group classifications. He and his students let a<br/>known group G, and a prime p dividing the order of G, seed the base level<br/>of a Modular Tower. Higher tower levels code relations with mysterious<br/>groups covering G related to p. Coherent maps between the tower levels<br/>replace details on these intricate covering groups. Work of Y. Ihara and<br/>J.P. Serre inspire showing that Modular Towers has many properties of<br/>their special, modular curve, case. For example, high tower levels for a<br/>G with no Z/p quotient should have no rational points. For certain groups G, <br/>and the prime p=2, this extends Serre's program on spin structures. The <br/>investigator applies new spin-like structures to all cases when p is 2 and <br/>to all primes p. <br/><br/>PRACTICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY AND IGP OVER FINITE FIELDS: Modern cryptosystems<br/>aim to secure electronic transfers of data. Exceptional functions act as<br/>permutations on infinitely many finite fields. A special case of the<br/>Inverse Galois Problem over finite fields asks how to construct<br/>exceptional functions. These scrambling functions look simple. Users can<br/>easily apply them (up to 1993, all came from the 19th century). Still,<br/>finding them has been difficult. Fried (UCI), Guralnick (USC) and Saxl<br/>(Cambridge) nearly classify them. This solves old problems (Dickson 1896<br/>and Carlitz 1965). They also produce unexpected new examples. Their best<br/>discovery is that exceptional polyomial Galois groups (excluding now<br/>well-understood cases) have the affine geometric property. This is<br/>useful for it gives the degrees of exceptional polynomials. Yet, it is<br/>also a difficult challenge: There can be no final description of all<br/>affine groups. The investigator with A. Mezard approaches affine groups<br/>by generalizing to all algebraic relations over finite fields<br/>Grothendieck's famous results for tame relations. Applications for<br/>exceptional functions alone include ways to manipulate data for<br/>encryption and to assure integrity. This will mean faster, more<br/>efficient and accurate file back-ups; more stable software; and more<br/>secure data transfers.<br/><br/>"

Plenty of time will be reserved for<br/>discussions between the participants, and it is expected that new<br/>collaborations and research associations between Indian and<br/>US mathematicians will come from these contacts.<br/><br/>II. In recent years both US and Indian mathematicians have made<br/>major contributions to the fields of Commutative Algebra, <br/>Algebraic Geometry, and Quantum Algebra. These three fields<br/>increasingly use tools from Computational Algebraic Geometry<br/>to check conjectures and to aid research. They also contribute<br/>tools which are used in the computational systems that underly<br/>robotics, cryptography, and other national applications of <br/>strategic interest. The proposed conference will foster <br/>collaboration in these fields between the US and Indian communities."

Two projects focus on the<br/>remarkable, recently discovered  applications of random matrix theory to<br/>the zeta-function. Keating and Snaith's characteristic polynomial model of<br/>the zeta-function is providing heuristic answers to many previously<br/>intractable problems in analytic number theory. However, a serious drawback<br/>of the model is that it does not contain the primes. Instead, they have to<br/>be inserted in an ad hoc manner with each new application. The investigator<br/>and his colleagues have a new model that explicitly integrates the primes<br/>and zeros in a most natural way. They are applying it to a variety of<br/>problems, such as moment and order estimates for the zeta-function, and<br/>they expect it to give them new insights into the connections between the<br/>zeros and the primes. A related project explores the relations between the<br/>Gaussian Unitary Ensemble Conjecture on the zeros, the distribution of<br/>primes and almost-primes, and mean-value theorems involving the Riemann<br/>zeta-function. They also study geometrical aspects of the zeta-function,<br/>such as its curvature near the critical line, and the size of gaps between<br/>zeros. Two final problems lie in an altogether different area of number<br/>theory. These concern additive patterns of elements in the multiplicative<br/>group of a finite field and the related question of the value distribution<br/>of incomplete exponential sums containing multiplicative characters.<br/><br/>This is a project in the area of mathematics known as number theory.  The fundamental questions of interest in number theory have to do with the structure of numbers, and in particular the prime numbers, as these are the fundamental building blocks of arithmetic and, therefore, of much of mathematics.  Many of the most important questions in this area are so intractable that it is impossible even to guess correct answers to them. Recently, a remarkable partnership has developed between theoretical physicists and analytic number theorists, which is succeeding in answering some of these questions. At the center of this collaboration is a model of something called the Riemann zeta-function, which is a special mathematical function known for over a century to encode within its properties a great deal of information about prime numbers.  This model is based on the theory of random matrices, objects previously used to model complicated physical systems such as heavy nuclei.  Although the model has been quite successful, it has the serious drawback of not containing the prime numbers which, after all, are the principal objects of interest. The investigator and his colleagues have now developed a model that does integrate the primes and zeros in a most natural way, and a main goal of this project is to explore further applications of our new model. A related project concerns arithmetic and analytic consequences of a widely believed conjecture about the zeros of the zeta-function.  Using recent developments in the field, we also investigate geometrical aspects of the zeta-function such as its curvature, and gap sizes between its zeros. Two problems in a different area of number theory concern the structure of finite fields, objects with important applications to coding theory and cryptography.<br/><br/><br/>"

If one knows the initial distribution of the population into the different age groups, then can one predict the short and long term evolution trends of the population?!  Could it be that the population can reach in time a situation that is called an equilibrium?  This is a situation in which the sizes of each age group may continue to change, but the relative size of each age group to the other age groups does not change.  There are many problems of this sort which the fields of mathematics called Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory can help model and solve.

The main goals of this part are: 1) geometric formulation <br/>of two-dimensional quantum Toda theories associated with simple Lie  <br/>algebras; 2) Fermi-Bose correspondence for compact Riemann surfaces and <br/>closed smooth Jordan curves; 3) proof of general Kleinian reciprocity on <br/>deformation spaces; 4) construction of the universal Weil-Petersson <br/>potential for the universal Teichmuller space; 5) curvature properties of <br/>the new Kahler metric on moduli spaces of punctured Riemann surfaces; 6) <br/>explicit form of factorization formula for determinants of Laplace <br/>operators acting on higher order differentials; 7) Faddeev-Popov ghosts <br/>for string field theory of open strings. Symmetries and Ward identities <br/>for correlation functions are guiding  principles of the algebraic part <br/>of the project. The immediate and long term goals of this part are: 1) <br/>proof of adelic Fermi-Bose correspondence for vertex operators, complete <br/>construction of quantum field theory of multiplicative bosons and proof <br/>of A. Weil's reciprocity law; 2) construction of quantum field theories <br/>on algebraic curves in non-zero characteristic with Artin-Schreier and <br/>Kummer theories as main examples, proof of Artin's reciprocity law using <br/>quantum field-theoretical methods; 3) adelic formulation of the WZW <br/>theory on algebraic curves in characteristic zero.<br/><br/>In mathematical development a pivotal role is played by ideas from  <br/>physics, originated in the study of the surrounding world. The last twenty <br/>five years have been characterized by dramatic success in application <br/>of quantum fields and strings to different areas of mathematics. The idea <br/>is to probe mathematical objects by quantum theories and to measure their <br/>response in order to get new information about the various mathematical <br/>properties of these objects. Usually the output is encoded in terms of <br/>partition function and correlation functions of physical theory, and the <br/>problem is to decode it back in mathematical terms. The goals of this <br/>proposal are the following: 1) to extend further quantum-theoretic method <br/>for the study of complex analytic properties of surfaces in two <br/>dimensions and their families; 2) to develop a new systematic <br/>quantum-theoretic approach for arithmetic surfaces and algebraic number <br/>fields (like the usual field of rational numbers). Fundamental properties <br/>of these objects are discrete and it is only natural to study them at a <br/>microscopic scale using quantum theory. In particular, many classical <br/>mathematical results about fields of algebraic functions and algebraic <br/>numbers, known as reciprocity laws, can be interpreted as conservation <br/>laws (like conservation of energy) in quantum theory. The main goal of <br/>the algebraic part of the project is to develop a new approach based on <br/>quantum theory towards fundamental laws that are satisfied by the very <br/>basic mathematical objects: algebraic numbers - solutions of algebraic <br/>equations with coefficients being rational numbers, and algebraic <br/>functions - solutions of algebraic equations with coefficients being <br/>rational functions. Realization of the goals of the proposal will <br/>contribute to the fundamental interface between mathematics and physics.<br/>"

It builds on past experience which indicates that <br/>much can be learned about the geometry of a given algebraic <br/>variety by studying its Chow group. The Chow group is obtained <br/>from the free abelian group on all subvarieties of a given variety <br/>by modding out by the relation of rational equivalence. For <br/>algebraic curves the Chow group is a close relative of the <br/>Jacobian. While the Chow group is known to have good functorial <br/>properties, it is often very difficult to compute. Thus it is <br/>difficult to gain access to the subtle and valuable information <br/>that it frequently contains. This investigation focuses on three <br/>different aspects of the problem of computing Chow groups. First <br/>the torsion subgroup of the Chow group is being studied with an <br/>emphasis on the quotient by the subgroup generated by cycles <br/>algebraically equivalent to zero. Secondly, the relationship<br/>between the Chow group and singular cohomology with rational <br/>coefficients is being investigated. The Hodge Conjecture is an <br/>important concern here. The theory of Abelian varieties and <br/>techniques from classical algebraic geometry will be brought to <br/>bear on this problem.  The third line of investigation involves <br/>the relationship between the Chow group and singular cohomology <br/>with integrer coefficients. An ancient guidepost here was the so <br/>called Integral Hodge Conjecture. It has turned out that the <br/>Integral Hodge Conjecture is false in some instances. The extent <br/>of its failure is poorly understood, so the principal investigator <br/>and a PhD student are working to clarify this.<br/><br/>To a significant extent, the value of basic research in algebraic <br/>geometry results from the tendency of mathematicians to reduce <br/>problems in various other fields of mathematics to problems in <br/>algebraic geometry. This tendency is due to the ultimate <br/>simplicity of algebraic geometry, where remarkably effective <br/>approaches to certain geometric problems have been developed<br/>with minimal reliance on infinite processes. While the initial <br/>translation of a problem from the physical world into mathematics <br/>frequently involves limits, derivatives, integrals, and further <br/>notions involving infinite processes which go well beyond ordinary <br/>calculus, mathematicians have learned to search for hidden aspects <br/>of these problems which are essentially of an algebraic or finite <br/>nature.  Neither the task of translating real world phenomena into <br/>mathematical problems, the task of discovering a hidden algebraic<br/>core in a problem formulated using infinite processes, nor the <br/>task of solving this core problem using algebraic geometry is<br/>often easy. Nonetheless, this lengthy process has led to profound <br/>insights.  For example, algebraic geometry and some of the <br/>algebraic varieties studied by the principal investigator are of <br/>great interest to physicists in their current attempts to unify <br/>quantum mechanics with the theory of gravity."

Let p be a prime.  Is the center, Cp, of the division ring of p x p generic matrices stably rational over the base field?  This is an old problem which has been studied extensively over several decades, in particular for its connections to important problems in other fields, such as geometric invariant theory and Brauer groups.  If G is a finite group, and M is a ZG-lattice, then F(M) denotes the quotient field of the group algebra of the abelian group M written multiplicatively.  Procesi and Formanek have shown that Cn is isomorphic to the fixed field under the action of Sn of F(M) for a specific ZSn-lattice M.  The findings of the investigator can be briefly described as two reduction steps. Let p be a prime.  First, the investigator has shown that under certain conditions induction-restriction from Sp to the normalizer N, of a p-sylow subgroup H of Sp, does not affect the stable type of the field..   Second, the investigator has proved that if we twist the Sp-action by a 1-cocycle a in Ext1SP(J(A), L*), then Cp is stably isomorphic to La(J(A))Sp, where A is the root lattice, L=F(ZG/H) and,  J represents induction-restriction from Sp to H. Note that now we are inducing from H which is a cyclic group of order p. The cocycle a corresponds to an element of the relative Brauer group of L over LH.  The importance of this result lies in the connection, described by Saltman., between fixed fields under twisted H-actions and corresponding fixed fields under twisted Sp-actions.  The above results naturally lead to the study of a-twisted actions on fields, and this is also an area the investigator will study; more precisely actions induced from subgroups.  The investigator will be also working on Noether's problem which is naturally related to the above question.  In particular the investigator will study its connections with monomial and a-twisted group actions and on fields.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to investigate the following problem. Let p be a prime number.  Is the center of the division ring of p x p generic matrices stably rational over the base field? Generic matrices over a field F are n x n matrices whose entries are independent variables. This problem has been studied extensively over several decades. Its importance lies in part, in its connections to problems in many other fields such as, geometric invariant theory, representation theory of algebras, and Brauer groups. Invariant theory and representation theory are classical mathematical fields whose results are also used in applied mathematics and physics. Brauer groups are a fundamental structure in the study of central simple algebras.  The importance of this problem also lies in the fact that matrices, which are rectangular arrays of elements, are an essential tool for storing data.  Little is known about this problem.  Positive results have been proved for the primes 2, 3,5 and 7, the first of which was found in 1883 by Sylvester. <br/>"

The linear geometric modules <br/>(point modules, line modules, etc) are parametrized by so-called <br/>linear schemes.

She is also interested in connections between this type<br/>of geometric analysis and that of various Poisson-geometric <br/>structures. Some of these activities entail the development of <br/>fundamental computational algorithms, and their implementation using <br/>a computer-algebra package, in order to enable explicit computation of<br/>linear schemes.<br/><br/>Systems of polynomial-style equations and their solutions play a <br/>critical role in almost every scientific field, such as statistical <br/>mechanics, elementary-particle physics, quantum mechanics, robotics, <br/>crystallography, networking, etc. The solutions are often results that<br/>cannot be found by experimentation nor other methods, and often they <br/>are not numbers but are functions (e.g., differential operators or <br/>matrices), and so, in general, they do not commute. The business of <br/>seeking methods that find all solutions to any system of <br/>polynomial-style equations in non-commuting variables is called <br/>non-commutative algebra. The main idea to find the solutions is as <br/>follows. One associates to such a system of equations an abstract <br/>object called an algebra, which encodes all the properties of the <br/>system. To the algebra is associated abstract objects called modules,<br/>and these encode all the properties of the solutions. Hence, in order<br/>to find all the solutions, one should find and understand all the <br/>modules for the associated algebra.  In many of the applications, the<br/>algebras that arise in this way tend to share certain properties; they<br/>are called regular algebras and are the main focus of Vancliff's<br/>projects. One of the goals of non-commutative algebraic geometry, the<br/>subfield in which Vancliff works, is to use geometric techniques to <br/>find some of the modules (point modules, line modules, etc) of the <br/>regular algebra, and then to use those modules to find the modules <br/>giving the solutions to the original system of equations.

Classical problems in these areas are computing class numbers, regulators, and discrete logarithms, as well as determining cardinalities of Jacobians. The first part concerns arithmetical invariants of hyperelliptic and cubic curves. In particular, the investigator and his colleagues hope to advance counting points methods for these curves over large prime fields. Effective methods make use of modular equations, the distribution of the zeroes of the zeta function, the Hasse-Witt matrix, approximation of Euler products, optimized algorithms, and others. The second part concerns with the Weil descent methodology for elliptic curves or other Galois descent methods. The Weil descent methodology is a means to reduce the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) over composite finite fields to the discrete logarithm problem in an abelian variety over a proper subfield. This leads to an effective method of reducing any instance of the ECDLP over a finite field to an instance of the discrete logarithm problem in the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve over a subfield. Since subexponential-time algorithms for the latter problem are known, this shows how important the method is for cracking certain elliptic curve cryptographic schemes.  Similar ideas are applicable for curves of genus bigger than one.<br/><br/>The proposed research belongs to the interface between number theory and algebraic geometry. On the theoretical side, it advances the theory of algebraic function fields and curves. At the same time, on the  practical side, it advances the connection between the theory of algebraic curves and a highly relevant application to cryptography. In recent years, elliptic and hyperelliptic curves have become objects of intense investigation because of their significance to public-key cryptography. Hereby, tools from algebraic geometry, number theory, and the theory of algorithms are central in the cryptanalysis of elliptic and hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems. Methods of this proposal can be applied to guarantee the security of these curve cryptosystems or reveal weaknesses of certain curves. The proposed research also advances the number theoretic computations and applies a variety of strong recent results to the algorithmic aspects of number theory.<br/>"

The study of local cohomology modules addresses finiteness issues of these modules over regular rings of mixed characteristic, and another question that is related to the theory of solid closure.  Research on Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities and on the rigidity of the Tor functor will be carried out in continued collaboration with Claudia Miller. <br/><br/>Commutative algebra is a field closely related to algebraic geometry:  while algebraic geometry focuses on the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, in commutative algebra the main objects of study are certain functions on these solution sets.

An active area of research in commutative algebra today is the theory of tight closure developed by Hochster and Huneke.  This theory provides stronger formulations of existing theorems, and brings together many seemingly unrelated problems.

They have resulted in surprising new estimates towards Ramanujan--Selberg and Sato--Tate conjectures, together with a large number of impressive, definitive and new results in number theory, automorphic forms and geometry obtained by other mathematicians.  The investigator explores extensions of these to higher powers of forms on GL(2) as well as transfers of generic forms on other classical groups and their simply connected similitude coverings.

He has a solid approach to establishing the stability of root numbers necessary for these transfers, by means of his method, and studies Bessel functions and the full generality of all the root numbers defined from his method.  Stability of a subclass of these root numbers is the last serious problem in establishing these transfers.

Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, which is a consequence of relating plane curves defined by equations of degree three with rational coefficients to functions on complex upper half plane, provides an excellent example of this vast program.  The investigator's recent work with his collaborators has led to new, striking and surprising correspondences of this sort with many consequences in number theory and geometry.  While this has resolved some very long standing and significant problems, many more important questions need to be answered.  In this project, the investigator uses methods of analysis, i.e., the study of continuous objects, that he has developed over his career and have been fundamental in the recent progress, to establish new correspondences of this kind between objects of a discrete nature with many applications to different parts of number theory and geometry.

This hypothetical theory should live in<br/>11-dimensional space and the corresponding low energy action<br/>should be given by 11-dimensional supergravity. At this<br/>moment a rigorous definition of M-theory is not known. <br/>Nevertheless, using various heuristic tools (first of all,<br/>dualities) physicists have created a beautiful and<br/>consistent picture, where all versions of (super)string<br/>theory can be obtained as limiting cases.A promising approach <br/>to a rigorous definition of M-theory is based on so<br/>called M(atrix) theory. The action functional of BFSS M(atrix) <br/>model can be obtained from ten-dimensional supersymmetric<br/>Yang-Mills theory ( 10 D SYM theory) by means of dimensional<br/>reduction to (0+1)-dimensional space.(This means that we should <br/>consider only gauge fields that do not depend on spatial<br/>variables, but can be time-dependent.)  It was shown  by  <br/>A.Connes,  M. Douglas and A. Schwarz (1998) that<br/>compactification of M(atrix) theory  can lead<br/>to gauge theories on noncommutative spaces, in particular, on <br/>noncommutative tori.This paper  opened the way for application <br/>of Connes' noncommutative geometry to string/M-theory  . It<br/>became very popular, especially after the appearance of the<br/>influential Seiberg-Witten paper (1999) , that contains<br/>together with important new  results, the understanding of<br/>Nekrasov-Schwarz noncommutative instantons (1998),  gauge<br/>(complete) Morita equivalence defined by A.Schwarz (1998),and  <br/>Pioline-Schwarz background independence (1999)    from the<br/>string theory viewpoint. The number of papers considering  the <br/>relation of string/M-theory to noncommutative spaces grows <br/>exponentially (today it is close to a thousand); many of these<br/>articles  were influenced by the papers of A. Schwarz and his<br/>collaborators. A. Schwarz  intends  to continue his work on<br/>applications of noncommutative geometry to string/ M-theory.  <br/>He is  planning to  analyze thoroughly the general theory of <br/>gauge fields on noncommutative spaces and  its relation to the <br/>duality in physics. He would like to apply (in collaboration <br/>with M. Movshev) this general theory to  the construction<br/>and analysis of gauge theories on noncommutative curved spaces. <br/>One more direction  the PI  would like to pursue ( also<br/>together with M. Movshev) is a search of formulation<br/>M(atrix) theory ( and, more generally, maximally supersymmetric<br/>gauge theory) in a manifestly supersymmetric form. The solution <br/>of this problem is interesting by itself, but M. Movshev and <br/>A. Schwarz  are planning to use it also as  a starting point in <br/>the construction of a  maximally supersymmetric Dirac-Born-Infeld<br/>action  for nonabelian gauge fields and on  noncommutative <br/>spaces. A. Schwarz is planning to develop a complex version of <br/>Connes' noncommutative geometry and the theory of<br/>noncommutative theta functions having in mind possible<br/>applications to noncommutative instantons and other BPS<br/>fields.He  aims also to study the role of K-theory in <br/>string/ M-theory. M. Movshev  is planning to analyze<br/>algebraic structures arising in open string field theory. <br/><br/><br/>It is clear now that noncommutative geometry is quite useful<br/>in physics. The PI intends to develop methods of<br/>noncommutative geometry and to apply these methods to<br/>various problems arising in string/ M-theory. It seems<br/>that noncommutative geometry should play an important role<br/>in rigorous formulation of M-theory. The PI hopes that<br/>his work will contribute to the search of appropriate<br/>mathematical formalism. <br/>"

In fact, one of the goals of the program is to bring experts in automorphic forms and analytic number theory to find applications of automorphic forms in analytic number theory, vice versa. <br/><br/>One of the most important mathematical ideas of the second half of  the 19th century is that an analytic formula often encodes discrete information. For example, one might want to count the number of solutions of a particular equation, but discover that the solutions are very hard to find. On the other hand, one might want to count the number of solutions to a sequence of equations and have the answers as a sequence. Mathematicians call these kinds of problems 'discrete'. The functions that appear in calculus, and for which calculus works so well, are not 'discrete', but 'analytic.' Amazingly, the right kinds of  analytic functions often provide the answers to the discrete problems. <br/>An L-function is a type of generating function formed out of data associated with either a geometric object that is related to number theory or with a kind of 'analytic' function, called an automorphic form, which are determined by groups of linear transformations.  These L-functions provide the right kinds of analytic functions. In the past thirty years, the study of these examples of L-functions has been systematized into a branch of number theory. In recent years many people have found new ways that L-functions encode discrete information, though there is still much to be discovered. The chief purpose of this program is to bring together experts in analytic number theory, automorphic forms, and geometry so that we may find more of the ways that arithmetic information is encoded by L-functions.<br/>"

The investigators, who are among the organizers, feel that such a conference will serve to advance the careers of any young researchers who are in attendance.  We are proposing that ten junior people receive funds to support their participation in these proceedings.  The amount requested will be sufficient for travel as well as local expenses. In administering these funds we shall make every effort to support those who have no other means of funding.<br/><br/>The focus of this conference is to survey recent results within a branch of mathematics referred to as the Langlands program.  The underlying philosophy of this program is that there should be deep, and in some sense, fundamental connections between three seemingly disparate mathematical fields: Algebraic Geometry, Number Theory, and Harmonic Analysis.  The Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, which posited the equivalence of the theory of elliptic curves (geometric objects) and a certain classes of automorphic forms (analytic  objects with number theoretic applications) <br/>is just a ``simple'' (that is simple within the context of the program) example of what the Langlands program is expected to produce.  By proving this conjecture, Andrew Wiles delivered a long sought proof of Fermat's Last theorem, that for integers larger than 2, there is never a choice of two non-zero integers whose n-th powers sum to the n-th power of another non-zero integer. More general conjectures within the Langlands program can be stated with some more technical language, but have a similarity to the Fermat problem in that the proofs are much harder than the statements.  <br/>The last several years have witnessed a series of remarkable breakthroughs in the Langlands program.  Wiles's work is one of many examples of these exciting results.  As outlined in the proposal, this is critical point in the history of the program, in that new  ideas must be found to build upon this recent momentum.  Thus, providing funding for relatively new researchers to attend a high level conference, such as the one being sponsored by CIRM, will serve the field, and the greater mathematical community greatly.  It is through such development that mathematics  continues to play a critical role in our society, both culturally and  technologically.<br/><br/> <br/>"

The principal investigator, together with his colleagues Robert MacPherson and Robert Kottwitz, have discovered that the kappa-orbital integrals which occur in the fundamental lemma may be expressed as the trace of Frobenius acting on the cohomology of an ""affine Springer fiber"".  So the (conjectured) fundamental lemma is equivalent to a (fairly complicated) statement concerning the structure of the cohomology groups of affine Springer fibers.  (An affine Springer fiber is the fixed point set, on the flag manifold of a loop group, or of a Kac-Moody Lie group, of the vectorfield which is determined by a semisimple element in the Lie algebra of the group.  These researchers have been able to prove the required cohomological statement for affine Springer fibers which are associated to elements <br/>in unramified tori in the loop group.  They are addressing the many technical problems associated with understanding the homology of affine Springer fibers associated to elements of ramified tori.<br/><br/>In the 1970's, R. Langlands (of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton N.J.) developed an elaborate theory, indicating that there should be deep and hidden connections between several widely separated areas in mathematics:  number theory, representation theory, algebraic geometry, and automorphic forms.  He showed, for example, how results from representation theory could be used to deduce results in number theory.  This vision was so far-reaching and broad in scope that it became known as ""Langlands' program"", and it is perhaps the mathematician's version of ""grand unification"".  However, most of this program was conjectural and to some degree, even speculative.  Progress on these conjectures was slow at first, as research in this subject demands an understanding of several different, highly technical branches of mathematics.  Nevertheless, after decades of research by scores of dedicated and talented mathematicians worldwide, enormous progress has been made on Langlands' conjectures.  For example, Andrew Wiles' celebrated proof of ""Fermat's Last Theorem"" depends in an essential way on some of these results.  However, one step in this program, which was originally felt to be a relatively minor one, has turned out to be one of the most difficult questions in<br/>the area: the so-called ""fundamental lemma"" (and its generalization, the Langlands-Shelstad conjecture).  While the supporting evidence for this conjecture is overwhelming, the conjecture has only been proven, after Herculean efforts, in a handful of special cases.  It is a stubborn obstacle which threatens to indefinitely delay further progress in the area.  The principal investigator and his colleagues Robert MacPherson (Institute for Advanced Study) and Robert Kottwitz (University of Chicago) have discovered that the Langlands-Shelstad conjecture may be restated in terms of the geometrical properties of certain objects (""affine Springer fibers"") which have recently attracted the attention of mathematicians for completely different reasons.  Using these geometric techniques, the investigator and his colleagues expect to outline a proof for the Langlands-Shelstad conjecture in a broad class of cases, the so-called ""unramified"" cases.  They are also addressing the many difficulties involved with the remaining ""ramified"" cases.  It is expected that this exciting connection between Langlands' program and ""Springer theory"" will lead to new developments in both subjects.<br/>"

The discrete tones which occur have interesting number theoretic meanings.  Instead of starting with the functions and looking for their discrete tones, mathematicians and physicists can start with discrete collections of numbers and from which they construct continuous functions.

Tate's 1984 book on the sub-<br/>ject provided a generation of researchers with a solid exposition of the <br/>state of the conjecture at that time, and a foundation for further in-<br/>vestigation. Work related to the conjecture has recently grown to in-<br/>volve more and more number theorists, but there has never been a major <br/>conference on the subject. This NSF award will provide major funding <br/>for a conference dedicated to Stark's conjecture and its variations to<br/>be held at John's Hopkins University in Baltimore August 4-9, 2002. <br/>Plans include plenary talks devoted to background and current research<br/>in the mornings, followed by contributed talks in the afternoons.<br/>The gathering of researchers from various strands of inquiry should<br/>lead to insight into the links between various conjectures and provide <br/>an ideal platform for further research on all aspects of Stark's Conj-<br/>ecture. In particular, one would expect that this conference would lead <br/>to a number of new and fruitful collaborations, and to the greater in-<br/>volvement of graduate students in this research. Indeed, graduate stu-<br/>dents, junior faculty members, women, and members of traditionally <br/>under-represented minorities are especially encouraged to attend and <br/>to apply for funding. <br/><br/>     Stark's conjecture in number theory suggests that there is astonishing <br/>and useful structure waiting to be discovered behind the fundamental <br/>concepts of higher arithmetic. In higher arithmetic, one seeks to de-<br/>scribe the solutions of polynomial equations and their properties. This <br/>is the algebraic side of number theory. The conjecture states that the <br/>solutions of certain polynomial equations can be obtained from the values   <br/>of specific limits and infinite sums which naturally involve the methods <br/>of calculus. This is the analytic side of number theory. Thus Stark's <br/>conjecture makes a striking connection between two branches of mathematics:<br/>algebra and analysis. Understanding this type of connection is just what<br/>leads to major breakthroughs. Indeed, the conjecture has already led to <br/>new and more efficient methods of performing certain computations.     <br/> <br/>"

The Year of Algebra <br/>features a conference in Galois Theory (Nov. 3--9, 2002), a conference<br/>in Group Theory (March 9--16, 2003) and a workshop on Computational<br/>Aspects of Algebraic Curves, and Cryptography (March 9--15, 2003).<br/>The Galois conference centers around the Inverse Problem of Galois<br/>Theory, one of the major open problems of mathematics. The conference<br/>on Finite Group Theory has speakers involved in the completion/<br/>revision of the Classification, as well as speakers in Representation<br/>Theory, and applications of Finite Groups to Finite Geometries and<br/>other areas. The workshop deals with interactions between modern <br/>computational tools/questions and the theory of algebraic curves,<br/>emphasizing the application to public key cryptography. It has a <br/>strong instructional component (mini-courses).<br/><br/>Group Theory is the abstract study of symmetry patterns (of any<br/>object), and Galois Theory provides tools for applying Group Theory<br/>to algebra and arithmetic. Recent applications to data security<br/>(public key cryptography) are the topic of the workshop. Galois <br/>Theory and Group Theory have further applications to physics, <br/>chemistry and coding theory. The Year of Algebra provides an<br/>opportunity for young mathematicians, women and minorities to <br/>learn the latest advances.  It was John G. Thompson who shaped <br/>finite group theory like no-one else, leading the way towards a <br/>major milestone of 20th century mathematics, the classification<br/>of finite simple groups.  After the classification, it was again<br/>J. Thompson who led the way in exploring its implications for<br/>Galois Theory.  For these contributions, Thompson has recently<br/>been awarded the National Medal of Science. He also won the Fields<br/>Medal, the highest honor in mathematics. For the Year of Algebra,<br/>University of Florida Graduate Research Professor John G. Thompson<br/>acts as an advisor.

More specifically, the first part of the proposal has to do with computation of the algebras of global sections of these sheaves on Calabi-Yau manifolds. The known examples arising in the case of tori and projective spaces are promising.  The second part is built on the recent discovery that a family of such vertex algebras arising in the case of the projective line is closely related to the super-algebra  Lie sl(2|1) and  to  sl(2|1) - Toda field theory.  The third is an attempt to generalize the relation of such sheaves to  ellptic genera, quantum cohomology, and modular forms discovered in a joint work with Schechtman. This relation is visible through the fact that the character of the space of global sections of one such sheaf, a chiral de Rham complex, over over an even-dimensional projective space equals the equivariant signature of the corresponding loop space.  The fourth is a project aiming at an explanation of a certain remarkable duality arising in the case of a simple Lie group, in physics terms if possible. That the whole proposal may be related to string theory is revealed, for example, in the fact that the above-mentioned chiral de Rham complex allows to reproduce the quantum cohomology of smooth projective toric varieties.  The fifth is a separate project based on the previous work of I.Frenkel and Malikov; it has to do with a possible application of affine translation functors to BGG-type resolutions of admissible representations.<br/><br/>This is a project simultaneously in the area of mathematics known as ""Representation Theory,"" and in the area of mathematical physics called ""Quantum Field Theory.""  Representation theory is generally considered to be the most useful area of mathematics for describing symmetries of all kinds, especially those that arise in nature.  Quantum field theory may be thought of as the logical foundation for the quantum mechanics that govern the behavior of subatomic particles.  An important source of inspiration for this project is string theory, which is widely accepted as the only candidate for a unified physical theory explaining all fundamental laws of Nature.  The striking idea of string theory is that an elementary particle in physics can be described mathematically as a loop.  The implications of this idea have made entire areas of mathematics previously thought of as totally abstract into everyday tools of research in theoretical physics.  The specific goal of this project is to obtain a better understanding of the so-called ""loop spaces"" that arise in this point of view.  Mathematical ideas from string theory have already found important applications in tomography, and surely there are more applications waiting to be found.<br/>"
