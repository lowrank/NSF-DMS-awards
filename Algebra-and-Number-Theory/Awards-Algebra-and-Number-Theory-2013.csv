The first is a study of manifolds possessing stratifications with the same good properties possessed by the Bruhat decomposition of a flag manifold.  In particular, in this project the PI, with Xuhua He and Jiang-Hua Lu, will explore whether certain other famous stratified spaces (e.g. the 'wonderful compactification' of a Lie group) can similarly be given a stratified atlas of Bruhat cells.  The second is about the extent to which the good properties -- Frobenius splitting, Poisson structures, total positivity -- imply one another.  The third project (with Joel Kamnitzer) is about giving a cohomological description of the coordinate rings for Mirkovic-Vilonen cycles in loop Grassmannians.  If one thinks of representation theory as either about coherent sheaves on flag manifolds (finite-dimensional geometry) or constructible sheaves on loop Grassmannians (infinite-dimensional topology), then this project is looking one level deeper, at coherent sheaves on loop Grassmannians.  The fourth project is about extending the 'puzzle' framework of the PI and Tao for Schubert calculus to determine in a positive way the classes of arbitrary positroid subvarieties.<br/><br/>Many of the most beautiful spaces considered by mathematicians, and structures on those spaces, have been discovered through symmetry considerations, but perhaps this is akin to looking for one's keys under the lamppost because the light is brightest there.  One well-known space and structure is the space of 'flags' of subspaces, with a 'stratification' given by looking at the level of intersection with a fixed flag; any linear transformation preserving the standard flag gives a symmetry of the stratification.  My coauthors and I are investigating other spaces in which such symmetries are present only locally, finding unsuspected structure on familiar spaces and stratifications.  One of the successes inspiring this study is a stratification of the space of full rank k x n matrices, stratified according to the position of pivots after Gaussian elimination on each rotation of the columns.  Without the rotation, this is a 19th century idea.  In a separate project, the PI intends to determine properties such as the volume of these strata, extending a century's worth of work on ""Schubert calculus"", the subcase using only the reflection of the columns."

Important applications impact various fields of research, ranging from number theory, coding theory, algebraic geometry, and topology to Kac-Moody algebras and quantum field theory. The interplay of automorphic forms and representation theory has been especially fruitful, and many surprising and deep results have emerged. The TORA conference series will emphasize the interplay between automorphic forms and representations, both in the classical and adelic languages, and related topics like analytic number theory and harmonic analysis.<br/><br/>The TORA mathematics conference series consists of semi-annual meetings hosted by the University of North Texas, Oklahoma State University, and the University of Oklahoma on a rotating basis. This award provides support for three weekend conferences, one at the University of North Texas in Spring 2013 (TORA IV), one at Oklahoma State University in Fall 2013 (TORA V), and another at the University of Oklahoma in Spring 2014 (TORA VI). Each conference will feature two or three prominent guest speakers from outside the Texas-Oklahoma region, in addition to other participants including students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty. Regional graduate students and  researchers will also give talks describing their work. These conferences will facilitate collaborations and interactions among the students and researchers in the region who work in the areas of Automorphic Forms, Representation Theory, and Number Theory."

The long term research objective of this program is proving the conjecture of the PI and his collaborators that there is a duality operation on symplectic singularities. At moment, the most important property of this proposed duality is its effect on the representation theory of associated algebras: ""categories O"" attached to the singularities should be Koszul dual (that is, induce a very special equivalence of categories). Many special cases of this duality are well-understood, but what links them remains to be investigated. This research is also tied up in the exploration of individual examples of these singularities; in these our proposal would be a ""geometrification"" and ""categorification"" of well-known dualities in mathematics, such as Schur-Weyl duality, rank-level duality and Gale duality. Our perspective also provides a fruitful approach to topics as diverse as the representation theory of symplectic reflection algebras and the Rouquier-Khovanov-Lauda categorification of quantum groups, and has applications as far afield as low-dimensional topology. <br/><br/>One of the most shocking discoveries of the 20th century was the discovery of quantum mechanics, and the introduction of non-commuting observables into physics.  Mathematicians have built on these observations to create an abstract theory of ""deformation quantization"" and ""noncommutative geometry."" The PI's work is about the relationships between the geometry of classical limits of noncommutative spaces on one hand, and state spaces that could describe related physical systems on the other.  The PI further proposes an educational component which creates a website platform for mathematical exposition, based on Wordpress. This will make blogs, wikis, and a whole range of of websites that don?t quite fit in those categories, and more closely resemble a dynamic version of a homepage freely and easily available to the mathematical community in a professional setting.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Topology program."

Let F be the function field of a curve over a number field. If p is a prime and F contains a primitive pth root of unity, a symbol in degree n Galois cohomology is simply a cup product of elements in the degree one cohomology modulo p. Voevodsky's theorem implies that every element in the degree n Galois cohomology modulo p is a sum of symbols. It is proposed to study boundedness of symbol length for F for each prime p. This study has consequences for bounding the u-invariant of F. The PI also proposes to study questions concerning the admissibility of finite groups over function fields of curves over p-adic fields.<br/><br/>A  basic pursuit of geometers and number theorist is to find common solutions of polynomial equations. A homogeneous polynomial of degree two is called a quadratic form.  It is known that every quadratic form in at least five variables over a totally imaginary number field has non-trivial zero, thanks to the Hasse-Minkowski theorem. It is an open question whether every quadratic form in sufficiently many variables over the function field of a curve over a totally imaginary number field has a non-trivial zero. By a theorem of Voevodsky, quadratic forms are classified by Galois cohomology invariants over any field. We propose to study the existence of non-trivial zeros for quadratic forms in sufficiently many variables over function fields of curves over totally imaginary number fields, by studying boundedness questions for symbol lengths in Galois cohomology."
"1303450","p-adic aspects of the Langlands program","DMS","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM","06/01/2013","06/09/2015","Matthew Emerton","IL","University of Chicago","Continuing Grant","James Matthew Douglass","05/31/2017","$320,000.00","","emerton@math.uchicago.edu","5801 S ELLIS AVE","CHICAGO","IL","606375418","7737028669","MPS","1264","","$0.00","The goal of the proposed project is to investigate the p-adic aspects of the Langlands program.  At the heart of the Langlands program is a conjectured reciprocity law relating automorphic representations of a certain type (namely those whose Langlands parameter at the archimedean place is ``integral'', or ``algebraic'') to Galois representations arising from the etale cohomology of  algebraic varieties over number fields (i.e. Galois representations that are ``motivic'').  A basic fact in the theory of Galois representations is that such representations are naturally parametrized by certain p-adic analytic spaces (Galois deformation spaces), in which the motivic Galois representations float in a much larger sea of non-motivic representations.  Studying this entire sea of Galois representations is an interesting and important problem, which turns out to be of fundamental importance even if one is ultimately interested only in the motivic points of this space, since most successful approaches to establishing reciprocity have involved p-adically interpolating information across the sea of all Galois representations. In the case of two-dimensional representations  of the absolute Galois group of Q, the proposer has proved the desired  reciprocity in most cases, by establishing a local-global compatibility  result relating the p-adically completed cohomology of modular curves to the p-adic local Langlands correspondence of Breuil, Colmez, and Paskunas.  The proposed project involves generalizing these results to other contexts, such as to representations of the/absolute Galois group of a totally real field.  Since there isno construction of a p-adic local Langlands correspondence in this case, a major part of the project will involve constructing such a correspondence.<br/><br/>Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies phenomena related to properties of whole numbers. A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest. The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. (Number theorists refer to Langlands conjectured relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ``reciprocity law''.) Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic methods to study his conjectures. These are methods that exploit the many  symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics known as ``the Langlands program''. A more recent approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently,<br/>the representation theoretic methods and p-adic methods have begun to be unified into a so-called ``p-adic Langlands program''. The proposer aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, and to use them to establish new results about L-functions, and, in particular, to establish new reciprocity laws."

KUMUNUJr is geared toward graduate students and recent PhDs working in these fields and provides an opportunity for young mathematicians studying commutative algebra in the Midwest to share their research and expertise with one another.  Commutative algebra is an active discipline, with connections to algebraic geometry, cluster algebras, combinatorics, homological algebra, representation theory, statistics and other disciplines. Midwestern commutative algebra research continues to reflect the activity and diversity of the larger commutative algebra research community.<br/><br/>Regular interaction with other researchers is essential to a mathematician's professional development, and participation in research conferences is a crucial part of the development of a mathematician's research program. KUMUNUJr will provide an opportunity for these young mathematicians to exchange ideas, to encounter new ideas, to develop new collaborative research projects, and to find mentors among their peers. The relatively small size of the meeting and the focus on work carried out regionally will create an atmosphere that will enhance each of these research and mentoring activities.

In situations where even an ""almost"" local-global statement seems out of reach of current technology, the PI will develop new exponential sum bounds to improve the number of R-almost primes which can be produced from an Affine Sieve. The PI will also develop numerical algorithms to explore the Laplace spectrum of infinite volume hyperbolic manifolds, and strive to rigorously certify that numerically observed eigenvalues actually correspond to true spectra.<br/><br/>Integrated with the proposed research projects are numerous educational and outreach components. The PI will continue to advise high school through graduate students, and organize seminars, meetings, and conferences. A new course at Yale will be developed for non-math majors, with the goal of popularizing mathematics to broader audiences, including discussions of recent research activity. The PI will give lectures through the Office of New Haven and State Affairs, and Science Saturdays at Yale, to the general public, specifically geared for middle and high school students in the Pathways to Science program. This proposal will also support the attendance of underprivileged New Haven area middle school students to the MathCounts competition.

The first project concerns noncommutative analogs of algebraic varieties called maximal orders; these are coherent sheaves of noncommutative algebras on varieties whose generic stalk is a central simple algebra. The project involves studying modules over some maximal orders, developing a minimal model program for maximal orders on 3-folds, and studying Brauer groups of supersingular K3 surfaces in characteristic p. The second project focuses on Clifford algebras and Ulrich sheaves on varieties. This project uses Clifford algebra representations to construct Ulrich sheaves on algebraic varieties and examines stability in the category of Ulrich sheaves on varieties. The third project links Clifford algebras and Brauer groups of fields by investigating the relationship between cyclicity of division algebras and representations of Clifford algebras, and by using weighted Clifford algebras to study relative Brauer groups of curves. <br/><br/>The fruitful interactions between mathematics and theoretical physics in the past several decades have resulted in great interest in noncommutative algebras and Clifford algebras in particular. Noncommutative algebras are similar to polynomials in which the order of multiplication matters. Clifford algebras occur in the definition of the Dirac equation and are an integral part of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Noncommutative algebras can be studied using the sophisticated methods of algebraic geometry and, conversely, have been used to answer questions is algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry was developed and has proved to be a powerful tool for addressing some old problems in algebra. The subject of noncommutative algebraic geometry has been progressing rapidly, and the projects in this proposal further develop some deep geometric and algebraic aspects of noncommutative algebras (and Clifford algebras in particular) and related algebraic geometry."

While there has been a lot of recent progress in our understanding of the geometry of higher-dimensional varieties, almost all of this body of work is restricted to characteristic zero, due to the use of vanishing theorems that can fail in positive characteristic.  The first goal of this collaborative research is to build tools and a framework that would allow the main results in birational geometry to be extended to positive characteristics.  This would make systematic use of the recent techniques that have been devised to exploit the Frobenius morphism.  A second goal of the project is to further develop the study of invariants of singularities and of linear series, with an eye toward the remaining problems in the minimal model program.  There have been many recent advances in this area. In particular, a conjecture of Shokurov asserting that certain invariants of singularities (the log canonical thresholds) satisfy the so-called  ACC property has been solved by some of the PIs.  This suggests that other related but harder questions might be within reach, questions whose importance comes from the connection with one of the remaining conjectures in the minimal model program, the termination of flips. The PIs propose to attack one of these problems, predicting the ACC property of another invariant, the minimal log discrepancy.  In a separate direction, the PIs plan to undertake a systematic study of examples of linear systems on algebraic varieties that exhibit a pathological behavior from the point of view of various positivity invariants.<br/><br/>The last ten years have seen major breakthroughs in the study of higher-dimensional algebraic varieties, but several important problems are still open.  A central such problem is intimately related to the study of singularities and one of the goals of this project is to make progress on understanding the properties of the invariants of singularities that appear in this setting.  Another general goal of the PIs is to develop systematically the study of algebraic varieties of dimension at least 3 in positive characteristic.  A lot less is known in this setting, where new phenomena (sometimes considered pathological) arise.  The PIs expect that cross-pollination of ideas with other areas, in particular with commutative algebra, will play an important role in making progress in this direction.  Moreover, it is likely that techniques and results in this context would have many applications to other fields (for example, in arithmetic geometry).

One of the central themes in the project is the analysis of weakly commensurable Zariski-dense subgroups.  The notion of weak commensurability was introduced earlier in a joint work of the PI and G. Prasad, and its analysis for arithmetic groups has led to a resolution of several problems in differential geometry dealing with length-commensurable and isospectral arithmetically defined locally symmetric spaces.  In the current project, some finiteness results which were previously known only for arithmetic groups are expected to be generalized to arbitrary Zariski-dense subgroups.  This work is likely to have interesting consequences for non-arithmetically defined locally symmetric spaces.  It is also related to the problem in the theory of algebraic groups of to what extent an absolutely almost simple algebraic group over a field K is determined by the isomorphism classes of its maximal K-tori.  This part of the project will build on the PI's recent results analyzing division algebras having the same maximal subfields.  The PI also intends to continue the investigation of the congruence subgroup problem.<br/> <br/>Generally speaking, the project focuses on the analysis of a very broad class of matrix groups (Zariski-dense subgroups of semisimple algebraic groups) based on the information about the eigenvalues of their elements.  This approach is fundamental in the representation theory of finite groups, but as was discovered by the PI and G. Prasad it can also be used to characterize many arithmetic groups (which are special groups whose elements are matrices with integer matrices).  The goal of the project is to extend some of these results to groups much more general than arithmetic.  This work has applications to the famous question ''Can one hear the shape of a drum?'' in the context of some special spaces called locally symmetric spaces."

The main part of this project concerns some categorical arithmetic invariants such as dimensions, exponents, Frobenius-Schur indicators, and representations of the modular group associated with modular tensor categories. These arithmetic invariants are closely related among each other, and they serve as important tools for studying these algebraic structures. A basic question is the relationship between the prime factors of the dimension of a simple object and those of the quasi-exponent of the underlying category. Any progress here would help in proving a conjecture of Kaplansky on semisimple Hopf algebras that remains open. The project also concerns the classification of Hopf algebras whose dimensions admit a simple prime factorization. Progress on the preceding basic question would also help in classifying finite-dimensional Hopf algebras.<br/><br/>The appeal of symmetry has been guidance for understanding the nature of science. Some symmetry can be described in terms of algebraic structures. For instance, the symmetry of platonic solids can be described by some finite groups of spatial rotations. Hopf algebras and tensor categories are generalizations of groups which can also describe the symmetry of some physical systems.  They appear naturally in many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics such as conformal field theory, statistical mechanics, and quantum computations. Thus, a deeper understanding of these algebraic structures is of fundamental importance and it will eventually be useful in the other areas of science."

Three projects aim to use topological methods to understand the Brauer group, Azumaya algebras, and more generally torsors on schemes. (1) The PI will study the extent to which the foundational results of Jackowski, McClure, and Oliver on maps between classifying spaces of complex algebraic groups can be extended to finite approximations to these classifying spaces. Progress on this problem will enable the solution of a host of problems about when torsors for complex algebraic groups extend from the generic point of a scheme to the entire scheme. In low dimensions, early progress on this problem has been used by the PI and Ben Williams to settle an old question of Auslander and Goldman on the existence of Azumaya maximal orders in unramified division algebras, where it transpires that there are purely topological obstructions to the existence of these Azumaya maximal orders. (2) The PI will work toward computing the Chow groups and singular cohomology of the classifying spaces of special linear groups by various central subgroups. This has been done in special cases by Vezzosi and Vistoli. However, greater generality is needed for most applications. These Chow groups are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry, controlling the characteristic classes associated to certain torsors of fundamental importance in the study of the Brauer group. The computations will be directly useful to the first project, and to the following project. (3) The PI and Ben Williams previously formulated the topological period-index problem and established first results. They will continue this study, especially as it relates to the algebraic period-index conjecture. In particular, their results in low dimensions suggest a method for disproving the period-index conjecture, which would be a fundamental advance. Following this idea to its conclusion is the major aspiration of the first set of projects. A fourth project aims to continue to build a bridge between higher category theory and classical algebraic geometry, bringing the formidable techniques of the former to bear on various questions in the arithmetic of derived categories. For example, the PI is developing a toolbox using higher category theory that will allow a purely derived-category proof of Panin's computations of the K-theory of projective homogeneous spaces, once the existence of certain exceptional objects on the split forms of these spaces is known.<br/><br/>The PI proposes work in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, two areas of modern mathematics. Algebraic geometry is an ancient subject with many connections to real-world problems. Its goal is to understand the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, equations of central importance in various disciplines, such as theoretical physics, cryptography, and the modeling of dynamical systems like weather. Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to the analysis of large data sets that occur in computer vision and cancer research, frequently finding patterns that more traditional methods of data analysis fail to find. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several questions in algebraic geometry which have been identified by the community as among the most important."

These include the study of rational pairs and thrifty resolutions and their connections with Du Bois singularities and other singularities of the minimal model program.  In another project, also motivated by the moduli project, jointly with Patakfalvi the PI will work on proving a logarithmic version of Kollr's Ampleness Lemma and use it to prove the projectivity of the moduli space of stable log varieties.  The PI will also continue his work on the refined Viehweg conjecture regarding subvarieties of moduli stacks of canonically polarized smooth projective varieties.

This project is joint work with Kebekus.  <br/><br/>This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one that blossomed to the point where it has solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, and still in its simplest form it treats figures defined in the plane by polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics. A central problem in algebraic geometry is the classification of all geometric objects. In turn, an important part of classification theory is the theory of moduli. The latter's core idea is that one does not only want to understand these objects, but also understand the way they can be deformed. Moduli spaces play a very important role in theoretical physics. Studying curves on moduli spaces provides information on how an object is changing in space-time. One of the focuses of this project is on compact moduli spaces. Those are extensions of moduli spaces in general and they give additional information about singular deformations, ones that are essentially different from others."

The first problem is analyzing a conjectural geometric construction of supercuspidal representations of p-adic groups proposed by Lusztig in 1979.  Lusztig's construction can be viewed as a special case of automorphic induction.  While automorphic induction has been constructed in many special cases, the existing approaches are quite complicated and often rely on global methods.  Lusztig's construction is much more elegant, but the questions of formalizing it and comparing it to the more classical constructions of p-adic representation theory remain completely open.  It is expected that the results obtained by the principal investigator will shed light on the geometry that underlies the known cases of automorphic induction.  The second problem was formulated by M. Harris in 2002.  It asks for a construction of Bushnell-Kutzko types for the general linear group of a local field K in the cohomology of suitable analytic subspaces of the Lubin-Tate tower of K.  The principal investigator studies a family of open affinoids in the Lubin-Tate tower whose cohomology is expected to realize various special cases of the local Langlands and Jacquet-Langlands correspondences (which will partially answer Harris's question).  The relevant cohomology computations have much in common with the examples of p-adic Lusztig induction that have so far been understood.<br/><br/>The Langlands Program has dominated much of research in algebra during the last 40 years. It has connections to some of the most prominent results in number theory and other areas of mathematics, such as Fermat's Last Theorem. The principal investigator works in a branch of this field known as the local Langlands program.  It is concerned with the representation theory of the so-called p-adic groups, and the main driving force is the search for a general proof of the local Langlands correspondence.  Various special cases of this correspondence have been obtained by Henniart, Harris, Taylor and many other mathematicians.  However, most of the existing proofs are not explicit and do not provide sufficient information for the desirable applications of the local Langlands correspondence.  The principal investigator uses methods of geometric representation theory for unipotent groups, developed in his previous works, to give new explicit constructions of the local Langlands correspondence, and to simplify and clarify the existing ones.  One of the main tools is a conjectural geometric construction of representations of p-adic groups formulated by Lusztig in 1979.  Until recently this construction has remained relatively unknown because it was not clear how to compare it to the more classical constructions.  The principal investigator developed general techniques for analyzing this construction, and is currently using it to shed light on the geometry behind the local Langlands correspondence."

A tca can be defined as a commutative algebra (typically very large), equipped with an action of the infinite general linear group. There are two reasons for studying these objects. The first is internal: joint work of the PI with Sam indicates that tca's enjoy a rich theory. For example, although these algebras are typically not finitely generated, the large group action mitigates this and in some ways they behave as finitely generated algebras; one can therefore attempt to extend known results from commutative algebra. The second reason is external: tca's can be used to study objects of independent interest. Typically, these applications are to the stable behavior of infinite families of objects. Some example applications: syzygies of Segre embeddings (PI), equations of secant varieties (Draisma--Kuttler), stable representation theory (PI and Sam), and cohomology of configuration spaces (Church--Farb--Ellenberg).<br/><br/>An important theme in mathematics is that of stability. Loosely speaking, one might say that a sequence of objects exhibits stability if it eventually acquires a regular behavior. This property is important because it often allows the entire sequence of objects to be described by a finite amount of data. In recent years, it has been observed by several researchers that certain sequences of invariants arising in algebra and geometry exhibit stability. The PI introduced a tool, called twisted commutative algebras, to study some of these invariants. Joint work of the PI and Sam has shown that these algebras are interesting in their own right. The purpose of this project is to continue to develop the theory and applications of these algebras."

The following themes will be represented at the conference:  the Minimal Model Program and its applications, vanishing theorems and multiplier ideals, derived categories and applications, Hodge theory and complex geometry, moduli spaces and enumerative geometry, commutative and computational algebra.  More details about the conference, as well as the list of confirmed speakers, are available at the conference website, at http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~mpopa/robfest/<br/><br/>The conference will focus on some of the outstanding recent developments in Algebraic Geometry.  The speakers have been chosen on the basis of their research contributions to the field, but also for their expository skills and dedication to the development of younger generations of researchers and teachers in mathematics.  Some have produced many of the most important textbooks and advanced monographs in Algebraic Geometry in the last decades, have introduced many of today's algebraic geometers to active research topics, and have been a major force in developing the field as a whole.  We therefore expect the conference to be well-attended by young researchers wishing to learn about, and then share with members of their groups, current questions in a wide spectrum of topics. The talks will contain a substantial expository and didactic component for this younger audience, for whom it is sometimes difficult to keep up to date with the rapid developments that the field is seeing."

Explicitly, he proposes to apply methods of commutative algebra to study adjoint line bundles in characteristic p > 0, especially to produce global sections.  Such line bundles are crucial when classifying the central objects of algebraic geometry.  Over the complex numbers, the standard techniques to study adjoint line bundles include Kodaira-type vanishing theorems.  These theorems are unavailable in characteristic p > 0, thus methods of the Frobenius morphism and test ideals from commutative algebra will be employed instead.  The PI also proposes to use methods of algebraic geometry to study questions related to singularities in commutative algebra.  The Principal Investigator will also run several mathematics camps for high school students.  He will employ students to help develop software related to test ideals and singularities in characteristic p > 0.  Finally he will continue to organize conferences.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a very active field of mathematics.  Explicitly, it is the study of geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) made up of the solutions to polynomial equations (for example, the parabola is the solution to y = x^2). Characteristic p > 0 algebraic geometry is the study of these equations and their solutions when the underlying rules of arithmetic have changed.  For example, instead of simply 4 + 4 = 8, in characteristic p = 5, once we get to 5 we start counting at 1 again so that 4 + 4 = 3 (like counting hours of a clock). This type of arithmetic and related algebra and geometry is heavily employed in modern cryptography and coding theory.  The running of camps, conferences and the development of software will also help train the next generation of researchers."

These compactifications, called moduli spaces of stable quasimaps, produce new curve-counting invariants, which are expected to be related by wall-crossing formulas with Gromov-Witten invariants. In recent work with Kim, the PI has found such wall-crossing formulas in genus zero and they turn out to give a significant generalization of Givental's toric mirror theorems. The PI will work to extend the theory in several directions. First, the wall-crossing formulas should extend to curves of higher genus, and the resulting theory for Calabi-Yau three-folds is conjecturally equal to the BCOV B-model theory of the mirror Calabi-Yau, but WITHOUT changing coordinates by the mirror map. The PI plans to prove this conjecture at least for local Calabi-Yau targets. Other projects will provide extensions to orbifold targets (with applications to the Crepant Resolution Conjecture), and to Landau-Ginzburg models (with applications to the Calabi-Yau/LG correspondence). Further applications, such as a proof of the general Abelian/Non-abelian Correspondence in Gromov-Witten theory are also expected.<br/><br/>This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, an old and highly developed branch of mathematics, which at its core is the study of geometric shapes defined by polynomial equations. Moduli theory is concerned with how these shapes deform. The moduli spaces studied by the investigator have deep connections with the mirror symmetry phenomenon discovered in string theory, a very active area of theoretical physics. In the last two decades, the results and techniques from algebraic geometry, especially the theory of moduli spaces, have been successfully employed in string theory. On the other hand, ideas from string theory have opened up new directions of research in mathematics by suggesting striking conjectures and at the same time putting old unsolved problems into a new light. The project will continue this fruitful interaction by offering new insights on mirror symmetry at higher genus.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Topology programs."

In a completely different direction, Robert Langlands used Lie groups as the language to attack problems in number theory, aspects of which have led to applications in modern cryptography.  The projects undertaken under the support of this grant place limitations on how Lie groups can appear as symmetries of physical problems, on one hand, and limitations on how they can appear as symmetries of number theory problems, on the other.

The first eight meetings (2005-2012) have each brought together an average of 40 participants from universities, FFRDC's, and liberal arts colleges in Southern California, ranging from beginning graduate students to senior faculty and researchers.  The speakers at the SCNTD conferences are an internationally diverse group of number theorists, speaking on a wide variety of topics.  The lectures are designed to promote research and to encourage fruitful interactions among researchers at various stages of their careers.  One of the main goals of the conferences is to disseminate the latest research in number theory and related areas.  The SCNTD conferences offer their participants the opportunity to interact with scholars from other institutions, and also give graduate students and postdocs the opportunity to interact with more senior mathematicians in an informal setting, conducive to learning and collaboration.  Most universities and colleges in Southern California have small number theory groups which makes it difficult to maintain regular and active number theory seminars.  The SCNTD conferences have become a very effective way to bring together a critical mass of number theorists in a way that most of these institutions individually could not possibly afford.<br/><br/>The current award will fund the next three Southern California Number Theory Day meetings at UC San Diego in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

Mathematically, those invariants are typically described as virtual Euler characteristics of some moduli spaces. The wall-crossing phenomenon is related to the presence of real codimension one ""walls"" in the space of parameters, where the invariants jump. In the case of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, the walls live in the moduli space of Bridgeland stability conditions on the ppropriate Calabi-Yau categories. Similar walls also occur in the theory of representations of quivers and cluster algebras. In mirror symmetry, walls correspond to jumps in the number of pseudo-holomorphic discs bounded by the torus fibers of an SYZ Lagrangian fibration. In supersymmetric gauge theories in physics, the number of BPS states jumps across ""walls of marginal stability"". The Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formulas for Donaldson-Thomas invariants thus occur in the physics literature on topics such as moduli spaces of vector ultiplets of 4-dimensional supersymmetric theories and supersymmetric black holes. Since these various wall-crossing formulas look so similar, one can ask for a common formalism. The aim of the FRG is to study the underlying ""wall-crossing structures"" and demonstrate hat the above-mentioned similarities are not coincidental, but rather reflect a deep underlying theory.<br/><br/>It is a frequently encountered situation in mathematics and physics that numerical quantities which in principle depend on various parameters actually are constant for general parameter values (they are ""invariants""), but jump along certain ""walls"" in the parameter space. Wall-crossing formulas describe these ""jumps"" quantitatively. The subject of wall-crossing has recently become a very active one due to its relevance to a number of different areas of mathematics and physics. The aim of this project is to develop the concept of ""wall-crossing structure"" rigorously and apply it to problems both old and new in which wall-crossing formulas appear. The results arising from this project will be in demand by both the mathematics and physics communities. The FRG will also build a research community around this coordinated effort, involving a mix of junior and senior researchers, training opportunities for graduate students, and the rganization of several workshops."

The workshop is part of the thematic program on Calabi-Yau varieties at the Fields Institute.  The NSF support will complement the existing funding and will be used to cover some of the travel expenses of the participants based in the United States. The Fields Institute is a major international research center with extensive experience in organizing similar events. The workshop in question focuses on the appearance of modular forms in many different contexts: in the physics of Calabi-Yau manifolds, such as generating functions for certain physical quantities; in the arithmetic of Calabi-Yau manifolds, as part of the general Langlands philosophy in the study of Galois representations of Calabi-Yau varieties defined over number fields; in the structure of geometric invariants on Calabi-Yau varieties, such as Donaldson-Thomas invariants. All of these represent extremely active topics of research, and the workshop aims to synthesize the different points of view brought by each of these perspectives.<br/><br/>Calabi-Yau manifolds play a vital role at the crossroads of mathematics and physics. While they first arose as important objects in geometry, Calabi-Yau manifolds really came to prominence after they appeared naturally in string theory. String theory replaces the traditional notion of the point particle with a small loop of string, moving through space-time. To make string theory compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must be ten-dimensional. Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one expects six of these dimensions to be a very small ""curled up"" geometric object. These objects are Calabi-Yau manifolds. Their introduction into physics led to a great deal of new mathematics. A crucial property of Calabi-Yau manifolds is that they both have very delicate flatness properties (satisfying so-called Ricci flatness) and they can be defined using systems of polynomials equations. As a result, they can be viewed as both algebro-geometric and arithmetic objects, the latter if the polynomial equations have coefficients in a number field. Intimate connections have been found between the physical, algebro-geometric and artihmetic features of Calabi-Yau manifolds. The goal of this workshop is to explore these relationships, making new connections between researchers with these three different perspectives.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Geometric Analysis programs."

The LLC is a body of predicted relations between the representation theory of local Galois groups and the representation theory of reductive groups over a p-adic field. The goals of the work in this proposal are aimed toward an explicit understanding of the LLC. There are four topics: i) Extending the proposer's earlier work introducing Geometric Invariant Theory to study representations of p-adic groups, in particular the recently-constructed 'epipelagic' representations. ii) Study of discrete Langlands parameters, including proof of a conjectured inequality for adjoint Swan conductors, atypical behavior at small primes, parameters for Yu's representations, classification of depths and mass formulas. iii) Uniqueness results for the LLC. iv) Jordan decomposition of depth zero representations and LLC.<br/><br/>The mathematics in this proposal is rooted in two ancient topics of mathematics: Representation Theory (the study of symmetry) and Number Theory (numerical solutions of equations). Though these appear to be two quite different areas of mathematics, the Local Langlands Correspondence predicts surprising relations between them. Roughly speaking, it says that certain kinds of infinite dimensional symmetries should correspond to certain equations whose solutions have a related collection of finite dimensional symmetries. The aims of the proposal are first, to discover and explicitly verify new and interesting examples of the LLC, and second, to use the predictions of the LLC to make new discoveries in Number Theory and Representation Theory."

Modern number theorists are interested in the field of algebraic numbers (numbers that satisfy a polynomial equation with rational coefficients) and its group of symmetries (which is an example of a Galois group). The conjectures of Langlands and Fontaine-Mazur then predict that representations of this group are intimately related to objects from distinct branches of mathematics such as representation theory, analysis and algebraic geometry. Progress on these conjectures has led to some spectacular results such as Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and has been a driving force for much development in neighboring fields. Objects of fundamental interest in this theory, such as elliptic curves, play a large role in cryptography and internet security.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with the correspondence, predicted by Langlands and Fontaine-Mazur, between Galois representations and automorphic representations. This correspondence is still largely conjectural but there has been much progress in recent years. The proof of the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture has been considerably generalized to rather general potential automorphy theorems that apply to Galois representations of arbitrary dimension.  Such results have led, for example, to a proof of the Sato-Tate conjecture. On the other hand, these results have the restriction that they apply only to Galois representations with distinct Hodge-Tate weights. This restriction rules out some well known examples of Galois representations such as Artin representations and the Tate modules of abelian varieties of dimension greater than one. The principal goal of this project is to develop modularity results that apply to Galois representations with repeated Hodge-Tate weights.<br/>"

It was founded by the algebraists in these three institutions in 1999 to promote interaction among  faculty, post docs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines.   The three institutions are within 3-5 hours driving distance and with modest travel and lodging support the weekend KUMUNU conference will continue to have significant regional impact.  KUMUNU moved to Missouri in 2012.  Last year we held the conference in Columbia on the weekend of September 22-23.  The KUMUNU conference has a strong tradition of playing an important  mentoring role for graduate students, recent PhD's and early career faculty in research institutions and four year colleges in the extended midwest/great plains region.  KUMUNU provides an annual venue for these groups to come together with senior researchers at KU, MU and NU along with two or three senior researchers from some institutions not so near.  KUMUNU stimulates interactions by having a series of 6 or 7 talks on current research accessible to graduate students with ample time and opportunity for interaction outside of talks in an informal and friendly setting.  In addition to faculty and students from KU, MU and NU, and other institutions from Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, KUMUNU draws participants from neighboring states such as Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.  One of the main goals is to showcase research of young faculty, helping enrich the research programs of recent PhD's and graduate students in commutative algebra and related fields by both formal and informal mentoring from experienced researchers.  In addition, KUMUNU serves to enhance the existing strengths at these three institutions.  The conference website is  http:/kumunu.missouri.edu.<br/><br/>The KUMUNU conference will provide an opportunity for mathematicians to interact and establish research connections with each other; in particular, the participants will benefit from interaction with other researchers and from seeing recent developments in the field and its relationships with other areas. The primary impacts of the conference will be its dissemination of recent ideals in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of students and early career participants.  Participants will take ideas form the conference back to their colleagues and students, stimulating further research and mathematical enrichment at their home institutions.  The relatively small size of the meeting and its geographic and disciplinary focus will be particularly effective at enabling participants to establish productive collaborative relationships.  Encouragement and mentoring that begins at the conference will significantly contribute to the success and professional development of early career mathematicians whether in research institutions or primarily teaching institutions."

To that end, the program proposed by the PI will focus on the F-signature and other related so-called F-invariants, including Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity and test ideals. Central to the investigations of the PI is the interaction with geometric methods in characteristic zero stemming from complex algebraic geometry. One of the main objectives of the program is to better describe the geometry and broader connections of F-signature, as well as its many generalizations.  The PI aims to approach various problems related to a number of long standing open questions in the field, including the equivalence of weak versus strong F-regularity and the direct summand conjecture.  Furthermore, the PI plans to build upon recent work describing test ideals via regular alterations in exploring the local and global geometry of algebraic varieties in positive characteristic.<br/><br/>Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry are among the oldest and yet most active disciplines in mathematics. The fields have strong ties to such diverse areas as complex analysis, topology, and number theory, and are used in a wide variety of applied settings. Applications range from error-correcting codes in computer science and genomics to control theory and modeling in engineering.  These fields seek to understand geometric objects (algebraic varieties) given locally as the solutions to polynomial equations. For instance, a plane curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two variables (such as the cusp y^2 = x^3). The richness and simplicity of polynomial equations make algebraic varieties fascinating objects of study.  The particular questions the PI proposes to study will hopefully lead to a deeper understanding of the varieties and singularities in positive characteristic, i.e. over number systems having the property that a prime number vanishes.  In particular, these systems include the finite fields at the heart of essentially all electronic computation."

While there has been a lot of recent progress in our understanding of the geometry of higher-dimensional varieties, almost all of this body of work is restricted to characteristic zero, due to the use of vanishing theorems that can fail in positive characteristic.  The first goal of this collaborative research is to build tools and a framework that would allow the main results in birational geometry to be extended to positive characteristics.  This would make systematic use of the recent techniques that have been devised to exploit the Frobenius morphism.  A second goal of the project is to further develop the study of invariants of singularities and of linear series, with an eye toward the remaining problems in the minimal model program.  There have been many recent advances in this area. In particular, a conjecture of Shokurov asserting that certain invariants of singularities (the log canonical thresholds) satisfy the so-called  ACC property has been solved by some of the PIs.  This suggests that other related but harder questions might be within reach, questions whose importance comes from the connection with one of the remaining conjectures in the minimal model program, the termination of flips. The PIs propose to attack one of these problems, predicting the ACC property of another invariant, the minimal log discrepancy.  In a separate direction, the PIs plan to undertake a systematic study of examples of linear systems on algebraic varieties that exhibit a pathological behavior from the point of view of various positivity invariants.<br/><br/>The last ten years have seen major breakthroughs in the study of higher-dimensional algebraic varieties, but several important problems are still open.  A central such problem is intimately related to the study of singularities and one of the goals of this project is to make progress on understanding the properties of the invariants of singularities that appear in this setting.  Another general goal of the PIs is to develop systematically the study of algebraic varieties of dimension at least 3 in positive characteristic.  A lot less is known in this setting, where new phenomena (sometimes considered pathological) arise.  The PIs expect that cross-pollination of ideas with other areas, in particular with commutative algebra, will play an important role in making progress in this direction.  Moreover, it is likely that techniques and results in this context would have many applications to other fields (for example, in arithmetic geometry).  As part of the collaborative effort, the PIs plan several events that will bring together members of the mathematical community working on related problems and also help disseminate the results and the techniques developed as part of this project."

The Southwest Center for Arithmetic Geometry was founded in 1997.  The NSF has provided the primary support for the center since its inception, with renewal of funding in 2002, 2006, 2009, and 2012.  The primary activity of the Southwest Center is the Arizona Winter School (AWS), an annual meeting which has become a prominent national event and provides high-level training and research experience for graduate students in arithmetic geometry.  The AWS is an intensive five-day meeting, organized around a different central topic each year, that features a set of courses by leading and emerging experts.  The AWS is not a traditional conference: the speakers organize courses of four lectures, provide lecture notes in advance, and propose projects for graduate students to work on during the meeting.  Nightly working sessions on these projects and on separate problem sets are run by the speakers and postdoctoral fellows.  On the last day, students present their findings to the participants of the meeting.  The result is a particularly intense and focused five days of mathematical activity for everyone involved.  Recent Winter School topics have included Number Theory and Dynamics, Stark-Heegner Points, and Ramification and Geometry.  The topics of upcoming Winter Schools will be guided by future mathematical developments.<br/><br/>At the Winter School, connections among peers are formed, and mentoring relationships between students and senior researchers are developed.  As has been the case at previous Winter Schools, subsequent collaborations between participants at all levels are the norm. Students make concrete strides toward becoming research mathematicians, post-doctoral assistants gain valuable mentoring experience in their academic careers, and faculty develop new interests and see new connections that lead to important published results.  The Southwest Center website shares reusable content from the Winter Schools, including lecture notes, project descriptions, and audio and video of lectures.  Through these thorough records, the dialogues begun at the AWS are extended to the greater mathematical community, and the efforts of the AWS participants are made freely and indefinitely available to all.

Studying the symmetries of a model is often more fruitful than studying the model directly, and representation theory has found many applications in physics and chemistry as well as in other mathematical fields. The cluster algebras provide a mathematical framework for fundamental patterns which occur throughout representation theory. Surprisingly, these patterns are also observed in various other branches of science which, a priori, are not related to representation theory. This motivates a further development of the theory of cluster algebras to which this project will contribute. <br/>"

The focus of this project is to expand our understanding of such groups in two different directions: going from finite covolume to infinite covolume (and beyond); going from characteristic zero to positive characteristic. The PI plans to see in what extent the analytical behavior of the congruence quotients of a finitely generated group is dictated by its Zariski-topology. The PI's second goal is to study homogeneous dynamics over a local field of positive characteristic. The analytical properties of the congruence quotients of linear groups have been showed to be extremely useful in various parts of mathematics and computer science. In the past decade they have been used in affine sieve, variation of Galois representations, hyperbolic geometry and group theory. It is clear that extending these results would have immediate impacts in other branches of mathematics. As the second component of this project, the PI plans to work toward the proof of Raghunathan's conjectures for semisimple groups over a local field of positive characteristic. Many mathematicians worked on these conjectures, e.g. Dani, Margulis, Shah, Tomanov, and finally in a series of papers, Ratner completely proved these conjectures over a local field of characteristic zero. As Ratner's results have been extremely fruitful in various parts of mathematics, it is expected that any partial result toward their positive characteristic analogue would have immediate applications.<br/><br/>One of the main tools to study an object or a structure is to understand its symmetries. That is the intrinsic reason why group theory is in a close connection with other branches of mathematics and physics. For instance the PI's work on linear groups can give us the precise algebraic conditions to construct explicit families of sparse highly connected graphs known as expanders. Expanders are extremely useful in communication, theoretical computer science (e.g. error correcting codes) and various branches of mathematics. The PI studies also the dynamical systems of algebraic nature and their deep and fruitful connections with other branches of mathematics, e.g. number theory."

The existence of such generalized theta functions points to the existence of geometrically meaningful compactification of the moduli space, vastly generalizing the Mumford-Namikawa-Alexeev-Olsson compactificaton of A_{g,d}, and the Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinski-Alexeev-Olsson theory of the secondary polytope, and at the same time suggests a synthetic construction of the mirror as Proj of the canonically described ring.  The proposal includes a detailed scheme for carrying this out in dimension two, and for cluster varieties of all dimensions.<br/><br/>The main proposal is that a broad class of geometric objects, so called Calabi-Yau varieties, come with a natural system of coordinates. Informally: If you live on a Calabi-Yau variety, there should be natural, intrinsic quantities in your world, whose values determine your precise position. As these geometric objects play a fundamental role in diverse areas of mathematics, these intrinsic quantities should play a similar fundamental role. More broadly, string theory models suggest that WE live on a Calabi-Yau, and thus the proposal suggests there are such fundamental quantities, not yet understood, in our world."

One of the goals is to establish a Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand type duality principle for these categories and to investigate the combinatorial and homological consequences of having such a duality.  Another goal of this proposal is to develop a connection between the homological properties of the category of infinite-dimensional representations of the quantum affine algebra and the tensor structure of this category.  The existence of such a connection is unexpected and somewhat mysterious and is suggested by some recent work of the PI.

The second part of the project will focus on a specific equation, for which the answer to the question of how many solutions there are (for different groups) is related to representation varieties, which are well-studied objects from mathematical physics and number theory.

In the case of elliptic curves, which is addressed by the celebrated conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, the research described in this proposal aims to establish simple p-adic criteria for an elliptic curve to have both algebraic and analytic rank one, to use this criteria to prove a converse to the work of Kolyvagin and Gross-Zagier, and to show that this criteria holds for a positive proportion of all elliptic curves over the rationals (when ordered by height), thereby proving that both the average algebraic and analytic ranks are positive. It also aims to connect the vanishing of the central critical value of the L-function of an elliptic curve over the rationals or a totally real number field to the non-triviality of the associated p-adic Selmer group through methods involving the Iwasawa theory of unitary groups, extending some of the investigator's prior work on such problems. This project includes further development and  generalization of these methods so as to apply to L-functions arising from more general unitary groups, especially groups of higher rank, and to connect values of p-adic L-functions to Abel-Jacobi maps of cycles of positive dimension on unitary Shimura varieties.<br/><br/>The research described in this proposal aims to connect certain algebraic and analytic objects that are fundamental for many problems in number theory. The analytic objects are L-functions - a special class of functions built from number-theoretic data (this class includes the celebrated Riemann zeta function which is built from the prime numbers).  For over a century and a half L-functions have been a crucial ingredient in efforts to tackle the most central problems in number theory (for example, understanding the distribution of prime numbers or the structure of the set of rational number solutions to cubic curves). An important feature of L-functions is that their values at certain special points are expected to encode information about the orders of algebraic quantities also associated with the number-theoretic data defining the L-function. The investigator aims to prove the existence of such relations, with an emphasis on the important case of elliptic curves. Understanding the structure of the set of rational points on an elliptic curve - essentially the rational number solutions to a cubic equation - has been an aim in number theory for over a century, with connections to open problems that go back even further (even to classical Greek geometry). The problem of connecting the structure of this set with the special values of the L-function of the elliptic curve is often listed as one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. It is expected that this project will especially further the understanding of this connection and that it will develop new methods that will be useful for making progress on more general problems of a similar nature. The methods will draw particularly on the theory of automorphic forms, which are closely connected to both analysis and algebra and a rich supply of L-functions."

The PI will also use moduli spaces of Hitchin type to study representations of rational Cherednik algebras, enumeration of Galois representations, and global analogs of Lusztig's character sheaves.<br/><br/>In mathematics, it is a general rule that the most interesting symmetries should arise geometrically.  For example, the ancient classification of Platonic solids is seen nowadays as an instance of finding all 'finite symmetries' in three-dimensional space.  With the revolution of algebraic geometry in the second half of the 20th century, we now have powerful geometric tools available to solve classical and new problems in number theory and group theory. The PI will use these geometric tools to attack problems in the Langlands program.  In the 70s, Langlands made a series of conjectures which links arithmetic invariants (e.g., solutions to Diophantine equations) to analytic invariants (e.g., modular forms).  The predictions that Langlands made, if proved, will be extremely powerful in solving classical problems (including the Fermat Problem which was solved in this way).  Through this project, the PI hopes to shed light on some problems in the Langlands program and to discover more symmetries that appear in geometry."

The main goal of the conference is to bring together mathematicians and physicists who work on ideas related to string theory. String theory, as well as quantum field theory, has contributed a series of profound ideas which gave rise to entirely new mathematical fields and revitalized older ones. For mathematics, string theory has been a source of many significant inspirations, ranging from Seiberg-Witten theory in four-manifolds, to enumerative geometry and Gromov-Witten theory in algebraic geometry, to work on the Jones polynomial in knot theory, to advances in symplectic topology, to recent progress in the geometric Langlands program and the development of derived algebraic geometry and n-category theory. In the other direction, mathematics has provided physicists with powerful tools, ranging from powerful differential geometric techniques for solving or analyzing key partial differential equations, to toric geometry, to K-theory and derived categories in D-branes, to the analysis of Calabi-Yau manifolds and string compactifications, to the use of modular forms and other arithmetic techniques. The depth, power and novelty of the results obtained in both fields thanks to their interaction is truly mind boggling. String-Math is the annual conference that was founded to reflect the most significant progress at the interface of string theory and mathematics.<br/><br/>String theory is the attempt to build a mathematical model which describes all four fundamental forces and all forms of matter. It assumes that the fundamental objects of the theory are one-dimensional objects - ""strings"" with elementary particles (i.e., electrons and quarks) being oscillations of fundamental strings. In particular, string theory aims to reconcile gravity, i.e., general relativity, with quantum mechanics which is the formalism in which the other three forces are described. String theory is very mathematical in nature and its development was based on advances in modern mathematics and inspired many recent developments in mathematics.  The main goal of the String-Math conference is to bring together mathematicians and physicists who work on ideas related to string theory.  By now there is a large and rapidly growing number of both mathematicians and physicists working at the string-theoretic interface between the two academic fields. The influence flows in both directions, with mathematical techniques and ideas contributing crucially to major advances in string theory. Following the success of first two meetings of String-Math series the conference String-Math 2013 is expected to have a major impact on the field and to serve as a record of the state of the art in string-related mathematics."

While certain themes in additive combinatorics are classical in number theory, there is also focus on new structural questions that turned out to be important. For instance, the work of Gowers and, later, Green and Tao on arithmetic progressions have put considerable impetus on Freiman's theorem and it's quantitative versions. Parallel to these results, a general `sum-product' theory in finite fields and residue rings was developed. The roots of this research go back for instance to early work of Erdos-Szemeredi  and the finite field version of the Kakeya problem (solved by Z. Dvir). It turned out that results from sum-product and product theory in various settings are of interest in their own right as they lead to new results in analytic number theory (such as estimates of short character sums), in pseudo-randomness and in group theory (growth, expansion and spectral gaps). The PI intends to explore finite field analogues of the Szemeredi Trotter theorem on incidences for algebraic curves (which are a special case of so-called pseudo-line systems). In the finite field setting, such results are presently only available for straight lines. More general results for pseudo-line systems have been obtained over the reals but none of the known approaches seem adaptable to the finite fields situation, so that new ideas are clearly needed here. Results of this type would have major implications in the areas mentioned above because they allow to obtain nontrivial statements on solutions of systems of equations in situations where classical number theory is not applicable. As a particular case, the PI would like to obtain analogues of the Bombieri-Pila results on lattice points on curves restricted to boxes in the prime field setting. Related to 'growth' phenomena in groups, the work of Breuillard, Green and Tao provides a complete description of 'approximate groups' that in some sense generalize Freiman's theorem and also provide a finitary version of Gromov's theorem. At this stage, the results are only qualitative and obtaining quantitative versions would be most interesting, in particular in view of the consequences to group expansion. The PI will continue to work with her collaborators on Poonen's conjecture on the multiplicative order of F-points on curves. Again this is a problem at the interface of combinatorics, algebra and number theory where progress can be expected.<br/><br/>Arithmetic combinatorics and `sum-product theory' in various settings have become increasingly significant to various other fields, such as pseudo-randomness in computer science, classical analytic number theory and the theory of expansion in linear groups. The purpose of this proposal is to continue research on the related issues in combinatorial number theory and their applications in particular, to  problems of estimating the number of solutions of algebraic equations when the variables are restricted. This research involves different groups of people and the interaction of various branches of mathematics, occasionally leading to progress on old problems.<br/>"

They are defined inductively, in increasing order of their complexity, as the relations between the equations, the relations between these relations, and so on. When the algebraic varieties come equipped with a large group of symmetries, which is often the case in nature, the syzygies will inherit some of those symmetries. The PI and his collaborators will employ a combination of methods from algebraic geometry, combinatorial topology, commutative algebra, and representation theory in order to study the equations and syzygies of natural spaces of tensors (also known as multidimensional matrices or arrays). A fundamental problem that will be addressed concerns the generalization of the familiar statement from linear algebra which states that matrices of rank less than r are defined by the vanishing of the determinants of their r x r submatrices. For multidimensional arrays of dimension larger than two a general statement like this one is unknown, and would have important applications to algebraic statistics, biology, complexity theory, signal processing etc."

It revolves around understanding how various fundamental algebraic objects occurring in mathematics---such as rings, class groups, algebraic curves and varieties, and maps relating such structures---are parametrized. Our goals in understanding these parametrizations are at least fourfold: 1) to describe how these fundamental algebraic objects are distributed with respect to their most basic invariants; 2) to discover new invariants of these objects, and their applications; 3) to develop efficient and practical algorithms for performing computations with these algebraic objects; and, perhaps most importantly, 4) to discover and understand how various seemingly different algebraic structures are in fact closely related to each other. Such parametrizations have been already used by the PI over the past few years to obtain precise information on the distribution of number fields with respect to basic invariants such as discriminant and class number divisibility. Applying refined counting methods to these parametrizations has led, for example, to a proof of the first known case of the Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet class number heuristics for higher degree number fields, and other theorems of this nature are forthcoming. In more recent joint works with Arul Shankar, Wei Ho, and Dick Gross, theorems on the average sizes of Selmer groups in families of elliptic curves and hyperelliptic curves have been obtained, with applications to understanding the distributions of rational points on such curves.  We expect several further analogous results on rational points, divisors, and other data of this kind for algebraic curves and surfaces in the near future.<br/><br/>The primary purpose of applying for this grant is the support of graduate students. Many of the projects described above will involve graduate (and undergraduate) students in an essential way. All these projects involve very fundamental questions in number theory, and are an excellent way to introduce and bring students into the subject. Many other mathematicians from various institutions will also be involved in these projects, which will thus increase interactions among researchers from many different but related subjects."

Central to the investigations of the PI is the interaction with geometric methods in characteristic zero stemming from complex algebraic geometry. One of the main objectives of the program is to better describe the geometry and broader connections of F-signature, as well as its many generalizations.  The PI aims to approach various problems related to a number of long standing open questions in the field, including the equivalence of weak versus strong F-regularity and the direct summand conjecture.  Furthermore, the PI plans to build upon recent work describing test ideals via regular alterations in exploring the local and global geometry of algebraic varieties in positive characteristic.<br/><br/>Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry are among the oldest and yet most active disciplines in mathematics. The fields have strong ties to such diverse areas as complex analysis, topology, and number theory, and are used in a wide variety of applied settings. Applications range from error-correcting codes in computer science and genomics to control theory and modeling in engineering.  These fields seek to understand geometric objects (algebraic varieties) given locally as the solutions to polynomial equations. For instance, a plane curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two variables (such as the cusp y^2 = x^3). The richness and simplicity of polynomial equations make algebraic varieties fascinating objects of study.  The particular questions the PI proposes to study will hopefully lead to a deeper understanding of the varieties and singularities in positive characteristic, i.e. over number systems having the property that a prime number vanishes.  In particular, these systems include the finite fields at the heart of essentially all electronic computation."

They occur in abundance throughout mathematics and physics. For more than one century, the theory of modular forms has being playing a central role in number theory, as witnessed in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  The symmetries of modular forms are captured by the elements of the special linear group of degree 2 over the ring of integers. Among all modular forms, majority of them are  noncongruence in the sense that their symmetries cannot be described by congruences. The study of noncongruence modular forms has been fallen behind its congruence counterpart due to the lack of a satisfactory  Hecke theory. However,  recent progresses on  noncongruence modular forms have revealed  their rich connections with several fruitful research frontiers: p-adic modular forms,  automorphic forms, and Galois representations. The theory of noncongruence modular forms has  far reaching impacts on other areas like the conformal field theory and combinatorics. The  project aims at  a further theoretic development of  noncongruence modular forms with applications to problems like supercongruences, which are special congruences satisfied by many interesting combinatorial or arithmetic sequences.  The scientific objectives are:  study when Galois representations attached to noncongruence modular forms are related to automorphic forms via Langlands correspondence; understand a fundamental conjecture  that characterizes genuine noncongruence modular forms; explore supercongruences using the perspective of Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer congruences that were originated in the study of noncongruence modular forms.  Currently, the proofs of supercongruences often require the finding of  auxiliary  identities, which procedure often involves intriguing guesses. A more conceptual understanding of supercongruences may shed lights on how to search for these identities systematically.<br/><br/>The research outcomes will be published by high quality journals and disseminated at various conferences and seminars.  The  PI will continue to widen the impacts of the her research program  by mentoring undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs, as well as organizing scientific conferences. In recent years, the PI has been seriously involved in activities to promote the advancement of women in mathematics. She was a group co-leader for Banff International Research Station workshops on Women in Numbers (WIN) in 2008 and WIN2 in 2011 and  is one of the organizers for a coming  WIN 3 conference in 2014."

Asymptotic behaviors of regulator maps and local height pairings, degeneration of motives, asymptotic behaviors of divergences which occur in physics, Hodge conjecture, and also to Iwasawa theory.

Along the way the PI plans to establish several unexpected links between seemingly unrelated topics.  Specifically, the PI will prove a 'quantum version' of an important equivalence of categories due to Bezrukavnikov.  This 'quantum version' relates a category of D-modules on the base affine space to an equivariant derived category of sheaves on the affine Grassmannian.  The PI then expects to find a natural interpretation of dynamical Weyl groups in terms of the algebra of differential operators on the base affine space.  In a different direction, motivated by recent work of Braverman, Maulik, and Okounkov, the PI will address the problem of finding an interpretation of the canonical flat connection on the quantum cohomology of the Springer resolution as a Gauss-Manin connection.  The idea here is that the correct mirror dual of the Springer resolution is a ""noncommutative space"" and the mirror dual of the quantum connection is the Gauss-Manin connection on periodic cyclic homology of that noncommutative space.<br/><br/>The proposed work opens up a wide variety of independent directions for research.  One of the central features of the proposed projects is the application of methods and results developed in one branch of mathematics to a totally different area of mathematics.  For example the research involves the systematic application of various algebraic techniques to problems in geometry and representation theory.  Thus one of the goals of the project is to enhance the concept of the ""unity of mathematics"".  The proposed work should also have far reaching applications not only in various areas of mathematics, but also in mathematical physics and theoretical physics, especially in quantum physics.  The mathematical sciences, viewed as a whole, make a profound contribution to society.  The current project goes a long way toward promoting the interactions between different disciplines and enhancing our scientific understanding."

Central to the Langlands program is the study of arithmetic moduli, which is to say parameter spaces for geometric objects defined over a local or global field. Arithmetic moduli include modular curves and Shimura varieties in the global setting, and the Lubin-Tate tower and spaces of Rapoport-Zink in the local setting. Such geometric objects are always structured in towers, such as the tower of modular curves of level a power of p. Taken as a whole, a tower of arithmetic moduli admits an action of a reductive group, and studying this action on the cohomology of the tower is the only way we know how to attach a Galois representation to an automorphic form. This project concerns arithmetic moduli at infinite level, e.g. the inverse limit along a tower of modular curves. A recent discovery of the PI is that, in the case of the Lubin-Tate tower, such limits exist as objects in Peter Scholze's new category of perfectoid spaces. There are many ways in which the inverse limit object is actually simpler than the constituent layers of the tower. The PI intends to generalize these discoveries to general arithmetic moduli. These results will be leveraged into new insights in the Langlands program. In particular this proposal represents the most promising hope yet for a proof of the local Langlands correspondence for GL(n) which is purely local in nature (i.e., which does not involve automorphic representations).<br/><br/>This proposal includes a plan for the research-level participation of graduate and undergraduate students at Boston University, with appropriate projects for each.

These programs include the PROMYS program, a number theory summer program for high school students located in Boston University, and the Arizona Winter School, an intensive mini-course for graduate students which takes place in Tucson.

The project fuses techniques from geometry and quantum field theory to unravel the hidden complexity of algebraic singularities, to extract new enumerative invariants of varieties, and to construct novel dualities in representation theory. Five problems will be studied. The first one aims to construct new algebraic invariants of moduli spaces and of symplectic singularities. The building and computation of these invariants requires a theoretical development of the formalism of shifted symplectic structures in non-commutative geometry.  In the second project a new method is proposed for constructing motivic enumerative invariants by shifted quantization of the moduli of objects in differential graded categories of Calabi-Yau type. The third project analyzes the way in which non-commutative Hodge theory controls the deformations of Landau-Ginzburg models and proposes a very general unobstructedness theorem.  The fourth project gives a strategy for reformulating and proving the classical limit Langlands duality as a purely topological duality for perverse sheaves. The last project will establish the functoriality of the ramified and the twisted non-abelian Hodge correspondences.<br/><br/>The resolution of these questions will consolidate and demystify several existing quantization schemes in geometry, symplectic topology, and field theory. The project sets the stage for understanding the basic structure of algebraic varieties in a way suitable for pragmatic use in a broad spectrum of applications. Aside from the natural applications to algebraic topology, the work proposed will be immediately relevant to deep questions in category theory, geometric representation theory, the theory of integrable systems, string theory, gauge theory, quantum gravity and cosmology. The project outlines concrete cross-discipline applications to the physics of mirror symmetry, renormalization group flow, and the quantization of gauge theories. This project also aims to organize a concentrated effort on enhancing and building a new geometric arsenal of techniques applicable to the theory of algebraic cycles, symplectic topology, and high energy physics. This will be achieved by training a group of young researchers, and graduate students in mathematics and physics, and by a curriculum development of a course on derived symplectic geometry, and a course on non-commutative Hodge theory. Specific research opportunities on the interface of geometry and string theory for graduate students and postdocs are discussed.

In particular, we propose to study the category T of tensor representation of sl-infinity.  In this proposal this category plays two different roles. In application to infinite-dimensional Lie algebras it is the target category for categorification of boson-fermion correspondence, the Fock space equipped with action of free bosons and fermions is identified with the complexified Grothendieck group of the category T.  In application to Lie superalgebras we use the approach originally suggested by Brundan.  Namely, we identify the complexified Grothendieck group of the category of representation of a classical supergroup G and certain ""tensor"" representation M of sl-infinity, and categorify the action of the Chevalley generators of sl-infinity in M by the translation functors.  Recent papers of Brundan and Stroppel, Cheng, Lam and Wang, Gruson and the author demonstrate the power of this approach by making essential progress in long standing open problems (such as character formulae, Kazhdan-Lusztig theory for the general linear superalgebras and explicit description of extension groups).  We suggest to combine this approach with our results on the structure of individual sl-infinity modules in T to obtain new information about modules over Lie superalgebras: description of tensor products, calculation of superdimension, Kazhdan-Lusztig theory for the orthosymplectic superalgebras.  Another goal is to generalize T to the case of fields of positive characteristic, and explore connection with Deligne's tensor categories.  We also combine the above approach with geometric methods in representation theory of Lie superalgebras. In particular, we introduce several conjectures relating thick ideals of the tensor category G-mod for a classical supergroup G, equivariant sheaves on the self-commuting cone of G and the socle filtration of the corresponding sl-infinity modules.  The last part of proposal addresses the problem of generalizing Borel-Weil-Bott theorem for supergroups. Although partial results in this area were obtained almost 30 years ago, a complete answer is still unknown.<br/><br/>Supersymmetry is an important tool in modern theoretical physics.  The methods of supersymmetry factor the questions interesting for physicists through the theory of representations of supergroups and superalgebras. There are still a lot of gaps in mathematical foundations in this subject: the methods familiar from representation theory of reductive groups get stuck early since the algebraic structure of representations is significantly more complicated. As new phenomena were discovered, it turned out that they have analogues in other non-semisimple branches of representation theory:  modular representations and representations of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras.  The latter representations have a wide range of applications: from integrable systems to string theory. We suggest a new approach to a key tool of this theory, vertex operators, by categorification of boson-fermion correspondence.  We also plan to study further the duality between representation of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and classical supergroups."

The main research concerns the behavior of zeros near the central point. While these zeros have been known to be related to arithmetic problems since Riemann, in the last few decades connections have been observed with high energy nuclear physics and random matrix theory (RMT) as well. Thus investigations in one of these topics can be fruitfully used in the others. The additive number theory problems have a similar flavor; many of them concern density of states as well as gaps between events. Similar techniques are used in the analysis here as in some of the number theory and random matrix theory investigations. Specifically, the PI proposes to study: (1) the n-level densities of low-lying zeros of GL(2) L-functions (including level 1 Maass forms and increasing the support for holomorphic cuspidal newforms by deriving alternatives to the Katz-Sarnak determinantal expansions that are more amenable for comparing number theory and random matrix theory), (2) the n-level densities of Dirichlet and number field L-functions (which involves exploring and extending our understanding of the finer properties of the distribution of certain classes of primes), (3) finding random matrix theory analogues to Rankin-Selberg convolutions (to extend the predictive ability of RMT), (4) additional consequences of the L-function Ratios Conjecture and other arithmetic conjectures, (5) the density of states and behavior of the eigenvalues of structured random matrix ensembles (with special emphasis on the resulting combinatorics, which is frequently related to other problems of interest), (6) generalized Zeckendorf decompositions and the gaps between summands, (7) generalized sum and difference sets (especially phase transitions from different models of randomness, behavior in subsets of highly structured sets, and results in non-abelian cases), and finally (8) Benford's law of digit bias.<br/><br/>The central questions in this proposal involve studying how events are distributed in diverse systems, such as energy levels of heavy nuclei, prime numbers and zeros of L-functions, leading digits in sets of data, and summands in generalized Zeckendorf decompositions. Similar to the Central Limit Theorem, there seem to be a few universal spacing laws that govern these and other phenomena; thus studies in one of these topics can frequently provide useful insights in the others. Understanding these systems requires the development of tools and techniques in complex analysis, Fourier analysis, number theory and probability. Some of the projects have real world applications; for example, the IRS uses Benford?s law to locate corporate tax fraud. Many of these projects have components that are amenable to numerical experimentation; these and tractable special cases will be investigated with undergraduate research assistants.

The study of Hodge structures and their symmetry groups, MumfordTate groups, lies at the intersection of complex geometry, representation theory and arithmetic. The proposed work addresses the relationship between Hodge theory and representation theory, with a focus on those aspects that may be described using complex geometry. (The Hodge theory of algebraic varieties will not be addressed: the emphasis is on Hodge structures as objects of independent interest.)  In the classical case that the Hodge domain D is a Hermitian symmetric space that may be equivariantly embedded in Siegel's upper-half space, the relation between Hodge theory and the geometric and arithmetic properties of a variety is a deep and extensively researched subject. The area is considerably less developed in the non-classical case, and it is generally felt that the principle obstacle to generalizing the theory (arithmetic properties, automorphic forms, theory of Shimura varieties, et cetera) is our limited understanding of the system of differential equations governing variations of Hodge structure.  The principle motivation and objective of this project is to better understand this system, the complex geometry of the Hodge domain D, and the associated representation theory in the non-classical setting.<br/><br/>Hodge theory lies at the crossroads of several mathematical subjects, including Algebraic Geometry, Complex Geometry, Number Theory and Representation Theory.  This rich confluence makes the subject a fertile and influential area of research.  The underlying motivation to study variations of Hodge structure (a dominant theme in this proposal) is to understand moduli of algebraic varieties.  Algebraic varieties arise as the solution spaces to polynomial equations.  The ability to understand and manipulate solutions of systems of polynomial equations is essential in many areas of engineering, science and mathematics."

NEDDERMAN DR","ARLINGTON","TX","760199800","8172722105","MPS","1264","","$0.00","This award supports the research of Michaela Vancliff to work in non-commutative algebra, with special emphasis on problems arising from the theory of AS-regular algebras and algebraic geometry. She is interested in the graded-module category viewed as a geometric space, with certain graded modules playing the role of geometric objects. The linear geometric modules (point modules, line modules, etc.) are parametrized by so-called linear schemes. Vancliff plans to study how the structure and role of higher-dimensional linear schemes generalize the structure and role of point schemes. Under prior NSF support, in work with T. Cassidy, Vancliff produced algebro-geometric techniques that allow the easy construction of certain AS-regular algebras (that generalize graded Clifford algebras) of any finite global dimension, naming such algebras graded skew Clifford algebras. Vancliff intends to study such AS-regular algebras of global dimension four that have finitely many points and a one-parameter family of line modules as a step towards classifying the line schemes that arise for ""generic"" quadratic AS-regular algebras of global dimension four. Her initial research with B. Shelton (under prior NSF support) suggests that such an algebra should have a line scheme that consists of exactly six elliptic curves, so if this is found to hold in general, then it would mimic the point scheme of generic quadratic AS-regular algebras of global dimension three (where it is one elliptic curve).<br/><br/>Mathematics in general is the study of patterns and frequently such patterns are described via systems of equations. For instance, systems of polynomial-style equations and their solutions play a critical role in almost every scientific field, such as statistical mechanics, elementary-particle physics, quantum mechanics, robotics, crystallography, networking, etc. Often, the solutions cannot be found by experimentation, and often they are not numbers but are functions (e.g., differential operators or matrices), and so, in general, they do not commute. The science of seeking methods that find all solutions to any system of polynomial-style equations in non-commuting variables is called non-commutative algebra. To find the solutions, the main idea is as follows. One associates to such a system of equations an entity, called an ""algebra,"" that encodes all the properties of the original equations. Associated to this algebra are ""modules,"" and these encode all the properties of the solutions to the equations.  So, in order to find all the solutions, one should find all the modules for the associated algebra.  In many of the applications, the algebras that arise in this way tend to share certain properties satisfied by commuting polynomials; such algebras are called AS-regular algebras and are the main focus of Vancliff's projects. One of the goals of the study of such algebras and their modules is to use geometric techniques to find certain modules (point modules, line modules, etc) of the AS-regular algebra, and then to use those modules to find the modules that give the solutions to the original system of equations. Vancliff's underlying goal is to improve on these geometric techniques and to understand better how they relate to the structure of the category of modules."

Firstly, he will work on proving that each member of a very general axiomatically defined class of quantum nilpotent algebras admits a canonical quantum cluster algebra structure. Based on this, he will attempt to construct a unified categorification for all algebras in the class. Many important families arise as special cases of algebras in this large class, most notably the quantum double Bruhat cell algebras and the quantum Schubert cell algebras. The former case will lead to a proof of the Berenstein-Zelevinsky quantum cluster algebra conjecture. In both cases the quantum cluster algebra structure will be used to study the topology of the spectra of quantum groups and quantum Schubert cell algebras. In the former case he will attempt to prove bicontinuity of his recently constructed Dixmier map from the symplectic foliation on a simple Lie group equipped with the so called standard Poisson structure to the primitive spectrum of a quantum group. The PI and his graduate students will apply these ideas for proving the existence of quantum foldings and for building quantum cluster algebras from them. He will also apply his recent results on rigidity of quantum tori to the classification of automorphism groups of interesting (quantum) cluster algebras. Via the work of Gekhtman, Shapiro and Vainshtein a certain large class of classical cluster algebras can be approached using Poisson geometry. The PI will work on Poisson analogs of the above projects using a notion of Poisson unique factorization domains.<br/><br/>Noncommutative and Poisson algebras arise in many different aspects of mathematics (functions on geometric objects) and physics (observables in classical and quantum mechanical systems). These objects are studied using many different techniques on the basis of algebraic, geometric, analytic and combinatorial methods. The PI will study these objects via two different methods. The first one is a classical one, based on studying the presentations of these algebras as collections of operators (representations). This method uses techniques from algebra and geometry. The second method is based on the recent combinatorial notion of cluster algebras invented by Fomin and Zelevinsky. It leads to a very concrete combinatorial structure on the objects. The idea of mutation is then used to study various parts of the objects which are not seen by the previous methods (they focused on a particular ""initial side"" of these algebras). Using his recent rigidity results, the PI will also study and classify the symmetries of the objects in the above classes. The motivation for this is that symmetries reduce the complexity of an abject and the full description of the collection of symmetries provides an understanding of the complexity of the object."

Cohomology theories provide some of the most powerful techniques for the study of such varieties.

For example, he is engaged in a research program with Karl Rubin to investigate the Markovian statistics of Selmer groups of quadratic twist families of elliptic curves. Selmer groups provide a delicate---and computable---gauge for the arithmetic of elliptic curves and abelian varieties. A close understanding of Selmer groups can be applied to questions as far-ranging as issues of solvability and unsolvability (Hilbert?s Tenth Problem) or refined analytic formulas (where Rubin and the PI have solved a good part of a conjecture of Darmon). Mazur also proposes to continue the study of p-adic interpolation of modular eigenforms and of their L-functions.<br/><br/>In broad terms, Mazur wants to understand polynomial equations and the algorithms that might lead us to the solutions of such equations. It is vastly instructive to study such solutions, both specifically and statistically, bringing the relevant analytic and arithmetic tools to bear on the problem. Such investigations have had, in the past, surprisingly broader application---both practical and theoretical---as the PI hopes will be the case in this instance."

Margulis gave the first explicit construction of expanders, following Pinsker's observation that random sparse graphs are expanders. This construction was improved in the eighties by  Margulis, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak who constructed Ramanujan graphs (optimal expanders) using deep number-theoretic results. In the ensuing years the scope and depth of applications of expanders has increased -- over the past decade several completely new and unexpected lines of development have emerged and the field has undergone explosive growth.

The PI also plans to further the current understanding of the geometry of determinant line bundles over moduli spaces of sheaves on a surface. For abelian or K3 surfaces, when the surface is allowed to vary, interesting questions arise about the cohomology of the moduli space of polarized abelian or K3 surfaces. In a different direction, the PI will interpret geometrically a q-defomation of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. <br/><br/>In the mathematical study of important geometric objects, there is considerable interest in describing geometrically the set itself of all objects of a certain type.

It is concerned with understanding systems with symmetry by representing them in matrix form. One of the tools which has proved to be highly effective for the study of representations is the theory of character sheaves which the PI initiated in the early 1980's. This theory provides a geometrization of the theory of irreducible characters of finite simple groups of Lie type. It is proposed to continue the project of studying character sheaves on reductive algebraic groups, including disconnected ones. In particular it is proposed to continue the study of affine Hecke algebras with unequal parameters and in particular to establish a geometric interpretation for their canonical basis. This should give new information on the representation theory of groups over p-adic fields. It is also proposed to continue the study of characters of semisimple p-adic groups continuing the author's earlier work with J.L. Kim. Progress in these topics is expected to have applications to various parts of mathematics and theoretical physics. <br/><br/>The theory of group representations attempts to study the idea of symmetry by means of matrices which are more amenable to computation. One of the oldest application of representation theory is the theory of Fourier series, widely used in engineering and applied science. More recently, ideas from representation theory have been used in chemistry (study of crystals) and physics (theory of elementary particles). G. Lusztig's research is concerned with applications of methods of algebraic topology (study of shapes by means of algebra) and algebraic geometry (geometric study of equations) to obtain new results on group representations which could not be obtained by other methods."

The Undergraduate Summer School will consist of three mini course on p-adic numbers and p-adic integration, tropical geometry, and statistical learning theory and singularities. The advanced Summer School will consist of five mini-courses on D-modules and vanishing cycles, Donaldson-Thomas invariants and the motivic Milnor fiber, the Monodromy Conjecture, motivic integration, and the Nash Conjecture.

Kontsevich in 1995, motivic integration has been a rapidly developing subject connected to Algebraic Geometry, Singularity Theory, Number Theory, and Model Theory.

While there has been a lot of work and notable progress in this direction, some fundamental problems are still open. Such a problem is the Monodromy Conjecture, which predicts a connection between p-adic and motivic integrals and more classical invariants of singularities. Further recent interest in the topic comes from connections with Donaldson-Thomas theory. In light of recent multiple developments, this is a good time to have a program  on connections between motivic integration and singularity theory. While motivic integration has achieved a certain maturity, several new interesting research directions are being uncovered. By bringing together experts from different but related  fields, the program can achieve a fruitful exchange of ideas that will result in progress on important problems (such as the Monodromy Conjecture) and in formulating new questions."

A common thread is drawn by the connection of each to the weak and strong (Bruhat) orders on the type-A affine Weyl group.  The underlying idea is that there are general methods for attacking the wide variety of problems that arise in this affine setting.  Inspiration comes from the role that tableaux, Bruhat posets, and crystal bases play in theories such as symmetric functions, Schubert calculus and quantum algebras.  The aim is to establish a combinatorial backbone that supports new theories in the same way.  An emphasis is on applications to Gromov-Witten invariants, conformal field theories, Schubert calculus, and Macdonald polynomials.  A guiding light will be the connection of each of these applications to the k-Schur functions.  <br/><br/>Combinatorics is an active and central branch of pure and applied mathematics.  Because the field is concerned with the development of tools for analyzing, organizing, and arranging discrete data, combinatorial methods are rudimentary in many scientific areas such as genomics, computer science, statistics, and physics.  The methods can often be traced back to research inspired by problems in algebra and geometry.  For example, the RSA public-key encryption algorithm is based on an elementary combinatorial result in modular arithmetic.  This project is devoted to developing combinatorial techniques for attacking problems that connect to algebraic and geometric areas such as symmetric function theory, an area with applications to probability and statistical mechanics.  A mutually beneficial component is the further development of the SAGE open-source mathematics software, as the use of a computer algebra system is crucial for this investigation."

While there has been a lot of recent progress in our understanding of the geometry of higher-dimensional varieties, almost all of this body of work is restricted to characteristic zero, due to the use of vanishing theorems that can fail in positive characteristic.  The first goal of this collaborative research is to build tools and a framework that would allow the main results in birational geometry to be extended to positive characteristics.  This would make systematic use of the recent techniques that have been devised to exploit the Frobenius morphism.  A second goal of the project is to further develop the study of invariants of singularities and of linear series, with an eye toward the remaining problems in the minimal model program.  There have been many recent advances in this area. In particular, a conjecture of Shokurov asserting that certain invariants of singularities (the log canonical thresholds) satisfy the so-called  ACC property has been solved by some of the PIs.  This suggests that other related but harder questions might be within reach, questions whose importance comes from the connection with one of the remaining conjectures in the minimal model program, the termination of flips. The PIs propose to attack one of these problems, predicting the ACC property of another invariant, the minimal log discrepancy.  In a separate direction, the PIs plan to undertake a systematic study of examples of linear systems on algebraic varieties that exhibit a pathological behavior from the point of view of various positivity invariants.<br/><br/>The last ten years have seen major breakthroughs in the study of higher-dimensional algebraic varieties, but several important problems are still open.  A central such problem is intimately related to the study of singularities and one of the goals of this project is to make progress on understanding the properties of the invariants of singularities that appear in this setting.  Another general goal of the PIs is to develop systematically the study of algebraic varieties of dimension at least 3 in positive characteristic.  A lot less is known in this setting, where new phenomena (sometimes considered pathological) arise.  The PIs expect that cross-pollination of ideas with other areas, in particular with commutative algebra, will play an important role in making progress in this direction.  Moreover, it is likely that techniques and results in this context would have many applications to other fields (for example, in arithmetic geometry).  As part of the collaborative effort, the PIs plan several events that will bring together members of the mathematical community working on related problems and also help disseminate the results and the techniques developed as part of this project."

In collaboration with Kari Vilonen, Schmid will complete the proof of their recent conjecture about irreducible unitary representations of reductive Lie Groups. Classifying the irreducible unitary representations of such a group G is known to be equivalent to an algebraic problem: among the irreducible Harish-Chandra modules with an invariant, but possibly indefinite inner product, determine those for which the inner product is positive definite. Vogan and his collaborators on the AIM Atlas project have pointed out that this inner product is directly and explicitly related to a certain indefinite inner product, one that is infinitesimally invariant under a compact real form U of the complexification of G. According to the above-mentioned conjecture, the U-invariant inner product is computable in terms of Morihiko Saito's Hodge filtration on the Beilinson-Bernstein D-module realization of the Harish-Chandra module in question. The conjecture would not explicitly classify the irreducible unitary representations, but would bring the functorial apparatus of Hodge theory to bear on the unitarity problem. Schmid and Vilnoen will prove the conjecture, and also investigate its various implications. The other component of the project is joint with Steve Miller. Schmid and Miller and have developed a new method for proving the functional equations and holomorphy for Langlands L-functions. Compared to the existing methods, it has the advantage of making the Gamma factors directly computable, at least in all the cases we have examined so far. This enables them to exclude all unexpected poles of L-functions that the other methods cannot rule out. In principle, it should apply to all L-functions accessible by the method of integral representations. Miller and Schmid plan to refine their method and extend its range of applicability.<br/><br/><br/>This mathematics research project by Wilfried Schmid is in the general area of representation theory, specifically on the representation of so-called non-compact groups of symmetries.  Symmetry is a familiar phenomenon that occurs in everyday life. The concept of symmetry was formalized by 19th century mathematicians, who introduced the notion of ""group of symmetries""; in this context the group of rotations of three dimensional space is a basic but important example because the laws of classical mechanics do not change under space rotations, and this fact helps to organize, simplify and thus better understand the solution of many practical problems in other disciplines such as relativity theory. While representations of compact groups have been well understood for three quarters of a century, the same is not true for the representations of non-compact groups, which are among the topics studied by this project. In addition to this work, Schmid is involved in several activities pertaining K-12 education, such as serving in advisory panels, and giving public lectures."

This began more than two thousand years ago, with the study of the geometry of conic sections, such as circles. However we still cannot completely answer many simple and fundamental questions, such as find the number of solutions.  We know this number in many special cases, and these cases have interesting applications in engineering and biology.  Foliation theory studies the solutions, or flow lines, to collections of differential equations.  As differential equations model physical phenomena, foliation theory is useful in physics and engineering.  When the collection of differential equations have polynomial coefficients, there is a rich interplay between algebraic geometry and foliation theory."

Modular forms fit into Hida/Coleman families; Galois representations are parametrized by universal deformation spaces; L-values are interpolated by p-adic L-functions.  In this proposal, Pollack seeks to study three different instances of p-adic variation. First, he aims to give a conjectural formula for the cyclotomic mu-invariant of a cuspidal eigenform.  His method is to transfer information from a p-adic family of Eisenstein series to the Hida family of the cuspform in order to calculate the relevant mu-invariant.  Second, he aims to study the variation in p-adic families of Kato?s Euler system attached to a modular form.  A novel aspect to his approach is to vary the Euler system over a Galois deformation space.  As ordinary and non-ordinary forms are intertwined in this space, he hopes to transfer known Iwasawa theoretic information from the ordinary case to the non-ordinary case.  Third, he proposes a number of computational projects relating to p-adic variation including the computation of Hida families and of weight one forms.<br/><br/>Number theory, one of the oldest fields of mathematics, has often borrowed methods from other mathematical fields to attack questions relating to the basic properties and patterns of numbers.  For instance, calculus is the study of functions of a continuous variable, but nonetheless has had a profound impact on number theory despite its very discrete nature.  This proposal explores the idea of trying to better understand certain number theory objects, namely modular forms, by putting them into a family and studying the family as a whole.  Imagine the difference between studying the actions of an ant versus the role of an ant in its colony.  The notion of a family in number theory is done through p-adic analysis.  P-adic analysis is a generalization of modular arithmetic which itself gained great public fame in its role in public key cryptography, the backbone of internet commerce.  Thus, by studying families of modular forms, the goal of the work proposed in this project is to deepen our understanding of any individual modular form on both a theoretical and computational level.  Modular forms are intimately related to elliptic curves which are also very useful in cryptography and are commonly used to encrypt cellular transmissions.  Thus any deepening of our understanding of modular forms could have potential cryptographic applications."

The SouthEast Regional Meeting On Numbers is a larger regional meeting that has been in effect since 1988. These meetings inspire collaboration and broaden the scope of existing research interests within the general subject of number theory. Meeting participants include mathematicians of all levels: undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, junior and senior faculty. The meetings have, in particular, provided an invaluable opportunity to students and young researchers in this region working in number theory, strengthening their knowledge of this research area and allowing them to disseminate their work while at the same time obtaining constructive criticism from other participants. These participants come from Ph.D. granting institutions, institutions whose highest degree awarded is a master's degree, and from institutions granting only baccalaureate degrees.

In another direction, the integral Hodge conjecture often fails for quotients of varieties by finite groups.

The central objects of interest in Algebraic Geometry are algebraic varieties, namely the loci of solutions of polynomial equations in many variables. Roughly, the idea is to study algebraic varieties ""indirectly,"" by using certain ""homological"" invariants associated to geometric objects on them -- for example, differential forms. The technique of the derived category was developed in Verdier's thesis, under the guidance of Grothendieck, in 1967. The original motivation was the need to find a proper foundation for Grothendieck's duality theory, which provides non-trivial relations among the above mentioned invariants. More recently, the theory of derived categories has found important and deep applications beyond the original motivation and even outside Algebraic Geometry; in particular, to Representation Theory, Symplectic Geometry, and High Energy Physics.The present proposal builds indeed on the interaction with these disciplines -- notably on the work of Kontsevich, Bondal, Orlov, Bridgeland, Kuznetsov among others -- to deduce new results in Algebraic Geometry and other areas."

Three projects aim to use topological methods to understand the Brauer group, Azumaya algebras, and more generally torsors on schemes. (1) The PI will study the extent to which the foundational results of Jackowski, McClure, and Oliver on maps between classifying spaces of complex algebraic groups can be extended to finite approximations to these classifying spaces. Progress on this problem will enable the solution of a host of problems about when torsors for complex algebraic groups extend from the generic point of a scheme to the entire scheme. In low dimensions, early progress on this problem has been used by the PI and Ben Williams to settle an old question of Auslander and Goldman on the existence of Azumaya maximal orders in unramified division algebras, where it transpires that there are purely topological obstructions to the existence of these Azumaya maximal orders. (2) The PI will work toward computing the Chow groups and singular cohomology of the classifying spaces of special linear groups by various central subgroups. This has been done in special cases by Vezzosi and Vistoli. However, greater generality is needed for most applications. These Chow groups are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry, controlling the characteristic classes associated to certain torsors of fundamental importance in the study of the Brauer group. The computations will be directly useful to the first project, and to the following project. (3) The PI and Ben Williams previously formulated the topological period-index problem and established first results. They will continue this study, especially as it relates to the algebraic period-index conjecture. In particular, their results in low dimensions suggest a method for disproving the period-index conjecture, which would be a fundamental advance. Following this idea to its conclusion is the major aspiration of the first set of projects. A fourth project aims to continue to build a bridge between higher category theory and classical algebraic geometry, bringing the formidable techniques of the former to bear on various questions in the arithmetic of derived categories. For example, the PI is developing a toolbox using higher category theory that will allow a purely derived-category proof of Panin's computations of the K-theory of projective homogeneous spaces, once the existence of certain exceptional objects on the split forms of these spaces is known.<br/><br/>The PI proposes work in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, two areas of modern mathematics. Algebraic geometry is an ancient subject with many connections to real-world problems. Its goal is to understand the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, equations of central importance in various disciplines, such as theoretical physics, cryptography, and the modeling of dynamical systems like weather. Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to the analysis of large data sets that occur in computer vision and cancer research, frequently finding patterns that more traditional methods of data analysis fail to find. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several questions in algebraic geometry which have been identified by the community as among the most important."

For example, Mel Hochster's direct summand conjecture, which posits the existence of some fundamental properties of regular rings, has been an important open problem in commutative algebra for over four decades; the solution to the equal characteristic case (due to Hochster from the 70s) is responsible for large swathes of modern commutative algebra, while the p-adic case remains tantalizingly open. The PI recently discovered that some ideas from p-adic Hodge theory (due to Faltings) can be used solve certain unknown cases of this conjecture. The PI intends to pursue this direction further by using powerful recent techniques --- chiefly Scholze's beautiful theory of perfectoid spaces --- from the fast evolving subject of p-adic Hodge theory to approach the direct summand conjecture and other purely algebraic problems. Conversely, previous work of the PI on the direct summand conjecture, coupled with some derived algebraic geometry, has recently proven instrumental in arriving at a significant simplification of certain geometric aspects of p-adic Hodge theory; the PI plans to develop the derived aspects more thoroughly to conceptualize the picture better.<br/><br/><br/>The study of solutions of polynomials with integer coefficients dates back to antiquity. An extremely useful technique here is to study ""approximate"" solutions first, i.e., solutions modulo primes, and then modulo powers of primes. The idea is that as the power of prime increases, the approximation becomes better. Grothendieck's revolutionization of mathematics in the last half century not only allows one to not only attach a precise meaning to the previous statement, but also provides a beautiful geometric context --- the world of p-adic geometry ---- to study such approximate solutions. This context has been at the heart of numerous recent advances in mathematics (such as Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem and other recent milestones in the Langlands program). The PI plans to contribute further to underlying geometric theory as well as develop applications to purely algebraic problems."

The specific goal of the present project is to expand etale topology from algebraic geometry into tensor triangular geometry. The starting point is the observation that restriction of modular representations from a finite group to a subgroup is nothing but an extension-of-scalars, with respect to a suitable ring object. Moreover, that ring object is commutative and separable and compact (finite dimensional), so it deserves to be called a ""tensor-triangular etale"" ring object. In short, such enhanced etale extensions not only generalize the classical etale extensions of algebraic geometry but also cover restriction to subgroups in representation theory. In algebraic geometry, the power of extension-of-scalars resides in the ability to apply descent theory. Extending descent to tensor triangular geometry and specializing to representation theory yields a machinery which allows one to decide when modular representations of a p-group extend to an arbitrary finite group containing our p-group as a Sylow subgroup. In modular representation theory of finite groups, abstract tensor triangular etale topology materializes into the so-called ""sipp topology"" on the category of finite G-sets and leads to stacks of derived and stable categories. These ideas then lead to (sipp) cohomology theory, which is one of the main avenues of the present project. Sipp cohomology theory can be related to classical group cohomology, to classical algebro-geometric etale cohomology and therefore to Galois cohomology. The first concrete range of application is the description of endotrivial representations over arbitrary finite groups, extending from the Carlson-Thevenaz classification over p-groups. Beyond this first major achievement, the sipp topology is actually perfectly suited for treating gluing problems from p-local to global. This is particularly interesting for derived and stable categories, in view of a series of long-standing conjectures, like Broue's Abelian Defect Group Conjecture for instance.<br/><br/>One of the driving forces of research in Fundamental Sciences, including Mathematics, is the constant attempt to unify specialized theories into more fundamental principles. The first goal is the discovery of deeper scientific beauties but the second, more collective, goal is the transposition of techniques and methods from one specialized area to other neighboring ones, thus creating new applications and further interaction and innovation. Tensor Triangular Geometry covers a large class of specialized areas of Mathematics, ranging from Algebra to Analysis: It appears in Algebraic Geometry, in Modular Representation Theory, in Stable Homotopy Theory, in Motivic Theory, in Noncommutative Topology, and more. Tensor Triangular Geometry provides a growing number of new theorems and great conceptual unification between those fields. Moreover, it displays a steadily expanding collection of applications. For instance, via Tensor Triangular Geometry, the deep beauty of Grothendieck's famous etale topology, with its origins in Galois theory and its full manifestations in modern Algebraic Geometry, now surfaces again in Modular Representation Theory. There, it provides answers to long-standing problems about the relations between representations of finite groups of order a power of a prime number and representations of arbitrary general finite groups."

One important aspect of the project is to improve bounds for the sizes of low degree cohomology groups.  This should lead to profinite presentations of the finite simple groups with two generators and a very small number of relations.  There will also be a study of discrete presentations of the finite simple groups building on earlier work of the proposer and others showing that with the possible exception of one family, every finite simple group has a presentation with at most 50 relations.  The project will also consider the notion of adequate representations of finite groups. This is a weakening of a condition used by Taylor and Wiles to prove certain representations are automorphic (and used in the proof of Fermat's last theorem).  The idea is to show that many representations do satisfy this condition (and also constructing others that do not).  This notion has already been used to great effect by Clozel, Thorne, Gee, Dieulefait and others.  Another part of the project will be to attempt to generalize the Tits alternative.  The conjecture is that any finitely generated Zariski dense subgroup of a semisimple algebraic group contains a strongly dense free subgroup.  Here strongly dense means every nonabelian subgroup is Zariski dense in the algebraic group.  Finally, certain problems related to mappings of smooth algebraic curves will be studied using the group theory results.<br/><br/>One of the major motivations for this project has been the major advances in computational group theory.  These advances are not just based on improvements in computing power but very innovative programs which use the theory in a crucial way.  The presentations mentioned above are already being implemented into MAGMA (a very powerful computational algebra software package) and is used to recognize groups.  The results on adequate representations have already been used in some significant advances in showing representations are automorphic and should help in the fundamental Langlands program. The results on strongly dense subgroups have already been used in proving new results on expander graphs.  These are graphs that are relatively sparse but are also very highly connected.  These have sparked a revolution in computer science in the last decade.  The new results will have even more applications to this field.  Deep results in group theory have led to major advances in basic problems about bijective polynomials over finite fields (viewed as mappings on a smooth projective curve) and has had applications to cryptography and solved problems over a century old."

A second objective is to prove that 2-Fano manifolds are rationally simply connected. This is an analogue of the celebrated Kollr-Miyaoka-Mori result that Fano manifolds are rationally connected. Using results of de Jong and Starr, a consequence will be a generalization of Tsen's theorem, namely, that a 2-Fano manifold defined over the function field of a surface has a rational point. This would give a natural geometric condition for the existence of rational points.<br/><br/>The broader context of the project is the area of algebraic geometry, currently one of the most active branches of mathematics, with widespread applications throughout mathematics and reaching into physics and engineering. Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, which are geometric objects given by the solutions of systems of polynomial equations. The variation of algebraic varieties is captured by the so-called moduli spaces, which are themselves algebraic varieties with a very rich structure. In the two main themes of this project, moduli spaces play a central role, both as spaces whose geometry we investigate, and as tools for answering questions about whether certain systems of polynomial equations have solutions or not. The expectation is that the projects will significantly impact other areas of mathematics, especially arithmetic geometry."

One such project will continue the systematic development of Boij-Soederberg theory.  This theory was recently developed by Eisenbud and Schreyer, and it provides results for understanding free resolutions in terms of specified atomic building blocks.  This is a powerful new theory, and there remain many open questions about both the foundations and the reach of the theory. Another project aims to develop a new framework for homological algebra in the context of smooth toric varieties.  The work of David Cox and others suggests the potential for a far-reaching algebraic/geometric dictionary that largely parallels the powerful dictionary between the algebra of the graded polynomial ring and the geometry of projective space.  Yet many of the results from homological commutative algebra have no satisfying analogue in the context of toric varieties.  A more robust homological theory would rely on connections between multigraded commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.  A third project involves the asymptotic structure of the free resolutions of high degree Veronese subrings. This aims to fill a gap in the literature: whereas the study of the free resolutions of high degree Veronese subrings for curves has been fruitful and widely applied, little is known about the free resolutions of higher dimensional varieties under a very positive embedding. <br/> <br/>Free resolutions are built from matrices of polynomials.  They arise naturally in many algebraic contexts, with connections to topics in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, computational algebra, and more.  Matrices of polynomials have a richer structure than the matrices of scalars that arise in linear algebra, and so basic questions about free resolutions remain unresolved.  The PI's research projects aim to provide overarching structural results about free resolutions, and to apply these new structural insights to open problems in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  These research projects all offer potential for explicit computations, providing research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as leading to new software packages to be developed for Macaulay2.  The PI will also continue his outreach projects on K-12 education, which often involve collaborative efforts between research mathematicians, educators, and public or nonprofit groups."

In the last fifty years, lots of progress has been made after Langlands introduced the deep philosophy between number theory and automorphic forms. Among these, the relation between special values of L-functions and periods, which the PI proposes to study, is one of the most important problems. Precisely, the first part of the proposal is about the global restriction problems of automorphic representations in the framework of the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture. With various collaborators, the PI will formulate an explicit conjecture for those periods, generalizing the work of Ichino-Ikeda, as well as study the case of unitary groups using the tool of relative trace formula, proposed by Jacquet-Rallis in a special case and the PI in general. The second part of the proposal is to understand the relation between central derivatives of L-functions and certain arithmetic periods, namely, height of cycles on Shimura varieties. The PI proposes to study such relation via arithmetic theta lifting after Kudla and the PI himself, in particular, in the next unknown case of U(2,2).<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this research is to better understand one of the central questions in mathematics: how to solve equations, particularly, algebraic equations in number fields. These equations hide themselves in various kinds of mathematical objects, such as algebraic cycles, representations, period relations, etc. The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is one of the most famous questions toward this direction. Outside pure mathematics, algebraic equations like elliptic curves, have important application in cryptography."

It will be a major gathering of the leading mathematicians and young scholars whose work fits in the realm of representation theory.  The conference has a broad scope and it aims to present some of the most important recent developments and techniques in this field, in particular the rich web of interconnections between representation theory, combinatorics, geometry, and physics, which has emerged in recent years and has greatly helped to advance each of these fields.  The topics to be covered in the conference include algebraic groups, geometric representation theory, vertex algebras, infinite dimensional Lie algebras, combinatorics of plane partitions, conformal field theory and enumerative algebraic geometry.  Many talks will involve applications of representation theory to mathematical physics, combinatorics and algebraic geometry.  The organizers expect the conference to be a major gathering of researchers in these fields and one of the most important mathematical events to take place in Moscow in the last few years.  We expect that it will attract many graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, especially from the USA.<br/><br/>In quantum physics, which describes the world of small objects (such as atoms, electrons, nuclei, etc) the state of a physical system is random and not definitively determined, unlike classical physics. In other words, states are no longer definite points of the classical space of states, but rather functions on the space of positions of the system, whose squared magnitude represents the chance the system will be found in that particular state.  Such functions can be added and multiplied by numbers; that is, they form what is called a linear space.  Symmetries of the system act by linear transformations of this space and therefore play an important role in studying quantum systems.  The part of mathematics which studies actions of symmetries in linear spaces is called representation theory since we represent symmetries by linear transformations.  Representation theory is thus extremely useful in quantum physics and other areas of physics, while physics, in turn, constantly provides deep insights into representation theory and other areas of mathematics.  For example, in recent years the development of the representation theory of infinite-dimensional symmetries, coming from quantum field theory, has been an active area of research.  During the conference leading mathematicians and mathematical physicists, many from the United States, will discuss the connections between representation theory and related fields in mathematics, as well as the connections to physics, especially in light of recent breakthroughs.  The conference will be very useful for young mathematicians and graduate students who will attend the conference.  The money from this award will support the travel and local expenses of US-based speakers and participants. Conference materials will be disseminated through the conference website http://bogomolov-lab.ru/rep2013/, which will allow the ideas presented at the conference to be accessed by a wide audience in the US and around the world.

The talks involve many aspects of representation theory and especially the geometric approaches and connections to physics.  In particular, the following subjects will be discussed:  quantum groups, Lie superalgebras, W-algebras, chiral algebras, invariant theory, Jordan algebras, toroidal algebras, Poisson algebras, integrable systems, geometric Langlands program, Gromov-Witten invariants, Donaldson-Thomas invariants, Springer resolutions, Koszul duality, motivic integration, conformal nets, quantum field theory, string theory, and more.

In modern mathematics, symmetries are investigated in the branch of Algebra called Representation Theory.

Together with J. Fasel, he will, for example, attempt to study splitting problems for projective modules of rank below the dimension by better understanding A^1-homotopy sheaves of punctured affine spaces.  Together with C. Haesemeyer, he will attempt to produce computable new obstructions to existence of a rational point on smooth algebraic varieties over a field, again using A^1-homotopy theory.  By their very nature, these problems draw together several branches of mathematics and thus illustrate the fundamental unity of the subject.  To make the techniques used in the above study and related areas accessible to a new generation of researchers, the PI will organize a series of summer schools devoted to introducing graduate students to A^1-homotopy theory and related subjects. <br/><br/>Algebraic geometry, one of the oldest branches of mathematics, is at its core concerned with the study of algebraic varieties, i.e., solutions to systems of polynomial equations in many variables. Algebraic topology studies the problem of attaching invariants, e.g., numbers or, more generally, abstract algebraic structures, to spaces in a manner independent of the way they are pulled and twisted (without being torn).  Solutions to systems of polynomial equations are not obviously amenable to the tools of algebraic topology, especially when such systems arise from arithmetic. Nevertheless, the relatively recently introduced subject of A^1-homotopy theory provides a framework in which one may apply the full power of techniques of algebraic topology to objects of interest in algebraic geometry---one can treat spaces having deep arithmetic structure, but a priori limited geometric structure, on equal footing with spaces that are more inherently geometric.  This project aims to study two general classes of problems by transplanting a very successful method from algebraic topology (the theory of obstructions) to the setting of algebraic geometry by means of A^1-homotopy theory.  With the goal of making some ideas involved in the above pursuits accessible to a broader audience, the PI will collaborate with artist Lun-Yi Tsai to organize public ``dialogues"" between artists and mathematicians to explore some common themes between the subjects.<br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Topology programs."

Mathematically, those invariants are typically described as virtual Euler characteristics of some moduli spaces. The wall-crossing phenomenon is related to the presence of real codimension one ""walls"" in the space of parameters, where the invariants jump. In the case of Donaldson-Thomas invariants, the walls live in the moduli space of Bridgeland stability conditions on the ppropriate Calabi-Yau categories. Similar walls also occur in the theory of representations of quivers and cluster algebras. In mirror symmetry, walls correspond to jumps in the number of pseudo-holomorphic discs bounded by the torus fibers of an SYZ Lagrangian fibration. In supersymmetric gauge theories in physics, the number of BPS states jumps across ""walls of marginal stability"". The Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formulas for Donaldson-Thomas invariants thus occur in the physics literature on topics such as moduli spaces of vector ultiplets of 4-dimensional supersymmetric theories and supersymmetric black holes. Since these various wall-crossing formulas look so similar, one can ask for a common formalism. The aim of the FRG is to study the underlying ""wall-crossing structures"" and demonstrate hat the above-mentioned similarities are not coincidental, but rather reflect a deep underlying theory.<br/><br/>It is a frequently encountered situation in mathematics and physics that numerical quantities which in principle depend on various parameters actually are constant for general parameter values (they are ""invariants""), but jump along certain ""walls"" in the parameter space. Wall-crossing formulas describe these ""jumps"" quantitatively. The subject of wall-crossing has recently become a very active one due to its relevance to a number of different areas of mathematics and physics. The aim of this project is to develop the concept of ""wall-crossing structure"" rigorously and apply it to problems both old and new in which wall-crossing formulas appear. The results arising from this project will be in demand by both the mathematics and physics communities. The FRG will also build a research community around this coordinated effort, involving a mix of junior and senior researchers, training opportunities for graduate students, and the rganization of several workshops."

The PI's research uncovers these hidden structures in an area of mathematics known as representation theory which is closely connected to some of the most sophisticated models in theoretical physics.  Following the philosophy that fundamental structures in mathematics should be simple and intuitive the PI utilizes a diagrammatic framework to encode a great deal of complexity into an intuitive diagrammatic language that greatly simplifies computations.  The PI will incorporate this diagrammatic philosophy into transformative educational programs aimed at high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students making the tools of modern research accessible to a new generation of researchers.
