Combinatorics is the area of mathematics concerned with enumerating, understanding and characterizing mathematical structures that occur within discrete objects.  The results of this project will contribute to the growing connections between combinatorics and other mathematical disciplines.  This includes extending sharing theorems of classical Coxeter groups, using combinatorial methods to generalize and understand identities involved with the representation theory of Shimura varieties, and continuing the PI's successful program involving noncommutative polynomials that have applications to understanding polytopes, Whitney stratified spaces and the totally nonnegative flag variety.  Results from this award have the potential to give insight into discrete structures in other sciences including the noncommutative nature of DNA sequencing in biology, mathematical methods in coding theory and topological surfaces related to robotic motion.  The PI has been vigorously involved in research, educational and outreach activities to foster the growth of the mathematical workforce.  As a response to the isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this includes co-organizing a new regional lecture series to reinvigorate collaboration between students, postdocs and faculty.  Support of the PI's research program reinforces the NSF's goals of scientific progress, building new talent, fostering innovation and improving society.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project includes four subprojects involving combinatorics broadly defined, plus ongoing graduate research projects.  Results from the award will contribute to the growing connections between combinatorics with geometry, topology, algebra and number theory, and to make fundamental contributions to classical areas of combinatorics.  Project I involves the PI's new work with Ehrenborg and Morel on extensions of sharing theorems to Coxeter arrangements, and using Herb's theory of 2-structures to give dissection proofs and generalizations to intrinsic volumes.  Extensions to other geometric settings will be studied, including regular complex polytopes and the Nandakumar--Rao conjecture.  Project II involves the PI's joint work with Ehrenborg and Goresky on topological face enumeration of Whitney stratified spaces, more generally, zeta functions of quasi-graded posets.  This widens the research program to understand and make progress on face vector inequalities for polytopes and singular spaces.  The PI and Ehrenborg develop a non-homogeneous extension of the classical cd-index to labeled digraphs satisfying a balanced condition to generalize the setting of Eulerian graded posets and include the family of Bruhat graphs as a special case.  Project III includes a conjecture for balanced digraphs which implies the Billera--Brenti nonnegativity conjecture for the cd-index of Bruhat graphs.  Project IV concerns extending the combinatorics of the generalized Harish-Chandra character formula.  The PI will continue her educational, regional and national activities to support the long-range goal to attract, retain and train more under-represented groups in the mathematical sciences and ultimately increase the number of STEM-educated individuals in the workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award will enable the PI to further explore fundamental questions about families of L-functions and prime numbers. Further, this will support the PI as he continues to mentor graduate and undergraduate students, organizes conferences and seminars, and participates in extra-curricular outreach. <br/> <br/>The PI will study the distribution of values and zeros of L-functions. We study statistics over quadratic characters with fundamental discriminants, where prominent problems have intimate connections to arithmetic problems. We extend results of Conrey, Iwaniec and Soundararajan on the critical line theorem for Dirichlet L-functions by building on our previous joint work on moments. We study the eighth moment of automorphic L-functions, which has already exhibited novel features. We investigate the statistics of a large orthogonal family for the first time, where we have a plan to ?reduce the conductor?; this also leads to simultaneous non-vanishing results.

The zeta function is the most fundamental example of an L-function, which is a mathematical construction that combines arithmetical information about all the primes at once.  More general L-functions, such as Dirichlet L-functions, are useful for understanding primes in arithmetic progressions.  One of the main ways that L-functions are studied is by placing them into families, such as the family of all Dirichlet L-functions, and viewing their properties through this framework.  Much of the proposed work in this proposal concerns the development of properties of new families of L-functions.  One of the main goals is to better-understand the size of these L-functions, especially in certain ranges that have been inaccessible using previous methods. The PI will continue to mentor and collaborate with undergraduate students, particularly through the Texas A&M REU. Such opportunities are important for preparing students for graduate studies, particularly for undergraduate students from non-PhD granting institutions as well as from population groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The PI will also continue to advise PhD students to work on problems related to families of L-functions and their moments.<br/><br/>The PI will study new families of automorphic forms and their associated L-functions, especially via moments of L-functions and large sieve inequalities.  The PI plans to study high moments of L-functions in order to make progress on the challenging but important L-functions in conductor-dropping families.  The proposer will also study narrower families of L-functions through the use of new versions of the relative trace formula that isolate small families based on their local behavior.  In a related vein, the proposer will study large sieve inequalities for families of automorphic forms, with two main goals.  One objective is to establish large sieve bounds in some of the new, narrow families.  A second goal is to develop heuristics for conjecturing the size of a large sieve bound for more general families.  The PI will mentor PhD students on problems on moments of L-functions for both narrow families and for higher degree L-functions.  The proposer will study newform Dedekind sums with his undergraduate students.   The methods employed will be techniques from analytic number theory such as functional equations, exponential sums and integrals, and the spectral theory of automorphic forms, including the Arthur-Selberg trace formula and the relative trace formula.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A noncommutative algebra is a mathematical concept that encodes such a phenomenon, and the subject of noncommutative algebra naturally has many applications in quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, string theory, and so on. The study of noncommutativity has become more and more common in modern science and technology. For example, a quantum group is equivalent to a Hopf algebra whose underlying algebraic structure is noncommutative and/or whose underlying coalgebraic structure is noncocommutative. The study of noncommutative algebras is both important and challenging. In many cases, noncommutative algebras arise as noncommutative analogues and generalizations of classical objects coming from other fields such as commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and Lie theory. To understand the structure of noncommutative algebras, the PI will investigate invariants that are defined by homological means. These invariants capture hidden structures and symmetries of noncommutative algebras. This research project combines ideas and methodology from several areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, linear algebra, homological algebra, and combinatorics. The proposed research activities will make contributions to teaching, undergraduate and graduate student training, and outreach.<br/> <br/>A major part of the project concerns homological invariants such as Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, Tor-regularity, and Artin-Schelter regularity for connected graded algebras. A weighted version of homological regularities with an extra parameter will also be introduced that incorporates different classical homological concepts. This is a new research direction in noncommutative algebra with connections to representation theory, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and noncommutative invariant theory. The PI will investigate and prove homological identities involving these invariants for connected graded algebras and their associated categories, and thus expand the foundations for this theory. One particular sub-project is the classification of non-Artin-Schelter regular algebras that are close to being Artin-Schelter regular. In addition this project concerns other active research topics in noncommutative algebra: the automorphism problem, the cancellation problem, operad theory, and noncommutative discriminants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Monodromy occurs when a mathematical object varies smoothly over a space, appearing identical at a point and each nearby point, but traveling around a loop in the space causes the object to twist around. Monodromy occurs throughout mathematics and specifically can be seen in the M¨obius strip: each small piece is an ordinary piece of paper, but traveling around the circle causes the paper to flip around to the opposite side. This conference will provide a historical perspective, recount current results, and look forwad to future developments in monodromy.<br/><br/>The main theme of the conference will be the key role of monodromy in all its incarnations: classical and l-adic, local and global, arithmetic and geometric, applications of it in number theory and algebraic geometry, and its connections to group theory and representation theory. In recent years there have been a number of exciting developments in this area. These include the complete classification of the finite (almost quasi) simple groups that occur as monodromy groups of hypergeometric sheaves by Katz, Rojas-Le´on and Tiep, the proof of many cases of the Putman-Wieland conjecture by Landesmann and Litt, the calculation of Tannakian monodromy groups in new settings by many mathematicians and their applications to generalizations of Shafarevich?s conjecture by Lawrence and Sawin, the proof of a relative analogue of Grothendieck?s period conjecture for a family of varieties by Bakker and Tsimerman, and the proof of the unbounded denominators conjecture by Calegari, Dimitrov, and Tang.

One way to understand their distribution among the integers is through the study of the Riemann zeta-function, a pursuit that is foundational to the area of analytic number theory. In particular, a thorough understanding of the location of the so-called nontrivial zeros of this function would give very precise asymptotic formulas for the number of primes up to a given (large) integer. This is a central problem in all of mathematics with connections to other deep problems, such as the class number problem, originally studied by Gauss. The proposed work seeks to further explore the analytic properties of the Riemann zeta-function and, more generally, of L-functions, with an overarching goal to obtain new information regarding the zeros of these functions. In addition to the research objectives, the proposed work includes ""Pathway Projects"" to provide novel, comprehensive guides to areas of active research in analytic number theory, and an undergraduate educational program aimed at increasing the participation of historically underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/> <br/>The research objectives of this project are in analytic number theory and fall into three themes. The first theme concerns the vertical distribution of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. In particular, limitations on the state-of-the-art methods used to detect fluctuations in gaps between non-trivial zeros will be determined. Moreover, a comprehensive guide to the problem of gaps between zeros of the Riemann zeta-function and its connection to several active areas of research in analytic number theory will be written. In the second theme, applications of the Chebotarev density theorem will be pursued. In particular, improved zero-density estimates for ""most"" L-functions within certain prescribed families will be proved. The third theme encompasses the mechanics and applications of the asymptotic large sieve. In particular, the asymptotic large sieve will be used to study the distribution of the zeros of various L-functions. A strengthening of the technique will be developed and subsequently applied to make new progress on calculating moments of certain L-functions. Finally, a comprehensive guide to the asymptotic large sieve, which is poised to be useful in various applications, will be written to make the technique more widely known and understood.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, number theorists since antiquity have been interested in finding whole number and rational number solutions to equations, such as y^2 = x^3 + 22 - that is, can a square be exactly 22 more than a cube? This project largely concerns the study of the probability that random equations of various types have whole number or rational number solutions. For example, a recent result of this kind proven during the period of the previous grant is that most equations of the form y^2 = a x^4 + b x^3 + c x^2 + d x + e, where a,b,c,d,e are whole numbers, do not possess any rational number solutions for x and y. The goal of the current project is to develop techniques for proving similar results for other types of classical equations of interest in number theory.

During the period of this award, this program is expected to lead to further results on the distribution of Galois groups of various types of algebraic objects, thus yielding new effective, quantitative forms of Hilbert irreducibility; new results on the distribution of Selmer groups of general (not necessary odd degree) hyperelliptic curves, and new results on the behavior of rational and integral points on curves and higher-dimensional varieties corresponding to representations having a ring of invariants that is not necessarily free.

Enumerative algebraic geometry concerns counting geometric objects satisfying a given list of constraints in a space defined by polynomial equations. In good situations, these counts do not change under generically varying the set of constraints and therefore define enumerative invariants. Among the most extensively studied enumerative invariants are Gromov-Witten invariants and Donaldson-Thomas invariants, which have important applications in mathematics and physics. While Gromov-Witten invariants correspond to counts of curves in a space, Donaldson-Thomas invariants are integers counting geometric objects called vector bundles or more generally sheaves. In mathematics, both the count of curves and sheaves in a space carry crucial information about geometric properties of the space, as such properties are used to characterize and classify different spaces. On the other hand in physics, Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants appear in the context of string theory, where they correspond to counts of particles in gauge theory as well as black hole microstates in quantum gravity. This award will also support graduate students working with the PI. <br/><br/>There are four main strands of research directions the project is branched into. In the first part, the project intends to investigate conjectural dualities, establishing new bridges between enumerative algebraic geometry and quantum physics. These dualities are expected to relate Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds to the quantization of the mirror curves. A second subject of study is related to canonical bases in representation theory. In particular, one of the goals of the project is to use enumerative algebraic geometry of surfaces to construct canonical bases for double affine Hecke algebras and their generalizations. In a third direction, the project intends to establish connections between refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants and invariants arising in real algebraic geometry. The focus of the final part of the project will be on holomorphic symplectic geometry. In this context, the goal is to provide a categorification of Floer theory for holomorphic symplectic manifold, motivated by structures in Donaldson-Thomas theory.

To better understand their geometry, one considers potential functions and force fields (differential forms) on these shapes, taking a cue from Einstein?s approach to physics on a curved spacetime. Force fields are linear objects, and thus can be studied using methods of linear algebra and group theory. Among the more sophisticated methods from this point of view are modular forms. This project will explore the constraints placed on smooth nonlinear shapes from modular forms, and then which features persist when the shapes acquire singularities. To describe singular shapes, we must introduce more general tools called quasi-modular and mock modular forms. The project has several avenues for participation by undergraduate and graduate student researchers, as well as fruitful connections with the neighboring fields of symplectic geometry and number theory. <br/><br/>The project addresses central questions in several areas of complex algebraic geometry, beginning with Hodge theory and extending through enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry, and Severi varieties. These areas are tied together by the appearance of modular forms and their generalizations: Siegel, quasi, and mock. A broad theme is the importance of K-trivial varieties, most notably elliptic curves. The investigator will vastly generalize a theorem of Borcherds about cycle-valued modular forms on locally symmetric spaces, and then explore an array of geometric implications.

First, they appear in number theory as building blocks in the theory of L-functions. L-functions shed light on many important number theoretic topics such as the distribution of prime numbers. In physics, automorphic forms model symmetry conditions of supersymmetric string theory and are used to find coefficients of the scattering amplitude for gravitons (hypothetical particles of gravity). Finding higher order coefficients of the graviton scattering amplitude may provide a quantum correction to the discrepancy between relativity and experimental data. This project seeks to answer a number of questions centered around the theory of L-functions and scattering amplitudes for certain string interactions using the study of automorphic forms. For broader impacts, the PI will lead undergraduate research projects, continue her involvement with the Sonya Kovalevsky Day and the Navajo Math Circle, and will write an open access text on math for elementary teachers with a focus on activities and curriculum that centers Native American traditions and ideas?.<br/><br/>The study of differential equations involving automorphic forms is a common thread connecting most of the questions addressed in this project. Specifically, the PI plans to answer a number of questions relating to the zeros and special values of GL(2) L-functions. Most of these questions relate the zeros of L-functions to the spectrum of certain operators.  The project also addresses a number of questions arising from the study of scattering amplitudes for gravitons. The PI will conduct a more detailed analysis of the Fourier modes of the SL(2) solutions and classify a family of solutions through a closed form expansion. In the course of the study of these Fourier solutions, the PI will address an open conjecture relating to a shifted convolution sum of divisor functions. Certain shifted convolution sums also have applications to subconvexity bounds for L-functions. The PI will also compute a spectral solution in SL(3) and uses these techniques to prove quantum unique ergodicity for non-degenerate Eisenstein series.

A central aspect of these fields is the study of polynomials in many variables - or multivariate polynomials.  Multivariate polynomials appear in a wide range of applications such as mechanical engineering, robotics, computer-aided design, and numerical partial differential equations.  The research will be clustered in three interconnected areas where multivariate polynomials play an essential role.  The first is configurations of linear subspaces, such as lines in the plane.  The second is interpolation, which involves fitting data with a polynomial model.  The third is piecewise polynomial functions, or splines, such as the Bezier splines common in drawing programs.  Each of these fields have major unsolved conjectures revolving around the impact of combinatorics and geometry on corresponding algebraic objects.  A recurring theme of the project is to use rigidity theory, which has its origins in structural engineering, to elucidate this impact.  Several lines of inquiry are a collaborative effort among the disparate communities of numerical analysis, rigidity theory, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry. The project includes training opportunities for graduate students.  This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project focuses on problems where the interactions between geometry, combinatorics, and algebra are not well-understood.  A first goal is to use rigidity theory to systematically produce line arrangements with fixed combinatorics whose module of derivations has changing structure based on the geometry, generalizing an example of Ziegler.  Understanding these examples sheds additional light on Terao's conjecture, which proposes that freeness of an arrangement is combinatorial. A second goal involves searching for a counterexample to a conjecture in numerical analysis using a hybrid of symbolic and numerical methods based on techniques analogous to rigidity theory.  This conjecture, which is long-standing, proposes a formula for the dimension of the space of smooth cubic splines on triangulations.  A third goal is to study asymptotic containments between symbolic and regular powers of ideals, with an eye toward highly structured examples where recent connections to combinatorial optimization and linear programming give good prospects for progress.  Despite their differences, the three focus areas allow for a rich exchange of techniques.  For example, homological methods connect hyperplane arrangements and splines to rigidity, while Macaulay inverse systems link splines to symbolic powers.  The projects are computational in nature and will include the development of code in symbolic software (Macaulay2) and numerical software (Bertini).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gromov--Witten theory is concerned with counting curves of a given type which intersect in special configurations. Such counts, in good situations, give rise to enumerative invariants of the space, called Gromov--Witten invariants. These invariants play a key role in modern enumerative algebraic geometry, as well as in theoretical physics, in the context of string theory. In this project, the PI will apply techniques to calculate Gromov-Witten invariants to several other questions coming from different areas of mathematics, to obtain major advances in mirror symmetry, in representation theory of quivers, and in the study of compactifications of moduli spaces of algebraic varieties.

In the first strand the project intends to develop new degeneration tools for calculating Gromov--Witten invariants with arbitrary insertions of a large class of spaces.

In the third strand, the project intends to provide concrete descriptions of functorial compactifications of the moduli space of log Calabi--Yau pairs using mirror symmetry. The fourth strand of the project will provide a correspondence between Donaldson--Thomas theory of quivers and Gromov--Witten theory for cluster varieties. Finally, the project intends to implement tropical algebro-geometric tools to study the topology of near symplectic manifolds with a toric structure.

Consider a space with lots of symmetries, for example a sphere. Choose a finite set of symmetries of this space, put a particle at a point, and each time move it according to a randomly picked symmetry from our chosen set. This is called a random-walk.  When after a few steps, an observer no longer has much information about the position of the particle, it is said that the random-walk has the spectral gap property. There are many important questions about different random-walks on the same space. For instance a major problem is whether under reasonable assumptions spectral gap is a property of the space rather than a random-walk. Another question is whether it is possible to have two random-walks where observing one gives us information about the other. The PI will solve these type of questions for spaces that emerge from number theoretic problems; this is known as super-approximation conjecture. The PI will continue his mentoring of graduate students and postdocs under this award.<br/> <br/>Having a single random-walk on an infinite space with the spectral gap property was the source of many applications. For instance, by discretizing the space, highly connected sparse graphs, known as expanders, were constructed. Having a random-walk with spectral gap on spheres were used to obtain an effective distribution of points on spheres, and recently used in quantum computing. In the past 15 years, it has been shown that the flexibility of the choice of random-walk which comes with the super-approximation makes it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications.

The PI believes that the study of L-functions can be significantly enhanced by thinking of them as the output of a quantum mechanical system. This perspective makes evident surprising new symmetries and unifying structures in the subject. This project demonstrates the utility of an emerging physics point of view on arithmetic whose broad dissemination the PI is spearheading, including through a planned book. In addition the PI is actively involved in training graduate students and giving expository lectures to broad scientific audiences.<br/><br/>The object of this project is to develop and disseminate new connections between physics and number theory.

In number theory and arithmetic geometry, L-functions are the fundamental invariants and at the heart of the overarching vision provided by the Langlands program. The investigator will develop a new geometric theory of L-functions (in the setting of number fields) directly modeled on partition functions in gauge theory. This reveals a hidden quantum mechanical structure to the subject, situating L-functions as part of the theory of geometric quantization. Conversely, the investigator will develop  a new theory of L-functions for 3-manifolds, suggesting new structure in topology inspired by number theory.

Commutative algebra serves as a local model for algebraic geometry; the latter is a central branch of modern mathematics, where the focus is on the geometric properties of solutions sets to systems of polynomial equations (objects ubiquitous throughout mathematics). In commutative algebra, one examines algebraic structures known as (local) rings, which provide insights into both smooth and singular points on the solution sets explored in algebraic geometry. Since its inception in the 1950's, homological algebra has been instrumental in describing singularities in local commutative algebra, offering valuable ring-theoretic insights. This project aims to leverage tools from homological algebra to gain a deeper understanding of commutative rings, thereby shedding light on singularities in local commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Moreover, this strategy advances commutative algebra by drawing from the wealth of ideas in algebraic topology and representation theory, areas that have leaned heavily on developing homological methods for application in their respective fields, and (further) revealing connections between commutative algebra and these areas. The award will also be used to fund graduate students interested in the proposed research program. <br/><br/>More specifically, the PI will apply an array of homological tools to glean insights in commutative algebra; the two central tools being homotopical methods and cohomological support. Applications of both theories have been far-reaching in commutative algebra, and the proposed research program will further hone this machinery with an eye toward breakthroughs in local algebra. In particular, a primary focus of this project will be on studying the structural properties of certain triangulated categories arising in commutative algebra. Projects in this direction include gaining traction on a long-standing conjecture of Quillen, unifying results in prime characteristic commutative algebra by understanding generators in the bounded derived category, and relating the dimension of certain cohomological supports to classical invariants in commutative algebra with the hopes of making progress on questions of Avramov and Jacobsson. The structural properties of resolutions is another primary focus of the project. In this direction, the PI will extend Koszul duality phenomena in local algebra to include non-quadratic and non-graded algebras.

In essence, tropical geometry replaces geometric spaces modeled by nonlinear equations (a parabola or a sphere, for example) with geometric spaces modeled by linear equations (a line or a plane, for example). Crucially, this bridge runs in both directions, allowing one to study the rich structure of nonlinear spaces using linear and combinatorial techniques while also allowing one to import the deep geometric framework of algebraic geometry into the study of combinatorics. This project will build a new lane in this bridge that is centered around the classical concept of volume, with applications in both combinatorics and algebraic geometry. In addition to the intellectual and mathematical outcomes of this project, the principal investigator will use the line of research problems in this project as an avenue to train and support a diverse community of student researchers at his home institution of San Francisco State University, preparing them to succeed in PhD programs and research careers in the sciences. <br/><br/>One of the most important ways in which volumes arise in algebraic geometry is through the study of divisors on algebraic varieties, which are fundamental objects for studying the defining equations of a variety.

This project will develop parallels of these notions in tropical geometry by introducing volume-theoretic tools for studying divisors and intersection numbers on tropical varieties. Applications of the volume-theoretic tools introduced in this project include a new geometric understanding of recent influential results concerning log-concavity of characteristic polynomials of matroids, allowing one to generalize these log-concavity results to intersection numbers on a much larger class of tropical varieties than was accessible by previous approaches, as well as the development of new tropical methods for studying cones of divisors on tropical compactifications of algebraic varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is concerned with the study of an invariant used for higher dimensional varieties, called the Chow group of zero-cycles, which can be used for classification of algebraic varieties, and relates to the question of existence of rational solutions to polynomial equations. On the broader impact of this award, the PI will support one graduate student and continue her various service and outreach activities including conference and seminar organization and the Bridge to the doctorate program at the University of Virginia. <br/><br/>This project focuses on four conjectures for zero-cycles. The first conjecture concerns the construction of motivic filtrations for the Chow group of zero-cycles. The PI has prior work on this subject for abelian varieties using some K-theoretic techniques, which she now plans to extend to some special classes of K3 surfaces. The second conjecture, due to Colliot and Thelene, concerns algebraic varieties over p-adic fields, and in particular establishing this conjecture for abelian varieties using various techniques including formal group laws and integral p-adic Hodge theory. The PI also plans to study two conjectures over algebraic number fields, and the compatibility between them. The first of these is a conjecture of Kato and Saito, which can be thought of as a local-to-global principle for zero-cycles, and she will explore whether her work could constitute the first step towards a new type of Euler system. The second conjecture is part of the famous Beilinson-Bloch conjectures, which predict that the Chow group of zero-cycles is a finitely generated abelian group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symmetries can be immediately visually apparent, as with mirror images or circles, but also may be more abstract.  For example, solutions to an equation may have symmetries that help us better understand them, or molecules may have symmetries that affect how they interact with one another. There are a number of ways to use the language of mathematics to formalize the concept of symmetry, and some of these lie within the field of Abstract Algebra. Informally, this project will work with symmetries of an object computationally, somewhat like familiar number systems used in everyday life, but more complicated. The project lies within the newly evolving field of ""quantum symmetry"" which allows for greater flexibility in the concept, at the expense of losing some intuition.  However, it can be formalized just as rigorously using mathematics, specifically in the language of Hopf algebras and tensor categories. The proposed work broadens participation in mathematics by having specific subprojects for a diverse group of doctoral students, which will prepare them for their own research careers, in academics, business, industry, or government.<br/><br/>More precisely, this project extends the foundations of representation theory of finite dimensional associative algebras to the setting of algebras in tensor categories. The PI will particularly focus on finite tensor categories and expects the strongest results for fusion categories. The proposed extension of quivers and their representations to the setting of finite tensor categories will accommodate richer underlying structures than just vector spaces, such as the action of a group by automorphisms or a Lie algebras by derivations, as well as vector spaces graded by groups, and even non-classical structures where the objects have fractional (Frobenius-Perron) dimension, and thus cannot be considered to have an underlying vector space in any natural way. A specific class of tensor categories which will receive detailed attention are representation categories of Hopf algebras. This includes many examples of interest across broad areas of mathematics, such as quantum groups.

The interplay between these three disciplines has been at the center of mathematical research over the past century. Mathematicians have uncovered deep connections between them, leading to many spectacular results in mathematics (e.g., Fermat?s Last Theorem) and other fields, including applications in cryptography, quantum field theory, and string theory in physics. The main object of study at the intersection of these disciplines is a set of algebraic equations. While geometry helps understand the shape of the set of solutions with complex entries (also called algebraic varieties), the goal of arithmetic is to understand the set of solutions with integer entries. There are natural linear structures attached to algebraic varieties called Hodge structures, which in some cases capture faithfully the set of algebraic equations we started with. The study of Hodge structures, their symmetries, and their variations is the main object of investigation of this proposal. It is a topic at the crossroads of several areas of research such as complex algebraic geometry, number theory, and representation theory, with many long-standing conjectures. The PI will involve graduate students in this project and will organize a conference on recent advances in Hodge theory.<br/><br/><br/>This project aims to answer several questions regarding the distribution of the exceptional Hodge locus in the theory of variations of Hodge structures and their arithmetic counterpart, the Tate locus. These questions will be addressed using tools from Arakelov intersection theory, ergodic theory, Hodge theory, Ax-Schanuel theorem for Shimura varieties, and Diophantine geometry. The first goal is to study the atypical Hodge locus in some families of algebraic varieties. The second goal is to study the Tate locus and give a concrete application to exceptional algebraicity under specializations of Brauer classes on K3 surfaces. The third goal is to study the modularity behavior of the closure of special cycles in moduli spaces of K3 surfaces, or more generally in orthogonal Shimura varieties. These generating series exhibit a quasi-modularity behavior as well as a mixed mock modularity behavior, depending on the type of degeneration of the family of K3 surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project further develops two curve counting techniques, the ""logarithmic gauged linear sigma model"" (log GLSM) and ""quasimaps"", and their combination, with the goal of making progress on challenging conjectures from physics, which have appeared out of reach of mathematicians until recently.

Thus, we can solve equations using geometry (by finding where lines, planes, curves intersect).  These ideas have evolved into algebraic geometry, a field of modern mathematics with applications ranging from physics to cybersecurity.  In this collaborative project we are particularly interested in the connections to physics.  These connections are made through ?derived categories?, a complex system of mathematical data associated to a geometric shape.  While derived categories have experienced explosive development in recent decades, many questions about them remain unsolved.   This project attempts to solve some of the central and most recent questions about derived categories using techniques developed by the principal investigators and many others over the last decade.  This award will also support undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project focuses on three specific questions about derived categories.  Together, these questions incorporate numerous areas of mathematics including birational geometry, enumerative geometry, and non-commutative algebra.   Specifically, our first question studies connections between derived categories and birational geometry (and the possibly concealed connection between flips/flops and derived partial compactifications).  We ask whether K-equivalent varieties have equivalent derived categories, a central conjecture about derived categories due to Bondal-Orlov and Kawamata.  Our second question asks how decompositions of quantum cohomology are related to semi-orthogonal decompositions of derived categories.  This connection is conjecturally made through mirror symmetry as proposed by Kontsevich and Kuznetsov.  Finally, our third question asks how derived categories shed light on resolutions of singularities (namely as moduli spaces coming from non-commutative algebra).  Here, we aim to construct non-commutative crepant resolutions using ideas from homological mirror symmetry.  The existence of these resolutions has been conjectured by Van den Bergh.  As a whole, this project aims to interpolate between these three questions/conjectures using techniques from geometric invariant theory, non-commutative algebra, derived algebraic geometry, and mirror symmetry. The central theme is the explicit use and construction of Fourier-Mukai kernels whose geometry provides a foothold into understanding these problems.  Combining the past work of the principal investigators on the construction of Fourier-Mukai kernels, wall crossing for derived categories, and virtual fundamental cycles, we expect to advance our understanding of these fundamental questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will reveal new symmetries possessed by L-functions, which in turn will be useful for understanding objects such as the prime numbers. Prime numbers are essential in cryptography, a method by which computer data is securely transferred. The project will also reveal how automorphic forms are distributed.

This project will go beyond QUE, by investigating higher moments of automorphic forms, and yielding a finer understanding of the distribution of automorphic forms. The reciprocity formulae are certain exact formulae for moments of L-functions, exhibiting some surprising symmetry. An early example is Motohashi's formula, which relates the fourth moment of the Riemann Zeta function to the third moment of automorphic forms. This project will discover new examples of reciprocity formulae, which will shed light on the nature of such symmetries and yield new applications, such as subconvexity bounds for L-functions.

It will also provide them with role models to help them see themselves as professional mathematicians and build their sense of belonging to the mathematical community.<br/><br/>This workshop will introduce graduate student participants to contemporary and exciting research in commutative algebra. The workshop will have three 50-minute plenary lectures given by faculty, three 20-minute talks given by senior graduate students, and a poster session for all participants to share their own research. The talks will highlight not only pure commutative algebra but will also highlight interactions between commutative algebra and adjacent fields, such as algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and even neural network modeling.  In order to help participants better understand the techniques and methods presented in the plenary talks, there will be problem sessions for active work. These activities will promote the growth of mathematically collaborative relationships among participants and will build their mathematical skills.

The geometry of Hessenberg varieties is completely understood in only a few cases. The PI will transform the traditional path of research in this area by studying families of Hessenberg varieties united by only a few essential properties, and prove the geometry of these varieties fluctuates in predictable ways as other inputs vary.

Number theory deals with properties of whole numbers, such as quickly factoring large numbers into primes, and underpins computer security and behavior of black holes. Harmonic analysis can be viewed as mathematically making a sculpture out of unformed clay; this field takes a complicated function and breaks it up into simple pieces ? its harmonics ? and is central to medical imaging and quantum states. Imagining and building a new landscape where areas sometimes perceived as disconnected can harmonize is at the forefront of this project: Instead of exploiting known connections, new ones will be created centered around three distinct areas. Firstly, quantitative behavior of discrete operators with curvature will be undertaken; while relevant to many applications, the novelty here will be developing the infrastructure to use both analysis and number theory from the perspective of both fields. The second part will be a continuation of the discovery of hidden number theoretic properties in the framework underlying harmonic analysis, furthering this mathematical grid system in both areas. Finally, determining the behavior of a random object of algebraic interest, such as a polynomial, is a central problem in mathematics. By integrating Fourier analysis into this playing field, will enable a better prediction of this randomness in a wide variety of ways. Undergraduates will be heavily involved in research, especially in the second part, via a summer and semester research and training program. The multifaceted and network-building education plan further includes the teaching of a graduate class intitled ?Widening the margins: the experience of URMs in the mathematical sciences,? which will be developed in collaboration with the institution?s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion office.<br/><br/>The project consists of three main programs, all on the intersection between harmonic analysis and number theory. Firstly, operator bounds for discrete operators involving integration over curved submanifolds will be obtained. This is a delicate topic in continuous analysis and the discrete setting introduces new challenges and obstacles. A development of number theoretic tools in tandem with the analysis will dramatically push forward understanding of these objects. Additionally, these bounds are connected to lattice point counts and information on this front will be quantified via refined analysis of exponential sums, including discrete restriction problems for a variety of surfaces that are translation dilation invariant. Secondly, a continued uncovering of a hidden number theoretic structure and techniques in the realm of dyadic analysis will be pursued, leading to a myriad of structure theorems. Thirdly, the program in Fourier analytic techniques in arithmetic statistics will use novel insights from analysis to improve a variety of counts of algebraic interest, such as fields and polynomials. Prior investigations here have already been successful as recent results include a major step in resolving a conjecture of van der Waerden on Galois groups of random polynomials and counting number fields of bounded discriminant.

In short, the main goal of this project is to further our understanding of higher dimensional moduli by leveraging many recent results in moduli theory and birational geometry, such as wall-crossing results that the PI has obtained in joint work with collaborators. The first project aims to use wall-crossing techniques to understand the underlying geometric structure and geometric properties of moduli spaces of higher dimensional algebraic varieties. Additionally, as most known results regarding moduli spaces of higher dimensional varieties focus on two cases, namely (log) general type pairs and (log) Fano pairs, the goal of the second project is to construct and study moduli spaces of (log) Calabi-Yau pairs using tools from the minimal model program and K-stability.

A polynomial is any equation that can be formed using the fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and solving a system of polynomial equations means solving multiple polynomial equations simultaneously.  Polynomial systems, though simple to define, are rich enough to describe, or model, many interesting phenomena.  They are ubiquitous in many different areas of science, including computer science, biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering, and play a critical role in the applications of these areas to industry.  A polynomial system can involve many different unknowns, or variables, and in applications, the number of these variables is often quite large (e.g., having thousands of variables in a system is not rare).  Unfortunately, the technique of graphing, which allows us to visualize and study polynomial equations, is no longer available to us once we are dealing with four or more variables.  This project is focused on overcoming this obstacle by developing systematic ways to describe and precisely measure the complexity of polynomial systems, no matter the number of variables.  Furthermore, this will done in an algebraic, discrete manner; that is, using methods that can be translated into the language of a computer.  In this pursuit, the PI will train, mentor, and support students.  He will train graduate students to conduct technical mathematical research, to implement their results using open-sourced computing languages, and to effectively communicate their results to a wide audience.  This will prepare such students for careers in academic research and instruction, as well as in industry.  At the undergraduate level, we will mentor students, especially those from under-represented groups, to prepare them for successful careers in industry, and also for graduate school in a STEM, or adjacent, field.<br/><br/>More precisely, The PI will study the singularities of algebraic varieties, or systems of polynomial equations, through understanding invariants associated to them.  Invariants are objects (such as a number, or an ideal in a ring, or a polyhedral shape) derived from a variety in a consistent manner, and that can meaningfully, precisely, quantify subtle properties of that variety.  The invariants studied are both discrete (e.g., defined using the Frobenius morphism in prime characteristic), and continuous (e.g., defined in terms of integrability conditions, or resolution of singularities).  The PI will employ many concrete techniques, including some based on convex geometry, polyhedral geometry and variants of linear optimization problems, and will produce effective algorithms to explicitly compute many interesting invariants of singularities. These algorithms will be implemented in open-source computer algebra systems such as Macaulay2.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humans have studied them for millennia. Number theory aims to understand patterns possessed by whole numbers. Fundamental questions revolve around multiplication: how often are numbers in some sequence even (i.e. divisible by two)? Divisible by three? Or five? Nineteenth century researchers introduced symmetry actions to reveal hidden patterns in numbers. And, in the 1970's, Robert Langlands made far-reaching conjectures on symmetry. These conjectures have occupied number theorists ever since. They predict patterns seen by symmetry actions will arise equally from the calculus of complex numbers (""modular forms""). A pattern appearing in two places is an example of a mathematical reciprocity. This project will refine Langlands' reciprocity prediction. The new tool is geometric spaces of symmetry actions, constructed by Emerton and Gee over the past fifteen years. These spaces are believed to convert reciprocity questions into geometrical ones. This project establishes instances of this belief. It will connect divisibility patterns from the world of modular forms to geometrical theorems on Emerton and Gee's spaces. The project has substantial broader impacts. Computational data will be included in the widely-used L-functions and Modular Forms Database. The project also develops computational tools for teaching. Open education resources (OERs) are learning materials placed in the public domain. Their primary benefit is providing learning experiences at low costs. They can be adapted to fit a diversity of learning environments. The project develops OERs for computer-based learning of number theory and abstract algebra. The project supports education and outreach in two more ways. First, Math Circles will be run in public schools. Second, research projects will be developed to support the Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists. Finally, the project plans two research workshops in number theory. Both aim to disseminate new advances in number theory and reciprocity. <br/><br/>The more detailed aim is a new study of p-adic slopes of modular forms and Galois representations. The p-adic slope of a modular form is how often its p-th Hecke eigenvalue is divisible by a fixed prime p. Predictions and theorems on slopes have been around since the 1980's. Seven years ago, Bergdall and Pollack proposed a way (""the ghost conjecture"") to unify almost all prior ideas. The ghost conjecture's input is a congruence class of modular forms. The output is an elementary recipe for slopes in the class. The main caveat is the ghost conjecture only applies to ""regular"" classes. But, assuming regularity, Liu, Truong, Xiao, and Zhao (LTXZ) recently established the conjecture. The current project removes the regular assumption in the ghost conjecture. The new tool is Emerton and Gee's (EG) moduli stack of Galois representations. In Galois terms, regularity is a generic property on the EG stack. The project's technical innovation is thus deforming slope questions over the stack. A geometrical reformulation will open the door to generalizing the LTXZ proof. It will also create space for novel studies of Hilbert modular forms or higher rank automorphic forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this field, known as number theory, the prime numbers play a central role.  Fundamental questions revolve around patterns in the primes, gaps between primes, and how primes of special types are distributed.  Since the early 20th century, sieve methods have been one of the chief tools we have for analyzing these problems, but the limitations of these methods are poorly understood, and discovering the limitations is a major open problem in the field. This award will enable the PI to continue his work understanding and exploring sieve methods and the distribution of primes. Success in this endeavor will help unlock many of the mysteries of prime numbers and have a significant impact on many areas of mathematics and information theory.  Grant funds will also be used to train and mentor graduate students working in number theory. <br/><br/>The PI will develop new methods of probing the limitations of sieve methods for detecting primes in a general sequence of integers. The emphasis will be on developing a new, unified theory of sieves that allows one to say if the main hypotheses on the sequence, known as Type-I bounds and Type-II bounds, are sufficient to show that the sequence contains many primes. The strength of these hypotheses are governed by three parameters. In particular, we will prove, for the first time, that in a certain range of these parameters, there are sequences which satisfy the Type-I and Type-II bounds yet contain no primes.  The primary goal is to determine precisely in which range of the parameters the main hypotheses imply that the sequence always contains many primes. We will also investigate in finer detail the problem of counting primes in short intervals.  The PI will also continue his investigations into further understanding the concentration of divisors of integers.

Besides the immediate mathematical applications, knot theory has implications in physics of quantum systems and in the study of chemical and biological properties of long knotted molecules. The central questions in knot theory are the classification problem (Can a knot be transformed to another knot without tearing its strands? Can it be untangled to look like an ordinary circle?) and the study of the geometric properties of knots or links. Both of these questions can be partially answered with the help of a link invariant: a collection of numbers that does not change under continuous stretching of a link. Two links are different if their invariants are different. The project is focused on uncovering and studying the patterns and symmetries of link invariants. The project will provide research training opportunities for students and post-docs.<br/><br/>In more detail, the project is focused on Khovanov-Rozansky link homology which generalizes the celebrated HOMFLY polynomial. To a link such a theory associates a triply graded vector space which carries an action of many interesting operators. The project will build upon and unify a variety of existing operations (such as Rasmussen's differentials, tautological classes and Witt algebra action), to study the commutation relations between these and to define new ones. The action of such a large algebra is expected to unravel some patterns and symmetries in link homology. Another motivation comes from geometric models for link homology: these include sheaves on Hilbert schemes of points on the plane, braid varieties, Hilbert schemes on singular curves and affine Springer fibers. In many cases, geometric representation theory then predicts an action of large algebras in homology, and the investigator will translate these into explicit actions in link homology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Systems of equation that have a large enough group of symmetries are called homogeneous and they play a central role in this project. These symmetries can be used to relate different integer solutions to each other and facilitate the introduction of methods from the theory of dynamical systems to this research area. The dynamical methods have been immensely successful in solving long standing problems in number theory. The major objectives of this project are to make progress on long-standing problems about equidistribution in number theory, to expose undergraduate students to number theory and prepare them to graduate studies, and to prepare graduate students to conduct research at the intersection of number theory and dynamics.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is the chaotic behavior of periodic subgroup orbits on homogeneous spaces, and the randomness exhibited in the asymptotic behavior of automorphic forms. Early breakthroughs include Linnik's results about the equidistribution of integral points on the sphere and Margulis's solution of the Oppenheim conjecture regarding the values attained by an irrational quadratic form at integer points. To make progress on these topics, this project will fuse and expand results from homogeneous dynamics and analytic number theory.

While mathematicians have infinitely many examples of such relationships, proving that these constitute all such relationships remains a distant goal. This project will study near-relatives of multiple zeta values in an alternative setting where there is a reasonable hope of proving such results about the set of all relationships between them.

Next, the PI will use these motivic constructions to show that spaces of deformed multiple zeta values are generated as a tau-algebra by certain special functions which have precise arithmetic meaning.

The main goal of this project is to establish new subconvexity bounds for L-functions and push existing bounds towards the gold standard (the so-called Weyl bound).  The project will consider the symmetric-square L-functions (or close approximations of these), L-functions at ?special points? exhibiting conductor dropping, and strong hybrid bounds for L-functions, such as those of Hecke eigenforms twisted by Dirichlet characters. The methodology will include moments of L-functions in families, reciprocity formulae, and automorphic spectral analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will approach problems in arithmetic dynamics from two different directions: One is a geometric approach, studying dynamical moduli spaces -- geometric objects that classify dynamical systems that have various interesting dynamical behaviors. The other is an algebraic approach, understanding various algebraic symmetries exhibited by dynamical systems and the way that these symmetries interact with dynamical moduli spaces. In addition to working with graduate students on problems in arithmetic dynamics, this project will involve outreach in the community, to middle and high school students as well as adults working to further their education.<br/><br/>Arithmetic dynamics is largely motivated by analogies between objects in arithmetic geometry and the dynamics of rational maps. One explicit connection is that preperiodic points for rational functions form a natural dynamical analogue of torsion points on elliptic curves. To better understand the torsion points on elliptic curves, one is led to consider modular curves, which parametrize (isomorphism classes of) elliptic curves together with level structure, a key example of which would be marking a torsion point of order n. In a similar fashion, one approach to studying algebraic dynamics is to consider moduli spaces for dynamical systems with a dynamical notion of level structure: for example, one might study the (equivalence classes) of rational functions of a given degree d together with a marked periodic point of period n. The PI will continue his work developing these dynamical moduli spaces and better understanding geometric, arithmetic, and Galois-theoretic properties. Work on this project will lead to insights into two directions in arithmetic dynamics: The Morton-Silverman dynamical uniform boundedness conjecture, which is a strengthening of Merel's theorem for torsion points on elliptic curves, and dynamical analogues of Serre?s open image theorem.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This seemingly simple concept leads to remarkably difficult unsolved problems in mathematics, with implications in areas such as biology, chemistry, computer science, and physics. This project focuses on investigating the connection between two fundamental objects in number theory: modular forms and hypergeometric functions. The theory of classical modular forms has long played an important role in number theory and was essential in Wiles? proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem. More recently, generalized modular forms have become central objects of study, and can be understood through differential equations satisfied by classical modular forms. Special functions known as classical hypergeometric functions are known to satisfy very similar differential equations, suggesting a connection between hypergeometric functions and modular forms. In turn, hypergeometric functions provide arithmetic information for various mathematical objects, including multi-parameter families of Calabi-Yau manifolds leading to applications in string theory. An overall expectation is that hypergeometric functions provide a new direction in understanding the phenomena arising in mirror symmetry, one of the central research themes binding string theory and algebraic geometry. This project will make use of this connection to hypergeometric functions to study the arithmetic properties and applications of general modular forms. The broader impacts of this project include mentoring graduate and undergraduate students in research, organizing conferences and workshops, continuing to work on outreach programs with middle and high school students, and disseminating data and expository notes.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will study the properties of modular forms in relation to character sums and differential equations ? especially those of hypergeometric type ? using methods from arithmetic geometry, Galois theory, and Galois representations.

The main goals are: <br/>(1) to discover the arithmetic properties of modular forms on Shimura curves through explicit constructions; <br/>(2) to advance the understanding of hypergeometric systems and the modularity of hypergeometric Galois representations; and <br/>(3) to exploit the relations between hypergeometric functions and modular forms for arithmetic triangle groups to understand the fundamental properties of these two objects, such as their values at complex multiplication points and L-values.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Amazingly, quantum groups have recently been shown to arise as the symmetries of 4-dimensional gauge theories, which describe the interaction of elementary particles such as quarks. Differential equations are another basic paradigm in science, and describe the evolution of physical, chemical, biological and economic systems. One of their striking aspects is that they can exhibit Stokes phenomena: their solutions are not entirely captured by the recursive, and often programmable methods used to solve them. The missing information, or Stokes data, can be considered as a hidden symmetry of the differential equation, as they relate different solutions possessing the same formal expansions. This project stems from the recent discovery that quantum groups naturally arise from the Stokes data of differential equations associated to classical symmetries. The main goals are to further explore this bridge between classical and quantum symmetries. Of particular interest is the extension to difference equations, which are natural discretisations of differential equations, and whose Stokes data are not well-understood beyond the one-variable case. Another important direction will the study of the integrable systems, or constants of motion, corresponding to these differential and difference equations.

Subsequently, the PI will develop new tools and build connections between braid and cactus group actions, both on the classical and higher-structure, categorical level, and in the process develop the representation theory of the cactus group. Finally, the PI will investigate a family of closely related diagram algebras?the two-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebras?and unite three radial viewpoints of their standard modules, which will enable the study of their decomposition and irreducibility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The set of solutions to a polynomial equation makes up a geometric object in multi-dimensional space (e.g., the set of solutions to the equation y=x^2 is a parabola in 2-space).  The intersection of several of these geometric objects is made up of the points that are solutions to all of polynomial equations cutting out those geometric objects.  When such an intersection consists of finitely many points, it is natural to ask how many points.  Questions of this nature have been of broad interest within algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics since at least the time of Hermann Schubert (1848-1911), whose methodology for solving these problems forms the basis of what is now called Schubert calculus.  The PI will apply techniques from commutative algebra to solve problems in modern-day Schubert calculus.  Through her research program, she will train graduate students.  She will also promote gender equity in the mathematical sciences by taking on leadership roles in conferences and research communities for women and non-binary mathematicians working in commutative algebra.<br/><br/>The primary theme of this research project is the use of combinatorial models to understand affine varieties and the algebro-geometric significance of these combinatorial models. The PI will first focus on Schubert varieties in the complete flag variety and the Groebner geometry of several classes of related affine varieties. A motivating problem is to understand the Schubert structure constants. Another family of problems concerns the connection between Gorenstein liaison and Groebner degenerations. The PI will use this connection to study a range of combinatorially-natural varieties. She will also further the understanding of Gorenstein liaison itself.  A link between these two focuses is the family of alternating sign matrix (ASM) varieties, which are generalizations of matrix Schubert varieties. Understanding when and why ASM varieties fail to exhibit various ?niceness? properties of matrix Schubert varieties will shed light on which features of matrix Schubert varieties are essential to their good behavior.

Nevertheless, one can often characterize an equation by the shape of its set of solutions, even if the solutions themselves cannot be written down.  The Langlands correspondences grow out of the observation that the shapes of the equations that arise in two apparently different areas of mathematics ? number theory and the symmetries of mathematical physics ? are linked by a complex web of relations that allow questions in one area to be solved by reference to the other area.  The branch of mathematics that studies these correspondences is called the theory of automorphic forms.  The simplest examples of automorphic forms are the familiar sine and cosine function from trigonometry.  More general automorphic forms are described in terms of geometry in higher dimensions.  In this way the study of automorphic forms contributes to the development of all branches of mathematics.   Problems studied in the present project, presented at seminars and conferences, will serve as the basis for training the next generation of specialists.  They also provide examples for philosophers and historians of the kind of synthesis of ideas that is characteristic of contemporary mathematics, and that presents a special challenge for those who prodict that artificial intelligence will play a prominent role in the mathematics of the future.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>This project is a contribution to the study of motives over number fields in the setting of the Langlands program, continuing a theme that has been central to the PI's research throughout his career.  The present proposal is divided into two parts.  Part 1 combines motivic methods, ? especially the Grothendieck-Deligne theory of weights ? with the Selberg trace formula and representation theory to the study of local and global Langlands correspondences, both classical and mod p.   In particular, a strategy is outlined for an inductive construction of the local Langlands correspondence over local fields of positive characteristic, and an extension is proposed to Arthur parameters of the author's approach to the generalized Ramanujan conjecture.   Part 2 points in the opposite direction:  it applies the insights of the Langlands program and harmonic analysis on reductive groups to study (p-adic) motivic L-functions, especially square root p-adic L-functions, with special attention to classifying the Gan-Gross-Prasad periods that can be interpreted as cohomological cup products.

For example, one might consider all the lines passing through a fixed point. These families, and the related questions, can be quite complicated. An important tool in their study is the ?period map?, a function that is associated with the family.

This project will identify and study concrete instances of these abstract symmetries and apply the results to advance the mathematical understanding of quantum field theory in dimensions two (via Landau-Ginzburg models) and three (via Rozansky-Witten models). Two novel features of these quantum field theories are that they are defined on non-orientable geometries or involve non-semisimple categories of line operators; both features make them particularly challenging to study.

In the second project the PI will extend prior work on the representation theory of cohomological Hall algebras and its applications to orientifold Donaldson-Thomas theory. In the third project the PI will use the representation theory of quantum supergroups to construct the equivariant Rozansky-Witten theory of a holomorphic symplectic manifold.

Thus, we can solve equations using geometry (by finding where lines, planes, curves intersect).

In this collaborative project we are particularly interested in the connections to physics.  These connections are made through ?derived categories?, a complex system of mathematical data associated to a geometric shape.  While derived categories have experienced explosive development in recent decades, many questions about them remain unsolved.   This project attempts to solve some of the central and most recent questions about derived categories using techniques developed by the principal investigators and many others over the last decade.  This award will also support undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project focuses on three specific questions about derived categories.  Together, these questions incorporate numerous areas of mathematics including birational geometry, enumerative geometry, and non-commutative algebra.   Specifically, our first question studies connections between derived categories and birational geometry (and the possibly concealed connection between flips/flops and derived partial compactifications).  We ask whether K-equivalent varieties have equivalent derived categories, a central conjecture about derived categories due to Bondal-Orlov and Kawamata.  Our second question asks how decompositions of quantum cohomology are related to semi-orthogonal decompositions of derived categories.  This connection is conjecturally made through mirror symmetry as proposed by Kontsevich and Kuznetsov.  Finally, our third question asks how derived categories shed light on resolutions of singularities (namely as moduli spaces coming from non-commutative algebra).  Here, we aim to construct non-commutative crepant resolutions using ideas from homological mirror symmetry.  The existence of these resolutions has been conjectured by Van den Bergh.  As a whole, this project aims to interpolate between these three questions/conjectures using techniques from geometric invariant theory, non-commutative algebra, derived algebraic geometry, and mirror symmetry. The central theme is the explicit use and construction of Fourier-Mukai kernels whose geometry provides a foothold into understanding these problems.  Combining the past work of the principal investigators on the construction of Fourier-Mukai kernels, wall crossing for derived categories, and virtual fundamental cycles, we expect to advance our understanding of these fundamental questions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A singularity is a place on a curve, surface, or higher dimensional space where it is not smooth, i.e., it has a sharp point or crosses itself. In general, one wants to be able to find measures of how extreme a singularity is and how these vary under maps, but usually the number of equations or variables makes a graph impossible or misleading. This is solved by employing the structural backbone given by algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. Generally, the goal is to attach invariants to singularities that are measures of the character of the singularity. Singularities will be studied in several ways: via differential forms and differential operators, which characterize smoothness; and by constructing new algebraic structures which yield not only invariants but also tools to discover new invariants. In the long run, work on singularities can lead to applications to computer vision and medical imaging and to string theory in physics. The project will continue the PI?s strong engagement in graduate education with PhD students. The PI will continue to co-organize conferences and workshops such as the Introductory Workshop at an MSRI semester program in 2024 and a future MSRI Summer Graduate School at the Chern Institute. <br/><br/>Commutative and homological algebra are crucial in developing the foundations of algebraic geometry. This project will address some central topics and their interplay: differential forms, differential operators, cotangent complexes, and dg-algebra and A-infinity structures. The focus will be on (1) resolutions of differential forms and the cotangent complex, (2) differential operators of fixed orders and their resolutions, (3) DG algebra resolutions of graded Artinian algebras, and (4) comparisons of bar and Eagon resolutions via A-infinity structures. For the first, the focus is on understanding symmetries in and vanishing of invariants obtained from higher differentials, such as generalized Tjurina numbers, by showing how their resolutions are interrelated for Gorenstein singularities. For the second, a new homological approach will be used to work on finding the differential operators of hypersurfaces. The third involves the use of HPT (homological perturbation theory) to transfer algebra structures, and the fourth use of A-infinity structures to relate and generalize two classical resolutions. The unifying theme is to use homological methods to gain insight into these problems.

The research program  will provide many projects suitable for undergraduate and graduate students research which the principal investigator will supervise.<br/><br/>There are two main directions the principal investigator and her collaborators will pursue with the projects, namely, to study the p-divisible groups for families of high dimensional abelian varieties and to study the structure of the ideal class groups of certain families of global function fields. There are different types of families in the research projects, such as the reductions of an abelian variety defined over a global field parameterized by the places of the base field, algebraic families of abelian varieties parameterized by a Shimura variety and sets of global function fields ordered by their discriminant. Specifically, one project aims to prove the set of ordinary primes in the reduction of certain abelian varieties with nontrivial endomorphism groups has density 1. In the opposite direction, another project aims to construct infinitely many primes at which these abelian varieties admit basic reduction, generalizing the work of Elkies? on the infinitude of supersingular primes for elliptic curves. For ideal class group, the principal investigator and her collaborators will use Galois cohomology and computational tools to predict and prove properties of the distribution of l-torsion classes for degree l extensions of the rational function field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry studies geometric objects that are defined by polynomial equations, using methods from algebra, complex analysis, differential geometry, topology, and partial differential equations. Algebraic geometry also provides useful examples for certain parts of theoretical physics such as string theory. Most of the research proposed by the PI has to do with a subfield of algebraic geometry called Hodge theory. Hodge theory makes it possible to apply results from the theory of partial differential equations to problems in algebraic geometry, in a language that is closer to algebra than to analysis. Some of the work proposed by the PI is about developing Hodge theory further (and to make it more accessible to graduate students); the rest is about using Hodge theory to solve several very specific problems in algebraic geometry. The PI will also work on a comprehensive book on this subject which will be of enormous use to the research community.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project has several different research objectives, all related to Hodge theory:<br/>(1) To develop a theory of higher multiplier ideals for effective divisors, in joint work with Ruijie Yang, by using the nearby cycles functor for mixed Hodge modules.<br/>(2) To apply this theory to theta divisors on principally polarized abelian varieties, in particular to a conjecture by Casalaina-Martin about the multiplicities of their singular points.<br/>(3) To continue to study the local and global structure of the locus of self-dual classes for integral variations of Hodge structure; self-dual classes are a generalization of Hodge classes that are of interest in theoretical physics.<br/>(4) To further investigate the behavior of Kodaira dimension under smooth morphisms, especially several related conjectures by Campana-Peternell and by Popa.<br/>(5) To continue the study of degenerating complex variations of Hodge structure in higher dimensions, in particular the precise local behavior of the Hodge metric, and its relation with the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras.<br/>(6) To continue the ""Mixed Hodge Module Project"" (joint with Claude Sabbah), whose aim is to write an accessible treatment of the theory of mixed Hodge modules with complex coefficients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humans have studied them for millennia. Number theory aims to understand patterns possessed by whole numbers. Fundamental questions revolve around multiplication: how often are numbers in some sequence even (i.e. divisible by two)? Divisible by three? Or five? Nineteenth century researchers introduced symmetry actions to reveal hidden patterns in numbers. And, in the 1970's, Robert Langlands made far-reaching conjectures on symmetry. These conjectures have occupied number theorists ever since. They predict patterns seen by symmetry actions will arise equally from the calculus of complex numbers (""modular forms""). A pattern appearing in two places is an example of a mathematical reciprocity. This project will refine Langlands' reciprocity prediction. The new tool is geometric spaces of symmetry actions, constructed by Emerton and Gee over the past fifteen years. These spaces are believed to convert reciprocity questions into geometrical ones. This project establishes instances of this belief. It will connect divisibility patterns from the world of modular forms to geometrical theorems on Emerton and Gee's spaces. The project has substantial broader impacts. Computational data will be included in the widely-used L-functions and Modular Forms Database. The project also develops computational tools for teaching. Open education resources (OERs) are learning materials placed in the public domain. Their primary benefit is providing learning experiences at low costs. They can be adapted to fit a diversity of learning environments. The project develops OERs for computer-based learning of number theory and abstract algebra. The project supports education and outreach in two more ways. First, Math Circles will be run in public schools. Second, research projects will be developed to support the Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists. Finally, the project plans two research workshops in number theory. Both aim to disseminate new advances in number theory and reciprocity. <br/><br/>The more detailed aim is a new study of p-adic slopes of modular forms and Galois representations. The p-adic slope of a modular form is how often its p-th Hecke eigenvalue is divisible by a fixed prime p. Predictions and theorems on slopes have been around since the 1980's. Seven years ago, Bergdall and Pollack proposed a way (""the ghost conjecture"") to unify almost all prior ideas. The ghost conjecture's input is a congruence class of modular forms. The output is an elementary recipe for slopes in the class. The main caveat is the ghost conjecture only applies to ""regular"" classes. But, assuming regularity, Liu, Truong, Xiao, and Zhao (LTXZ) recently established the conjecture. The current project removes the regular assumption in the ghost conjecture. The new tool is Emerton and Gee's (EG) moduli stack of Galois representations. In Galois terms, regularity is a generic property on the EG stack. The project's technical innovation is thus deforming slope questions over the stack. A geometrical reformulation will open the door to generalizing the LTXZ proof. It will also create space for novel studies of Hilbert modular forms or higher rank automorphic forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, the value of a function at a point is just one number, but knowledge of how a (continuous) function behaves in a tiny neighborhood of that point gives qualitative information like whether the function is increasing or decreasing and how fast.  This requires a notion of distance so that one can talk about perturbing an object ?a little bit?.  In number theory, one often replaces the usual notion of distance with a ?p-adic? distance ? one that measures how divisible a number is by a given prime number p.  The PI will investigate the p-adic variation of ?modular forms? ? special functions whose graphs have many symmetries.  Studying variation of modular forms is a topic in number theory that has led to many deep results such as the proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem.  The PI and her collaborators have found new directions of p-adic variation that have yet to be explored and promise to yield new insights about arithmetic.  This investigation will incorporate young scientists at many career stages as the PI mentors high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and organizes conferences at both a regional and international level. <br/><br/>On a more technical level, there are three overarching topics to be studied.  The first two concern congruences between modular forms, first in the ?vexing? setting and then Eisenstein congruences.  The final topic concerns images of Galois representations. Each topic contains multiple projects, both addressing the topic directly as well as arithmetic consequences.  One new direction of (tame) p-adic variation referenced above occurs in the vexing setting, where the PI and her collaborators can prove a structure result on the relevant Hecke algebra.  A deeper study of this phenomenon will allow her to explore consequences for tame analogues of Iwasawa theory and the Bloch-Kato Conjectures.  Within the topic of Eisenstein congruences, the PI will explore the structure of pseudodeformation rings and Hecke algebras in weight 2 and prime-square level.  This has natural applications to the p-rank of the class group of the field cut out by a p-th root of an integer.  Finally, she will use her recent work with Conti and Medvedovsky on images of 2-dimensional Galois representations to understand images of finite products of such representations, doing this in a way that characterizes the availability of elements needed for Euler system machinery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solving these so-called Diophantine equations is typically very difficult, and this difficulty is a source of security for encryption algorithms that, for instance, guarantee private communication on the internet. Moreover, the richness of these Diophantine problems has profound connections to other branches of mathematics. One can fruitfully study the set of solutions to these equations through its geometry and dynamics, repackaging them as a Galois representation. In the 1970s, Robert Langlands made far-reaching predictions that connect Galois representations to mathematical physics and harmonic analysis. A p-adic version of Langlands' conjectures, which incorporates divisibility by powers of a prime, has led to exciting progress on Langlands' original conjectures and, consequently, a range of classical number-theoretic questions like Fermat's Last Theorem. Further analogues of Langlands' conjectures in other contexts have spurred activity in representation theory, algebraic geometry, and modern physics. More recently, a number of mathematicians have proposed a unifying categorical framework for these different versions of Langlands' conjectures. This project aims to study the p-adic version of Langlands' conjectures through the categorical framework by modelling the space of Galois representations. The geometry of the space of Galois representations is a new and fertile research direction that provides opportunities to train younger researchers and to connect communities in number theory and geometric representation theory. The PI also plans to recruit and train researchers through outreach, by disseminating accessible background material on number theory aimed at beginning graduate students, and by organizing local and regional seminars and conferences.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate the hypothetical mod p and p-adic Langlands correspondences that relate Galois representations and modular and integral representations of p-adic reductive groups.

This project aims to study several classes of moduli spaces which lie at the crossroads of central areas in mathematics and physics. The investigator will develop new tools concerning these varieties, attack long standing questions, and explore new connections.

Graduate students will be supported by this award. <br/><br/>The research of the investigator will center around three projects: (1) to study the P=W phenomenon and the topological mirror symmetry for general reductive groups. This will bridge more systematically symmetries of groups in representation theory and symmetries of moduli spaces in algebraic geometry; moreover, a local version of P=W will be explored concerning several conjectures relating algebraic geometry of singularities to knot invariants in topology; (2) to study Hodge theory of Lagrangian fibrations. This will connect the general theory of perverse sheaves and Hodge modules to concrete and interesting examples of integrable systems and symplectic varieties; (3) to study perverse sheaves in enumerative geometry. This concerns relating Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas invariants to the more mysterious work of Gopakumar and Vafa. This direction will provide new perspectives in understanding the connections between algebraic geometry and quantum physics.

The project focuses on developing theoretical tools to understand large classes of diphantine equations.  Applications of understanding these equations, and their related shadows over finite number systems, abound, e.g., in cryptography and coding theory.  The PI has experience working on the latter applications.

The main themes are (1) Systems of Polynomial Equations, (2) Computer Science and Computational Complexity. Systems of polynomial equations can be thought of as describing the dependence relations between physical quantities in some models. The solution set of them describes the geometric shape of the model. Natural phenomena, and hence the model describing them, often come equipped with a rich symmetry. Hence it is natural to use symmetry-based methods to study them. The proposed research will lead to a better understanding of the geometry as well as the utility of the model. A second theme of the project is the complexity of matrix multiplication (a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers). Finding efficient ways to multiply matrices is the topic of a subfield of Computer Science known as complexity theory. In 1968, Strassen discovered that the widely used algorithm for matrix multiplication which was assumed to be the best possible, is in fact not optimal. Since then, there has been intense research in both determining just how efficiently matrices may be multiplied and determining the limits of how much Strassen's algorithm can be improved.

These are abstract algebraic structures  consisting of objects that can be fused using certain natural rules. Such categories are indispensable in the study of classical and quantum symmetries.  They are also used as mathematical models for a potential hardware design of a quantum computer. Namely, they correspond to topological phases of matter relevant to quantum computation and are used to predict the existence of new types of such phases, their behavior, and their physical realization. This project is motivated by these connections and deals with algebraic aspects of the theory of (higher) tensor categories: their structure, classification, and arithmetic properties. The emphasis is on categories that are most widely used in applications. Such categories admit an additional symmetry constraint called braiding that is used to model the interaction of quantum particles. Student recruitment and training are essential components of the proposed research activity.<br/><br/>This project will address fundamental questions concerning the structure and classification of braided tensor categories and 2-categories. Categorical techniques will be employed to interpret and solve algebraic problems. Previously developed tools such as categorical Witt and Picard groups will be generalized and combined into higher-categorical groups, providing a useful homotopy-theoretic machinery. The concrete research problems include the following: (1) classification of braided fusion 2-categories and description of their Witt invariants, (2) computation of groups of minimal extensions corresponding to symmetry-protected topological phases of matter, (3) study of Hecke algebras associated with fusion categories and their integral forms, (4) classification of  fiber functors on non-degenerate braided fusion categories using a categorical analog of Belavin-Drinfeld triples, and (5) classification of non-semisimple pointed braided tensor categories.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups are fundamental objects in mathematics and ubiquitous in real life; for example, the numbers on a 12-hour clock form a group of 12 elements. The addressed problems are of combinatorial nature; for example, if we take any subset of a group, then as long as the subset is ''large'' in some sense (without any assumption on its structure), we predict that some pattern will emerge. Graduate students will be trained as part of this proposal. The PI will also be involved in K-12 outreach.<br/><br/>The groups studied in this project are: (1) The integers and their polynomial ring analogs, for which techniques from number theory apply, (2) finite groups, including vector spaces over finite fields, for which techniques from algebra apply, and (3) more general amenable groups, for which techniques from Fourier analysis and ergodic theory apply. Problems studied in this proposal include the following: If a subset A of a group G is large in some sense (e.g. A has positive density, or comes from a finite partition of G), then can one find structures in sumsets such as A-A and A+A-A? This question is intimately related to various notions of recurrence in ergodic theory and topological dynamics. If A is a sparse set, e.g. a subset of the primes, then this question will lead to patterns hitherto unexplored in the primes.

Algebraic curves are one-dimensional sets of points that can be described by polynomial equations. For example, the unit circle in the plane x^2 + y^2 = 1 defines an algebraic curve. A ubiquitous problem in the theory of algebraic curves is to understand how many algebraic curves there are satisfying a given list of conditions. This information corresponds to the so-called ""intersection theory of their moduli space"": a moduli space of curves is a space whose points correspond to algebraic curves, and its intersection theory describes how various loci in this space can meet (which corresponds to various conditions on the algebraic curve being satisfied simultaneously). The Chow ring of the moduli space packages this information of intersection theory into an algebraic structure. This summer school will introduce graduate students and postdocs to recent developments in computing Chow rings through four mini-courses, afternoon exercise sessions, and research groups. Students will participate in exercise sessions to reinforce the material from the mini-courses. They will also work in research groups to apply these techniques to compute new examples of Chow rings (both integral and rational) of moduli spaces of curves.<br/><br/>More specifically, the four mini-courses will be on the following topics: (1) Equivariant intersection theory: this describes how intersection theory behaves in the presence of a group action; (2) Higher Chow groups: these invariants capture the failure of exactness of excision sequences of Chow rings; (3) The tautological ring of the moduli space of stable pointed curves: this describes a well-behaved subring of the Chow ring; and (4) Patching techniques and the integral Chow ring of the moduli of 2-pointed genus 1 curves: often enlarging moduli spaces to include curves with worse singularities can enable patching togetherinformation about Chow rings of strata to the Chow ring of the entire moduli space. https://sites.google.com/site/agneshomepage/brown-2023-agnes-summer-school<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Representation theory is the study of symmetries of a vector space such as a three-dimensional Euclidean space (or more generally, an infinite dimensional space) endowed with additional important structures. Such symmetries often arise in families encoded by algebraic objects like groups, Lie algebras, or algebras. One important class of algebras that arise in this way is the class of so-called affinized quantum groups. These algebras have been inspiring active research and interactions between mathematics and physics since the 1980s. The main goals of this project are to resolve important questions intrinsic to the affine nature of affinized quantum groups. The project will enhance our understanding of their internal algebraic structures and establish novel connections to the above fields. In addition, the project will have an educational impact through the training and mentoring of students at various levels from high school to graduate school. <br/><br/>In more detail, the project will develop new methods in the study of quantum loop groups with applications to geometric representation theory, integrable systems, mathematical physics, and quantum cluster algebras. Building on recent results, the PI will pursue research in five related areas, with specific goals in each. These research areas are unified by the general notion of duality and the use of the ""shuffle algebra approach."" The rough plan is as follows: 1. Develop key  structures of quantum affine and toroidal algebras; 2. Continue the study of quantized Coulomb branches; 3. Continue work on integrable spin chains; 4. Develop a new approach to finite quantum groups and their integral forms that allows for arbitrary roots of unity, as well as a modular theory, thus generalizing and unifying the classical work of DeConcini-Kac-Procesi; and 5. Provide a rigorous mathematical formulation and proof of the BPS/CFT correspondence for A(n)-type quiver gauge theories in string theory, generalizing the known results for the A(1)-quiver.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Group theory is motivated by the study of symmetries of objects found in many areas of science, art, and technology, from molecular structures, to the spin of particles, to the patterns in cryptosystems, to the structure of musical chords. Number theory is motivated by the study of the integers, prime numbers, integer-valued functions, and generalizations of these objects, and has applications to the same areas as group theory.

The main subject of exploration is homology, which can be thought of as the study of (dis)similarities. Despite being regarded as an abstract mathematical tool, homology has found many applications in recent years, particularly to data analysis and computer science. In algebra, homology refers to a way of measuring the difference between an implicitly defined set of objects (cycles) and an explicitly defined subset (of boundaries). In geometry, it is a tool used to distinguish between different shapes. The homology attached to an object usually focuses on the most significant traits, and it reflects its symmetries in intriguing ways. The PI will investigate homological theories associated to flag varieties, which are geometric objects parametrizing increasing sequences of subspaces of linear spaces, such as a point contained in a line contained in a plane. The symmetry comes from moving the linear spaces around while preserving their containment relations. The homological theories considered depend on a prime number p=2,3,5,7,11 etc., and the goal is to understand how the resulting homology depends on p, and how it encodes the symmetries of the flag varieties. This can then be further applied to study algebro-geometric objects of interest, such as matrices and higher-dimensional tensors. The proposed research is suitable for engaging students in research, as well as for computer experimentation and software development.<br/><br/>A fundamental question at the confluence of commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and representation theory is to describe the cohomology of line bundles on flag varieties. A well-known case is that of the projective space, where it is equivalent to computing local cohomology for a polynomial ring with support in the ideal of the variables. Other examples include Grassmannians, complete flag varieties, or the incidence correspondence. For flag varieties over a field of characteristic zero the cohomology is computed by the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem, but the positive characteristic problem remains wide open. The PI's goal is a systematic study of this question, with an emphasis on concrete examples, and on showcasing peculiar interactions between algebra, geometry, and symmetry. The PI plans to use the newly acquired knowledge to solve questions of a homological nature regarding fundamental objects such as matrix determinantal varieties and analogues for higher tensors, equations and syzygies, or Koszul modules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The singular or non-smooth points of an algebraic variety have rich algebraic and geometric structures, and detailing their properties is crucial in many investigations. For example, the parabola is nonsingular (meaning that locally it looks like a line), while the curve defined by y^2=x^3 is nonsingular except at the origin, where it locally looks like a cusp. The projects that will be explored are focused on the singular points of algebraic varieties (i.e., singularities), with a focus on measuring singularities using various algebraic techniques. The PI will involve his graduate students and post-docs in this research project.<br/><br/>The PI will construct a mixed characteristic singularity theory in collaboration with other experts in this area.

In the past century, giant leaps of understanding have been made by exploring the analogy between number fields and function fields in positive characteristic.  In this latter setting, arithmetic becomes geometry and vice versa, allowing the techniques, tools, and intuitions from one to be applied with great effect to the other, leading to new and important insights, results, and conjectures. The research of the PI will continue and develop this tradition in new directions.  Additionally, the PI will leverage his administrative role as Associate Head for Undergraduate Programs at the University of Arizona to collect and analyze data on student challenges, and devise strategies to increase student success in the mathematical sciences.  <br/><br/>The project will continue to develop a new analogue of Iwasawa theory for function fields by investigating the structure and growth of the p-divisible groups of the Jacobians associated to a pro-p branched Galois tower of curves over a finite field of characteristic p.  These p-divisible groups break up into three pieces: an etale part, a multiplicative part, and a local-local part.  In previous work, the PI proved under very general hypotheses that the etale and multiplicative parts exhibit regular and predictable behavior in any such tower. While the local-local part can in many ways be as wild as the imagination allows, the PI and his collaborators have recently formulated several conjectures which posit striking regularity and predictability, and have proved some fundamental instances of these conjectures by leveraging ideas and tools from Dwork theory.  The project will continue this research by adapting these methods to handle more general situations, aiming to prove the conjectures in full.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this seemingly elementary premise, number theory has been at the the forefront of some of the most intricate structures discovered in mathematics, as well as underlying key practical applications (such as public key cryptography, which powers current secure communications over the internet). One fundamental idea of modern number theory is that collections of numbers sharing some common feature (such as being solutions of some list of equations) possess interesting emergent properties and symmetries. The most primordial of such emergent symmetry is the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers, and a large swath of number theory in the last few centuries concerns probing its (complicated) internal structure. In the 1970s, Langlands made a web of surprising predictions that this absolute Galois group is related to the (continuous) symmetry of vibrations on some highly symmetric geometric shapes (the automorphic representations). Such conjectures are known to have far reaching consequences: for instance, a proven special case was at the heart of the resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem. One promising approach to Langlands Conjectures that crystallized over the last few decades is the method of p-adic deformation, where one organizes the information on the two sides of the conjecture according to divisibility by powers of a given prime number p. The key point whose importance has only come into focus very recently is that this process reveals macroscopic/geometric features which make it easier to match the two sides, and the project aims to study exactly those features. Belonging to an emerging research direction, the project is a fertile ground for the discovery of and experimentation with new concrete phenomena, and thus create excellent opportunities for the training of students at both the graduate and undergraduate level. The PI also plans to disseminate the new geometric perspectives in the Langlands program to a broader audience through organizing summer schools and mini-courses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>More specifically, the project studies the geometry of the moduli stack of representations of the Galois groups of p-adic fields, with focus on loci cut out by p-adic Hodge-theoretic conditions. These recently constructed spaces are expected to play a pivotal role in the nascent categorical p-adic Langlands program, which seeks to promote the (conjectural) relationship between individual smooth representations of p-adic Lie groups and individual local p-adic Galois representations to a relationship between the entire categories of such objects. The project aims to establish a bridge between these two categories, by relating both to categories of sheaves on some intermediate objects, moduli spaces of (semi-)linear algebraic objects, which are susceptible to analysis via methods of geometric representation theory. A sufficiently strong control on the geometry would lead to major progress on local questions such as the Breuil-Mezard conjecture as well as global questions such as Serre weight conjectures, automorphy lifting and the structure of mod p cohomology of locally symmetric spaces. The flow of information can also be reversed, namely one can predict new phenomena in geometric representation theory from arguments and heuristics with Galois representations. Furthermore, these linear algebraic moduli spaces are sufficiently concrete that one can experiment on them with computer algebra software, leading to many theoretical and computational projects accessible to undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One relevant geometric fact in this setting is that the red dots (and equally so the blue dots) can be rearranged in whatever order you like without ever breaking the no-collisions rule; this would not, for instance, be true if the red and blue dots were located on a line instead of on a sphere.  In a non-technical setting it isn?t easy to say why this has anything to do with the likelihood of two numbers having a prime factor in common; suffice it to say that this passage between contexts has consistently generated new ideas in both number theory and geometry, and is a central theme of the PI?s proposed research.  Beyond that, the PI has several projects at the interface of geometry and machine learning -- for example, can we use the kind of techniques that enable machines to play very strong chess and Go to find large configurations of points in in a grid such that no three form an isosceles triangle?  This is a toy problem but the techniques we develop will tell us a lot about the prospects for accelerating progress in pure mathematics using machine learning techniques.  The PI?s research is closely entwined with his work in outreach to the community outside academic mathematics, which includes a best-selling book on geometry published in 2021;  during the funding period he will continue developing programs to train early-career scientists in writing for the public. This award will also support graduate student research. <br/><br/>The proposed research covers a range of problems at the interface of number theory, algebraic topology, and algebraic topology.  One main goal will be exploiting the techniques developed in PI?s collaboration with Tran and Westerland to prove upper bounds (and in some cases lower bounds) for Malle?s conjecture over function fields, an old problem which in the number field case remains almost entirely inaccessible.  The new techniques suggest an interesting role for perverse sheaves in arithmetic statistics, will the PI will explore over the granting period. The PI also proposes a range of projects in arithmetic geometry, including:  new directions in ?twisted? arithmetic statistics (for instance: how many cubic extensions of F_q(t) are there with prime conductor?) and computational and theoretical work on the variation of the Ceresa class in families of algebraic curves,  The PI will also continue collaborative work with researchers in industry on the development of machine learning techniques adapted to enable progress in pure mathematics, especially extremal combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It originated from theoretical physics, and generated great impact on various areas of mathematics, in particular differential geometry and algebraic geometry. The objects of study are geometric shapes called Calabi-Yau manifolds that appear naturally in different contexts of mathematics and physics. Mirror symmetry predicts that given any Calabi-Yau manifold, there exists a mirror manifold, such that an ever-growing list of geometric relations hold between the two, involving deep and elaborate invariants that are otherwise unrelated. Despite the continual progress in the subject, both the full extent of existence of mirror manifolds and the underlying mathematical mechanism of mirror symmetry remain unsolved today. This project brings a new approach to the study of mirror symmetry, based on latest developments from non-archimedean geometry. The goal is to conceive and pursue a full-fledged theory of non-archimedean mirror symmetry, which will lead to new results unattainable from existing methods, as well as applications beyond the current scope. This award will also support graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The mirror existence problem will be studied via the enumeration of analytic curves with boundaries in non-archimedean SYZ torus fibrations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. New constructions of such fibrations will be explored using non-archimedean Monge-Ampère equations in addition to the minimal model program. An analog of the Gromov compactness theorem for non-archimedean curves with boundaries needs to be established, based on generalized tail conditions, which depend on novel analytic surgeries of the target spaces. The construction of virtual fundamental classes for the curve counts will rely on our previous works on derived non-archimedean geometry. PI will prove various properties of the mirror algebra obtained from the curve counts, including associativity, radius of convergence and singularity estimates. The local mirror algebras are expected to glue together to form the global mirror variety using wall-crossing formulas. A long-term goal is to show that the mirror construction is an involution, the best exhibition of mirror duality. PI also aims for applications outside mirror symmetry, in particular towards cluster algebras in representation theory and the moduli of KSBA stable pairs in birational geometry. PI expects fruitful future interactions with the Gross-Siebert program based on logarithmic geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For systems that evolve with time, one aims to determine which perturbations will preserve the system?s long-term behavior and which perturbations will lead to radically different outcomes. This project concerns stability and bifurcations in the setting of complex algebraic dynamical systems. Such systems are defined by polynomial formulas in one or several variables. The algebraic nature of the defining equations connect the dynamical study with the rich theory of algebraic geometry. Moreover, in the case of examples where all of the defining polynomials have, for example, integer coefficients, the relevant dynamical stability questions have surprising connections to number theory and to the Diophantine geometry of the underlying equations. The project will extend the theory of dynamical stability for complex analytic examples to new settings that arise naturally in arithmetic geometry and complex dynamics. The project also provides research and training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>This project develops the theory of stability for analytic families of maps on projective spaces, in both a complex analytic setting and in the setting of non-archimedean-valued fields and p-adic analysis. It was recently discovered, in earlier work of the PI and of other researchers, that certain questions about height functions and arithmetic intersection theory can be analyzed using complex dynamics. In a series of recent breakthroughs in arithmetic geometry, especially concerning uniform bounds for numbers of rational points on families of algebraic varieties, stability theory played a crucial--if somewhat hidden--role. This project aims to shed new light on the role of stability theory and to push the theory further. Many of the proposed problems and applications of the theory are related to the occurrence of `unlikely intersections? in families of abelian varieties or in more general families of polarized dynamical systems. Specific goals of this project include (1) to characterize positivity properties of certain bifurcation currents and measures; (2) to provide bounds on the geometry of invariant subvarieties for algebraic dynamical systems; and (3) to formulate a theory of bifurcations in the setting of p-adic analytic families of maps.

They appear naturally in different fields of science and engineering, including physics, cryptography, control theory, robotics, computer vision, etc,. A fundamental problem in geometry is the classification of algebraic varieties, as it helps us gain a better understanding of the structures and relations between them. The first step in classification is called birational classification, i.e. two algebraic varieties are called birational if they are equal outside some lower-dimensional loci. In this proposal, the PIs will investigate new birational invariants. These invariants will shed new light on the birational classification problem. The Principal Investigators will bring new ideas from differential equations, category theory, mirror symmetry and conformal field theory for achieving this goal. This project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students and early-career researchers.<br/><br/>More concretely, the Principal Investigators will develop an extended theory of variations of non-commutative Hodge structures. It will be based on a new singularity theory of Landau-Ginzburg models and a non-commutative refinement of the notion of spectrum of quantum multiplication operators. These new non-commutative spectra will provide natural obstructions to rationality and equivariant rationality of Fano varieties. Additionally the PIs will investigate the connection between non-commutative spectra and R-charges of conformal field theories. This will lead to even stronger birational invariants, as well as to new unexpected bridges between geometry and other branches of mathematics, including: a new connection between Steenbrink spectra and the spectra of conformal weights in vertex operator algebras; a connection between topological invariants of 3-manifolds and non-commutative spectra of complex surfaces; semicontinuity of non-commutative spectra of algebraic varieties and the RG-flows on sigma-models with targets on such varieties; and a relation between the Kaehler-Ricci flow and the RG-flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the professional development opportunities offered by the conference are compelling for US-based participants as well, and funding from this grant will be used to enable junior researchers at US institutions to participate in the conference.<br/><br/>GaEL XXX will bring together many leading experts on range of topics within Algebraic Geometry, providing an excellent opportunity for junior mathematicians to learn about major new developments.<br/>The conference includes 3 senior speakers each giving 4 hour mini-courses, as well as a range of opportunities (short talks and poster sessions) for junior participants to present their own research in front of an international audience. The mini-courses are an opportunity to learn about cutting edge results and techniques, and they cover 3 distinct areas of algebraic geometry:  Mori Dream Spaces and quiver GIT; Specialization techniques in the study of curves; and Kawamata log terminal singularities. This conference is an excellent career opportunity for junior mathematicians entering algebraic geometry, due to the exposition on cutting-edge research and the new professional connections that are often made at the poster session and various social events.

The Southeast Lie Theory Consortium and Workshop Series will continue to stimulate and enhance regional research collaboration in Lie theory and representation theory in the Southeastern United State. Featured expository talks at the workshops by leading researchers will provide an avenue for graduate students and early-career researchers to enhance their research programs. The opportunities for mathematical interactions and mentorship during the conferences will foster a strong regional tradition of research and education.   <br/><br/>The proposed workshops are broadly concerned with the representation theory of Lie algebras, quantum groups, and related algebraic structures.  These topics have numerous connections to theoretical physics, number theory, algebraic geometry, and other disciplines.  Research in these fields involves the study of a broad range of algebraic, combinatorial, or categorical objects, a sampling of which includes: quantized enveloping algebras, quantum function algebras, Kac--Moody Lie algebras, Hecke algebras, canonical bases and crystal bases, vertex operator algebras, Hall algebras, quivers, cluster algebras, Hopf algebras, and Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras. In general, the representation theory of quantized Kac--Moody Lie algebras and its accompanying categorical and geometric developments has taken on a significant  role not only within Lie theory but also in other areas of mathematics and physics such as combinatorics, group theory, number theory, integrable systems, low-dimensional topology and conformal field theory.

Resolution refers to the replacement of singular algebraic varieties with smooth models by repeated blowings up. Semistable reduction is the closely related process of finding mildly singular limits of degenerating families of algebraic varieties. These are fundamental tools for constructing birational models and boundary limits in moduli spaces. New tools like algebraic stacks, non-archimedean geometry, logarithmic geometry, and tropical geometry are driving progress on these questions. Novel, stronger forms of resolution and semistable reduction are appearing, even as the proofs of existing results become simpler. These developments offer a deeper understanding of long-standing arithmetic problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since ancient times, people have been interested in integer solutions to equations, called Diophantine equations; the Pythagorean equation, the Pell equation, and Fermat's Last Theorem are well-known problems of this type. In modern times, research has focused on general techniques for this sort of problem. A breakthrough result, proven by Faltings, shows that certain types of equations have only finitely many integer solutions. However, there is no known algorithm to find these solutions in general; algorithmic approaches to Diophantine equations are an active area of research. Surprisingly, this problem relates to many other areas in math, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, Galois theory, and more. In order to compute solutions to Diophantine problems, we need to develop methods to perform some calculations in these other fields.  This project involves studying several of these difficult computational problems.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate various computational and algorithmic topics related to finiteness theorems in number theory. For example, a theorem of Faltings guarantees a polynomial equation of a certain type can have only finitely many rational solutions. (In geometric language, a curve of genus at least two can have only finitely many rational points.) All known proofs of Faltings's theorem are ineffective: one knows that the solutions are finite in number, but the proof provides no way to tell whether one has found them all. Recent work, including a new proof of Faltings's theorem by the PI and Venkatesh, has opened up promising new avenues toward an algorithmic solution. The PI will study algorithmic and computational questions in algebraic geometry and number theory, motivated by Faltings's theorem and other problems in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. The PI hopes to study algorithmic approaches to the Shafarevich conjecture (determining abelian varieties over a fixed number field, with good reduction away from a fixed finite set of bad primes) and the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence (finding algebraic differential equations with given monodromy representations).  The Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, in turn, should be applicable to the problem of finding branched covers of curves, as well as the problem of studying variations of Hodge structure over a given base. Both these problems relate to Faltings's theorem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental question, for example, is how many whole number solutions does a particular system of equations have? This is often a very difficult question and engages with techniques from a wide variety of different areas of mathematics. Galois theory, introduced in the 19th century, studies groups of symmetries of polynomial equations and is central to modern number theory. In the 1970s, Langlands introduced a far-reaching web of conjectures which connects Galois symmetries with other symmetric structures appearing in analysis (modular forms). Building bridges between the arithmetic world (Galois theory) and the complex analytic world following Langlands conjectural framework has been a formidable task and a driving force in modern number theory. This project aims to prove new instances of Langlands? conjectures. This project will open up and engage a number of new questions and concrete problems that will provide research opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. The project will also provide mentoring and online training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, a major breakthrough in the Langlands program was the proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem which was accomplished by proving a two-dimensional conjecture connecting arithmetic objects (elliptic curves) to analytic objects (modular forms). A key idea in the proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem and in many other important results is the study of congruences modulo a prime p between modular forms. This proposal will systematically construct congruences in higher dimensions by connecting them to new geometric structures in Galois theory. This circle of ideas led to the resolution of Serre?s conjecture for modular forms in the early 2000s, another major achievement in the progression of the Langlands program. The weight part of Serre?s conjecture, which classifies congruences between modular forms, has been generalized in a number of directions as part of the growing field of the p-adic Langlands program. This project will resolve major gaps in progress on these generalizations including the lack of a conjecture for wildly ramified representations and the branching problem for potentially crystalline deformation rings in dimension greater than three. The project will also prove new modularity lifting theorems by studying the geometry of moduli spaces of Galois representations in intermediate weight.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
