The principal techniques involved in this research are those coming from the theories of motivic integration and singularities of pairs. First, de Fernex proposes to further develop the theory of motivic integration, and to extend the results of a recent article on stringy Chern classes of singular varieties that he coauthored with Lupercio, Nevins and Uribe. Portion of this project stems from a nice interpretation of this results in the context of Deligne-Mumford stacks. Another portion of this project addresses the formulation of a theory of motivic integration involving derived categories and perverse sheaves; one of the aims in mind is the unification of the theories of stringy Chern classes and elliptic genera of singular varieties. A second collection of projects addresses the study of the birational geometry of Fano varieties and Mori fiber spaces, and particular attention is devoted to questions regarding nonrationality and birational rigidity of these varieties. Two more projects are proposed by de Fernex. One of these deals with a characterization of ampleness of line bundles via asymptotic cohomological vanishings, and is joint work with K\""uronya and Lazarsfeld. The other project addresses the question of extendibility, to a given ambient variety, of rational fibrations defined on subvarieties with ample normal bundle; this is in collaboration with Beltrametti and Lanteri.<br/><br/>The first main project proposed here is based on a fundamental theorem in algebraic geometry, Hironaka's ``resolution of singularities'', which in its simplest form states that every<br/>singular complex algebraic variety can be modified into a manifold without altering the locus where it is already nonsingular. The fact that associated to any singular variety there exists a<br/>nonsingular one which looks ``almost the same'' suggests the idea that one should be able to extend topological invariants from manifolds to singular varieties by just looking at the varieties after resolving their singularities. However the resolution of singularities is typically not unique, so one needs to proceed cautiously; it is at this point that motivic integration comes into play: essentially, it is the technical tool used here to ensure that things, if defined suitably, do not depend on the<br/>chosen resolution. Hironaka's theorem is also crucial in the study of the birational properties of algebraic varieties and, in particular, it is used in the part of the proposed research dealing with questions concerning their nonrationality and birational rigidity. Modern techniques, based on a delicate analysis of singularities through their resolutions and accurate quantitative estimates of their nastiness, are here employed to address these questions, some of which are in fact quite classical and still open.<br/>"

The first concerns Schubert calculus, <br/>a boolean lattice's worth of problems whose minimal element is the (now <br/>extremely well-understood) intersection theory on Grassmannians. Its <br/>extensions include equivariant intersection theory (recently solved by Knutson <br/>and T. Tao), K-theory (recently solved by A. Buch), quantum cohomology (unsolved, but a very solid conjecture exists), replacing the Grassmannian by larger flag manifolds, and analogues for arbitrary Lie groups (for these last two almost nothing is known). Since the submission of the proposal, much progress has been made (by Knutson and R. Vakil) towards one more level in this lattice, the equivariant K-theory of Grassmannians, but all other combinations remain. The second part is a generalization of Littelmann's path model in representation theory, which one should regard in this context as providing a flat degeneration of the flag manifold to a union of toric varieties. In the generalization, the only property used of the flag manifold is that it carries an action of the circle  with isolated fixed points. Many other varieties should thus have a ""path model"" for their coordinate ring, such as toric varieties (a testbed, where the theory is rather trivial), wonderful compactifications, and Hilbert schemes. As an example application, this would provide a ppositive formula for Haiman's generalization of the (q,t)-Catalan numbers (where positivity is known for vanishing-cohomology reasons, but there is no formula).<br/><br/>The first of Dr. Knutson's two projects concerns a 19th-century intrusion<br/>of combinatorics into algebraic geometry: counting the number of lines (or <br/>planes, or chains consisting of a point inside a line inside a plane etc.)<br/>satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions. The first interesting <br/>such question is ``Given four generic lines in space, how many other lines touch <br/>all four?'' (The answer is 2.) There are many generalizations of this problem; <br/>one of the newest and most exciting is quantum intersection theory, in which there may be no single solution to all the conditions, but rather the solution may ""quantum tunnel"" between the requirements, while paying a well-defined ""penalty.""(In physical terms, this penalty means the occurrence is impossible classically, but in the quantum world is only very rare.) There already exist formulae to solve any one of this huge family of problems, but they are extremely unsatisfying, as they determine the count by adding and subtracting many numbers. Such cancelative formulae are essentially useless for proving that a general class of intersection problems has an answer, and moreover they are computationally very inefficient. Dr. Knutson and his collaborators have provided noncancelative formulae for some of these generalizations, and have conjectures about others. His other project is not directly related, though it also uses combinatorics to control algebraic geometry, building on work of P. Littelmann. Littelmann showed how to use the very great symmetry of certain algebraic spaces, such as the set of all k-planes in n-space, to compute the space of functions on them in terms of lattice points inside a union of large-dimensional tetrahedra. This second proposal is based on recent work of Dr. Knutson's indicating that this large degree of symmetry is unnecessary -- a single circular symmetry, plus a technical (but common and easily checked) condition, seem to be enough to be able to make use of this lattice-point machinery. Such algebraic spaces with symmetry are endemic in mathematics and physics.<br/>"

In turn, group theory has benefited tremendously from its connections with other areas.

The problem of approximating the circumference of a graph is NP-hard. For most canonical NP-hard problems, either dramatically improved approximation algorithms have been devised, or strong negative results have been established, leading to a substantially improved understanding of the approximability of these problems. However, the longest cycle problem, finding the longest cycles in a graph, has resisted all attempts at devising either positive or negative results. One feasible way to study the longest cycle problem is to consider some special classes of graphs.  Under this award, the PI will investigate the longest cycle problem for the following classes of graphs: Planar graphs and graphs embeddable on certain surfaces, graphs with certain forbidden minors, graphs with bounded degrees, and graphs with large degrees. Each of these four classes of graphs plays an important role in the study of graph theory. The PI and his collaborators have successfully solved a few conjectures in the areas and made significant progresses towards solving some problems in this area. He plans to work on problems surrounding a few long-standing conjectures in the area and hopes his experience will help him to solve some of the conjectures. The second component of this proposal is finding ""dense"" subgraphs and partitioning a graph into ""dense"" subgraphs. In studying web graph, experiments suggest that dense substructures correspond communities on the web, i.e. collections of web pages related to the same topic. The problem of finding dense subgraphs has received a lot attention recently. However, the PI's  motivation of finding small dense subgraphs arises from two practical bioinformatics problems: Design of calcium-binding sites in proteins and Modeling the Protein Structure and Conformation Changes. <br/><br/> This proposed research lies in graph theory and its applications. The PI hopes the results from the first part of the project will provide a better understanding of NP-hard problems, which is one of few fundamental problems in computer science.  Protein functions are associated with their structures and the cofactors, such as the metal-binding. In addition to deepening understanding the biology mechanism, detecting metal-binding sites  benefits the protein design, and thereafter, protein-based drug development, biosensor, and more.<br/>"

In this geometric harmonic analysis, function spaces are replaced with categories of sheaves, and the spectral theory of operators on these sheaves is analyzed using geometric Fourier transforms.  The investigator is developing applications of these cutting edge ideas to classical questions in representation theory. In particular, in collaboration with D. Nadler, he proposes an enhancement of the geometric Langlands program which performs a spectral decomposition of the categories of representations of real Lie groups. This significantly enhances the Langlands classification of irreducible representations (part of the classical Langlands program) and binds it to the geometric (Borel-Weil) realizations of representations.  The investigator also spearheads efforts to make this material available to a far broader audience, in particular through the organization of GRASP (Geometry Representations and Some Physics), electronically distributed expository lecture series on the fundamental ideas and underlying currents in this rapidly developing area.<br/><br/>A fundamental theme of modern mathematics is the exploitation of symmetry as an organizing principle, linking diverse and potentially baffling phenomena in an elegant overarching framework. Perhaps the prime example of this trend is the Langlands program, which identifies a general pattern in the appearance of symmetry in algebra and number theory, and counts among its successes the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem. In recent years, a new geometric setting for the application<br/>of the Langlands philosophy has emerged, which makes contact with new symmetry principles, in particular those underlying the exciting developments of string theory in physics.  My CAREER proposal is aimed at advancing this geometric Langlands program in two ways.  First, the GRASP (Geometry Representations And Some Physics) program will provide an electronic resource center for students interested in this exciting and varied but potentially intimidating and inaccessible area. At the center of GRASP is a series of expository lectures introducing the fundamental concepts underlying and relating to the Langlands program to a wide audience, via the web. In parallel, the research component of the proposal develops a novel program to apply the cutting edge geometric Langlands technology to more classical problems in algebra. In particular I expect these ideas to have a significant impact on the classification of symmetries arising in linear algebra with real numbers, a question with a distinguished history and origins in quantum mechanics.<br/>"

In a baby sisterof this  project, Pevtsova and Witherspoon propose to develop a new description of the rank variety for a class of local algebras over fields of characteristic zero, and define rank varieties for certain non-cocommutative Hopf algebras, identifying the new varieties with the existing geometric constructions which use Hochschild cohomology. In a third project, Pevtsova proposes to establish a geometric correspondence between certain triangulated module categories associated to reduced enveloping <br/>algebras of a Lie algebra.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The proposed research begins with the philosophy of understanding a difficult, complicated algebraic structure by studying a family of simple structures embedded in the original. The simple objects are well understood so that the challenge is to combine this understanding to gain some information about the original, difficult structure. This idea is applied to the study of formal algebraic objects arising as symmetries of familiar structures. In the process, the interplay of two different mathematical fields, geometry and algebra, is used extensively, revealing beautiful connections and enabling applications to both areas. A second aspect of this proposal includes the mentoring of female undergraduate students, participation in a popular mathematical program for advanced high school students, and the editing of a special volume of amathematical journal.<br/><br/>"

The first project concerns<br/>modular forms for noncongruence groups and their connections to forms<br/>for congruence groups. The arithmetic of the forms for noncongruence groups <br/>is little understood. Based on their numerical data, Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer<br/> (ASD) suggest very interesting congruence relations  to be satisfied by a basis of cusp forms for a noncongruence group. A recent joint work by the PI,<br/>Long and Yang gives the first two-dimensional example establishing the ASD<br/>congruence relations between forms for noncongruence and congruence groups. <br/>To move forward, the PI plans to systematically study the structure of the <br/>cusp forms for noncongruence groups, to explore their relationship<br/>with forms for congruence groups, and to tackle the conjecture that   <br/>algebraic cusp forms genuinely living on noncongruence groups are distinguished<br/>by their Fourier coefficients having unbounded denominators. The second is on <br/>the interplay between automorphic forms and Ramanujan hypergraphs, and <br/>connections between hypergraphs and LDPC codes.  Ramanujan hypergraphs are <br/>higher dimensional analogue of Ramanujan graphs, which are known to have broad <br/>applications. The PI proposes to study whether the rich interplay between <br/>combinatorics and number theory, which exists for Ramanujan graphs, extends to <br/>Ramanujan hypergraphs. On the applied side, the PI plans to construct good <br/>LDPC codes using Ramanujan hypergraphs, and to generalize her joint work with <br/>Koetter, Vontobel, and Walker on  characterizing pseudo-codewords for LDPC <br/>codes from attached to graphs to attached to hypergraphs.<br/><br/>It has been the PI's long term research goal to do fundamental research in <br/>number theory and to seek applications of number theory to graph theory and <br/>coding theory, especially to solve real world problems. The study of interplay <br/>between these areas has turned out to be quite fruitful. The PI has applied <br/>deep results in number theory to construct efficient communication networks; <br/>and conversely, investigations in graph theory inspired very interesting <br/>and unexpected results in number theory. This proposal is a continuation of<br/> the PI's effort to pursue the same general theme. The first<br/>project of the proposal lies in basic research, to understand the arithmetics<br/>of modular forms for noncongruence subgroups. The second project is to explore <br/> the interplay in arithmetic and connections between automorphic forms and <br/>Ramanujan hypergraphs, extending PI's previous success on Ramanujan graphs.  <br/>A potential application is to LDPC codes. The very efficient encoding and <br/>decoding algorithms for LDPC codes together with their extensive <br/>applications make them very hot research topic in coding theory. A primary <br/>goal of the second project is to construct good LDPC codes using Ramanujan <br/>hypergraphs, and to understand the ""wrongly"" decoded words arising from <br/>the rapid decoding algorithm. A conference is planned in 2007 to disseminate <br/>the results of this proposal.<br/><br/><br/>"

The PI plans to establish the existence of this <br/>and other crossing patterns in drawings of graphs with sufficiently many <br/>edges. Problems of finding good lower bounds on the minimal number of <br/>crossings over all drawings of a fixed graph, as well as the existing <br/>connections with algorithmic questions in computational geometry, will also <br/>be studied. A related investigator's goal is to apply Szemeredi's regularity <br/>lemma in combination with certain tools from real algebraic geometry and <br/>topology to prove the existence of large, complete or empty, bipartite <br/>subgraphs in the intersection graphs of segments, curves, or, in general, <br/>semi-algebraic sets. Another proposed direction of research is Euclidean <br/>Ramsey theory. Questions of the type: ""Does any sufficiently large set of <br/>points in the plane, no three on a line, contain six points forming a convex <br/>hexagon with no other point inside?"", or ""Can one color points of the plane <br/>with six colors so that no two points, unit distance apart, receive the same <br/>color?"", are questions posed many years ago by Erdos and other <br/>pioneers of the field, and despite all the efforts are still open. The author <br/>devises and plans to exploit novel perspectives on these problems, while <br/>introducing certain machinery from matroid and polytope theory, and <br/>commutative algebra. <br/><br/>The main theme of this proposal is to further explore the beauty of Ramsey <br/>theory and combinatorial geometry, especially natural and intuitive questions<br/>that can be easily described in lay terms, but difficult to solve. Fascinating<br/>problems of Erdos-type continue to be a fertile ground for interactions of <br/>various areas of mathematics and provide a theoretical foundation for <br/>combinatorial optimization, VLSI design, robotics, pattern recognition, <br/>tomography and computer graphics. Furthermore, an important aspect of this <br/>proposal is its educational component. Working with an undergraduate <br/>student, the investigator initiates a new discipline of Ramsey theory on <br/>integers, where one is interested in the existence of rainbow arithmetic <br/>structures. Questions considered are of the form: ""Does every 3-coloring <br/>of integers from 1 to 3n, with exactly n red, n blue and n green integers, <br/>contain a rainbow 3-term arithmetic progression?"" The proposed problems are <br/>rainbow analogues of classical van der Waerden-type results in Ramsey theory, <br/>and are well suited for undergraduate research projects.

The first part of the proposal is focused on the vertex<br/>operator algebra structure of a modification of regular representations of affine Lie<br/>algebras.

The author proposes to use the geometric construction<br/>due to Nakajima of representations of affine Lie algebras based on Yang-Mills<br/>instantons on asymptotically locally Euclidean spaces, and also a new geometric<br/>construction related to the first one by the level-rank duality discovered by the<br/>author in the algebraic context in his earlier work. Finally, the third part is dedicated<br/>to a new direction in the representation theory of 3 dimensional convolution<br/>and current algebras presently developed by the author. It is based on a new noncommutative<br/>geometry of quantum Minkowski space-time recently introduced by<br/>Jardim and the author in their study of a noncommutative version of the Yang-<br/>Mills theory. The three parts of the proposal are related to each other in that they<br/>constitute a new program: a representation theoretic approach to 4 dimensional<br/>QFT.

Conversely, numerical techniques have been applied to solve computational problems arising in ""non-traditional"" fields. A good example is the fruitful interaction between computational mathematics and algebraic geometry. Singularity theory, which builds on ideas of algebraic geometry, has been embraced by computational scientists to compute paths of critical points in multi-parameter systems of differential and partial differential equations. Symmetries and group actions are used to create numerical methods for specific types of problems with significantly improved accuracy and stability properties. Techniques in algebraic geometry are also very useful for finding solutions of differential equations on manifolds, and are currently being applied to develop algorithms to compute decompositions of higher order tensors. On the other hand, numerical techniques for continuation, homotopy and symmetry provide the basis for methods in numerical algebraic geometry that are used to compute solution components of systems of polynomial equations. The ability to carry out the numerical decomposition of polynomial systems has yielded applications in mechanical engineering including the understanding and design of mechanisms that transmit, control, or constrain relative motion, robotics, control theory (pole placement), integer programming, and statistics. The development of hybrid exact/approximate methods for finding solutions of polynomial equations gives rise to issues of errors and stability that confront numerical analysts in many other contexts. <br/><br/>The Workshop on geometry and symmetry in numerical computation will bring together experts from computational mathematics and algebraic geometry in order to explore and develop the potential in this rich interdisciplinary area.  The program has been planned specifically to introduce and attract students and young investigators to this area. Each session will begin with an introductory lecture followed by four talks by leading experts. The introductory speakers will prepare a short ""guide"" describing some basic language and results that the audience can use during the invited talks. The one hour lectures themselves will be aimed towards an audience of advanced graduate students and researchers from different areas of mathematics. We expect the Workshop to break down disciplinary barriers and encourage cross-fertilization between researchers from algebraic geometry and numerical analysis. The lectures and discussion sections will encourage students and young researchers to become involved in the intersection of algebraic geometry and numerical analysis, and will provide stimulation and support for those already engaged in this activity. Potential outcomes range from improved methods to compute large complex physical systems governed by systems of partial differential equations, to advances in computational methods for general relativity, to new geometric methods for the analysis of large data sets, and to more efficient numerical methods for robotics and control.<br/>"

In the last 50 years, applications of these<br/>theories have become crucial to cryptography and communications theory.<br/>The Principal Investigator studies delicate questions concerning the fine<br/>structure of sets of solutions to systems of polynomial equations, the<br/>symmetries they exhibit, and their (often surprising) relationship to<br/>various interesting geometric and topological objects.    These<br/>relationships are mediated by how the equations behave with respect to the<br/>various prime numbers.  There are a number of conjectural explanations of<br/>these relationships, and the PI studies them, proving them in certain<br/>""easy"" cases and verifying them by computer in more complicated cases.  He<br/>also investigates phenomena which compare whole families of these<br/>structures with respect to a fixed prime number.<br/>"

Tight closure theory was developed by Hochster and Huneke, and leads to the notion of F-regular rings. This class of rings includes well-studied examples such as determinantal rings and normal monomial rings, but several questions about F-regular rings remain unanswered. The theory of local cohomology has applications to fundamental questions such as determining the minimal number of equations needed to define an algebraic set. Local cohomology modules often have useful finiteness properties, and the investigator proposes to continue his work on Lyubeznik's conjecture, which states that local cohomology modules of regular rings have finitely many associated prime ideals. The work on intersection multiplicities will focus on the recently developed theory of Roberts rings: these rings provide a framework in which intersection multiplicities have several desirable properties. Some of the questions described in the proposal create possibilities for students to be involved in research by performing computer verifications to suggest answers and plausible approaches. The investigator will also be involved in curriculum development in areas related to this proposal, and intends to enhance opportunities for students interested in algebra in the Deep South.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with questions in commutative algebra. This is a field closely related to algebraic geometry: while algebraic geometry focuses on the geometry of solution sets of polynomial equations, in commutative algebra the main objects of study are certain functions on these solution sets. It continues to develop a fascinating interaction with several other branches of mathematics, and is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in engineering, coding theory, cryptography, and other applications of strategic interest. <br/>"

The general<br/>Theory of m-Quasi-invariants  and the Theory of Macdonald Polynomials.<br/>m-Quasi-invariants originally arose in the study of particle dynamics<br/>but have emerged as a truly fascinating Algebraic Combinatorial<br/>subject. For each Coxeter Group G there is an associated one parameter<br/>family of subspaces which interpolates between the ordinary polynomial <br/>ring and the ring of G-invariants. The m-Quasi-Invariants of $G$ are <br/>simply polynomials which, upon the action of the difference operator <br/>corresponding to a reflecting hyperplane of G, they  produce a factor that <br/>is divisible by the equation of the reflecting hyperplane raised to the <br/>power 2m+1. This theory has been extensively developped, from the <br/>algebraic point of view, in fundamental papers by Feigin-Veselov,  and <br/>Felder-Veselov, and  culminated in  certain conjectures  which were proved <br/>by Etingov-Ginsburg in 2002. Jointly with N. Wallach the PI discovered<br/>that  several constructs associated to $m$-quasi-invariants,<br/>such as the associated Baker-Achieser function, encode some truly<br/>remarkable combinatorial properties of the corresponding Coxeter group.<br/>The present project is to explore the theory from the combinatorial<br/>point of view. The early successes obtained in the study of the simplest <br/>cases of the dihedral groups strongly suggest  that such a study should be <br/>conducive to significant discoveries in various areas of Mathematics <br/>ranging from Combinatorics, Representation Theory and the Theory of <br/>special functions.<br/><br/>Since its 1988 discovery, the Macdonald symmetric function basis has<br/>progressively emerged as a central element in the  connection between<br/>Representation Theory and the Theory of Symmetric Functions.<br/>After more than a decade of research in  the Theory of Macdonald <br/>polynomials, the PI,  M.

In particular he has studied the nature of the moduli space M(g) as it changes from being a unirational variety (for small g) to a variety of general type. Recently the investigator has found a series a counterexamples to the Harris-Morrison Slope Conjecture on the cone of effective divisors on M(g). In other works, the investigator has used moduli of curves to prove the Minimal Resolution Conjecture for canonical curves and has studied geometric stratification of moduli spaces of spin curves. This project proposes a new technique of defining intrinsic coordinates on the moduli space of curves that would reduce many problems about linear series or vector bundles over M(g) to combinatorial questions having a toric geometry flavour. In particular, this approach is expected to provide a uniform bound (independent of g) on slopes of effective divisors on M(g), and thus prove a weak version of the Slope Conjecture. This would show that any modular form on the moduli space A(g) of g-dimensional abelian varieties which has sufficiently small slope, vanishes on M(g) which would give a novel solution to the Schottky problem of distinguishing Jacobians among all abelian varieties. In a different direction, the investigator proposes to introduce a new stratification of M(g) defined in terms of syzygies of certain special linear systems of curves. This geometric stratification can be thought of as a<br/>more subtle analogue of the classical stratification of M(g) given by gonality<br/>where the analogue of hyperelliptic curves are sections of K3 surfaces. One application  would be a construction of  a birational model of the moduli space F(g) of polarized K3 surfaces of sectional genus g which could be used to describe the intersection theory of F(g). A different project (joint with S. Grushevsky) involves the study of the linear system of 2-theta functions on the Jacobian of a curve. Using a mixture of algebraic geometry and theta function theory, the investigator hopes to understand the stratification of this linear system given by multiplicities along the higher difference varieties of the curve and relate them to the projective geoemtery of secant varieties of canonical curves.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The guiding problem in algebraic geometry is to classify algebraic varieties up to isomorphism. For varieties of dimension 1 this problem is approached by considering the moduli space M(g) of curves of genus g. This  is the universal parameter space for curves of genus g and M(g) is an algebraic variety of dimension 3g-3. This space is of enormous interest to algebraic geometers and string theorists and the last decade has seen major progress in understanding the geometry of M(g) involving ideas from geometry, number theory and physics.<br/>"

She is interested in the graded-module category viewed as <br/>a geometric space, with certain graded modules playing the role of <br/>geometric objects. The linear geometric modules (point modules, line <br/>modules, etc) are parametrized by so-called linear schemes. Vancliff <br/>plans to study how the structure and role of higher-dimensional linear <br/>schemes generalize the structure and role of point schemes. She intends <br/>to produce algebro-geometric techniques that allow the easy construction <br/>of regular algebras of global dimension four that have finitely many <br/>points and a one-parameter family of line modules; such techniques would <br/>allow researchers in the field to easily create examples on which to <br/>test their conjectures.  An underlying theme of her research is to <br/>classify the line schemes that arise for ""generic"" quadratic regular <br/>algebras of global dimension four.  Vancliff is also interested in <br/>connections between this type of geometry and that of various <br/>Poisson-geometric structures. <br/><br/>Systems of polynomial-style equations and their solutions play a <br/>critical role in almost every scientific field, such as statistical <br/>mechanics, elementary-particle physics, quantum mechanics, robotics, <br/>crystallography, networking, etc. Often, the solutions cannot be found <br/>by experimentation, and often they are not numbers but are functions <br/>(e.g., differential operators or matrices), and so, in general, they do <br/>not commute. The science of seeking methods that find all solutions to <br/>any system of polynomial-style equations in non-commuting variables is <br/>called non-commutative algebra. To find the solutions, the main idea is as <br/>follows. One associates to such a system of equations a certain algebra; <br/>one that encodes all the properties of the original equations. Associated<br/>to this algebra are modules, and these encode all the properties of the <br/>original solutions. Hence, in order to find all the solutions, one should <br/>find all the modules for the associated algebra.  In many of the <br/>applications, the algebras that arise in this way tend to share certain <br/>properties; they are called regular algebras and are the main focus of <br/>Vancliff's projects. One of the goals of non-commutative algebraic geometry,<br/>the subfield in which Vancliff works, is to use geometric techniques to <br/>find certain modules (point modules, line modules, etc) of the regular <br/>algebra, and then to use those modules to find the modules giving the <br/>solutions to the original system of equations. Vancliff's underlying goal <br/>is to improve on these geometric techniques and to understand better how <br/>they relate to the structure of the category of modules.<br/><br/>"

There will be four plenary<br/>speakers: Doron Zeilberger, Joszef Solymosi, Daniel Goldston, and Neil Hindman. <br/>There will also be approximately sixty 20-minute invited talks.<br/><br/>The conference will gather mathematicians, graduate students, undergraduate <br/>students, and others interested in combinatorics<br/>or number theory. It will include student research talks, and promote<br/>interaction among research mathematicians representing the spectrum of<br/>""career stages,"" from the talented undergraduate to  the <br/>internationally distinguished researcher. Various areas of expertise will be <br/>represented from the general area of discrete mathematics. Leading experts will <br/>present their latest work, and there will be much collaboration among <br/>participants. The research areas have many applications, including <br/>cryptography, genetics, neural networks, mathematical biology, radio frequency <br/>assignment for mobile telecommunications, coding theory, sequences for<br/>communications applications, and interconnection networks.<br/>"

Over five days, the conference will cover a broad range of topics in Iwasawa theory with an emphasis towards the main conjecture in its many guises and non-commutative Iwasawa theory.  Iwasawa theory has seen major advances in the last few years (e.g. the Skinner-Urban proof of the cyclotomic main conjecture for modular forms and the Coates, Fukaya, Kato, Sujatha and Venjakob proposal of a non-abelian main conjecture) making it important to have experts come together to discuss these results and make them more widely available to the mathematical community.  A key aspect of the conference will be an emphasis on the future direction of Iwasawa theory.  Indeed, each speaker will be asked to present open questions and conjectures that they feel are important to the development of the field.<br/><br/>Iwasawa theory is a subfield of number theory whose fundamental <br/>questions relate algebraic information (e.g. solutions to polynomial <br/>equations) to analytic information (e.g. values of functions arising <br/>from calculus).  The merging of these two disparate ideas is what makes <br/>Iwasawa theory such a mysterious and powerful field.  One can use <br/>Iwasawa theory to study the arithmetic of a variety of geometric <br/>objects such as elliptic curves.  Since the theory of elliptic curves <br/>has applications to coding theory and cryptography, advances in Iwasawa <br/>theory could lead to advances in these two subjects<br/>"

The first of the three main projects concerns the approximation of <br/>real numbers by rationals, a classical subject of research in number theory.  <br/>Over the past few decades many authors have applied ad hoc methods to <br/>obtain highly nontrivial bounds for the approximation by rationals whose <br/>denominators belong to particular types of sequences, such as the sequence <br/>of prime numbers, or the sequence of squares.  The proposer believes that <br/>results of this type should hold in a much more general context, and he hopes <br/>to prove a universal result for general  sequences that is of nearly the same<br/>quality as the results that have been obtained in the literature for special <br/>sequences.  The second project concerns the distribution of zeros of <br/>L-functions, a vast area of research motivated by the Riemann Hypothesis <br/>and its generalizations.  In particular, the so-called pair-correlation for the <br/>sequence of such zeros has received much attention in recent years because <br/>of surprising connections with phenomena arising in quantum chaos and the <br/>theory of random matrices. The proposer plans to investigate a new type of <br/>pair correlation, in which a second sequence is introduced, in the hope of <br/>obtaining new results by exploiting the added flexibility provided by the <br/>second sequence.  The third project is to apply methods and tools from <br/>number theory to certain problems in mathematical physics, in particular, the<br/>so-called Lorentz gas and the Sinai billiard problem.<br/><br/>This project falls in the area of number theory, one of the oldest subjects of <br/>mathematics which in recent years has received renewed interest due to <br/>newly found applications (e.g., to cryptography and coding theory), <br/>unexpected connections with physics (such as the theory of quantum chaos <br/>and statistical mechanics), and major unsolved problems (such as the <br/>Riemann Hypothesis, one of the seven ""million dollar"" problems in <br/>mathematics). The proposed research is concerned with several problems <br/>that fall at the interface of number theory and mathematical physics and <br/>build upon ongoing work by the proposer and his collaborators.  It is hoped <br/>that deploying the powerful methods and tools of number theory to these <br/>problems will lead toinsights and results that specialists have not been able <br/>to  obtainand which will be of interest to a broad range of researchers,  <br/>both in mathematics and in physics.<br/><br/>"

More specifically, using work of Fisher and <br/>Stephenson as its starting point, it studies the interaction of the holes <br/>when all the leftover portion is tiled, via a certain averaging over all <br/>such possible tilings, called the joint correlation of the holes. In <br/>earlier work, the proposer proved that the case of triangular holes on the <br/>triangular lattice is governed, for large separations between the holes, <br/>by a law closely resembling the superposition principle of electrostatics, <br/>where holes correspond to charges of magnitude equal to the difference <br/>between the number of unit triangles of each orientation they enclose. In <br/>the current project, the proposer presents a program of research problems <br/>that extend his previous work in some new, interrelated directions. One of <br/>these problems concerns generalizing the superposition principle for <br/>correlation to the case when the holes can be arbitrary (not necessarily <br/>connected) unions of lattice triangles of side two. Another problem <br/>considers a finer analysis of the correlation, namely the study of its <br/>variation under small displacements of individual holes. The proposer <br/>conjectures that these finer changes are also governed by a superposition <br/>principle, analogous to the superposition principle for the electric field <br/>in electrostatics. A third problem is concerned with studying boundary <br/>effects. Besides the core research program outlined above, the proposer <br/>also intends to study the symmetry classes of perfect matchings of a <br/>certain family of graphs on the lattice determined by the tiling of the <br/>plane by squares, regular hexagons and regular dodecagons, and determine <br/>to what degree a parallel he found between the perfect matchings of these <br/>graphs and the intensively studied plane partitions extends when <br/>considering the action of symmetry groups.<br/><br/>This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of <br/>Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete <br/>collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems <br/>is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design <br/>of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the <br/>design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of <br/>objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The specific <br/>problems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical <br/>physics.  A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant <br/>to the study of of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid, consisting of <br/>two-atom molecules---the dimers in the model---along the surface of a <br/>crystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two <br/>neighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given <br/>crystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule. The <br/>main issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities <br/>that are studied (speciffically, the number of different ways the surface <br/>of the crystal can be covered by molecules). In some of the instances we <br/>encounter, the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities <br/>exactly turns out to allow progress in the asymptotic study.<br/>"

Among these are the problem of determining the structure of <br/>subsets of finite fields having few arithmetic progressions. For example, suppose <br/>S is a subset of the integers modulo p having about p/2 elements, and having the <br/>least number of three-term arithmetic progressions among all sets with about <br/>p/2 elements.  How many three-term progressions does S have, and what can <br/>one say about the structure of S?  The square dependence problem: pick integers <br/>at random less than x until a subset of these integers products to a square.  <br/>Determine the expected stopping time of this process.  This problem is central to <br/>running time estimates for integer factoring algorithms, problems related to <br/>sum-product estimates in finite fields (given a subset of a finite field, how large <br/>must the sumset or product set of that subset be?), and problems related to the <br/>complexity of inverting certain  number theoretical functions (how difficult is it <br/>to decide whether an integer n is in the image of the Euler phi function?).   The <br/>proposer has already made substantial progress on all of these problems, and <br/>forsees a rich research programme developing in the next several years. <br/> <br/>Two good examples of the research problems on which the proposer plans to work, <br/>both from the same area of mathematics, but of a very different character, are the <br/>square dependence problem and the three-term progression problem:  When one <br/>uses the internet to make purchases, ones credit card information is encrypted <br/>using any of several coding schemes called ``public key encryption''.  There are <br/>methods to break these codes (for, example the quadratic sieve); however, just how <br/>fast they work is not well understood.  A good solution to the square dependence  <br/>problem would give one a very precise estimate for how quickly these methods <br/>work, as well as indicate how one might tweak them to make them run faster.  <br/>The other problem, the three-term progression problem, concerns triples of <br/>numbers which are equally spaced, such 3,5,7 or 11,22,33.  A fundamental, <br/>well-studied problem in combinatorial mathematics is to determine when dense <br/>collections of integers contain such triples;  for example, if you pick 100 numbers <br/>from among the numbers 1 through 1000, must your 100 numbers have one of <br/>these triples?  No one knows exactly what makes certain collections of numbers <br/>have no or few of these triples; however, the proposer has a research plan to <br/>partially answer this question, and already has an accepted publication in a <br/>peer reviewed journal (JCTA) on the problem. <br/><br/>  <br/>"

In the first project, building on his<br/>recent joint work with Persi Diaconis and with Brian Conrey, <br/>the principal investigator will explore connections between the<br/>distribution of the secular coefficients of random matrices, the<br/>conjectures of Conrey, Farmer, Keating, Rubinstein and Snaith<br/>for moments of  L-functions, and some  classical problems in <br/>enumerative combinatorics related to counting  magic squares. <br/>The  second project of the principal investigator is devoted to <br/>studying from a unified point of view one of the main problems in <br/>the theory of expander graphs and one of the basic conjectures in <br/>the theory of quantum chaos. A basic problem in the theory of <br/>expander graphs, formulated by Lubotzky and  Weiss, is to what <br/>extent being an expander family for a family of Cayley graphs is a<br/>property of the groups alone, independent of the choice of generators.<br/>For many natural families of groups, in particular, for special linear<br/>group of order two, numerical experiments indicate that it might<br/>be an expander family for generic choices of generators<br/>(Independence Conjecture). A basic conjecture in Quantum Chaos,<br/>formulated by Bohigas, Giannoni, and Shmit, asserts that the<br/>eigenvalues of a quantized chaotic Hamiltonian behave like the<br/>spectrum of a typical member of the appropriate ensemble of random<br/>matrices. Both conjectures can be viewed as asserting that a<br/>deterministically constructed spectrum generically  behaves like<br/>the spectrum of a large random matrix:  in the bulk  (Quantum<br/>Chaos Conjecture) and at the edge of the spectrum (Independence<br/>Conjecture). The principal investigator will work on proving these<br/>conjectures  in the context of the spectra of elements in group rings.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Random Matrix Theory originated in Wigner's suggestion in the<br/>early fifties that the resonance lines of heavy nuclei might be<br/>modelled by the spectrum of a large random matrix. In the ensuing<br/>fifty years the scope and depth of Random Matrix Theory has<br/>dramatically increased; in the past decade the subject has<br/>undergone explosive growth. The first project of the principal<br/>investigator aims at forging a link between two recent lines of<br/>development in Random Matrix Theory.  One is the discovery and<br/>exploitation of the connections between eigenvalue statistics and<br/>the longest-increasing subsequence problems in enumerative<br/>combinatorics;  another is the outburst of interest in<br/>characteristic polynomials of  random matrices and associated<br/>global statistics, particularly in relation with the moments of<br/>the Riemann zeta function, a function of fundamental importance in<br/>number theory.  The second  project of the principal investigator<br/>is devoted  to studying connections between random matrices and <br/>expander graphs -- highly connected sparse graphs that efficiently<br/>propagate information quickly to many nodes along short paths. Recent<br/>explicit constructions of such graphs have created an explosion of<br/>interest in their potential applications to network design, complexity<br/>theory, coding theory and cryptography. These constructions are algebraic<br/>in nature, and provide a beautiful example of how abstract, seemingly<br/>unrelated topics in number theory, group theory and combinatorics  <br/>can be elegantly combined to solve an important real-world problem.<br/><br/>"

Among <br/>those representations, the ones that are geometric, in the sense of Fontaine <br/>and Mazur, are especially of arithmetic significance, and their category<br/>should be equivalent to the (still conjectural) category of mixed motives <br/>over F. It is important to understand the first Ext groups in that category<br/>(higher Ext groups should be zero) and Bloch and Kato have made precise <br/>conjectures relating the dimension of those groups to the order of <br/>L-functions at integers values of the variable. The project aims to construct <br/>as much extensions as possible in those Ext groups (hopefully as much as <br/>predicted by the conjecture, in the case corresponding to the center of the <br/>functional equation of the L-function) using p-adic deformations of <br/>non-tempered automorphic forms. An important step should be the study of <br/>the local geometry of the ""moduli space of p-adic automorphic forms"" called <br/>Eigenvarieties around the non-tempered automorphic forms.<br/><br/><br/>Many old problems in arithmetic, some of them going back as far as <br/>Diophantes, as well as some new ones, fit well in the framework of Galois <br/>theory: they often can be translated into questions about existence, or <br/>non-existence, of certain Galois representations (that is representations of the <br/>absolute Galois group G of the field Q of rational numbers, or of some open <br/>subgroups of G) with prescribed properties. And then, sometimes, they can <br/>be proven, as was Fermat's Last Theorem by Wiles. The study of Galois <br/>representations splits up into two parts : finding irreducible Galois <br/>representations, and then determining extensions between them. Even if the <br/>first problem is far from being solved, precise conjectures about the second <br/>one were made by Bloch and Kato. The projects aims to give partial answers <br/>to those conjectures, by constructing some interesting extensions. The method <br/>uses the theory of automorphic forms, which was once quite a different topic, <br/>but which is now  strongly tied to the theory of Galois representations by the<br/>Langland's program. The idea is that one can obtain interesting extensions of <br/>Galois representations by looking at (p-adic) deformations of some very <br/>special automorphic forms, the so-called non tempered forms. The more <br/>deformations there are, the more extensions one should be able to construct. <br/>Those deformations are encoded in the geometry of a (p-adic) variety, known <br/>as the Eigenvariety, and developing tools to study that geometry is an important <br/>part in the project. <br/>"

Under the support of the NSF project ""Transfer, Definability and Constructibility"",  this approach cumulated in the introduction of an alternative tight closure operation in  characteristic zero. The key idea is that by taking ultraproducts of the positive   characteristic  Frobenii, one gets an ultra-Frobenius in characteristic zero acting on  a canonically defined overring.  By this technique, complications from reduction to  positive characteristic have been avoided and the elegant arguments from positive characteristic have been recovered. Through his novel  approach, the proposer was able to improve results from classical tight closure theory, to  successfully classify   rational singularities of finite type over a field of characteristic zero, and to solve an open problem on Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing for quotients of Fano  varieties. The author purports that these results can be extended to arbitrary Noetherian local rings containing a field,  if one better  understands the structures that are in the center of  this transfer: ultraproducts of Noetherian local rings. He proposes a comprehensive study of their local  properties, using variants of classical notions from commutative algebra, cast in a  more general framework of local rings of finite embedding dimension. Many applications and benefits are expected to follow from   his study, some of the more important of which  are: a parallel development of tight closure in positive and in zero  characteristic leading to a unified and simplified treatment, making the theory more accessible and appealing to a general mathematical  audience; sharper results on uniform bounds;  the study of rational singularities  in a more general setup; and, asymptotical solutions to the Homological   Conjectures in mixed characteristic.<br/><br/>The synergy  between concepts from  model theory, commutative algebra,  homological algebra, ring theory, topology and  algebraic geometry, is what makes this project  particularly interesting, and the exchange of ideas between these mathematical  disciplines will contribute substantially to the advancement of the subject. This  is one of the first studies in its kind that brings these notions together via a single concept, to  wit, the ultraproduct of Noetherian local rings. In response to the proposer's previous success in using  ultraproducts, other researchers in algebra and ring theory have already turned their  attention to such ultraproducts. It is the goal of the author to engage in a productive interaction with these researchers, in the hope that this eventually will lead to the organization of an international  conference on the  use of ultraproducts in ring theory.<br/><br/><br/>"

One of the very real possibilities is the deployment of `smart dust', a vast network of radio transceivers, in order to monitor large areas and, possibly, track movements in that area.  Such `smart dust' is of any use only if the various transceivers are very cheap, use very little energy, so that they are around for a long time, and do not cost much to put in place.  In particular, the transceivers cannot be expected to be able to transmit far, and must be placed in essentially random positions.  This leads us to numerous mathematical problems, several of which we hope to attack.<br/><br/>For example, a mathematical model of one of many real-life problems goes as follows.  Suppose we have a large number of points (radio transceivers) in a square or circular disc, distributed at random.  Let N be the network obtained by connecting each point to the k points nearest to it (each transceiver can communicate with the k transceivers nearest to it).  How large should k be in order to make it likely that the network N is connected?  In other words, how large should k be to make it likely that, for any two transceivers x and y, a message can be sent from x to y via a sequence of transceivers, i.e., there are transceivers a, b, ... , u, such that the message can be sent from x to a, from a to b, etc., and finally from u to y.<br/><br/>There are numerous other mathematical problems related to ad hoc wireless networks: for example, in the problem above we may relax the requirement that the entire network be connected, and want only a large set of transceivers that can communicate with each other.  It also makes sense to care about the speed with which a message can be transmitted to faraway transceivers, and we may want to investigate how an efficient route can be identified.  In yet another problem, we should take into account the interference encountered if several nearby transceivers broadcast at the same time.<br/><br/>The problems above belong to the theory of random geometric graphs, an area started by Gilbert about 45 years ago, but, curiously, still not too well developed.  Our aim in this NSF project is to identify a number of problems that are not only of interest from the point of view of pure mathematics, but also have substantial applications to large ad hoc wireless networks."

Built upon earlier work of Pevtsova and others which employs local methods in modular representation theory, the proposed research aims to<br/>create new invariants and to achieve a better understanding of existing <br/>ones. For example, Pevtsova proposes  in joint work with Friedlander to produce finer invariants than support varieties by considering restrictions of representations  to subalgebras isomorphic to group algebras of a cyclic group. In another project, joint with Witherspoon, Pevtsova will seek a representation-theoretic description of<br/>support varieties for representations of a restricted quantum Lie <br/>algebra at roots of unity. In a baby sisterof this  project, Pevtsova and Witherspoon propose to develop a new description of the rank variety for a class of local algebras over fields of characteristic zero, and define rank varieties for certain non-cocommutative Hopf algebras, identifying the new varieties with the existing geometric constructions which use Hochschild cohomology. In a third project, Pevtsova proposes to establish a geometric correspondence between certain triangulated module categories associated to reduced enveloping <br/>algebras of a Lie algebra.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The proposed research begins with the philosophy of understanding a difficult, complicated algebraic structure by studying a family of simple structures embedded in the original. The simple objects are well understood so that the challenge is to combine this understanding to gain some information about the original, difficult structure. This idea is applied to the study of formal algebraic objects arising as symmetries of familiar structures. In the process, the interplay of two different mathematical fields, geometry and algebra, is used extensively, revealing beautiful connections and enabling applications to both areas. A second aspect of this proposal includes the mentoring of female undergraduate students, participation in a popular mathematical program for advanced high school students, and the editing of a special volume of amathematical journal.<br/><br/>"

Ellenberg<br/><br/>Institution:  University of Wisconsin<br/><br/>The investigator proposes to address an ensemble of problems in<br/>arithmetic geometry, centered on the problem of describing the<br/>distribution of rational points on varieties over number fields.  The<br/>study of rational points is, on the one hand, passed down to us from<br/>the very beginning of number theory; on the other hand, the present<br/>state of the art in this extremely active area involves ideas from a<br/>wide variety of subjects, including etale cohomology, methods of<br/>analytic number theory, and the complex algebraic geometry of moduli<br/>spaces of morphisms.  In the first project, the investigator and his<br/>colleagues will continue their investigation of well-known conjectures<br/>on distribution of rational points and distribution of discriminants<br/>of number fields.  In the second project, the investigator will study<br/>the arithmetic of towers of curves; rational points in such towers<br/>seem to be intimately related with objects of non-abelian Iwasawa<br/>theory, a subject which has enjoyed an explosion of interest in the<br/>last five years.  The proposed projects will involve a great deal of<br/>collaboration with researchers from every part of number theory and<br/>algebraic geometry, and should provide many opportunities for graduate<br/>students and postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>The foundational problem of number theory is this: find all solutions<br/>in rational numbers to an equation.  For instance, one can ask for<br/>solutions of the Pythagorean equation: for which rational numbers x,y,<br/>and z is it the case that the square of x plus the square of y equals<br/>the square of z?  The Pythagorean equation has been well-understood<br/>for centuries; but many others, like Fermat's equation, present -- to<br/>say the least! -- more serious difficulties, and most equations are<br/>presently beyond our current ability to analyze.  In recent years, the<br/>subject of ""rational points"", or the analysis of solutions of<br/>equations, has been taking shape as a subject of its own, drawing<br/>ideas and techniques from many different parts of mathematics.  The<br/>investigator proposes several research projects in the area of<br/>rational points.  Because this area of research combines classical,<br/>easy-to-state problems with advanced methods and opportunities for<br/>experimentation, it is very well-suited for fledgling mathematicians.<br/>The investigator will launch a research program for students at<br/>Madison Memorial High School, and will expand the scope of the<br/>Wisconsin Talent Search; the aim will be to develop in Wisconsin an<br/>infrastructure for mathematical exploration, enrichment and research<br/>in secondary school, which will have enough momentum to continue<br/>beyond the duration of the present award.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

This new mathematical development makes use of the rich structure of congruences between Fourier coefficients of modular forms, and more generally of automorphic representations, to tie together infinitely many otherwise disparate automorphic representations into finite-dimensional parameter spaces.  By one count, there seems to be six independent, essentially simultaneous  constructions currently underway, of parametrized (p-adic) spaces of automorphic forms attached to algebraic groups, and their concomitant Galois representations. These parameter spaces are called ``eigenvarieties,"" or ``Hecke varieties,""  and  are being constructed by different people, in different but sometimes overlapping contexts: for unitary groups of higher rank, for symplectic groups of high rank, for general linear groups over number fields.  Eigenvarieties are a unifying force for classical and modern aspects of number theory, algebraic geometry, analytic geometry (p-adic, mainly) and the theory of group representations  (both automorphic representations and Galois representations). Some of this work has already been used in important applications. The   Eigenvarieties program at Harvard University during the Spring semester 2006 is intended to bring together  many of the people working on these constructions to provide intensive graduate courses on this material and satellite seminars.<br/><br/>   The classical work of Ramanujan, that dealt with the arithmetic properties of the Fourier coefficients of modular forms, unearthed striking congruences that contain important number theoretic information. These congruences suggest that a mysterious coherence underlies a large assortment of basic arithmetic phenomena such as the number of ways you can separate a collection of N objects into subcollections,  or given a lattice in some Euclidean space, the number of lattice points closest to a given point, or {\it the number of solutions of a system of polynomial equations modulo a prime number}.  An extraordinary web of congruences acts as a virtual glue that binds such problems together. In the intervening years, the search for congruences that have arithmetic applications, that unify representation theory, and the theory of modular forms, has  guided much number-theoretic work.  This search has been directly involved in many of the important advances in number theory in the past few decades.  For example, it played its role in the dramatic proof of modularity of elliptic curves over the rational numbers, a few years ago.  One is now on the verge of a significant expansion of this enterprise. The hope is that the Eigenvarieties program at Harvard University during the Spring semester 2006 program will provide a milieu where further progress can be made, where a coherent account of  the current state of knowledge will be established, and where graduate students, and also post-docs and other interested mathematicians, can gain mastery of these new developments.<br/><br/>"

The proposer intends to further explore this<br/>interplay by studying the relation between cores and adjoints or<br/>multiplier ideals. Having worked on a formula for the core in<br/>equicharacteristic zero, he wishes to obtain a similar explicit expression<br/>in positive characteristic, where the shape of the core is markedly<br/>different. Likewise he would like to find a combinatorial description for<br/>the core of monomial ideals. The investigator plans to continue his work<br/>on blowup algebras of ideals, most notably of zero-dimensional ideals in<br/>regular local rings. He asks whether the quasi-Gorenstein property of the<br/>extended Rees algebra implies the Gorensteinness of the associated graded<br/>ring. He also suggests that the normality or Cohen-Macaulayness of the<br/>special fiber ring of a Gorenstein ideal may force the ideal to be a<br/>complete intersection. On a more computational note, he addresses the<br/>problem of constructing the integral closure of algebras, in particular of<br/>Rees algebras. Passing to the integral closure of the Rees algebra of an<br/>ideal is the first step towards resolution of singularities and the only<br/>known general method for computing the integral closure of the ideal. The<br/>proposer wishes to estimate the complexity of this process by finding bounds<br/>on the number of generators of the integral closure, the degrees of the<br/>generators and the number of steps required in the computation. As another<br/>measure of complexity he plans to study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity<br/>of powers and symmetric powers of homogeneous ideals having dimension at<br/>most one. He expects that estimates on the regularity do not only persist<br/>when the ideal is raised to powers, but that they actually improve. Similar<br/>improved bounds for the regularity of symmetric powers would help finding<br/>the equations of Rees algebras and thereby lead to efficient algorithms in<br/>elimination theory.

Szczesny<br/><br/>The principal investigator proposes four projects relating conformal field theory, vertex algebras, and algebraic geometry. The first one concerns orbifolds of the chiral de Rham complex and their relation to Chen-Ruan's orbifold cohomology. More precisely, the PI proposes to understand the product structure on orbifold cohomology in terms of the orbifold chiral de Rham complex.  The second (with E. Frenkel and R. Donagi) relates spaces of twisted conformal blocks and D-modules on generalized Prym varieties. The third project involves the construction and study of sheaves of orbifold conformal blocks over the stack of pointed G--covers. The objective here is to obtain an orbifold CFT generalization of the KZ equations. Finally, the last project (with L. Borisov) is concerned with a non-chiral generalization of the chiral de Rham complex. The aim is to construct, for each Calabi-Yau manifold M, a sheaf of non-chiral vertex algebras in the sense of Kapustin-Orlov, which computes the (2,2)-sigma model with target M. This construction should have complexified Kahler dependence.<br/><br/>The purpose of these projects is to apply ideas in conformal field theory (CFT) ( a type of quantum field theory) to algebraic geometry. This has already been done successfully in the case of ordinary conformal field theories, leading to a large number of beautiful results. Most of the above projects are concerned with so called orbifold models, which arise when the CFT has additional discrete symmetries. In this case, the connections with algebraic geometry have not been fully explored, and the PI wants to extend some of the geometric results already known in the case of ordinary CFT's to the orbifold setting. The last of the projects proposed above focuses on rigorously defining and constructing an important quantum field theory, called the sigma model. So far, only a partial construction of ""half"" the theory exists.<br/><br/>"

During the late 1950's and early 1960's G. A. Freiman derived a series of theorems, which indicated that for a finite set A, if the size of A plus A is small, then A must have some arithmetic structure. In the proposal the principal investigator proposes to study the inverse phenomenon for generalizing Freiman's theorems for finite sets and discovering new theorems for infinite sets using nonstandard methods. One type of Freiman's results optimally characterizes the structure of A when the size of A plus A is less than 3 times the size of A minus 2. Since then many efforts have been made by various people to generalize Freiman's theorems with this type of condition. However, no optimal structural characterization of A had been obtained for the size of A plus A greater then 3 times the size of A minus 2, until recently. It seemed unexpected that nonstandard methods were brought in and made a break-through. With the help of nonstandard analysis the principal investigator was able to give an optimal characterization of the structure of A when the size of A plus A is upper bounded by c times the size of A for a constant c slightly greater than 3. The principal investigator believes that the potential power of the methods hasn't been fully uncovered. He proposes to further his investigation and derive the same kind of characterization for the structure of A when the size of A plus A is less then the ten-thirds the size of A or further. The principal investigator also proposes to work on other problems including inverse problems for infinite sets using the nonstandard methods.<br/>Freiman's inverse phenomenon revealed a fundamental behavior of natural numbers. This idea had many applications in various fields such as combinatorial number theory, algebra, coding theory, integer programming, probability, etc. as mentioned in ""Structure Theory of Set Addition"", Asterisque No. 258 (1999), Societe Mathematique de France, Paris. Any improvement on Freiman's theorems would certainly bring about better applications in these fields. Since numbering and counting are fundamental to mathematics as well as our daily lives, a better understanding of our number system would obviously be beneficial to the both. One distinctive feature of this proposal is the use of the nonstandard methods. Nonstandard analysis uses the techniques in logic to create a world in which infinitely large numbers are allowed. An interesting aspect of this research is that these infinitely large numbers, which are purely imaginary to the human minds, could be used to prove theorems in the real world. This interaction between logic and number theory demonstrates the importance of interdisciplinary research. This research should also be instructive to young researchers encouraging them to open their minds, embrace different kinds of knowledge, and uncover the hidden relationships between these different disciplines. <br/><br/><br/>"

Many others have approached the study of combinatorial spaces from this point of view, but it seems that Forman's approach is simpler than that which has come before, and also retains more of the flavor of the motivating subjects of differential topology and geometry. Numerous applications have been found to the study of combinatorial spaces arising in various aspects of algebra, graph theory, and complexity theory.  The ultimate goal is a unification of the study of smooth and combinatorial spaces.<br/><br/>Compact combinatorial spaces arise in a wide variety of settings in discrete mathematics, and can be described, in a very convenient way, with a finite amount of data describing the local structure near each point. There has been a resurgence of interest in such spaces because they are well suited for computer experimentations and calculations. Moreover, in numerous real world settings one has the goal of investigating a space, but the only available information is a finite set of data points sampled from the space. In such cases some of the most natural approaches to reconstructing the space begin with a process of building a combinatorial space out of the set of points. It is not always clear how to go about determining the global properties of such a space from the local data with which it is encoded.  On the other hand, the subjects of differential topology and differential geometry are largely devoted to this problem, except that the spaces under investigation are not combinatorial, but rather smooth (and cannot in general be described with a finite amount of data). Some very general techniques have been developed over the recent decades for the study of smooth spaces. Forman's work is devoted to showing that many of these ideas can be adapted to apply to combinatorial spaces.  <br/><br/>"
