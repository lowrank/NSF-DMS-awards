The conference will involve approximately thirty talks on those parts of algebra and geometry  to which Professor Shult has made significant contributions in a long and distinguished career. Thus, the conference will be concerned with developments in the theory of finite simple groups, with geometries related to those groups, and with generalizations of such geometries.<br/><br/>Group theory can be described as the algebra associated with symmetry, and finite groups in particular afford a rich mathematical structure and wealth of applications. The finite simple groups may be viewed as the ""atoms"" of which all finite groups are composed, and for this reason, the announcement, twenty years ago, of the classification of the finite simple groups was a milestone in mathematics. The conference will focus on developments which promise to provide, perhaps for the first time, a satisfactory treatment of this fundamental result. The interplay between geometry and group theory has always been enriching for both subjects and will provide a second focus for this conference.<br/>"

The central unifying notion <br/>in geometry is that of curvature. Now, through these diverse<br/>geometric and combinatorial theories, curvature is emerging <br/>as a powerful tool and fundamental unifying concept in <br/>combinatorics as well.  This Focused Research Group will <br/>explore some of the specific notions of combinatorial<br/>curvature driving current combinatorial work, and also the <br/>role of curvature as the basis for a coherent geometric <br/>vision of combinatorics itself.<br/><br/>The notion of curvature has been one of the grand unifying <br/>concepts in geometry and physics for well over a century.  <br/>For example, Gauss, the originator of our modern understanding <br/>of curvature, showed that Euclidean geometry was distinguished <br/>from other geometries as being the geometry of a space with <br/>zero curvature. As an application he showed that it is<br/>precisely the curvature of the surface of the Earth which makes <br/>it impossible to draw a map of the Earth's surface (on a flat <br/>piece of paper) that accurately portrays all lengths and angles.<br/>Riemann generalized Gauss's work to smooth spaces of higher <br/>dimensions, and Einstein observed that Riemannian geometry<br/>was precisely the right setting in which to describe his <br/>theory of general relativity (in which the curvature of the <br/>universe is the result of gravitational forces). Partly as a <br/>result of Einstein's work, the last century saw an intensive investigation into the curvature of smooth spaces.<br/>Combinatorics, roughly defined, is the study of objects which <br/>can be described by a finite amount of information.  This is <br/>precisely the mathematics that computers can do.  This type of mathematics seems far removed from the geometric investigations <br/>of Gauss, Riemann and countless others.  However, there is a <br/>growing collection of  combinatorial phenomena which can best <br/>be viewed as being finite analogues of facts about the curvature <br/>of smooth spaces.  The goal of this proposal is to come to a<br/>coherent understanding of curvature as a combinatorial notion. <br/>In addition, bringing together researchers from a variety of mathematical disciplines, we wish to bridge the chasms between geometry, combinatorics, algebra and topology, using curvature <br/>as the unifying theme.<br/>"

Part<br/>of this project involves moment graphs of varieties with torus<br/>actions.

There has been much recent progress in<br/>computing topological invariants, such as cohomology or<br/>intersection homology, in terms of the moment graph.  The<br/>investigator proposes to extend this to K-theory.

A diophantine equation is simply a polynomial equation with integer coefficients.  One is generally interested in solutions to these equations that are rational numbers or integers.  The investigator uses the p-adic method Chabauty-Coleman to study the number of solutions to Thue equations, which are equations of the form F(x,y) = m, where m is an integer and F is a homogeneous polynomial with integer coefficients and without repeated roots.  The investigator has shown that the number of integer solutions (x,y), with x and y coprime, can be bounded in terms of the degree of F under certain hypotheses and is now working on weakening these hypotheses, sharpening his bounds, and extending his methods to attack other similar problems.  The investigator also looks at various questions related to Vojta's conjecture for algebraic points on curves, which implies a variety of important results in diophantine number theory, most notably the abc conjecture.  In addition, he uses techniques from arithmetic geometry to study class groups of quadratic fields, consequences of the abc conjecture, and curves over finite fields.<br/><br/>The investigator studies problems having to do with whole number and rational solutions  to polynomial equations in two or more variables.  Such problems are among the oldest in the branch of mathematics known as number theory.  Indeed, they derive their name ""diophantine equations"" from Diophantus of Alexandria, a Greek mathematician who lived in the 2nd century BC.  Over the past few years, mathematicians have succeeded at completely solving many diophantine equations that were first examined hundreds of years ago: Andrew Wiles solved the famed Fermat equation (which has the form ""x to the nth power plus y to the nth power equals z to the nth power"", where x,y, and z are positive whole numbers and n is a whole number greater than or equal to 3) that was initially studied by French mathematician Pierre Fermat in the 1600's, and others have solved problems posed by Diophantus himself.  Contemporary investigations of diophantine equations have given rise to a host of new questions and conjectures; for example, it has been conjectured that the number of solutions in rational numbers to a polynomial equation in two variables depends only on the degree of the equation.  Number theory has proven to be of more than historical and theoretical interest in recent years.  It provided the theoretical ideas that led to the development of error-correcting codes employed by compact disc players and has found applications in the areas of cryptography and data encryption, which are important both for national security and for e-commerce.<br/>"

The Principal Investigator is particularly interested in the homological properties of representations which underlie the basic module theory.  He plans to consider a question open for more than 20 years on the classification of a specific type of modules that play an important role in the larger category theory of the modules, and also to look the structure of the cohomology ring of the group which acts on the fundamental homological constructions.  Carlson and his collaborators have shown that many facets of the module category are controlled by the group cohomology of p-subgroups.  The proposed work would build on this foundation. Other projects involve investigations of the structure of module categories of finite groups and the general theory of extensions of modules.  Results from the project could be of interest in the area of algebraic topology as well as in representation theory.  Professor Carlson plans to continue his development of computer algebra systems for experimentation with modules and homomorphisms.  He intends to expand his collection of programs for the computation of group cohomology and other aspects of the module theory.  The programs are also being rewritten for more general applications in the area of the representation theory of algebras. <br/><br/>In basic terms the Principal Investigator will look at certain types of algebraic systems together with the actions of operators.  Such a system is called a module and it might have many dimensions in the sense of depending on many variable. The operations may represent something like the geometric rotation of points on a space.  The project will concentrate on the classification and properties of modules whose associated operators have a preset collection of interactions.  A significant part of the project is the development of computational techniques and software for analyzing the structure and properties of modules.  Groups of transformations on modules and spaces are basic objects in modern mathematics and arise in many applications of the mathematics.  Some of the methods of the study are closely related to geometric techniques used in topology."

The main goal of the project is to find good definitions of compact moduli functors, with special regard to the moduli theory of surfaces. As part of the moduli theory project special efforts are devoted to reflexive sheaves and their behavior with respect to morphisms in an effort to develop a theory that includes many results for reflexive sheaves of rank 1 that are similar to results already known for line bundles. This is very important in order to develop a moduli theory of singular varieties, which in turn is essential for geometrically meaningful compact moduli spaces. Another problem the investigator is studying is generalizations of Shafarevich's conjecture and its applications to the case of higher dimensional bases, in particular the problem of boundedness and rigidity for families of varieties of general type.  This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one that blossomed to the point where it has solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, and still in its simplest form it treats figures defined in the plane by polynomials. Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those fields. Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical computer science cryptography, coding theory and robotics. A central problem in algebraic geometry is the classification of all geometric objects. In turn an important part of classification theory is the theory of moduli. The latter's core idea is that one does not only want to understand these objects, but also understand the way they can be deformed. Moduli spaces play a very important role in theoretical physics. Studying curves on moduli spaces provides information on how an object is changing in space-time. This project focuses on compact moduli spaces. Those are extensions of moduli spaces in general and they give additional information about singular deformations, ones that are essentially different from others. Presently the existence of compact moduli spaces is known for low dimensional problems. The investigator is studying the higher dimensional case. As part of the project, but somewhat independent of the above, the investigator and his graduate students are running a website that works as a forum for graduate students and young researchers in algebraic geometry. Users of this website can pose questions that are likely to be known to experts but not available in the literature. The main goal of this project is to open a new venue for a larger number of students to access the knowledge of experts in the field helping to achieve a more equal opportunity environment. In addition, the collected database provides references to results that are too ""small"" to occupy an entire article, but too important to ignore, as well as a collection of potential research problems for graduate students."

The investigator together with students and collaborators will study problems in four connected areas: the theory of tight closure, rings of F-finite Cohen-Macaulay type, the theory of integrally closed ideals with applications to evolutions, and the study of infinite free resolutions.  At its core, tight closure theory rests on reduction to positive characteristic.  The principal investigator will study two main problems using tight closure.  The first deals with recent work concerning the behavior of symbolic powers in regular local rings, and the second concerns the question of whether tight closure commutes with localization.  To study rings of finite (or F-finite) Cohen-Macaulay type, this proposal places the study in the broader context of understanding the decomposition of purely inseparable extensions of a fixed Cohen-Macaulay domain into direct sums of indecomposable Cohen-Macaulay modules.  Integral closures of ideals are a basic object in commutative algebra.  This proposal concentrates on questions pertaining to the existence of evolutions over the complex numbers.  The study of infinite free resolutions and vanishing to Tors is the focus of the last part of the proposal, especially over Gorenstein rings of dimension zero.<br/><br/>Commutative algebra studies the relationship between algebraic equations, such as polynomial equations, and geometry.  This idea goes back to Descartes and the idea of coordinatizing the plane, and has proved to be a powerful tool.  A wide range of problems can be put into the context of solving systems of equations. For example, linear algebra studies systems of linear (degree one) equations.  Commutative algebra studies the solutions of polynomial or power series equations of higher order by forming an algebraic object consisting of the 'generic' solutions.  The algebraic properties of these generic solutions then give insight into the geometric and algebraic nature of the equations. <br/><br/>"

One such problem is to find a conceptual moduli-theoretic interpretation of the Coleman-Mazur eigencurve. The investigator also proposes to study the problem of incorporating conditions such as semi-stability (in the sense of Fontaine) in the deformation theory of Galois representations, continuing a line of development growing out of the work of Wiles.  In a somewhat different direction, Buzzard has recently observed in numerous examples that the slopes of eigenforms seem to possess much more structure than conjectured by Gouvea-Mazur.  These surprising observations do not fit into any general framework, and the investigator proposes to determine the general nature of such phenomena.  In addition to studying these problems, the investigator continues his efforts in the direction of supporting active student interest in mathematics at the high school level.  Through personal contacts at a local school, he arranges regular meetings in which he leads informal group discussions with students on an assortment of interesting mathematical ideas (taken from a wide variety of disciplines:  number theory, geometry, probability, etc.).  The idea is to expose students to important and interesting concepts which are not usually encountered in the classroom but which can be presented in an elementary context.<br/><br/>The investigator also provides these students with information about summer math programs and research opportunities, in order that they can experience mathematics as a living field of scientific inquiry.  Number theory is the branch of mathematics which is concerned with the properties of whole numbers.  It abounds in deep and unsolved problems, particularly concerning properties of prime numbers and geometric objects called elliptic curves.  Prime numbers and the theory of elliptic curves also lie at the heart of modern cryptographic systems, without which secure diplomatic transmissions and Internet commerce would be impossible.  The RSA cryptosystem and the elliptic curve factorization algorithm are two such prominent applications in this context.  Improvements in our theoretical understanding of elliptic curves is expected lead to further applications along these lines.  The investigator's scientific work is concerned with several questions naturally arising from the theory of elliptic curves, and partly aims to continue the development the techniques that were used to recently settle the Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture, one of the most important problems in the theory of elliptic curves.  The investigator also regularly visits with local high school students, showing them important mathematical ideas that are not usually encountered in school, such as the inner workings of the RSA cryptosystem and the role of probability in the design of medical tests for rare diseases.  The investigator also provides these students with nformation about summer opportunities for education, research, and work in mathematics, and offers guidance for students who wish to take part in several prestigious high school science research competitions.  The Faculty Career Development Program makes it possible for the investigator to continue his scientific work while at the same time enabling him to give some high school students a deeper appreciation for mathematics and its important role in modern society.<br/>"

This connection makes their study very interesting and it is also a major source of important questions.  For example, for the celebrated Langlands Program (in Number Theory), a complete classification of unitary representations of reductive groups over local fields is needed.<br/><br/>I propose to investigate arithmetic, group theoretic and geometric properties of reductive groups using various tools.  Among the powerful tools I have used in the past is the geometry of a nice space known as the ""building"" of the group provided by the Bruhat-Tits theory.  This theory, together with a detailed understanding of the structure of reductive groups, and their cohomology (these are certain subtle geometric invariants of the groups), has helped to settle many important questions about these groups. In my own work on rigidity of certain ""large"" subgroups known as ""lattices"", and also in my study of arithmetic questions about these groups, including the congruence subgroup problem, these techniques played crucial role. In my joint work with Allen Moy, the Bruhat-Tits theory of reductive groups over local fields was used to settle some questions about their representations and also to classify admissible representations of depth zero.  Subsequently, several other mathematicians used our frame-work and techniques to find solutions of many interesting problems in the representation theory and harmonic analysis.  I will use some of the geometric techniques mentioned above to find a classification of irreducible admissible representations of reductive groups over local fields. I will also investigate the congruence subgroup problem which remains unresolved for certain (anisotropic) groups.  The latter would require understanding their normal subgroups first.  I am working on this question with Andrei Rapinchuk and Yoav Segev.  I also plan to write a book on the congruence subgroup problem in collaboration with Andrei Rapinchuk.<br/>"

He studies some fundamental problems in the theory of quiver representations.  In earlier joint work with Jerzy Weyman, he found a nice description and even an algorithm for the decomposition of a general representation into indecomposable representations (this is the canonical decomposition as introduced by Kac).  Also Weyman and the investigator proved that semi-invariants introduced by Schofield always generate the ring of semi-invariants. The above results have a remarkable application to Littlewood-Richardson coeffients.  In particular one can prove results of Klyachko, and Knutson-Tao about the set of nonzero Littlewood-Richardson coefficients using quiver representations.  Using results about quiver representations many more new results about Littlewood-Richardson coefficients can be proven.  The investigator is continuing his research on quiver representations to deepen our understanding of generic representations of wild quivers, and to apply these results to the combinatorics of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. The investigator just finished writing a book together with Gregor Kemper on Computational Invariant Theory.  He is now studying various problems in Invariant Theory, in particular algorithms for finding rational invariants and for determining whether two elements in a given representation of an algebraic group lie in the same orbit.  This orbit problem is the original motivation of Invariant Theory.<br/><br/>This research is in the area of Mathematics referred to as Invariant Theory, a branch of Representation Theory, in the general area of Algebra.  Invariant Theory has a long tradition back to the nineteenth century.  It studies quantities which stay invariant under certain symmetries (in arbitrary dimension). A simple example is a person on earth.  The quantity ""distance to the rotation axes"" stays invariant under rotation of the earth.  Of course symmetries play an important role in nature.  Related to this is the problem to recognize if two objects can be transformed into each other by certain symmetries. Think of a robot eye which has to recognize whether two objects are the same after rotation.  The investigator studies various problems in invariant theory and in particular (a mathematical formulated version of) the object recognition problem. ""Quiver"" representation theory can be thought of as a generalization of linear algebra.  This theory shows a deep and interesting structure.  For example, a graphical representation gives fractal-like pictures.  There are several applications to other branches of mathematics.<br/>"

The straightforward way to analyze a position is to examine  all of its options and all the options of these options and all the  options of the options of these options and so on.  The obvious difficulty of this exhaustive search through the game-tree is that it takes enormous amount of time.  An attempt to make up for the lack of time is to study the random walk on the game-tree, i.e. the randomized game where both players play randomly.  The basic idea is that the statistical analysis of the randomized game can be  efficiently converted via potential arguments into deterministic optimal strategies.  It is basically a game-theoretic adaptation of the so-called Probabilistic Method in Combinatorics (""Erdos theory"") applied to hopelessly complicated games where the exact methods fail to work.  It is very surprising how this ``desperate'' attempt turns out to be  successful for large, interesting classes of positional games.  Carrying out the program sketched in his prior proposal the investigator have developed a ""game theoretic second moment method"" for fair games, and applied it to solve long-standing open problems in graph and hypergraph games.  Another great success was his work toward ""game-theoretic independence"" (i.e. game theoretic Lovasz Local Lemma).  In this direction the investigator achieved an important partial result, which led to the solution of the long-standing Hales-Jewett conjecture about the multi-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe game.  In this new proposal the investigator aims for a biased generalization of his game-theoretic second moment method, which would create a breakthrough in ""game-theoretic random graph theory"".  Also the investigator wants to continue his work to prove a perfect game-theoretic analogue of the probabilistic Lovasz Local Lemma.<br/><br/>Traditional game theory focuses on games of incomplete information.  The traditional theory provided good insights to  Economics, and many areas of social science (Management, Military  Strategy, etc.).  One can expect at least as many new applications from a successful theory of games of complete information.  Positional games, i.e. 2-player ""pure conflict"" games of skill like Chess and Go, form the most natural and interesting subclass of games of complete information. An extremely exciting aspect of studying positional games is that they give unique insight to how human intelligence works.  It concerns fundamental questions like whether human understanding is a computational or non-computational process.  Or more specific problems like to understand why (say) Go playing computer programs are nowhere close to the best human players.  In contrast to Go, the best Chess-playing programs have reached the level of human Grandmasters.  Game-playing computer programs examine millions of positions before deciding what to do next.  On the other hand, even the best Grandmasters do not search more than 50 positions per move. In human Chess and particularly in human Go pattern recognition plays a  far more important role than search.  How to supply this human knowledge to a computer is a puzzle that no one has solved yet.  A more concrete theoretical significance of this proposal is that it brings the seemingly separated subjects of Probability Theory, Combinatorics, and Game Theory closer to each other in an unexpected way.<br/>"

The first problem is concerned with the intrinsic symmetric structures of automorphic forms of reductive groups over number fields.  Such structures of automorphic forms can be characterized by the existence of various period integrals of automorphic forms.  Periods become recently a very useful tool to characterize various basic properties of automorphic forms and L-functions.  In this project, the investigator and his colleagues intend to use periods to characterize new families of automorphic forms, especially, the degenerate cuspidal automorphic forms.  The first example of such degenerate cuspidal automorphic forms is systematically studied by I. Piatetski-Shapiro in early 1980's in order to understand the generalization of the Ramanujan conjecture on estimate of Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms.  These new families of automorphic forms characterized by the relevant periods are expected to share the basic structures with the ones suggested by J. Arthur from his work on general trace formula over the space of square integrable automorphic forms of reductive groups.  The second problem is to study local and global Langlands reciprocity laws.  The investigator and his colleague intend to establish local Langlands reciprocity law for classical groups by studying local gamma functions and using recent progress in the local and global theory of automorphic forms.<br/><br/>The investigator and his colleagues study the theory of automorphic forms, an abstract, transcendental theory that describes repeating phenomena like sound and waves.  A cornerstone of modern mathematics, it provides the foundation for relevant areas of mathematics and has applications to computer network theory and string theory in physics.  Using this theory, the investigator and his colleagues can examine the reciprocal relations among objects from geometry, analysis, and number theory.  The theory played an essential role in recent solution of the Fermat's last theorem by A. Wiles, and has also been important to the recent development in coding theory and cryptology.

Some known (classical) results of Maurey, McDiarmid, and others  are derived using this notion, leaving open still some fundamental problems, a few of which are addressed in this proposal.

Prasad on a refinement of the local Langlands correspondence for self-dual representations of GL(n).<br/><br/>    The field of research of the P.I. is Automorphic Forms. The simplest, yet not so simple, instance of the basic problem of the field is the following: Start with a sequence of numbers {a_0, a_1 , a_2, a_3, .., a_n, ...} and consider the ""generating function"" f(q) = a_0 + a_1q + a_2q^2 + ... + a_nq^n + ...., where q is a dummy variable. A fundamental  question is to know when f(q) satisfies a ""hidden symmetry"". To elaborate, write q = exp(2\pi iz), with z a complex number of positive imaginary part, and set q* = exp(-2\pi i/z). What one is often looking for, and this shows up in disparate fields like string Physics and combinatorics, is a relationship between  the pair (f(q), f(q*)). One says that f has weight k if <br/>f(q*) =(-log q/2\pi i)^k f(q). The existence of such a symmetry <br/>implies that the sequence {a_n} we started with has miraculous properties. For example, when the a_n are multiplicative, i.e., when a_{mn} = a_ma_n for m,n  relatively prime, with a_0=0 and a_1=1, then there is an associated  2-dimensional Galois representation R coming from geometry whose associated ""L-function"" equals 1 + a_2/2^s + a_3/3^s + ..., implying that for each prime p, a_p =<br/>u_p + 1/u_p with u_p an algebraic integer of absolute value p^{(k-1)/2}; in particular, |a_p|  is bounded by 2p^{(k-1)/2}, which is not provable by an apriori analytic estimate.  A key example to keep in mind is the ubiquitous Delta function q{(1-q)(1-q^2)(1-q^3)...)}^{24} = q+tau_2q^2 + tau_3q^3 + ..., which has weight 12. The general ""Langlands program"" envisions many such occurrances, and they involve a family of symmetries (""modularity"") which are complicated to write down explicitly, but are nevertheless very important to pursue due to their far-reaching consequences. For example, one key ingredient of the celebrated proof of Fermat's last theorem by Wiles makes use of a result obtained in this program. In his work related to his<br/>current (about to become preious) NSF proposal, the P.I. proved that given two functions f(q), g(q) as above attached to {a_n}, {b_n} respectively, admitting hidden symmetries of some weights, the product sequence {a_nb_n} is associated to a modular object of degree 4. This has the following consequence. Suppose f, g have the same weights, and suppose further that a_p^2 equals b_p^2 for almost all primes p. Then f equals g."

This Focused Research Group will <br/>explore some of the specific notions of combinatorial<br/>curvature driving current combinatorial work, and also the <br/>role of curvature as the basis for a coherent geometric <br/>vision of combinatorics itself.<br/><br/>The notion of curvature has been one of the grand unifying <br/>concepts in geometry and physics for well over a century.  <br/>For example, Gauss, the originator of our modern understanding <br/>of curvature, showed that Euclidean geometry was distinguished <br/>from other geometries as being the geometry of a space with <br/>zero curvature.

The first of these projects would extend to classical groups much of the investigator's work with Bushnell on the groups GL(N).  The ultimate goal is to construct inducing representations for the supercuspidal representations of these groups and then to produce covers for the resulting supercuspidal types.  This would allow the use of earlier methods in studying the harmonic analysis of these groups and would hopefully have arithmetic applications, especially to Langlands functoriality.  The second project involves working out what might be called a Plancherel theory for affine Hecke algebras with possibly unequal parameters.  These algebras play a critical role in applying the techniques alluded to above; it is to be hoped that results already obtained in low rank may be extended to this general situation.  The third project involves the K-theory and homology of p-adic groups and builds upon some recent results on the module theory of Hecke algebras.  The fourth project is to apply methods involving compact, open subgroups to study the oscillator representation, especially in case p=2.<br/><br/>A basic problem in the mathematics of almost every ancient culture was to determine solutions to equations where the solutions were constrained to be whole numbers.  Such equations, called Diophantine equations after the late Greek mathematician Diophantos, have motivated much of the development of that part of mathematics referred to as the theory of numbers.  As an example, one has the so-called Fermat equation, an equation that has been much in the news of late due to the recent determination of its lack of solutions except in case n=2.  One way of attempting to solve a Diophantine equation is to replace the equation by a congruence:  that is, one picks an integer N and one replaces the condition that the two sides of the equation be equal by the less stringent condition that the difference of the two sides of the equation be divisible by N.  Solving these congruences for enough integers N often gives good information about the existence or non-existence of solutions to the original equation.  Often it is useful to fix a prime number p and then to study the congruences that result when N runs through all powers of p.  In this case, one says that one has localized the problem to the prime p.  This process of localization has, over the last two hundred years, led to the development of a part of number theory called local number theory.  This is the general area in which this project is to be carried out.   One of the most powerful conceptualizations in local number theory is to be found in the conjectures of R.P. Langlands which, if verified, would go a long way to clarifying the nature of local Diophantine problems.  The project proposed here would build on the investigator's earlier work in an attempt to provide some of the tools necessary to verify these conjectures.<br/>"

These problems concern, among other things, whether the intersection multiplicities are always greater than or equal to zero (nonnegativity) and precise conditions for them to vanish (vanishing) or to be greater than zero (positivity).  These problems have become known as Serre's conjectures for intersection multiplicities.  This proposal has two parts.  The first part is a continuation of research of the principal investigator on the positivity conjecture that uses recent advances on the resolution of singularities which have led to a solution of the nonnegativity conjecture.  This investigation will also study relations between these ideas and other questions on multiplicities in commutative algebra.  The second part concerns modules of finite projective dimension over nonregular rings.  It will use a recent result of the principal investigator and V. Srinivas to study intersection properties of modules of finite length and finite projective dimension and extend these results to study the vanishing conjecture for two modules of finite projective dimension.<br/><br/>In this proposal the principal investigator studies some fundamental questions in the relations between Algebra and Geometry.  Geometric sets are often defined as sets of solutions to polynomial equations. In studying the behaviour of these solutions, one has to define  multiplicities, which give the number of times a solution should be counted.  This concept generalizes the multiplicity of a root of a polynomial, which is crucial to most applications of polynomials.  The investigation of these ideas has led to several fundamental questions in Algebra.  One of these questions is the problem of determining when these multiplicities are positive. Another group of questions concerns modules of finite projective dimension, which are modules which can be described by a finite resolution; the finiteness of this description is used, for example, in computer algebra for computing invariants.  The principal investigator will study properties of these modules and their relation to questions on multiplicities as well as to other branches of Algebra.<br/>"

In the first part the investigator and his colleagues study the asymptotic affine Hecke algebra introduced by G. Lusztig.  The asymptotic Hecke algebra is a suitable limit of the usual Hecke algebra as parameter tends to zero.  Its representation theory is closely related with representation theory of the Hecke algebra itself.  One of the aims here is a proof of Lusztig's Conjecture describing the asymptotic Hecke algebra in the elementary K-theoretic terms.  In the second part the investigator studies module categories over monoidal categories.  This subject is closely related with modern physics where module categories appear in the context of the Boundary Conformal Field Theory.  In the third part the investigator and collaborators study distinguished involutions in the affine Weyl group.  In particular they make extensive explicit calculations of canonical distinguished involutions in number of cases.  In the fourth part the investigator and his colleagues study the Double Affine Hecke Algebra.  The aim here is to describe Intersection Cohomology of certain infinite dimensional algebraic varieties in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig type combinatorics of this algebra.<br/><br/>In this proposal the investigator studies various questions of Representation Theory. Representation Theory is a part of mathematics that studies all possible ways in which symmetry can be used for solving concrete physical or technical problems.  Many physical and technical systems do not change under some transformations (e.g. the gravitational field of the Sun depends only on the distance from the Sun and so it does not change under rotating of the space around the Sun).  Such transformations are called symmetries of the system.  In many cases symmetries can be used to simplify the study of such systems.  So it is not surprising that Representation Theory has many applications in physics (where continuous symmetry is one of the most fundamental concepts), chemistry (especially in quantum chemistry where it is used in computations of chemical forces inside molecules), computer science (for example, Fourier analysis, which can be considered as a simplest case of Representation Theory, is one of the most widely used of all calculation techniques), and inside of mathematics itself, in number theory (where Representation Theory is an essential part of the Langlands program). One of the central objects of study in Representation  Theory is the affine Hecke algebra, because answers to many seemingly unrelated questions are encoded in the structure of this algebra.  This proposal is mainly devoted to the study of the affine Hecke algebra.<br/><br/>"

A common theme is the exploration of new ideas  for the construction of extremal objects; in particular, the investigator suggests new ideas for constructions in the  settings of Shannon capacity, the lonely runner conjecture,  and combinatorial discrepancy.  In the area of Shannon  capacity, the investigator has developed a new construction  for independent sets in the powers of odd cycles that is, in a sense, asymptotically optimal.  It is hoped that the algebraic ideas used in this construction can be further developed to give more insight into the Shannon capacities of odd cycles.  The investigator suggests a similar algebraic approach to a number of conjectures (conjectures that follow from recent work of R. Holzman, D. Kleitman and the investigator) concerning the extremal objects for the so-called lonely runner conjecture.  The research on combinatorial discrepancy is motivated by a conjecture of Lovasz, Spencer and Vestergombi on the relationship between the linear discrepancy and hereditary discrepancy of a hypergraph.  In addition to work on new constructions, this research includes questions in the fields of random graphs and the combinatorics  of cellular automata.<br/><br/>Questions considered in extremal combinatorics are of the  form: `How large (or small) can an object that lies in a particular discrete mathematical system and satisfies a certain  condition be?'  We are usually interested in the size of extremal objects for very large systems.  Interest in such  questions grew extensively during the twentieth century.  Pioneers of the field, such as Paul Erdos, had posed  many fascinating questions of this form and had devised  powerful methods for solving them even before the close connections between extremal combinatorics and various other fields (including computer science, statistical physics and information theory) had been discovered.  Shannon capacity is a prime example of the significant link between extremal combinatorics  and information theory.  Shannon capacity gives a measure of the zero-error performance of a noisy communications channel.  The investigator has developed new, near--optimal codes for  some notoriously difficult channels, and the proposed research includes further development of these codes with the goal of  determining the zero-error optimum of these channels.  The study  of cellular automata has been part of the recent interaction between extremal combinatorics and statistical physics.  Cellular  automata are discrete dynamical systems that have been used to model a wide range of physical phenomena.  The investigator  proposes research on the regularity of growth of certain cellular automata that model crystal growth.  This work is expected to have impact on our understanding of the shapes achieved by these models and their randomized counterparts.  <br/>"

The chromatic number of a hypergraph is the minimum number of colors used in a proper coloring.  Finding proper colorings using only few colors can be useful in many applications.  The assignment of colors can model resource allocation; the edges represent conflicts in usage of resources.  Areas of application include scheduling, database access, assignment of computer registers, data clustering, computer aided design of printed circuits, positional games, DNA sequencing, etc.  The more general model of list coloring allows to restrict the colors available for each vertex.  Each vertex is assigned a list of available colors.  The color for each vertex must be chosen from its list, but the constraints imposed by edges must still be satisfied by the chosen coloring.  List coloring can be used to model problems such as extension of colorings of subgraphs.  The list chromatic number of the hypergraph is the minimum k such that whenever all lists have size at least k, it is possible to choose a proper coloring from the assigned lists. A proper coloring with k colors can be considered as a list coloring with all the lists of vertices being the same (of size k).  Thus, the list chromatic number of a hypergraph always is at least the chromatic number.  Although one might think that the most difficult case of list coloring is when all the lists are the same (giving more conflicts for colors), this is not always the case.  Vizing and Erdos, Rubin, and Taylor gave examples of 2 colorable graphs with arbitrarily large list chromatic number.  On the other hand, in some classes of (hyper)graphs the list chromatic number behaves similarly to the (ordinary) chromatic number.<br/><br/>The main thrust of this project is to explore the analogs for list coloring of many results about ordinary coloring.  The issue is under what conditions there are similar bounds for related list coloring and coloring problems.  Upper bounds on coloring parameters can lead to efficient algorithms; lower bounds impose limits on what can be accomplished.  One question is when the list chromatic number actually equals the chromatic number.  Another is how many edges are needed to form a (hyper)graph with a given chromatic number, subject to various additional conditions; here a list coloring analogue will also be explored.  For classes of graphs obtained using intersections of geometric objects of special types, bounds on (list) chromatic number in terms of the maximum number of pairwise adjacent vertices are sought.  Many coloring problems have analogs using lists, and this project will begin the exploration of many of these list coloring problems.  For example, many generalized coloring parameters have bounded values on important classes of graphs such as the  planar graphs (those that embed in the plane without edge crossings).  Do such colorings still exist when the vertices are assigned color lists of bounded size?  Most of the work is planned to be done jointly with Douglas B.

Lusztig and Kashiwara have developed the deep and intricate theory of canonical bases for suitable modules over quantized enveloping algebras of Kac-Moody algebras. When the quantum parameter is set to zero (the \low temperature limit""), one obtains a colored directed graph called the crystal graph of the module. This remarkable graph encodes nearly all the important algebraic data of the module. Using the crystal graph, many algebraic problems are reduced to combinatorial ones. In the case of a+ne Kac-Moody algebras the combinatorics is particularly favorable; it was shown by Kang, Kashiwara, Misra, Miwa, Nakayashima, and Nakayashiki, that the elements of the crystal graph can be expressed as certain eventually periodic finite sequences of elements of very special finite crystal graphs called perfect crystals. In turn, the perfect crystals can be studied using techniques of classical combinatorics such as the theory of Young tableaux.<br/><br/>One goal is to determine explicitly the colored graph structure of crystals in a family whose existence was conjectured by Hatayama, Kuniba, Okado, Takagi, and Y. Yamada and which arose from the study of the Bethe Ansatz in integrable systems. Another goal is to give explicit formulae for certain multiplicities that arise in conformal field theory and statistical mechanics, such as fusion coefficients and branching functions. It is of particular interest to express such quantities in a certain form (\fermionic""), one which admits a quasi particle interpretation for the states of the underlying model. Such formulae have combinatorial descriptions in terms of the rigged configurations of A. N. Kirillov and N.-Y. Reshetikhin.  The second object of study is the family of Kazhdan-Lusztig (KL) polynomials for a+ne Weyl groups. For simple Lie algebras these polynomials are prominent in the geometry of Schubert varieties and in the representation theory of both the Weyl group and the simple algebraic group; these phenomena generalize for the a+ne algebras. One goal is to give explicit combinatorial (no alternating sums allowed) formulae for certain of these polynomials, which appear as graded multiplicities of irreducible modules for the associated simple Lie algebra, in the modules of twisted functions on the nullcone, the closure of the principal nilpotent adjoint orbit of the simple Lie algebra. A second goal is to give such formulae for certain parabolic KL polynomials for the a+ne Weyl group of type A, which can be expressed in terms of the ribbon tableaux of Lascoux, Leclerc, and Thibon."

The zeta function of an algebraic curve, that contains information about the number of rational points, can be defined for an arbitrary self-dual code.  The zeta function of a self-dual code contains information about the minimum distance of the code, which has an expression in terms of the trace of the zeros of the zeta function.

Recent successes demonstrate that these can provide powerful new methods for many areas of mathematics and can be the basis for breakthroughs on critical problems.  This project focuses, therefore, on a well defined and coherent research direction, made timely by recent advances, not on a single mathematical problem.<br/><br/>Model-theoretic methods typically involve identifying and axiomatizing the first order theories of classes of structures, studying their nonstandard models, identifying the class of definable sets in a structure (quantifier-elimination), and making use of the compactness theorem to work within rich nonstandard models.

Specifically, motivated by the monomer-monomer correlation introduced by Fisher and Stephenson, and based on the exact enumeration found by the proposer of the tilings of certain hexagonal regions with triangular holes along their symmetry axes (which generalizes MacMahon's theorem on counting plane partitions), the proposer pursues extending his work on the asymptotic enumeration of tilings in the situation when the holes are not necessarily on the symmetry axis of the region.  This should bring useful insight into an important conjecture of Fisher and Stephenson concerning the rotational invariance of the monomer-monomer correlation. Furthermore, the proposer studies three additional problems.  First, the proposer pursues extending the arguments that allowed him to prove directly one identity from a set of four similar identities he found relating eight of the ten symmetry classes of plane partitions to the remaining three identities.  This would help explaining the still mysterious fact that all ten cases are enumerated by simple product formulas and would bring close to completion the task of finding combinatorial proofs for all ten cases.  Second, the proposer continues his work on the three dimensional dimer problem by considering the question of improving the lower bound, employing extensions to three dimensions of the Gessel-Viennot and Kasteleyn theorems that yield signed enumerations.  And third, the proposer uses a generalization of his complementation theorem for perfect matchings to classify the periodic weightings of the Aztec diamond that lead to simple product enumeration formulas, thus giving a unified perspective on several results of Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen and Propp, B. Y. Yang, Stanley and the proposer.<br/><br/>This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged.  The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.  The specific problems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical physics.  A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant to the study of of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid, consisting of two-atom molecules --- the dimers in the model --- along the surface of a crystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two neighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given crystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule.  The main issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities that are studied (specifically, the number of different ways the surface of the crystal can be covered by molecules), but it turns out in the present context that the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities exactly allows progress in the asymptotic study.<br/>"

A typical question asks for integers, say a, b<br/>and c, that satisfy some given equation.  An example is the equation of<br/>Pythagoreas, which asks that the sum of the squares of a and b equal that<br/>of c.  There are very general and natural classes of such relations (such<br/>as those involved in the now proved Fermat conjecture) that probe to the<br/>heart of the theory of numbers; and the study of such equations forms the<br/>core of Mazurs research.  Raoul Botts work probes the manner in which<br/>families of symmetries can be used to simplify computations in mathematics<br/>and theoretical physics.  These symmetries relate different structures and<br/>often this relation equates a simple to understand property of one system<br/>to a mysterious and not understood property of another.  Clifford Taubes<br/>major project probes the possibilities for the large scale structure of<br/>four dimensional universes.

The research projects of the proposer are focused on the the combinatorial representation theory of affine Hecke algebras and Iwahori-Hecke algebras.

The type of models that are the most useful have the flavor of games for children, like LEGOS or ERECTOR sets, and yet these models enable one to obtain very explicit information about the fine structure of the corresponding representations. In analogy with molecular biology, a general representation is a large and complex structure like a molecule and is composed of smaller ``irreducible components'', analogous to atoms.  The research in this proposal is directed towards determining the properties of the irreducible components and on determining which irreducible components appear in naturally occuring ``standard'' representations."

The intention is to explore the connections between tree lattices and lattices in rank 1 Lie groups over non-archimedean fields.  The investigator is interested in making explicit constructions of non-uniform lattices contained within  rank 1 Lie groups, comparing them with general tree lattices, covolumes, questions of arithmeticity and commensurability, and Hausdorff dimension.  Concerning lattices in Lie groups, A. Lubotzky showed that rank 1 Lie groups over non-archimedean local fields contain uncountably many conjugacy classes of lattices.  The investigator has obtainted a topological description of Lubotzky's deformation spaces of lattices.  The aim now is to investigate  the analytic and algebro-geometric structure of these deformation spaces, and to construct infinite dimensional deformation spaces for non-uniform lattices.  The investigator and  H. Garland have established that Kac-Moody groups over finite fields contain lattices.  The aim is now to show that in rank 2 there are deformation spaces of lattices and to investigate the structure of the deformation spaces, of fundamental domains for non-uniform lattices, and of commensurability groups of uniform lattices in rank 2.  Under consideration also is the existence of uniform lattices and spherical buildings in higher rank, congruence subgroups, and lattices in non-split and generalized Kac-Moody groups.

The networks (graphs) have long been used as abstract mathematical descriptions of real-life social and technological networks. In 1960 Erdos and Renyi began studying a mathematical model of a graph with many vertices that slowly evolves in time, as one link after another is inserted between two randomly selected nodes. However idealized, this model captured a combinatorial complexity of the real networks that are poorly connected at the inception and become more and more tight as more and more pairwise links appear in a chaotic fashion. Erdos and Renyi discovered a remarkable mathematical phenomenon: for a long time the evolving graph remains split in many small connected components, and then during a relatively short time period the graph undergoes a dramatic transition which results in the appearance of a giant connected subnetwork (subgraph) that contains a positive fraction of all vertices. This pioneering work started an avalanche of research aimed at elucidating deeper feautures of the phase transition phenomenon and tracking down the likely changes in the graph structure after the giant component has appeared. This research includes a detailed study of the group of largest components at the moments when they are about to merge into a giant component. Another component of this research is to have a close look at a core of the giant component, i.e. the largest subset of vertices in that component which are connected to each other noticeably stronger than to the other vertices. The principal investigator will work on alternative random graph models that may be closer to the real-life networks. One such network is the World Wide Web. There is a body of interesting, but not rigorous, research on the networks that grow population-wise in such a way that the most connected nodes are statistically preferred as contacts by the arrivals. The proposer plans to study these network growth processes jointly with D. Aldous and A. Frieze.<br/> Other classic examples of combinatorial structures are the partitions of sets and integers. And again there are numerous illustrations of how useful and insightful these abstractions are in applications. An integer partition is a partition of a given integer into decreasing parts. A central problem is to study the structure of a partition chosen at random among all such partitions. Since the pioneering work by Erdos and Lehner, the studies by Szalay, Turan, Fristedt and this investigator resulted in discovery of a rather detailed picture (shape) of the typical partition. The investigator plans to continue his research on the random integer partitions, and to extend it to the random plane partitions, a surprisingly rich combinatorial scheme, whose probabilistic aspects have only started to emerge. The investigator plans to combine enumerational tools and the probabilistic techniques in order to study the geometric characteristics of the typical plane partitions. The random partitions have been found critically important in probabilistic studies of optimization problems. One such well known problem is to partition a given set of numbers (weights) into two groups so that the weights of two groups are as close to each other as possible. Simplicity of this problem is deceiving: there is no efficient algorithm to solve it when the set of weights is large. It is natural then to switch attention and to study computational complexity of a typical problem when the individual weights are random. In on-going joint research C. Borgs, J. Chayes and the investigator have found a parameter of the problem whose value plays a crucial role in determination of how intrinsically difficult a typical instance of the problem is. Much as the partition problem differs from the evolving random graph, there is a striking similarity between two structures: both experience a rapid transition within a surprisingly narrow window on the parameter scale. The research will continue, and the collaborators plan to broaden it, to include various other optimization problems."

The central unifying notion <br/>in geometry is that of curvature. Now, through these diverse<br/>geometric and combinatorial theories, curvature is emerging <br/>as a powerful tool and fundamental unifying concept in <br/>combinatorics as well.  This Focused Research Group will <br/>explore some of the specific notions of combinatorial<br/>curvature driving current combinatorial work, and also the <br/>role of curvature as the basis for a coherent geometric <br/>vision of combinatorics itself.<br/><br/>The notion of curvature has been one of the grand unifying <br/>concepts in geometry and physics for well over a century.  <br/>For example, Gauss, the originator of our modern understanding <br/>of curvature, showed that Euclidean geometry was distinguished <br/>from other geometries as being the geometry of a space with <br/>zero curvature. As an application he showed that it is<br/>precisely the curvature of the surface of the Earth which makes <br/>it impossible to draw a map of the Earth's surface (on a flat <br/>piece of paper) that accurately portrays all lengths and angles.<br/>Riemann generalized Gauss's work to smooth spaces of higher <br/>dimensions, and Einstein observed that Riemannian geometry<br/>was precisely the right setting in which to describe his <br/>theory of general relativity (in which the curvature of the <br/>universe is the result of gravitational forces). Partly as a <br/>result of Einstein's work, the last century saw an intensive investigation into the curvature of smooth spaces.<br/>Combinatorics, roughly defined, is the study of objects which <br/>can be described by a finite amount of information.  This is <br/>precisely the mathematics that computers can do.  This type of mathematics seems far removed from the geometric investigations <br/>of Gauss, Riemann and countless others.  However, there is a <br/>growing collection of  combinatorial phenomena which can best <br/>be viewed as being finite analogues of facts about the curvature <br/>of smooth spaces.  The goal of this proposal is to come to a<br/>coherent understanding of curvature as a combinatorial notion. <br/>In addition, bringing together researchers from a variety of mathematical disciplines, we wish to bridge the chasms between geometry, combinatorics, algebra and topology, using curvature <br/>as the unifying theme.<br/>  <br/><br/>"

Altogether, the proposal<br/>contains 19 problem sets: five from Algorithmic Number Theory, three<br/>from Algebraic Number Theory, five from Commutative and Homological<br/>Algebra, three from the Geometry of Numbers, and three from Group Theory.<br/>The collection has been composed with a view towards assisting the<br/>investigator's many current and future graduate students in choosing<br/>suitable thesis subjects. The problems have the appealing features of<br/>appearing to be feasible without being trivial, and of being specific<br/>without being narrow. They belong to mainstream areas that will also<br/>serve the students after obtaining their degrees. Of the nineteen<br/>problem sets, the following two are both easy to formulate and<br/>attractive. The first is the development of an algorithmic theory of<br/>quadratic forms over rings and fields of arithmetic interest. A typical<br/>question is how quickly one can find a representation of a positive<br/>integer as a sum of four squares. Or: it is known that any odd unimodular<br/>indefinite inner product space over the ring of integers is<br/>diagonalizable; given the symmetric matrix that defines the inner<br/>product, how quickly can one find the change of basis that diagonalizes<br/>the form? A first investigation shows that one may expect a wide spectrum<br/>of answers to the algorithmic questions in this area, displaying all the<br/>riches of number-theoretic algorithms. The second is giving class number<br/>estimates for orders in number fields. What is a good upper bound for the<br/>number of equivalence classes of fractional ideals of a giving order,<br/>expressed as a function of the degree and the discriminant of the order?<br/>And can one find better estimates for orders that have nice properties,<br/>such as being Gorenstein? This type of question is of importance in the<br/>theory of abelian varieties, and one will need to apply techniques coming<br/>from commutative algebra, abelian group theory, combinatorics, and<br/>elementary analytic number theory.<br/><br/>In order to place the project in perspective one may consider the recent<br/>development of number theory. Present day number theory differs in two<br/>important respects from number theory twenty five years ago, namely in<br/>the roles played by algorithms and computers, and by algebraic geometry.<br/>It has been found that algorithmic number theory has important<br/>applications, notably in cryptography, and in addition number theorists<br/>have learned how to use computers for their research. Inventing good<br/>computational methods for number-theoretic problems has thus become of<br/>central importance. One of the principal investigator's strengths is in<br/>the interaction between theory and practice, on the one hand using recent<br/>theoretical advances for algorithmic purposes and on the other hand<br/>deriving purely mathematical inspiration from the problems suggested by<br/>the applications. At the other end of the spectrum, knowledge of<br/>algebraic geometry has become a standard requirement for aspiring number<br/>theorists. Virtually every breakthrough in number theory over the past<br/>few decades, including Andrew Wiles's work on Fermat's Last Theorem, has<br/>involved arithmetic algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry depends on a<br/>broad spectrum of techniques from algebra and algebraic number theory,<br/>and gives rise to an unending array of tantalizing questions in those<br/>areas, of which the project studies a sample. What is maybe the most<br/>exciting of all, is the way in which arithmetic algebraic geometry and<br/>algorithmic number theory are presently being tied together, both in the<br/>application of geometric objects to cryptography and in the application<br/>of algorithmic techniques to investigate geometric objects in number<br/>theory.

The focus of the first part is a numerical invariant, called the base change conductor, defined using the Neron models.  This numerical invariant measures the difference between the Neron models of a semiabelian variety before and after making a finite base extension so that the semiabelian variety acquires semistable reduction.  For an abelian variety over a number field, the base change conductor is equal to the decrease of Faltings height under stabilization.  Recently E. de Shalit, J.-K. Yu and Chai proved that the base change conductor for a torus is equal to one half of the Artin conductor, using a congruence property for Neron models they discovered.  This congruence property has been extended to abelian varieties by Chai.  The explicit goals of the first project include:  (a) Prove that the base change conductor for an abelian variety with potentially ordinary reduction is equal to the pairing between two central functions on the Galois group: the character of the Galois representation on the character group of a formal torus obtained from the Neron model, and a specific central function defined for every finite Galois extension.  This specific central function has values in some cyclotomic extension of the field of p-adic numbers; it can be thought of as a ""bisection of the Artin conductor"" because the sum of this function with its complex conjugate is equal to the Artin character.  (b) Prove an additivity property of the base change conductor.  (c) Study the elementary divisors of the base change conductor.  The second project is centered around the Hecke orbit problem and Oort's ""foliation structure"" for good reductions of Shimura variety.  A notion of ""Tate-linear"" subvarieties of reduction of Shimura varieties with ordinary points will be investigated.  (d) Verify in lower-rank cases the conjecture that every Tate-linear subvarieties is equal to the reduction of a Shimura subvariety.

A typical problem in Arithmetic Geometry concerns polynommial equations.  For a system of polynomial equations, the degree of complexity of drops if one is allowed to use more general numbers, because it becomes easier to find solutions.

The aim of this proposal is to suggest some new links, and to explore and expand the existing ones.  The first proposed project involves a conjectural extension of the Fourier-Mukai transform, or the spectral construction, to several new situations, including fibrations without sections, noncommutative geometries, and higher dimensional complex or special Lagrangian torus fibers.  The special Lagrangian case in particular casts new light on the SYZ approach to mirror symmetry and suggests the existence of an integrable system structure on the stringy moduli space of Calabi-Yaus.  The next two projects involve applications of the first to two central issues of quantum field theory and string theory.  Specifically, the second project seeks to derive a fully realistic version of the Standard Model of particle physics, starting from particular M-theory vacua.  This is based on the construction techniques for vector bundles on genus-1 fibrations discussed in the first project.  The third project studies several aspects of the other major conjectural string duality, the one between the heterotic string and F-theory.  Proposed work includes the rigorous establishment of the isomorphism on all strata of the geometric boundary in complete generality, and its extension to the interior in one important case where it may also be possible to establish the equality of the superpotentials on both sides.<br/><br/>String theory is generally considered to be the leading candidate for a unified physical theory which explains everything we know about the physical world, from the smallest sub-particle scales to the entire universe.  Our confidence in the power of string theory to describe the real world relies to a great extent on the recent discovery of string dualities and their understanding via geometric tools.  This proposal aims to explore and expand these recent applications of algebraic geometry to string theory and especially to dualities. It also includes a range of educational activities, including curriculum development, the writing of a textbook, and extensive work with undergraduate and graduate students, aimed at the dissemination of new knowledge concerning the interactions of mathematics and high energy physics.<br/>"

While numerical <br/>approximations exist, concrete analytic information is <br/>somewhat scarce; in particular, at present no explicit <br/>constructions exist for any of these eigenfunctions. These <br/>mathematical objects are of interest in such seemingly <br/>diverse fields as number theory in mathematics and dynamical <br/>systems, statistical mechanics, and quantum chaos in <br/>theoretical physics. The starting point for this project is<br/>a new class of functions equivalent to the Maass forms, called <br/>period functions in analogy with the period polynomials <br/>associated to the classical modular forms of integral weight. <br/>These functions, discovered by the investigator and developed <br/>individually and more recently in collaboration with D. Zagier, <br/>are holomorphic and satisfy a simple functional equation, and <br/>so appear to be simpler class of mathematical objects than the <br/>Maass forms themselves. For this reason, and because the <br/>development of their algebraic structure leads in a number of <br/>different interrelated and intriguing directions, they show <br/>promise to continue to shed new light on this basic problem. <br/>Their further development and the extension of these results <br/>to general subgroups, using representation theory and cohomology <br/>of groups, are the main goals of this project. In addition, <br/>connections between period functions and certain equations which <br/>arise both in the study of transfer operators for dynamical <br/>systems and in the study of spin-chain partition functions in <br/>statistical mechanics are already under study by several <br/>researchers, including one working group in Germany which <br/>is specifically investigating these questions. The applications <br/>of Maass period functions to these related areas of theoretical <br/>physics is thus also a focus of this work, to be pursued including <br/>discussions with researchers working on these problems. <br/><br/><br/>  Research in mathematics and related theoretical physics will <br/>use methods developed by the investigator and his colleagues to <br/>gain more concrete and explicit information about Maass wave forms. <br/>These functions are one type in a class called ""modular forms"" <br/>which has many applications in such diverse fields as number theory, <br/>physics, and cryptography (or code making and breaking). Maass wave <br/>forms in particular are the non-Euclidean version of the sine waves <br/>(or pure tones - the wave form produced by striking a tuning fork) <br/>in ordinary space, which are the basic components out of which all <br/>shapes are built. The study of geometry and physics in this non-<br/>Euclidean ""parallel universe"" has provided science with a rich source <br/>of new ideas, as well as a contrasting proving ground on which to <br/>sharpen ideas in the geometry and physics of the space we live in. <br/>For example, the study of the behavior of Maass forms provides very <br/>useful insights in the quest to gain a deeper understanding of the <br/>conditions under which a physical system will exhibit regular or <br/>chaotic behavior, an important and pervasive question in physics. <br/>Maass forms have proven mysteriously hard to construct explicitly, <br/>and continue to be under active investigation fifty years after <br/>their discovery.  <br/>    <br/><br/>  <br/>"

(The prototypical example is f(a,p)=(a/p), the Legendre symbol; more general examples are given by p-coefficients of L-functions of various algebraic-geometric objects depending on parameters a.)  Such functions f are generally not polynomials in (p,a) hence they ``transcend the language of algebraic geometry''.  The first main idea of the proposal is to enlarge usual algebraic geometry by ``adjoining'' one new operation, the ``Fermat quotient operation'' which, on the adeles of the rational numbers, acts as by sending the p-th entry x(p) of the adele into the Fermat quotient of x(p) with respect to p.  The main conjectural principle proposed will be that the ring of functions of this larger geometry (called the ring of Fermat adeles)  can be used to ``represent'' many of the interesting arithmetic functions f as above.  For each fixed p, such a geometry has been introduced by the investigator in his previous research; the main task in the present proposal is to make p vary ``geometrically''.  The strategy of the approach, at least for Abelian varieties, is to use Siegel differential modular forms (which are an analogue, in this larger geometry, of usual Siegel modular forms).  The study of Siegel differential modular forms is the second main theme of the proposal.  A different motivation for the study of Siegel differential modular forms can be described as follows.  On the ``moduli space'' A of principally polarized Abelian schemes of dimension g there is a natural equivalence relation ~ given by ``isogeny''. The quotient A/~ does not exist, in any reasonable sense, in usual algebraic geometry, but it has a nice substitute in the larger, ``Fermat adelic geometry''.  The embedding of A/~ into a projective space should be given by Siegel differential modular forms in a way similar to the embedding of A into a projective space, given by usual Siegel modular forms. A series of problems then arise as to the ``projective geometry'' and ``cohomology'' of A/~.  This point of view can be generalized to other quotients X/~ where X is a scheme of finite type over the integers and ~ is an ``arithmetically defined equivalence relation'' on X.<br/><br/>One of the main problems of number theory is to understand how various quantities that naturally depend on prime numbers vary as the prime number varies.  The variation of these quantities is not governed by classical algebraic geometry in the sense that these quantities are not polynomial or algebraic functions of the variable prime number.  The investigator proposes to develop a new geometry that would describe this variation.  This geometry would be obtained from the classical algebraic geometry by adjoining one more operation, the Fermat quotient.  Once geometry has been enlarged in this way, a series of puzzling quotient objects that did not have any geometric meaning in classical algebraic geometry start making sense geometrically.  This particular way of looking at arithmetic functions and quotient problems in arithmetic algebraic geometry should bring a new, geometric, intuition into the study of these objects.<br/>"

The main goal of the project is the construction of norm varieties for arbitrary weights and primes, the computation of some of their characteristic numbers and of some of their K-cohomology groups.  Cohomological invariants are characteristic classes for G-torsors over a field.  Classical examples are the discriminant and the Hasse-Witt invariant for quadratic forms.  There is a huge variety of known cohomological invariants for various linear algebraic groups.  One objective of this project is to get a better systematic understanding of cohomological invariants, but also to investigate certain particular cases.
