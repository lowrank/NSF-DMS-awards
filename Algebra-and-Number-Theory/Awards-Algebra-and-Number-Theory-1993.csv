A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                multiplication defined on it.  Every element a in the ring has an               additive inverse usually denoted -a.  However, elements are not                 required to have multiplicative inverses.  A ring in which every                nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse is called a field.                 This project concerns the relationship between the multiplicative               structure of a field and that of its subfields.  It involves a                  combination of techniques from field theory, group theory and                   number theory."

During the proposed research period, the                     emphasis will be in an area that has in recent years been called                ""computational Convexity"".  It forms an interface that involves                 aspects of convex geometry, discrete mathematics, computer                      science, and operations research.  In essence, it is the study of               the computational and algorithmic aspects of high-dimensional                   convex bodies (essentially polytopes).                                               The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                      Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                   discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete                systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                   example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                 and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                  discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research."

The monodromy method takes the following form.               A precise statement S about Diophantine equations translates to                 this: Rational points on certain varieties produce a desired                    Galois theory situation ""g"".  By forgetting where the Galois                    theory arises, we get a group theory situation G.  The method                   applies the group theory to solve G.  It then eliminates                        geometric situations in the list of ""g"" that don't correspond to                what remains of G.  This leaves the harder problem of deciding if               what geometrically remains produces the arithmetic situation                    under investigation.

The AS regular rings have been a subject of considerable research               recently, since they provide genuinely new, geometric techniques                for the study of noncommutative rings and are related to other                  areas of current interest, notably quantum groups.  The principal               investigator will study specific, important examples of these                   algebras to develop the abstract theory of AS regular algebras                  and the related theory of ""noncommutative projective geometry"".

An example of a ring for which                          multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                      matrices over the integers.

The  other principal investigator will study the internal structure of  simple Lie algebras in prime charateristic, where the ground  field is assumed algebraically closed and over general fields of  characteristic zero.  The majority of the support is for graduate  students working with the principal investigators.       This award supports research in two areas of algebra --  finite group theory and the theory of Lie algebras.  A group is  an algebraic object with a single operation defined on it.  It  has important applications in mathematics, chemistry, computer  science and physics.  Lie algebras arise from another object  called a Lie group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations  of a sphere where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie  groups and Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis  of spherical motion.  ***"

The type of variety under                       consideration is a twisted form of G/P where G is a split                       reductive algebraic group and P is a parabolic subgroup of G.                   The index reduction formula will follow from a knowledge of the                 Grothendieck group of the variety of interest, which has been                   computed in general only when G is connected.  The principal                    investigator will investigate the Grothendieck group of the                     twisted forms of G/P when G is not connected, where it is clear                 from examples that some new phenomena not seen in the connected                 case will arise. The principal investigator will also study                     central simple algebras with involution, and the associated                     generalized even Clifford algebras.                                                  This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring               is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                            multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                  satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                  not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                          multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                      matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                  has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing               significance to other branches of mathematics and physics."

One of the problems that Professor Cox will                address will be the issue of assigning a coordinate ring to a                   toric variety in a natural way.  This ring should be a polynomial               ring and should depend only on the toric variety and not on a                   particular projective embedding.  Professor Cox has a suggested                 construction which seems to have many of the needed properties.                      This research uses the techniques of algebraic geometry, one               of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had                a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                   origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and                        robotics."

Asymptotic improvement in the efficiency of                      combinatorial generation requires not only good data structures                 and algorithm design techniques, but more often, some new insight               into the structure of the combinatorial class involved.  These                  structure questions are in the realm of well-known open problems                in discrete mathematics, graph theory, group theory, and                        combinatorics.

The behavior of discrete                systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                   example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                 and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                  discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research."

Besides its importance in physics, the beautiful and rich                       mathematical structure of conformal field theory also has                       interested many mathematicians.  New relations between different                branches of mathematics, such as representations of                             infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces                  and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic group, modular                       functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is               revealed in the study of conformal field theory.  It is believed                that the study of the mathematics involved in conformal field                   theory will lead to new mathematical structures which will be                   important both in mathematics and theoretical physics."

The principal investigator will establish results on the structure and embedding of reductive subgroups of simple algebraic groups; work on linking the subgroup structure of finite groups to that of algebraic groups; study the representation theory of the symmetric groups over fields of positive characteristic; and study representations of finite groups of Lie type over a field of the defining characteristic. A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation. It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and chemistry. The fundamental building blocks of finite groups are finite simple groups. One of the major results in mathematics of the past decade is the classification of the finite simple groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal pages. This research is aimed at using this classification in the study of arbitrary finite groups."

Probabilistic and asymptotic properties of finite groups will be studied: the nature of random elements, or of random subgroups, of a given permutation group. Some results obtained will be applied to algorithmic questions concerning permutation groups. The study of polynomial-time and parallel (complexity class NC) group-theoretic algorithms will be continued. Additional new practical group-theoretic algorithms will be obtained, in some cases based on methods developed in polynomial-time situations. All of this work will make detailed use of the classification and properties of finite groups. Some of these algorithms depend on geometric methods. Other geometric projects will be continued including investigations into the number of planes, designs, generalized quadrangles, or other geometries, based upon special properties of their automorphism groups. This project is in the general area of finite group theory and the computer-aided computational aspects of this field. There is a growing interest in using computers to answer theoretical questions in algebra and conversely, algebra is quite useful for the development of algorithms. This project makes serious use of both the theory and practice of symbolic calculations to solve real problems in group theory."

Professor Hayes will be addressing Stark's conjectures in class field theory. These conjectures are an ingenious and highly original answer to the questions raised by the famous 12 problem of Hilbert. Professor Hayes has given constructed proofs of the abelian Stark conjectures in function fields and he now hopes to apply his insights to the number field case. This is research in the field of number theory. Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics."

In recent years several general model-theoretic problems have been systematically approached via the stability-theoretic hierarchy. Even though a problem itself may not involve stability-theoretic notions, considering separately the cases: totally transcendental, superstable, etc., brings into play a mass of technical machinery. Such is the case for Vaught's conjecture, which was proved by Shelah for totally transcendental theories and (over the past 5 years) by Buechler for the superstable theories of finite rank. Buechler intends to continue using the methods of geometrical stability theory to gain insight into Vaught's conjecture for all superstable theories. The geometrical methods bring modules into the picture, allowing for the use of representation theory and other algebra to pin down further the models of these theories. This research lies in the general setting of abstract ""Classification Theory."" In many diverse branches of mathematics researchers attempt to code each element of a class of structures with an element of a ""simpler"" class of structures. The original class is then more easily analyzed, using the more detailed information that one can obtain for this simpler class. Classification Theory is the abstract study of such codings. Researchers have shown that it is possible to determine when such a simplification exists by using only rather basic information about the original class. Buechler intends to study when an abstract class can be simplified down to a very precise class of objects called ""modules,"" which have been studied in great detail by algebraists."
