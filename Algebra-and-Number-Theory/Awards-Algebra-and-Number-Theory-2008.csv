The set of solutions can then be viewed geometrically, but it is often best encoded into a family of functions defined on this set.  The abstract version of such families of functions are called commutative rings.  Homological algebra brings to the study of rings methods of algebraic topology, developed to study geometric structures.  Methods for decomposing complicated structures into primitive building blocks are developed as part of a different branch of algebra, known as representation theory.<br/><br/>Avramov will investigate problems arising at a crossroads of commutative algebra, homological algebra, and representation theory. <br/>The combination of different points of view allows for a fruitful transfer of techniques and intuition between fields.<br/><br/>Properties of commutative noetherian rings will be studied through numerical, algebraic, and geometric invariants generated by homological constructions.  These include free resolutions, Hochschild cohomology, stable cohomology, cohomological support varieties, derived categories of modules and of differential modules.  Special attention will be paid to developing finitistic recognition criteria for geometrically important properties of families of commutative rings.  Connections through homological algebra with representation theory of finite dimensional algebra will be studied.<br/><br/>"

Recently it has become increasingly apparent that L-functions most naturally fit into families, and that many properties of an individual L-function can be studied through the family.  In particular, the study of mean values of L-functions can be used to understand the sizes (such as nonvanishing and subconvexity) of L-functions at special values, which have great arithmetical interest.  Furthermore, there is evidence that some families are connected to other families, a property that has been detected through careful evaluation of certain mean values; for example, Motohashi's celebrated exact formula connecting the fourth moment of the Riemann zeta function to the Hecke-Maass L-functions associated to the full modular group.  The PI intends to investigate certain higher moment problems using techniques from analytic number theory to gain insight into higher degree L-functions.  Furthermore, the PI seeks to develop new formulas connecting families of L-functions.<br/><br/>The Riemann zeta function is the basic example of an L-function.  The distribution of the prime numbers, the fundamental particles of the integers, are intertwined with properties of the Riemann zeta function, as predicted by the Riemann Hypothesis.  The Riemann zeta function itself is just one part of a complex web of L-functions that themselves interact in mysterious ways.  This project aims to further the understanding of the Riemann zeta function and its generalizations, especially by finding new links between different kinds of L-functions."

This leads naturally to considering the distribution of points with special properties on subvarieties of Shimura varieties. These special properties can be interpreted as meaning that the points lie on the intersection of the subvariety with certain Shimura subvarieties. This leads to studying open conjectures in the theory of Shimura varieties. We also propose an approach independent of these conjectures which would involve studying the locus of ``irreducible'' points on subvarieties of Shimura varieties. We propose developing a transcendence theory for more general varieties in a family, and for more general period maps as well as for periods of higher order forms. <br/><br/>A fundamental problem in transcendence theory is the determination of the exceptional set of a function, that is the set of algebraic numbers at which the function assumes algebraic values. A classical result is that the exceptional set of the exponential function consists only of the origin. This implies that e and pi are transcendental. In previous work, we determine the exceptional set of the classical hypergemetric function and its generalization to several complex variables by relating these functions to families of algebraic curves. We intend to extend this work to a wider class of functions related to more general families of algebraic curves and varieties. <br/><br/>"

The theory of Ehrhart polynomials is of broad interest to the mathematics community due to connections with commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, combinatorics, discrete and convex geometry, and number theory.  The PI studies roots and coefficients of Ehrhart polynomials, with particular focus on reflexive polytopes.  The PI also investigates problems regarding graph and poset homomorphism complexes, continuing the application of algebraic topology to combinatorics.  The PI studies possible homotopy test graphs and investigates connections between poset homomorphism complexes and poset order dimension.  Finally, in joint work with Richard Ehrenborg, the PI studies simplicial subcomplexes of the boundary complexes of associahedra arising from triangulations of non-convex polygons.<br/><br/>Mathematics has historically been driven by the interplay between discrete and continuous structures.  Contemporary problems arising from the interaction of combinatorics, algebra, and topology continue this tradition.  The study of polytopes began in antiquity, with roots in the solid geometry of Euclid.  Ehrhart theory is a contemporary approach to studying polytopes from a combinatorial and algbraic perspective, producing from a polytope with integer vertices a polynomial counting lattice points in integral dilates of that polytope.  The roots and coefficients of these polynomials are known to carry some combinatorial and geometric data, but there are many open questions about exactly how far this line of investigation can be taken.  The study of graphs began in the 1700's with investigations by Euler, and has found modern day applications in most areas of science and engineering.  Studying chromatic numbers of graphs by moving to the continuous world leads to investigations of topological spaces with symmetries arising from symmetries of the graphs under consideration.  Investigations in this direction have been successful so far, and many open questions remain.<br/>"

Broadly speaking, they plan to chart the landscape of L-functions and modular forms in a systematic and concrete fashion. They will study these functions, develop algorithms for their computation, and test fundamental conjectures, including: the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, the Bloch-Kato conjecture, the correlation conjectures of Montgomery and of Rudnick-Sarnak, the density conjectures of Katz-Sarnak, automorphy of the Hasse-Weil zeta functions, and the Selberg eigenvalue conjecture. They plan to carry out a systematic study, theoretically, algorithmically, and experimentally of degree 1, 2, 3, 4 L-functions and their associated modular forms, including classical modular forms, Maass forms for GL(2), GL(3), GL(4), Siegel modular forms, and Hilbert modular forms.  They will also investigate symmetric square and cube L-functions, Rankin-Selberg convolution L-functions, the Hasse-Weil L-functions of algebraic varieties, Artin L-functions associated to 3- and 4-dimensional Galois representations, and, less systematically, look at a few high degree L-functions associated to higher symmetric powers and higher dimensional Galois representations.<br/><br/>L-functions and modular forms underlie much of twentieth century number theory and are connected to the practical applications of number theory in cryptography. Virtually all branches of number theory have been touched by L-functions and modular forms. Besides containing deep information concerning the distribution of prime numbers and the structure of elliptic curves, they feature prominently in Andrew Wiles' solution of the famous 350-year-old Fermat's Last Theorem, and in the twentieth century classification of congruent numbers, a problem first posed by Arab mathematicians one thousand years. In spite of their central importance, mathematicians have only scratched the surface of these crucial and powerful functions. The PI and his research team are undertaking a major new project to systematically tabulate and study these functions. Their work will fall into four categories: theoretical, algorithmic, experimental, and data gathering.  The theoretical work will be stimulated by their goal of charting the world of L-functions and modular forms. Their experimental work will involve testing many key conjectures concerning these functions. The project will produce a large amount of training, with plans for three graduate student schools, an undergraduate research experience, and support for a score of postdocs and graduate students who will assist in research. It will result in the creation of a vast amount of data about a wide range of modular forms and L-functions, which will far surpass in range and depth anything computed before in this area. The data will be organized in a freely available online data archive, along with the actual programs that were used to generate these tables. By providing these tables and tools online, the researchers will guarantee that the usefulness of this project will extend far beyond the circle of researchers on this FRG. The archive will be a rich source of examples and tools for researchers working on L-functions and modular forms for years to come, and will allow for future updates and expansion.<br/>"

It is arguably the ultimate algebraic geometry event of 2008.<br/><br/>Miles Reid has been one of the main original architects of the revolutionary Minimal Model Program (MMP) starting in the 1980s and continuing today. This conference celebrates his 60th birthday, but beyond that occasion, perhaps more importantly, it brings together the best of the best in higher dimensional algebraic geometry. The fact that this conference is related to the birthday of one of the leaders of the field is assurance that the list of speakers and participants is truly spectacular.<br/><br/>The MMP was developed as a tool in the classification of algebraic varieties (geometric objects defined by algebraic equations). The theory for curves was already known to Riemann and his contemporaries and for surfaces the classical Italian school. The surface theory was completed by Kodaira in the 1960s. Due to results discovered in the 1970s, it was believed that a similar theory was not possible in dimensions higher than two. That view was altered by the work of Miles Reid and lead to groundbreaking results by Reid and Mori as well as by Kawamata, Kollar and Shokurov. For his contribution to the theory, Mori received the Fields Medal in 1990 reflecting on the importance the theory plays in algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>The MMP was completed for 3-folds in the 1980s and most of it was developed in arbitrary dimension at that time, leaving one central problem open for a quarter of a century. Recently Hacon and McKernan achieved an extraordinary breakthrough on that open problem which created a buzz and rekindled interest in the development of the theory (interest in its applicationa never faded).<br/><br/>The conference features 12 world famous speakers including most of the major figures in MMP, 2 Field Medalists at least 9 ICM speakers. The present grant's main purpose is to make it possible for junior researchers, including some graduate students to participate in this unique event.<br/>"

Many questions in commutative algebra, first studied by Auslander, Peskine-Szpiro, and Serre, relate homological properties of modules to other invariants such as depth or dimension. One of the most often exploited properties allows the modules to have finite projective dimensions. Recently, it has emerged that over rings with nice enough singularities, a much weaker condition suffices: being zero in the reduced, rational Grothendieck group of finitely generated modules. The PI will, broadly speaking, pursue a program to investigate the type of singularities for which the classical questions can be extended. This approach simultaneously generates several other projects. <br/>One of them will study a new, asymptotic version of Serre's intersection multiplicity over local complete intersections. Another project will investigate a local version of Hartshorne's conjecture on Chow groups of smooth projective hypersurfaces and its consequences on splitting of vector bundles. <br/><br/>The questions being studied lie naturally at the intersection of algebraic geometry, commutative algebra and algebraic K-theory. <br/>Algebraic geometry studies shapes and properties of solutions of polynomial equations. Commutative algebra focuses more on general objects, such as rings of functions and modules over them. Both of these fields have been studied for a very long time and are still developing rapidly, with newly discovered connections to many areas of mathematics and sciences, such as physics, statistics, and coding theory. This project will utilize a relatively new viewpoin from algebraic K-theory, which examines subtle invariants of rings, to understand nice properties of geometric and algebraic objects."

Number theory has to do with such objects as prime numbers and diophantine equations. Other than being perhaps the oldest branch of mathematics, it is of great significance in today's world, since many cryptographic protocols (needed for secure transmissions over the internet) and error correcting codes (needed for compact discs, hard discs and the like) are based on number theoretic methods. These practical applications in fact involve rather sophisticated geometrical objects such as elliptic curves. Over the last half-century, we have realized that one can gain a better understanding of these geometric objects by studying certain functions, called L-functions. Conjecturally one expects that very interesting information about the geometric object is encoded in the behavior of the associated L-function at certain special points. The investigator hopes to deepen our understanding of this connection through the work to be done in the current proposal. One of the concrete consequences of this project will be a new method to find solutions in rational numbers to certain cubic equations, a central problem in number theory.<br/><br/>"

KUMUNU is an annual weekend conference anchored by the Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri- Columbia (MU) and Nebraska-Lincoln (NU), promoting interaction among researchers, post docs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines (such as algebraic geometry, K-theory and coding theory) at regional schools (which in 2007 included 16 different institutions). Although the KUMUNU triad has significant strength in these areas, geographic separation raises a hurdle to taking the most advantage of this strength. Fortunately, the distances are small enough that regional participants can fairly inexpensively gather at a central location for a weekend conference. The goal of the KUMUNU conference series is to provide a cost-effective annual venue for regional researchers at various stages of their careers, including graduate students, recent PhD's and faculty at nonPhD granting institutions, to interact with each other and with experienced researchers based at KU, MU, NU and a limited number of invited experts from outside the region.<br/><br/>Travel and lodging support to facilitate participation, especially for graduate students, is a key element for KUMUNU to achieve its main goals. These include: playing a strong regional mentoring role at all levels by showcasing the research of post docs and young faculty and by helping recent Ph.D.s and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines enrich their research programs by meeting senior researchers based at KU, MU, NU and elsewhere; and promoting research in commutative algebra by providing a venue for discussion of the latest developments in the field, for exchanging ideas and for setting the basis for future research collaborations. The conference design also furthers these goals: KUMUNU comprises 6 or 7 plenary talks accessible to graduate students by speakers representing a geographically diverse mix of senior researchers, young faculty and post docs, with plenty of time reserved outside of talks for additional interaction. The relatively small size of the meeting and its geographic and disciplinary focus also encourage participants to establish productive collaborative relationships. In addition to the stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of the students and early career participants, participants from nonPhD granting institutions will take ideas from the conference back to their colleagues and students, stimulating further research and mathematical enrichment at their home institutions.<br/><br/>"

The workshop has become internationally recognized for both its high-quality research talks and its supportive atmosphere for junior researchers. <br/><br/>Participants give presentations covering all areas related to automorphic forms, including Maass wave forms, elliptic curves, Siegel and Jacobi modular forms, special values of L-functions, random matrices, quadratic forms, computation and applications of modular forms, etc. These topics are among those at the cutting edge of current research in number theory, and they have applications in other fields such as physics, cryptography, and computer science, to name a few.<br/><br/>In addition to research presentations on recent and on-going projects, this workshop will continue the successful tradition begun in 2003 of featuring discussion sessions, facilitated/moderated by experts, on numerous topics germane to junior faculty.  In recent years, topics have included ``Where is it best to publish?"", ``How to restart a stalled research program?"", ``Encouraging and retaining women and other under-represented groups in the Number Theory community'', to name a few.

Responding to the rising interest, achievements in partition theory have been presented in various conferences and meetings, while sporadic meetings focusing on partitions have been held.  This conference will not only bring together prominent mathematicians in combinatorics, number theory, and special functions to report on recent advances in their areas but also provide a means for research mathematicians, graduate students, and others interested in partitions to explore new achievements, research trends, and problems.  In addition, the conference will honor George Andrews who has made major impacts both within the theory of partitions and in the larger mathematical community.  Andrews will turn 70 years old around the time of the conference.<br/><br/>We are expecting 75-100 participants with eleven invited plenary 45-minute talks.

The first project concerns the<br/>arithmetic of modular forms for noncongruence subgroups. For<br/>noncongruence subgroups whose associated modular curves have a model<br/>over the rationals, Atkin and Swinnerton-Dyer suggested very<br/>interesting congruence relations on the Fourier coefficients of cusp<br/>forms which are meant to replace the Hecke operators. On the other<br/>hand, Scholl has attached Galois representations to the space of<br/>noncongruence cusp forms. The ASD congruences together with the<br/>modularity of Scholl representations yield extremely interesting<br/>congruence relations between the Fourier coefficients of congruence<br/>and noncongruence forms. Some examples were constructed by the PI<br/>and her coauthors. Continuing her joint work with coauthors, the PI<br/>plans to apply the modularity lifting theorems to investigate when<br/>Scholl representations arise from Hilbert modular forms, and to use<br/>the modularity result and ASD congruence relations to establish the<br/>conjecture which says that the Fourier coefficients of genuinely<br/>algebraic noncongruence forms have unbounded denominators. The<br/>second project is to construct zeta functions of complexes arising<br/>from finite quotients of the Bruhat-Tits buildings. Such zeta<br/>function should be a rational function which encodes topological and<br/>spectral information of the complex, and which satisfies the Riemann<br/>Hypothesis if and only if the complex is Ramanujan. When dimension<br/>is one, this is the Ihara zeta function attached to a graph. In a<br/>very recent work, the PI and a PhD student did the 2-dimensional<br/>case. The PI proposes to explore the general case. The third project<br/>concerns low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The LDPC codes are<br/>equipped with very efficient decoding algorithms, which make them<br/>highly desirable in real world applications. The source of decoding<br/>errors is the pseudo-codewords. One way to understand these<br/>pseudo-codewords is to construct a suitable infinite series, called<br/>a zeta function, with each term corresponding to a pseudo-codeword.<br/>Such zeta function should be a rational function with good<br/>combinatorial property. This was done indirectly in a joint paper of<br/>the PI. The PI proposes to pursue a more direct approach.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It has been the PI's long term research goal to do fundamental<br/>research in number theory and to seek applications of number theory<br/>to combinatorics and coding theory, especially to solve real world<br/>problems. The study of interplay between these areas has turned out<br/>to be quite fruitful. This proposal is a continuation of<br/> the PI's effort to pursue the same general theme. Part of the research<br/> will be carried out by the PI's Ph D<br/>students. The results from this proposal will be disseminated<br/>broadly through the talks given by the PI in seminars, colloquia,<br/>conferences, short courses, and workshops. They will also be<br/>incorporated in the graduate courses taught by the PI. Weekly<br/>informal seminars will be conducted to integrate research with<br/>education and teaching. A conference is planned in 2010 to<br/>disseminate results from this project."

The first objective is to study the asymptotic behavior of the cohomology groups of modular varieties and of the number of rational points on such varieties over finite fields as the level varies. It will establish a rather important property of modular varieties, namely that the modular varieties over appropriately chosen finite fields provide examples of varieties with many rational points compared to their Betti numbers. This will shed some light on a difficult and largely open question of the optimality of the Weil-Deligne bound on the number of rational points on varieties over finite fields. This result might also find applications in coding theory. The second objective is to develop arithmetic tools for the study of modular curves over function fields and to use the parametrizations by modular curves to study non-isotrivial elliptic curves over function fields.<br/><br/>Modular varieties introduced by Shimura and their function field counterparts introduced by Drinfeld play an absolutely central role in current algebraic number theory. One of the main applications of these varieties is to the Langlands conjectures, since the cohomology groups of these varieties provide a link between Galois and automorphic representations. The project builds on and extends the results obtained by the PI earlier. The methods which will be employed come from the ideas in the proofs of the Langlands conjectures over function fields, rigid-analytic geometry and representation theory over local fields.<br/><br/>"

The Cox ring of an algebraic variety $X$ is a multigraded ring whose GIT quotients are the coordinate rings of images of $X$ via rational maps. For many interesting varieties, the so called Mori Dream spaces, the Cox ring is a finitely generated k-algebra. The project aims to develop tools to realize Cox rings of some Mori Dream spaces effectively, in terms of explicit coordinates and defining equations. Such descriptions are obtained via Koszul filtrations, via the combinatorics of Groebner bases or via new methods proposed. <br/>Specific conjectures about the structure of the Cox rings of certain classes of varieties are proposed.  The project also studies the Hilbert scheme of points in affine space, in particular the problem of describing the radical component (the closure of the set of radical ideals) and the singularities near monomial ideals.<br/><br/>An algebraic variety is a space defined by the simultaneous vanishing of a collection of polynomial functions in several variables. A very fertile classical technique for studying the geometry of an algebraic variety is to consider the various natural coordinate systems that this variety admits. The Cox ring of an algebraic variety is a way to study all these coordinate systems simultaneously. The first objective of this project is to provide descriptions of the Cox rings of some algebraic varieties. The second objective of this proposal is to study the Hilbert scheme of<br/>points: the space of all possible configurations of n points in d-dimensional space. The geometry of this set is rather intricate and the aim of the project is to describe all possible ways in which the n-points can collide into one another and the geometry of the Hilbert scheme near these collisions.<br/><br/><br/>"

The Columbia-CUNY-NYU team will develop nine new graduate courses for the design of a city-wide graduate number theory curriculum with more active training methods such as workshops, presentations by students, and opportunities to develop technical lecturing, computer programming, and writing skills. The new graduate courses will  go beyond the existing first year courses (commutative  <br/>algebra/algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory) and will cover   <br/>a broad range of core topics (required for cutting edge research) such as: arithmetic geometry, automorphic representations, spectral theory, and combinatorial number theory.  In addition, six new or restructured undergraduate courses will be developed and an annual undergraduate summer research program and graduate summer school (meeting once every 3 years) will be created. The recently created Columbia-CUNY-NYU Number Theory Seminar will be redesigned, making it more accessible to students and more vibrant for seminal research.

Basic research in number theory has led to important applications  in computer science and cryptography. Recent spectacular breakthroughs in the subject such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Taylor-Wiles require an understanding of an enormous amount of mathematics, much of it outside number theory. It is not sufficient any more for beginning students to study a small segment of number theory.

Almost half of those who attended CNTA IX (Vancouver 2006) were American (95 people); the rest were from Canada (57), Europe (32), Asia (13), Africa (3), Australia (3), and Latin America (2). <br/><br/>The conference will contain 12 plenary lectures, including a talk given by the <br/>winner of the 2008 Ribenboim Prize (an award for distinguished research in number theory),  and a lecture open to the general public. The conference will also include more than one hundred lectures in several special sessions, covering areas in algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, computational number theory, and diophantine analysis. These topics form the core of number theory, a vast subject with origins in classic greek mathematics and having important applications in a wide range of areas including cryptography, graph theory, coding theory, combinatorics, and logic, to name just a few.<br/>"

The project seeks further development of the Regularity Method that has had many successes over the past 30 years, and applications of the method to a variety of problems in extremal combinatorics and Ramsey theory. The PI also plans to use methods of probabilistic combinatorics to attack some older problems in Ramsey theory. In the area of quasi-randomness, one of the PI's long-term projects is to investigate the properties of quasi-random sparse graphs and uniform hypergraphs.<br/><br/>Over the last two decades, the use of probability has become one of the most powerful tools in discrete mathematics and computer science. The understanding of discrete, combinatorial structures is very important in modern science and technology. For instance, probabilistic reasoning is crucial for the design of large networks and algorithms. In discrete mathematics, one of the most successful techniques is the probabilistic method, which enables one to prove results about deterministic objects. One of the more recent techniques employs the idea of quasi-randomness. Quasi-random properties that enable one to find and enumerate sub-objects of a given type are of particular interest. The main part of this proposal aims to extend the applicability of the current techniques to a broader class of combinatorial structures. The results should lead to applications in various areas such as phase transition, game theory or theoretical computer science."

The PI   has an active research program on estimating coefficients of automorphic forms. In particular she plans to study coefficients of different kinds of automorphic forms of small weight including half-integer weight  <br/>modular  forms and Siegel modular forms. Improving existing estimates has a wide range of applications to many areas including  physics, elliptic curves, representation theory, algebraic geometry, and  quadratic forms. The second emphasis of this proposal is to investigate the <br/>connection between hypergeometric series and automorphic forms, in particular classical modular forms, weak Maass forms, and Maass cusp forms.    The literature on examples of hypergeometric series that are modular is extensive, and the pursuit of further of these  and their interpretation is an active area of research   due to their applications to many areas of mathematics and to physics.  <br/>However,   the proofs of these scattered results fall far short of a comprehensive theory to describe the interplay between hypergeometric  series and automorphic forms.   The situation is further complicated by the mock theta functions, a collection of 22 q-series defined by Ramanujan  in his last letter to Hardy.  Though  they resemble  modular q-series, these functions do not arise as <br/>minor modifications of the Fourier expansions of modular forms. Nevertheless  they  possess many striking properties, and  have been the subject of an astonishing number of important works. <br/>Recently, much light has been shed on the nature of Ramanujan's mock theta functions. By work of the PI, Ono, and Zwegers it is now known that these functions are the  holomorphic parts  of <br/>weight 1/2   weak Maass forms, and  a clearer picture is beginning to emerge of which  modular forms and Maass forms arise   from  basic hypergeometric series.    <br/><br/>Since it is very difficult to describe Fourier expansions of Maass forms, the PI plans  to  go  beyond the finite list of tantalizing examples that exist and  develop general theorems which illustrate the precise interplay between basic hypergeometric series and automorphic forms.  Since these play an important role in different areas of mathematics and physics, and the PI expects that the newly developed theories will have applications there. <br/>"

The advent of personal computing, and more so the development of software for symbolic computation, introduced a new facet of the discipline; it was suddenly possible to carry out computations far too sophisticated to be handled manually.  More recently, a numerical approach to algebraic geometry was pioneered, largely driven by the work of Sommese, Verschelde, and Wampler.  This new field is aptly known as numerical algebraic geometry.  The fundamental technique of this field, known as homotopy continuation, provides a numerical means of tracking the changing geometry resulting from algebraically morphing one system of polynomial equations into another.  The ubiquity of polynomial systems throughout the sciences and engineering means that the techniques of numerical algebraic geome  try may be used to solve problems arising in many different disciplines, such as kinematics, chemistry, economics, robot vision, and power electronics.<br/><br/>It has recently been realized that the techniques of numerical algebraic geometry may be used to study problems in classical algebraic geometry as well.  The purpose of this conference is to bring together classical and numerical algebraic geometers in a lively discussion forum to spark joint efforts between these two communities.  The intersection of these two fields is ripe for rapid growth fueled by joint work, so it is the hope of the organizers that these interactions will help to yield important advances along this front.  The conference will take place at the University of Notre Dame from May 22 to May 24, 2008.  There will be 13 lectures over those three days, given by eminent scholars from both communities and from various locations throughout Europe and the U.S.  As this field seems poised to spawn many new avenues of research, the participation of young mathematicians will be actively sought.<br/>"

It is used by virtually all mathematicians and by statisticians, physicists, biologists, computer scientists, engineers, and social scientists. Just as the basic idea of first semester differential calculus (approximating the graph of a function by its tangent line) provides information about the function, the process of linearization often allows difficult problems to be approximated by more manageable linear ones. This can provide insight into, and, thanks to ever-more-powerful computers, approximate solutions of the original problem.  The fundamental nature of linear algebra and its many applications make this an ideal theme for a summer program for graduate students.<br/><br/>The 2008 Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) Participating Institutions  Summer Graduate Program on ``Linear Algebra and Applications'' will be held Iowa State University June 29 - July 26, 2008.   The IMA will pay all costs for the principal speakers  and all expenses for up to two students from each of the 40 IMA participating institutions to this Summer Graduate Program.  This project will provide support for an 12 additional graduate students from non-IMA US institutions, and salary for a post-doctoral associate who will serve as a mentor to the graduate students.   Applications will be taken through the Linear Algebra and Applications Graduate Summer School website http://www.ima.umn.edu/2007-2008/PISG6.30-7.25.08/<br/><br/>The program organizers are Leslie Hogben, Wolfgang Kliemann and <br/>Yiu-Tung Poon.

The questions range from calculating a specific geometric invariant for particular classes of representations to understanding the (geometric) structure of triangulated categories associated to a given algebraic object. In particular, Pevtsova proposes to continue the study of modules of constant Jordan type and related invariants for a finite group scheme, initiated in a joint work with E. Friedlander and J. Carlson. Pevtsova is seeking further knowledge on cohomology and associated geometric invariants of certain non cocommutative finite dimensional Hopf algebras. The project also aims to investigate the geometric properties of triangulated categories, such as the derived category of perfect complexes of a stack. Bringing the projects on finite group schemes and derived categories to a meeting point, Pevtsova is seeking to compare derived categories associated to different algebraic objects via their geometry.<br/><br/>Representation theory as a subject has emerged about 100 hundred years agoin the work of Frobenius and Schur and quickly became an active area of research. In its current stage of development, representation theory has been discovered to be intimately connected to numerous brunches of mathematics, such as geometry, topology and combinatorics, as well as physics. Pevtsova is particularly interested in connections with geometry. Representation theory studies actions of groups and other algebraic structures on vector spaces. In particular, modular representation theory studies actions in a context when they are not semi-simple: not every vector space splits as a direct sums of orbits under the action. Pevtsova studies invariants of such actions which arise from geometric considerations. Her work takes its roots in the fundamental work of Quillen on group cohomology and expands in two different directions: one is to understand and compute invariants for particular actions, the other is to understand global properties of families of vector spaces with an action of a particular group. Pevtsova is also actively involved with math enrichment programs for school children. She will continue running a math challenge program at a local elementary school, and will be teaching at a residential summer math program for high school students from the Northwest organized yearly at the University of Washington."

The project also studies homological algebra, especially in terms of the graded Betti numbers and in terms of rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type. A new asymptotic length function for local cohomology is proposed with applications to the homological conjectures, especially the monomial conjecture. Additional problems are proposed on the theory of liaison, especially regarding comparing the local and homogeneous versions, as well as understanding Gorenstein liaison classes.<br/><br/>Commutative algebra arose from the 19th century study of polynomial equations in many variables, and their solutions. The relationship between polynomial equations and geometry goes back at least to Descartes and the idea of coordinatizing the plane.<br/>Commutative algebra studies the solutions of such polynomial or power series equations by forming an algebraic object, called a ring, which consists of the 'generic' solutions.<br/>The algebraic properties of these generic solutions then give insight into the geometric and algebraic nature of the solutions. An important technique in this field has been to study such equations by reducing the coefficients modulo prime numbers for all large primes. A particular example of this has been the explosive development of the theory of tight closure over the last twenty years. Commutative algebra combines techniques from a number of other areas including combinatorics, topology, and analysis.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

This gave the original motivation for Thomas Lam and the PI to introduce and study the skew version of total positivity. Further investigation in this direction, and in particular the relation of skew total positivity to the theory of total positivity developed by George Lusztig, is the subject of the first project. The second project grew out of an attempt to reinterpret the often used standard bases of the coordinate ring of Grassmanians, and to find different kinds of bases occurring naturally. The question is closely related to the question of triangulating the cone of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, which motivated David Speyer and the PI to introduce the notion of driving rules as a way to locally determine the triangulation. Properties of the simplicial complexes and the bases which arise are the subject of the investigation. The third project deals with K-homology of Grassmanian, studied so far to a smaller extend than the dual notion of K-theory. The first step in this direction was taken by Thomas Lam and the PI who introduced dual stable Grothendieck polynomials as representatives of Schubert classes in the K-homology ring. Further questions to be studied include the K-theoretic version of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence, K-homology of complete flag varieties and more.<br/><br/>The unifying theme of all three projects is the study of nice varieties, such as Grassmanians and more general flag varieties. A Grassmanian as the variety of all k-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional space. An old and yet active research area is Schubert calculus, which - very roughly - studies how subspaces of a space intersect. A simple example would be the following question: in a three-dimensional space four lines in generic position are chosen. What is the number of lines that intersect all four of them? Schubert calculus was recently enriched by the work of George Lusztig, who defined and studied a special part of flag varieties, called totally the positive part. Real numbers naturally come with a notion of positive and negative, and when we consider flag varieties over real numbers there is a way to identify a positive part in them. The study of the totally positive part has lead to a number of beautiful recent developments.<br/><br/>"

In each setting one defines invariants that measure the singularities. Despite the different definitions, the two sets of invariants exhibit many common features and subtle connections. In characteristic zero, the invariants to be studied (more precisely, the log canonical threshold, and the minimal log discrepancies) are defined in terms of divisorial valuations. A fundamental result, the existence of resolution of singularities, gives a strong finiteness statement when computing these invariants. The motivation for the interest in such invariants comes from their applications to birational geometry: certain conjectural properties of these invariants imply the termination of flips, one of the outstanding open problems in higher dimensions. The PI plans to study questions related to the main conjecture on log canonical thresholds, that asserts that in fixed dimension,  there are no increasing sequences of such invariants. Another part of the proposal concerns invariants defined in positive characteristic via the Frobenius morphism. They come out of tight closure theory, but have many subtle connections with the  invariants in characteristic zero. In particular, a basic conjecture in the field connects in a precise way the invariants in characteristic zero to those in positive characteristic, via reduction mod p. The PI proposes to use D-module theoretic ideas in order to study this conjecture.<br/><br/>Singularities are responsible for many phenomena, both in geometry and in arithmetic. For example, they govern the asymptotic of the number of solutions of congruences modulo prime powers, or the integrability of powers of polynomials. It has been realized in the past few years that invariants of singularities that show up in different contexts have deep connections amongst them. One can hope that by approaching singularities from these various points of view, one can get a richer picture, that can be used to attack problems with applications in other fields.<br/>"

The conference will focus on recent advances in commutative algebra, centered around areas which have been greatly influenced by the contributions of Mel Hochster. These include tight closure, singularities and multiplier ideals, the homological conjectures, invariant theory, local cohomology, the structure of free resolutions, and combinatorial commutative algebra. Hochster's research has had a transforming impact on the field, and there are several highly active areas which rely on his past and present work. We hope to bring together these areas for fruitful interaction. Commutative algebra is the study of equations: to paraphrase Hochster, ""...algebra, after all, has to do with solving equations. Abstract algebra is the daughter of the theory of equations (in the broadest sense) and perhaps its best theorems still deal with that subject."" Striking developments in the last few decades in commutative algebra have reinforced this view of commutative algebra. These developments include solutions to classical problems, as well as strengthened connections with diverse areas including algebraic topology, group cohomology, algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, invariant theory, and algebraic and arithmetic geometry. The invited speakers include experts in different areas, as well as several young researchers. The conference will provide an opportunity to present key results and recent advances. A special effort will be made to support the expenses of young researchers, women and minorities, graduate students, and those without alternative means of support.<br/><br/>"

More specifically, using work of Fisher and Stephenson as its starting point, it studies how the total number of dimer coverings of the complement of the holes changes as the holes are shifted around on the lattice graph. The joint correlation of a collection of holes is a non-negative real number measuring this change, and is the central object of study of this proposal. In earlier work, the proposer proved that the correlation of holes on the hexagonal lattice is governed, for large separations between the holes, by a law closely resembling the superposition principle of electrostatics: If each hole is regarded as a point charge of magnitude given by the signed difference between the number of white and black vertices in it (in a fixed white-black coloring of the vertices in which each edge has oppositely colored endpoints), then, for large distances between the holes, their correlation is proportional to the exponential of the negative of the 2D electrostatic energy of the resulting system of charges. Other previous results concern two naturally defined fields that the proposer proved approach the electric field in the limit when the lattice spacing approaches zero. In the current project, the proposer presents a program organized in several inter-related groups comprising two dozen specific problems and conjectures. The bulk of this program is aimed at developing further the analogy to electrostatics, but the list includes also independent combinatorial problems, such as conjectures on tiling enumeration of new regions and problems arising in the study of card shufflings.<br/><br/>This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research. The specific problems in this project are instances of the dimer model of statistical physics.  A basic illustration of this is the real-world process (relevant to the study of of lubricants) of adsorption of a liquid, consisting of two-atom molecules---the dimers in the model---along the surface of a crystal, whose fixed atoms form a lattice pattern, with any two neighboring positions capable of holding one molecule, and any given crystal atom being involved in the adsorption of at most one molecule. The main issue in this setting is the asymptotic behavior of the quantities that are studied (speciffically, the number of different ways the surface of the crystal can be covered by molecules). In some of the instances we encounter, the usually more difficult problem of determining quantities exactly turns out to allow progress in the asymptotic study."

The connection between Representation Theory and the Theory of Special functions is provided by a process that goes back to Frobenius. Combinatorics plays a role in that certain important integers such as dimensions and multiplicities are obtained by counting tableaux, paths, trees, etc. These connections provide an invaluable vehicle of discovery, since results and mechanisms which may be obvious in one of these areas often translate into highly  non trivial and unexpected facts in one of the other areas. The power of the combinatorial viewpoint should be easily understood  from the truism `` A picture is worth a thousand words''. Combinatorial interpretations translate mathematical information be it algebraic, analytical, logical or otherwise into visual information. The proposed activities involve computation of Kronecker coefficients, determination of Hilbert series, constructions of explicit basic sets of rings of invariants, factorization of certain algebras as free modules over rings of invariants,  decompositions of graded representations into their irreducible constituents. These are all activities that have a bearing in several branches of Mathematics and Physics. All the proposed research lies in areas which are particularly suitable to computer experimentation. Experience  shows that, in this setting, even students with limited background can experience the joy of non trivial discovery. <br/><br/>Kronecker coefficients, which are integers yielding the multiplicities of irreducibles in tensor products of representations, are difficult to compute directly from their original definition. New methodology that is being developped by the proposer in collaboration with A. Goupil and M. Zabrocki obtains polynomial generating functions of these coefficients, from which the coefficients themselves can be easily extracted. Constructing these  Kronecker ``polynomials`` and seeking for their combinatorial interpretation will be one of the activities to be carried out under this grant. Hilbert series of graded vector spaces are generating functions of dimensions of the successive homogeneous components of these vector spaces. The proposed reseach will develop algorithms for the calculation of Hilbert series of rings of invariants. Invariants are polynomials which remain unchanged under the action of certain groups of matrices. Hilbert series are computed primarily to obtain information useful in the construction  of  basic sets of invariants.  The proposer in collaboration with N. Wallach  explored and expanded a way to obtain Hilbert series by constant term algorithms. Subsequent collaboration by the proposer with G. Xin succeeded in refining these algorithms to the extent that certain Hilbert series that hiterto required hours of computer time were recently obtained in a few seconds. The acquisition of explicit formulas and when not available the development of efficient algorithms yielding mathematical constructs are the primary activities that will be carried out under this grant. Significant success in these endeavours should be beneficial to other researchers in the applied sciences.<br/><br/>"

Various classical combinatorial problems can be modeled as packing or covering problems.<br/>For example, the problem of existence of a spanning cycle in an n-vertex graph is the question whether the n-cycle packs with the complement of G. Important examples of packing and covering problems are problems on existence of a given subgraph, coloring problems, Turan-type problems, domination problems and Ramsey-type problems. These examples (and many more) show that (hyper)graph packings and coverings are rather general problems and are rich enough models for many important applications.

It is expected that the results will make an essential step in understanding extremal packing and covering problems for graphs and hypergraphs.<br/>Some proofs can lead to efficient packing and covering algorithms; negative results will impose limits on what can be accomplished.

Broadly speaking, extremal combinatorics addresses the existence of and theoretical bounds on the sizes of combinatorial objects with certain local restrictions imposed. Many of the important problems, while simple to state and attractive, are often representative of more general phenomena in mathematics, and lead to many unexpected and useful applications in other areas.  For example, the topics of expander graphs and Ramanujan graphs have had a major impact on coding, complexity and information theory.  These problems also lead to new theoretical methods, perhaps the most remarkable instance of which is the probabilistic method pioneered by the renowned mathematician Paul Erdos.  Extremal combinatorial methods lead to the construction of new and more efficient codes for correcting errors in data transmission, the reduction of the number of bits required for Monte-Carlo algorithms, such as randomized algorithms for primality testing. In fact, the spectacular recent breakthrough of a deterministic algorithm for primality testing is highly connected to preceding randomized algorithms which were long known to exist. In my proposal I plan to study further theoretical and practical applications, including the problem of time-complexity of matrix multiplication, quadratic sieve-type integer factoring algorithms, and questions in other areas of mathematics.  In mathematics, this work has implications in functional analysis, projective geometry, spectral graph theory, coding theory, and algorithms.  While these open problems are important and clearly difficult, some major inroads are possible by combining probabilistic and combinatorial techniques with some new ideas.<br/><br/>Combinatorial mathematics lies at the heart of many modern-day operations, such as digital security, web searching, and reliable data transmission.  Examples include multiplication of large arrays of numbers for qualitative web searches -- these matrices tend to have billions of rows and columns; the RSA cryptosystem, which underpins much of modern digital security, and is based strongly on the belief that factoring integers is difficult; finally, transmission of data over noisy or unreliable channels is at the core of coding theory, where one attempts to design novel ways of encoding a message so that even if the message is perturbed in transmission, the receiver can still figure out with high probability what the original message was.  One of the major ingredients for constructing such good error-correcting codes is the existence of combinatorial objects known as expander graphs.  Using explicit constructions and variants of these objects, together with basic probabilistic arguments, one can compress a message in an optimal way such that the receiver has an excellent chance of figuring out what the original message was. Constructions of graphs with such extremal properties is fundamental to the proposed research. In addition, the researcher plans to use combinatorial and probabilistic techniques to approach the problems of matrix multiplication and integer factoring, both of which are central to the concrete examples listed above.  The researcher plans to investigate both the practical and theoretical applications of the above-mentioned combinatorial and probabilistic methods."

This moduli space is the Betti version of a cohomology group in non-abelian Hodge theory. Its other versions are, Dolbeault: the moduli space of semistable Higgs G-bundles on the surface and, de Rham: the moduli space of flat G-connections on it.  In the Dolbeault and de Rham versions this space has been central to recent important work in the Langlands program, both the arithmetic by work of Ngo and Laumon and the geometric by work of Kapustin and Witten.  The basic idea of the project is to use tools of Number Theory, Combinatorics and the Representation Theory of finite groups of Lie type to count points on the Betti space over finite fields. The Weil conjectures then yield cohomological and geometrical information about it (and hence also about its other two flavors).<br/><br/>In the long run, Mathematics always has a way of making itself useful outside its own discipline. Who would have thought 20 years ago, say, that something as apparently removed from everyday life as the concept of an ""elliptic curve"" could end up as a crucial tool for the security of online shopping? An elliptic curve is a geometric construct with a very rich structure. Two points on the curve can be ""added"" by geometric means to produce a third point. This fact goes back more than 300 years. In more modern times we have learned how do to ""geometry"" (work with points, lines, curves, etc.)  in a purely finite context, where the real or complex numbers are replaced by their finite counterparts, finite fields. This provides one of the most useful ways to apply abstract mathematical concepts from Geometry and Number Theory to real life situations. The research project uses finite fields in a different way: to probe the geometry, in the usual sense of the word, of certain spaces of great interest to both Mathematics and Physics. The PI finds the interplay between the discrete (counting points over finite fields) and the continuous (geometry over the complex numbers) in this project, as well as the fact that involves in a substantial way fairly distant areas of Mathematics (Number Theory, Combinatorics, Group Theory and Differential Geometry), fascinating."

These questions regarding equidistribution can be approached from many angles. Two theories which have proved to be particularly well-suited to study such questions are the spectral theory of automorphic forms, which is closely related to the theory of L-functions, and the theory of dynamical systems, particularly the study of unipotent and more general flows on these homogeneous spaces. Recently there has been considerable progress involving tools such as special value formulae for L-functions, and (partial) classification results for measures invariant under higher rank torus actions. Particularly exciting is the possibility, already realized in some instances, of combining these techniques. The purpose of the proposed FRG is to investigate further this circle of ideas, which we believe has the potential to impact many other problems related to the above.

The study of number theory began thousands of years ago, motivated, in significant part, by questions about prime numbers.  On the other hand, ergodic theory and dynamics are mathematical fields of more recent provenance, which arose from studying the long-term evolution of complicated deterministic processes -- such as planetary motion. It is a striking fact (which has only recently begun to be heavily exploited) that, in certain contexts, ideas from ergodic theory interact very deeply with classical problems in number theory.  This project will enhance our understanding of this inter-relation and how we can combine knowledge from both of these fruitful disciplines effectively."

This project investigates the theory beyond this result, just as topological obstruction theory is the theory beyond the quoted topological result. The first goal is to determine how the obstruction to ""weak approximation""(approximation of power series solutions by polynomial solutions) decomposes into a local obstruction and a global obstruction.  The second goal is to investigate the obstruction theory where it is not yet known by determining precisely which algebraic fibrations over a surface of a specified, simple type admit a rational section.<br/><br/>Systems of polynomial equations are ubiquitous in mathematics, science and engineering.  In studying the collection of all solutions in complex numbers, i.e., the variety, associated to such a system, there is one special phenomenon: the system is ""rationally connected"" if for every pair of solutions, there is a polynomial map taking values in the variety and whose values interpolate between the given pair of solutions.  This special property is often satisfied in practice.  Surprisingly, a system of polynomial equations depending algebraically on 1 extra parameter (often thought of as time) always has a family of solutions varying as a polynomial of the parameter so long as the system for a fixed general choice of the parameter is rationally connected.  There is now an analogous theorem for a 2-parameter system, but with very strong constraints on the system.  The goal of the project is to weaken the constraint condition, and thus make the advance more widely applicable, by using notions analogous to those in topology, i.e., ""rubber-sheet geometry"". <br/>"

Ellingham<br/><br/><br/>    An international research conference in the area of discrete mathematics and computer science will be held at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee from 15th to 17th May, 2008.  The conference is the Twenty-First Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing.  The Cumberland Conference is an annual conference held to bring together researchers in discrete mathematics and computer science in the mid-south and southeast.  It was first held in 1988, and has been held every year since then.  The venue changes from year to year, moving around between universities.  Many outstanding researchers have given principal talks at previous Cumberland Conferences.<br/><br/>    The conference focuses on combinatorics, graph theory and computing. These areas form the essential theoretical background for much of our modern information infrastructure, and for many modern methods of optimizing activities such as transportation and scheduling.  Tools from these areas are used in areas as diverse as ecology, communication networks such as the Internet, economics and business, and military logistics.  The conference aims to promote interaction between researchers, to allow for the dissemination of the most recent research results, and to publicize the importance of these areas in modern society.<br/><br/>    The conference is expected to have about 100 participants.<br/>There will be five principal hour speakers and about sixty contributed talks, each of fifteen or twenty minutes' duration, in two or three parallel sessions.  At the time of writing, Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi (National Institute of Informatics, Japan), Neil Robertson (Ohio State University), Akira Saito (Nihon University, Japan), and Bjarne Toft (University of Southern Denmark) have accepted invitations to be principal speakers.  The conference is organized by Mark Ellingham and Gexin Yu, both of Vanderbilt University.<br/><br/>    Besides being a meeting place for mathematicians and computer scientists from the southeast, the conference will have a focus on two special areas designed to stimulate future research.  There will be forward-looking focused sessions on Matchings, Factors and Factorizations, and on Hadwiger's Conjecture.  These are currently very active areas of research, and these sessions should attract attendance from strong researchers from a wider area.  In addition, the conference will be dedicated in honor of Mike Plummer's 70th birthday, and these are two topics in which Mike has worked.  There will be principal speakers and special contributed talk sessions in each of these two areas.<br/>"

Specifically, she seeks ways to use the combinatorics of a face poset or closure poset together with limited topological information (e.g. information about codimension one cell incidences) to determine topological information such as rational homology or even in some cases homeomorphism type.  A main goal is to prove that various stratified spaces whose closure posets are thin and shellable are in fact regular CW complexes.  She also aims to construct boundary maps on important classes of posets such as geometric lattices, motivated by potential applications e.g. in theoretical computer science.  She will also study representations of simple Lie algebras via an analysis of local structure within the poset that indicates which weight space generators appear with nonzero coefficient upon application of a raising or lowering operator to other weight space generators.<br/><br/>In computer science, there is a strong interest both in finding effective algorithms when this is possible, and also in understanding when this is not theoretically possible.  It is often difficult to know how to even begin to obtain these impossibility results, but topology combined with combinatorics does have the potential to yield such results, and there have been some striking successes in the past.  One of the proposed projects is somewhat in this vein -- to prove impossibility results for the question of which graphs (i.e. which models for networks of computers) admit data sorting algorithms by greedily swapping pieces of neighboring data that are out of order.  In another direction, geometric structures such as the Schubert varieties of representation theory/algebraic geometry often have combinatorial data associated to them which is organized into what is called a partially ordered set.  Much is known about how properties of the geometric structure force properties on the partially ordered set.  The PI seeks a better understanding of how much can be said in the other direction, perhaps allowing some manageable extra data such as information about how edges are attached to 2-dimensional faces, how 2-dimensional faces are attached to 3-dimensional faces, and so on.  This could have applications to finding new ways of figuring out what very complicated, high-dimensional geometric objects look like.  In addition to continuing to mentor students and run seminars, the PI will also continue organizing conferences designed to foster fruitful new interactions and collaborations between those working in topological combinatorics and in related areas such as combinatorial representation theory and combinatorial commutative algebra.<br/><br/>"

The methods used to develop an effective sieve in this context involve automorphic forms, expander graphs and unexpectedly arithmetic and additive combinatorics.<br/><br/>   The Twin Prime Conjecture asserts that there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers which differ by two. It is one of the longest standing unsolved problems in mathematics.

The proposal is concerned with far-reaching generalizations of the twin prime conjecture and with developing new techniques to prove parts of these general conjectures. The interplay between number theory, combinatorics and theoretical computer science has been a very active one in recent years. Many times in this context the applications have been of number theoretic ideas to the other two fields. In the present project the reverse application is also critical."

One project involves studying the connection between the Hasse principle for geometrically rational varieties over global fields and the period-index problem for Brauer groups of function fields.  This is analogous to the connection between Artin's conjecture on the finiteness of the Brauer group for schemes proper over the integers and the Tate-Shafarevich conjecture, and builds on earlier work by the PI on the moduli of twisted sheaves.  A second project will continue the joint work carried out by the PI and Kovcs on higher-dimensional generalizations of the Shafarevich conjecture on non-isotrivial families of curves.  Crucial to this project will be a greater understanding of stacks parametrizing morphisms between stacks, whose systematic study was only recently begun.  A third project aims to deepen the understanding of stacks and their intrinsic geometry.  The PI and his collaborators will study the nature of birational modifications and analytification of stacks, and the categorical information content of stacks. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to broaden the applications of algebro-geometric and stack-theoretic methods in pure algebra and related fields.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, algebraic geometry is the study of the geometry associated to algebraic objects.  One of the most fruitful historical examples is the equation for a circle; the quadratic nature of the equation is closely related to the fact that a line generally intersects a circle in two points.  Over the last several millennia, mathematicians have come to understand that the connections between algebra and geometry run far deeper than one might imagine, and this has led to the gradual encroachment of geometric methods into far-flung areas of pure algebra and a profound unification of several seemingly-different subjects.  Each new advance in algebraic geometry ultimately finds applications to other areas of mathematics; several abstract areas of the field have turned out to be very computer-friendly, and modern cryptography would be impossible without algebraic geometry.  The theory of stacks is relatively young, but it has been the focus of recent attention and is rapidly maturing.  The PI's research will be directed toward applying the theory of stacks to a wide range of problems in algebra and geometry, bringing new tools to the geometric analysis of algebraic problems."

The formula for the solution of the quadratic equation, at least in special cases, was known to the Babylonians and the solutions to cubic and quartic equations were developed by Italian mathematicians in the 16th century. In the 19th century it was shown that a general equation of degree greater than or equal to five has no formula of the same kind. However it is possible that equations in more than one variable might always have simple solutions obtained by extracting roots, just as exist for the quadratic, cubic and quartic equations. Our first goal is to try to find families of equations for which there are such solutions.

These symmetries are more complicated than, but are related to, the kinds of symmetries satisfied by the trigonometric functions.<br/>       <br/><br/>The particular set of curves which will be investigated are the curves of genus one. These curves have received a lot of attention in recent years. The PI hopes to extend his research into whether these curves always have solvable points. His second and principal goal is to try to prove cases of non-solvable base change. This would enable one to describe suitable representations of  Galois groups in terms of automorphic forms.

A long-term goal of the first project is to construct a model<br/>of the integers using diophantine sets, because this would disprove a<br/>conjecture of Mazur regarding topology of rational points and<br/>simultaneously prove the undecidability of the problem of deciding<br/>whether a multivariable polynomial equation has a rational solution.<br/>The second project is to study countable unions of subvarieties over a<br/>countable algebraically closed field, such as the field of algebraic<br/>numbers, and in particular to prove that in naturally occurring<br/>situations, there exists a closed point outside the countable union,<br/>as required for various constructions.  Examples include the union of<br/>rational curves in a non-uniruled variety, the moduli space locus of<br/>abelian varieties isogenous to a Jacobian, the locus in the base of a<br/>family of varieties where the Picard number of the fiber jumps, and<br/>unions of subvarieties arising from iteration of endomorphisms of<br/>varieties.<br/><br/>Arithmetic geometry lies at the intersection of number theory and<br/>algebraic geometry: like algebraic geometry, it studies the solutions<br/>to multivariable polynomial equations, but it does so under the<br/>number-theoretic restriction that the coordinates of the solutions be<br/>integers (whole numbers like -37) or rational numbers (fractions like<br/>-3/5) or perhaps elements of some other number system different from<br/>the traditional systems of real numbers or complex numbers.  Such<br/>questions were studied for their intrinsic interest since the time of<br/>the ancient Greeks, and in the 20th century they found unforeseen<br/>applications to cryptography and error-correcting codes.  The<br/>investigator's research focuses not on these applications, but on the<br/>fundamental questions underlying and surrounding them, such as the<br/>question of whether it is possible to write a computer program to<br/>decide whether an arbitrary multivariable polynomial equation has a<br/>solution in rational numbers.  The research covered by this grant will<br/>study patterns in families of equations in the hope of deducing a<br/>negative answer, while also proving the existence of solutions<br/>satisfying infinitely many constraints in a larger number system."

Zeros near the central point in families of L-functions are well modeled by scaling limits of <br/>eigenvalues near 1 of a classical compact group. For elliptic curves the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture relates zeros at the central point to the size of the group of rational solutions. Thus one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank over Q(T) should provide an accessible <br/>laboratory for investigating the effect of multiple zeros. In addition to studying special families of L-functions (with emphasis on how zeros of the twist of two families of L-functions and families of L-functions with high vanishing at the central point behave), the research will include <br/>developing random matrix theory models for ensembles with high multiplicity eigenvalues, as well as writing computer programs and algorithms for numerical investigations. This will be accomplished by analyzing Legendre sums related to elliptic curves (for by the explicit formula sums over zeros of an L-function are related to sums over primes of its coefficients), analysis of the Satake parameters of Rankin-Selberg convolutions, and developing combinatorial formulas to handle the random <br/>matrix theory calculations. As conjectures on the behavior of zeros are related to standard conjectures in number theory, this work provides an opportunity to test such claims (for example, the dependence of the error term on the residue class for primes in arithmetic progression). Finally, <br/>Professor Miller and A. Kontorovich recently proved that values of L-functions near the critical line, values of characteristic polynomials of random matrix ensembles and iterates of the 3x+1 map satisfy Benford's law for digit bias. These connections will be further explored in additional systems of number theoretic interest.<br/><br/>Zeros of L-functions have been related to arithmetic problems since Riemann; standard conjectures on their distribution imply numerous results in number theory, with applications ranging from optimal error terms in counting primes to constructing efficient algorithms in cryptography. In <br/>the last few decades connections have been observed with high energy nuclear physics and random matrix theory as well. Thus investigations in one of these topics can be fruitfully used in the others. Studying digit bias in number theoretic and dynamic systems highlights key features of <br/>these problems, and is another example where different systems behave similarly. Deriving techniques to detect and understand digit bias have enormous applications; such methods have been used to test for data integrity. Many of these projects have components that are amenable to <br/>numerical experimentation; these and tractable special cases will be investigated in conjunction with undergraduate research assistants.<br/>"

Eigenvarieties are the universal p-adic families of automorphic forms for a given reductive group. Individual automorphic forms are conjectured to have a p-adic L-function, a p-adic counterpart of their usual complex L-function, and it is natural to expect that the p-adic L-functions of individual automorphic forms for a given reductive group will fit in an analytic family carried by the eigenvariety. However, besides the case of modular forms, very little is known on the existence of p-adic L-functions, and virtually nothing on their families. Even for modular forms, many important questions remain, such as the de finition and computation of many critical p-adic L-functions. This project proposes a strategy to address some of those questions. It focuses on the most arithmetically significant situation: the case of ""critical"" automorphic forms. The strategy is to consider automorphic forms in families, in which a critical automorphic forms may have milder siblings. The ultimate aim of the project is to relate the geometry of the Eigenvariety at some point to the order of vanishing of the p-adic L-function of the corresponding automorphic form. This should be done in such a way that, combined with earlier work of the PI and Chenevier, could lead to a proof of an inequality in the equality conjectured by Bloch and Kato between rank of Selmer groups, and order of vanishing of L-functions.<br/><br/>The discovery, by the pioneers of mathematics of modern times, of some very remarkable equalities, like that the sum of the reciprocals of the square of all positive integers is equal to one sixth of the square of the area of a unit disc (Euler) have opened a trend of mathematical research which is still very active today. Those equalities relate an analytic side (the sum of an in finite series , an object of calculus) to a side which is a product of a number of geometric nature times a rational number (hence an object of study for number theorists).  <br/>Those equalties, and a very great number of famous results obtained since then, as well as many more still to be proved, are all contained in a vast framework of conjectures built by Deligne, Beilinson, Bloch, Kato and Perrin-Riou. In their modern and general forms, those conjectures still relate an analytic object, called a L-function, and a number- theoretical one, called a Selmer group. The project of the PI intends to shed some light of one important aspect of those conjectures, the one concerning the order of the zeros of the L-functions. The PI proposes to do so by relating the two sides to a third object, whose appearance is much more recent, the Eigenvarieties, which are the universal families of automorphic forms.<br/><br/><br/>"

The project  roughly breaks up into two parts.  The first part concerns the study of moduli spaces and log geometry.  Since log geometry and logarithmic structures are closely related to degenerations,  log geometry plays a natural role in the study of compactifications of moduli spaces.  The PI studies several problems related to log geometry and moduli spaces, and also studies a logarithmic Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, generalizing the classical theorem for schemes. The second part of the project concerns sheaves on algebraic stacks. A central theme in this part of the project is trace formulas and their generalizations to stacks. Central to all parts of the project is the close relationship between algebraic stacks and log geometry discovered in earlier work of the PI.<br/><br/><br/>Given a system of polynomial equations defining an algebraic variety, there are two natural ways to study the system.  One approach is to study the symmetries of the equations, and a second approach is to vary the coefficients of the equations (""moduli"") and ""degenerate"" them to a simpler (though possibly singular) system.  Stacks, introduced by Artin, Deligne, Grothendieck, and Mumford in the late 1960's, are the main tool used in algebraic geometry to study spaces with additional symmetries. In recent years, the theory of stacks has come to play an important role in almost every part of algebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, and mathematical physics and a great number of exciting new  <br/>applications of stacks have been found.   For example, stacks play a  <br/>central role in the study of Brauer groups and in the rich interaction between string theory and algebraic geometry. For the study of degenerations, a key tool is the theory of logarithmic geometry developed by Kato, Fontaine, and Illusie in the late 1980's.  As mentioned above, in earlier work the PI related this theory to stacks, and the ongoing projects use this relationship to further our understanding of degenerations and the moduli of algebraic varieties.<br/>"

The conference is being organized by Delaram Kahrobaei and Victoria Gitman of the NYCCT, who successfully organized the 2006 meeting. The conference will consist of invited talks by women mathematicians, a poster session by graduate and undergraduate women students, and a panel discussion of issues affecting women in mathematics. <br/><br/>The meeting will be in the fields of algebra, combinatorics, and logic, with added emphasis on interdisciplinary research and establishing connections between mathematics and computer science. The organizers will focus on the areas of combinatorial, geometric, and computational group theory, applications of model theory to algebra and combinatorics, computational complexity, and set theory. All these areas are relatively new to mathematics. They have developed in response to the deep interconnections discovered in the last century between theoretical mathematics, algorithmic processes, and formalizing our notions of information. Because these areas are so young and so wide in scope and application, the most fascinating questions still remain to be answered. These questions will determine how theoretical mathematics and the world of modern technology will reinforce each other in the near future.  The first objective of the conference is to advance our knowledge in these areas by supporting women mathematicians who work in them and promoting research collaboration among them. The second more global aim of the conference is to increase the participation of women in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

The project is a joint training effort involving three universities (Columbia-CUNY-NYU) with eight principal investigators and twenty-five other faculty all working in number theory and related areas. The Columbia-CUNY-NYU team will develop nine new graduate courses for the design of a city-wide graduate number theory curriculum with more active training methods such as workshops, presentations by students, and opportunities to develop technical lecturing, computer programming, and writing skills. The new graduate courses will  go beyond the existing first year courses (commutative  <br/>algebra/algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory) and will cover   <br/>a broad range of core topics (required for cutting edge research) such as: arithmetic geometry, automorphic representations, spectral theory, and combinatorial number theory.  In addition, six new or restructured undergraduate courses will be developed and an annual undergraduate summer research program and graduate summer school (meeting once every 3 years) will be created. The recently created Columbia-CUNY-NYU Number Theory Seminar will be redesigned, making it more accessible to students and more vibrant for seminal research. A central goal is to provide an environment where postdocs, graduate students, undergraduates, and faculty from the entire New York metropolitan area study and work together in a collaborative atmosphere that fosters research and development.<br/><br/>Number theory is one of the oldest and most fundamental branches of mathematics. Basic research in number theory has led to important applications  in computer science and cryptography. Recent spectacular breakthroughs in the subject such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Taylor-Wiles require an understanding of an enormous amount of mathematics, much of it outside number theory. It is not sufficient any more for beginning students to study a small segment of number theory. The eight PI's of this proposal (Goldfeld, Kolyvagin, Kramer, Szpiro, Tschinkel, Urban, Venkatesh, Zhang) have extensive overlapping interests but their combined expertise covers all of modern number theory. The scientific research interests of the  <br/>team include algebraic/arithmetic geometry, hyperbolic geometry,   <br/>automorphic forms and representations, Langlands program, analytic number theory, spectral theory, ergodic theory, Lie algebras, algebraic number theory, elliptic curves, dynamical systems, and cryptography. This project will be decisive in raising the level of number theory across participating campuses: cross-pollinating successful ideas already in existence, and creating approaches through collective interaction. It is hoped that this RTG will become a national model for other programs of this kind.<br/>"

The various research groups at these institutions have compatible interests, but at the same time complementary expertise, and collaborations are already ongoing. Primarily, this goal will be achieved by promoting a series of bi-annual rotating conferences and by supporting the mobility of graduate students, junior faculty members, and visitors. These types of initiatives will help graduate students, postdocs and young faculty broaden their mathematical background and start new collaborations.<br/><br/><br/>Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra have seen a great deal of advances in the past years, most notably through a recent breakthrough in the minimal model program. Particularly fruitful has been the interaction between the two fields, which will also be the focus of the activities supported by this grant. In addition, the advent of high-speed computers and the development of algorithms have led to a line of research in Algebra and Geometry that is close to applications.  An area of common interest of the groups at Purdue, UI Chicago, Kentucky, and Notre Dame have been the topics of multiplier ideals, integral closures, and cores. The other areas of common interest among the groups at Purdue, UIC, and UIUC are intersection multiplicities and related problems, and the homological conjectures. Our groups approach these subjects from different points of views, ranging from complex analytic geometry to commutative algebra and combinatorics. This makes an exchange of ideas and the mutual training of graduate students even more crucial.  The series of conferences will showcase recent progress in various areas of algebra and geometry, including Hilbert functions and multiplicities, Groebner bases and computational algebra, liaison theory, the homological conjectures, problems in positive and mixed characteristic, tight closure and its interaction with birational geometry, resolution of singularities, Rees algebras, multiplier ideals, cores and Briancon-Skoda type theorems.  To this end many of the national and international experts in these areas will be brought together, but there will also be ample opportunities for young researchers to present and discuss their work.

The inverse limit of all such groups for a given point and morphism form what we call an arboreal Galois representation.  Piecemeal results on these representations have existed for some 20 years, but the PI has recently developed a more unified theory, and discovered several new applications. These include properties of the p-adic Mandelbrot set, sets of prime divisors of non-linear recurrences, and reductions of a given point on an abelian algebraic group. The PI plans to pursue applications further, into the domain of dynamics over finite fields, which is a natural direction. Several cryptographic algorithms, including the Pollard rho algorithm, make use of dynamics over finite fields, and the research proposed here is likely to have applications in this area. Further research plans include the determination of the image of arboreal representations in certain analogues to the case of CM elliptic curves; the further development of the analogy between arboreal representations and linear Galois representations, with the ultimate goal of attaching interesting L-functions to arboreal representations; and finally, an examination of irreducibility properties of iterates of polynomials with integral coefficients.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, this projects blends ideas from two a priori different fields, number theory and dynamics.  The study of extensions of the rational numbers Q by algebraic numbers -- that is, roots of polynomials<br/>-- is one of the most basic areas of number theory.  The field of dynamics seeks to understand how processes evolve over time, and the most basic dynamical system consists of repeated application (or iteration, as it's<br/>known) of a map f from a space to itself.  The PI proposes to study the extensions of Q obtained by adjoining roots of iterates of certain polynomials.  Of particular interest are the Galois groups of such fields, namely the group of field automorphisms fixing pointwise the base field. <br/>When the Galois groups of all iterates of a single function are taken together, we term it an arboreal Galois representation.  Even in seemingly simple cases such as the polynomial x^2 - 1, this arboreal representation is not well understood.  These representations turn out to encode density information regarding a variety of dynamical phenomena.  Moreover, they furnish an interesting and potentially fruitful analogue to the well-studied case of linear l-adic Galois representations, namely the study of fields whose Galois groups embed in certain matrix groups. <br/>These have had a myriad of important applications.<br/><br/>"

The Hironaka theorem on resolution of singularities plays a central role in Algebraic Geometry. It constitutes a basis of proofs of many theorems in Algebraic and Analytic Geometry. The theorem on desingularization is proven in characteristic zero and is known only in some special cases in positive characteristic. This is a major drawback for many theorems which rely on desingularization and which can be proven in characteristic zero only. The project deals with studying some new ideas and developing  a new relatively simple approach to the resolution problem in positive characteristic. By suitable modification of the basic notions (like order, marked ideals and etc) introduced in the algorithm in characteristic zero the investigator plans to approach the problem of resolution of singularities in positive characteristic. The new notions open some new possibilities  in related areas. In particular, the new invariant proposed in the project, so called p-order, may have interesting applications in  problems related to studying singularities in positive characteristic. <br/><br/><br/>The goal splits into two parts. First, the investigator plans to show how <br/>to reduce in a canonical way the resolution of general singularities to the singularities of the special form (singularities of Giraud hypersurfaces of maximal contact). Understanding these singularities is considered to be the key for solving the problem. Second, the investigator plans to approach the resolution of singularities by using the introduced language and the inductive scheme developed in the first part. Although the problem seems very difficult, using new tools significantly simplifies it and allows us to better understand the problem in many particular situations. Moreover the investigator plans to analyze and generalize the simplified algorithms of Hironaka desingularization and the Weak factorization from the point of view of further potential applications."

The formulas connect Macdonald polynomials with other special q-symmetric functions recently studied by combinatorialists, namely the LLT polynomials of Lascoux, Leclerc and Thibon, and the k-Schur functions of Lapointe, Lascoux and Morse.  From the point of view of Lie theory, all these developments are connected with general linear groups and therefore with the root systems of type A.  The guiding themes of the proposed research will be to unify these recent combinatorial discoveries, to connect them with underlying algebraic, geometric and representation theoretic phenomena, and to extend them to Lie groups and root systems of other types.<br/><br/>In a broader optic, combinatorics is the part of mathematics that deals with the passage from the abstract to the concrete.  Thus Lie theory in the abstract is the theory of continuous symmetries.  However, by one of the great theorems in mathematics, concrete combinatorial data--the root systems--govern the structure of the most important Lie groups.  While the link between Lie groups and root systems is classical, there are also other, more subtle, combinatorial structures associated with Lie theory, which mathematicians are still striving to understand.  One way to seek such understanding is to begin by exploring the combinatorial side, which by nature lends itself to explicit computation and the search for patterns, and afterwards to try to explain the observed combinatorial phenomena by reference to more abstract underlying concepts from group theory, geometry and representation theory.  This is the mode of understanding which Haiman seeks to pursue in the proposed research.<br/>"

However, the p-adic program is only in an embryonic stage, and there is very little by way of general conjectures, let alone theorems. It is natural to consider the reduction mod p of the p-adic objects involved in the p-adic Langlands program, and when one does so one is led firstly to questions involving generalizations of the weight part of Serre's conjecture.

Recently, it has become clear that this part of the Langlands program should generalise to what is known as a ""p-adic Langlands program"". This new program does not, as yet, have a precise conjectural formulation, and the PI proposes to investigate the correct formulations of the conjectures that should make up the program, to prove cases of them, and apply them to more classical problems in number theory.  <br/><br/><br/>"

This will be the Institute's principal activity during that period.<br/><br/>Arithmetic geometry is the application of methods of algebraic geometry to questions of relevance to number theory.  Specifically, given a system of equations for which one wants to study its rational solutions (or solutions over a given number field), one studies this system using methods of algebraic geometry and attempts to show finiteness or sparseness of the set of solutions.  The focus of this program is to do so using ideas stemming from the Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem in diophantine approximation.<br/><br/>Hyperbolic geometry (as envisioned by this program) is the study of analytic functions from the complex plane to complex algebraic manifolds, again studied through the lens of algebraic geometry.  If there are no such functions (other than constant functions), then the manifold is said to be hyperbolic.  A weaker condition would be to show that such maps have sparse image.  The main methods used in this program stem from the work of R. Nevanlinna in value distribution theory.<br/><br/>Although the above two paragraphs describe very different areas of mathematics, their statements and methods have been found to be very similar, for reasons that are not fully understood.

Furthermore they should be realizable by locally constant sheaves on the classical and etale topologies, as well as by variations of mixed Hodge structures. The hope is that this theory should provide a good framework in which to study Hodge theory for families.  Such a theory would have a number of ramifications: It would  lead to the motivic fundamental group of an algebraic variety which would be related to the usual fundamental group. And it could used in the study of bundles over a curve. There are a couple of subprojects which are separate from the above.

Their study has found interactions with areas as diverse as mathematical physics and cryptography. Indeed  Hodge theory, which is the subject of this project, was partly motivated by physical ideas. The goal of this project is to further the understanding of the Hodge theory of varieties by replacing them with simpler objects called motives.  The collection of  motives would be fine enough to reflect much of the original structure of algebraic varieties, but they would posses a ""linear""  structure which makes them easier to handle.<br/><br/>"

The more general theory of character sheaves will be also needed in the study of irreducible characters of the group of rational points of a reductive group with a cyclic group of components defined over a finite field.It is also proposed  to continue the study of unipotent elements in small characteristic, in particular to try to give a uniform description of the group of components of centralizers of such elements. <br/>Progress on the topics above is expected to have applications to various parts of mathematics and theoretical physics.<br/><br/>The theory of group representations attempts to study the idea of symmetry by means of matrices which are more amenable to computation. One of the oldest application of representation theory is the theory of Fourier series, widely used in engineering and applied science. More recently, ideas from representation theory have been used in chemistry (study of crystals) and physics (theory of elementary particles). G. Lusztig's research is concerned with applications of methods of algebraic topology (study of shapes by means of algebra) and algebraic geometry (geometric study of equations) to obtain new results on group representations which could not be obtained by other methods."

All three  are well-known fundamental problems in the field of graph theory. All three problems deal  with graphs with certain  substructures excluded, and the goal is to investigate the structure of such graphs, with the hope that understanding this structure will uncover the solution to the problems. Structural approaches have been traditionally used to  attack the first two problems; on the other hand, approaching the last problem  from the point of view of structure is a relatively new idea,  which in view  of some resent results,   seems quite promising.<br/><br/>The first proposed question is to study the structure of perfect graphs, with the goal of finding a polynomial time combinatorial coloring algorithm. The second is a long standing conjecture of Hadwiger that states that for every integer p, every loopless graph with no clique minor of size p+1  is p-colorable. Finally, the Erdos Hajnal conjecture asserts that in a graph G  with  no induced subgraph  isomorphic to a given graph H, there exists either a clique or a stable set of size polynomial in the number of vertices of G. (Thus, the fact that G has no induced subgraph isomorphicto H makes G ``very different'' from a random graph from the point of view of Ramsey theory.)<br/>"

The elementary example of Z/p x Z/p is one of the first examples encountered by beginning students of abstract algebra, yet its representation theory is ``wild"" so that no listing of all finite dimensional representations is possible.  Friedlander has introduced constructive techniques which apply to this and other specific examples yet extend to very general situations.  Friedlander proposes to continue his study of representations of arbitrary finite group schemes using insights and techniques from algebraic geometry as well as more traditional techniques of algebra.  One goal is to contribute to the understanding of specific examples; a second goal is to sketch a general theory which incorporates these examples; and a third goal is to utilize certain special actions to study the algebraic K-theory of certain singular projective varieties associated to finite group schemes.  A second aspect of Friedlander's proposed research is the investigtion of algebraic cycles on algebraic varieties.  This is one of the most fundamental and challenging topics of algebraic geometry, much studied in the past hundred years.  Friedlander's focus will be on algebraic equivalence classes of cycles, influenced by insights from the better understood analogue in algebraic topology. Applications are envisioned to algebraic K-theory as well as algebraic <br/>geometry.   <br/><br/>How can finite groups of symmetries act on vector spaces over finite fields or over even more general fields?  How does the consideration of more general algebraic objects (finite group schemes) reflect on the original problem, especially in basic, familiar examples?  How does the geometry, at first unrecognized, constrain the possibilities and lead to concrete examples?  Can the explicit nature of these examples give structures in abstract contexts? These are some of the questions Friedlander proposes to investigate with several collaborators.  In addition, he proposes to study solution sets of polynomial equations (algebraic geometry) using techniques developed in algebraic topology <br/>(theory of shapes).   Friedlander plans to encourage younger <br/>mathematicians (including his past, present, and future students) in his quest.  He also plans to continue his active roles in publishing mathematics, organizing mathematical events, and serving the national mathematical community.<br/>"

The fundamental question is to estimate the topological complexity of a definable set in terms of the structural complexity of its defining formula.  Recent developments in algorithmic real algebraic geometry and topological o-minimality suggest that an answer to that question can be obtained for a wide class of sets definable in o-minimal structures with the Bezout-type finiteness property. Notably, a combinatorial-geometric construction suggested by A. Gabrielov and N. Vorobjov allows one to approximate arbitrary definable sets by homotopy equivalent definably compact sets, simplifying considerably the study of their topology. Furthermore, homotopy colimit construction allows one to approximate a set defined by a formula with existential quantifiers by a homotopy equivalent simplicial object defined by a quantifier-free formula, and to employ the descent spectral sequence to compute topological invariants of the original set.  The proposed research will advance our understanding of the topological properties of the sets definable in o-minimal structures, and of the algorithmic complexity of operations with such sets and their families. It will provide new tools for the o-minimal algebraic topology.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to develop new upper bounds on the topological complexity of semialgebraic sets (defined by formulas with equations and inequalities between polynomials in several real variables)and their generalizations known as definable sets in o-minimal structures.  Given an appropriate measure of complexity, such as Bezout theorem bounding the number of zeros of a polynomial, the topological complexity of a definable set depends on the structural complexity of its defining formula.  Recently A. Gabrielov and N. Vorobjov suggested a construction replacing a general definable set with a homotopy equivalent compact set, applying a simple combinatorial procedure to the defining formula of the original set.  Thus the problem of the topological complexity of the general definable sets can be reduced to the more tractable problem for the compact sets.  The proposed research will establish new connections between o-minimal theory, topology, combinatorics, and real algebraic geometry.  It will provide new combinatorial and topological tools for development of faster computational algorithms in real algebraic and analytic geometry and its applications in control theory, visualization, and computer-aided design."

In 1998 Malikov, Schechtman and Vaintrob proposed the notion of chiral differential operators as a direct such link.

The background to the conference consists of<br/>the work on supersymmetry pioneered by the physicists such as<br/>Zumino, and Ferrara (both speakers at the conference), and the<br/>work of the mathematicians Kac, Moody, and others who brought<br/>focus to infinite dimensional Lie algebras and their applications<br/>to quantum field theory. In the 1990's the group theoretic point<br/>of view was applied successfully to the theory of meromorphic<br/>differential equations and their moduli. Very recently important<br/>new progress has been made by the development of a supersymmetric<br/>Mackey theory and its applications to super particle<br/>classification, by work on differential Galois group theory of<br/>difference equations, and by the work on the foundations of<br/>super-geometry.<br/><br/>Symmetry is one of the most fundamental and useful notions in<br/>both mathematics and theoretical physics. For example it explains<br/>the mysteries of the periodic table of chemical elements such as<br/>why hydrogen and oxygen combine to make water. An example of<br/>symmetry is the following; consider an ordinary square made with<br/>wire, rotate it 90 degrees about its center and notice it comes<br/>back onto itself although the molecules of the wire have<br/>moved. Do it again, you still get the same square. When you do it<br/>the fourth time, i.e., you rotate it 360 degrees the molecules of<br/>the wire come back to where they started. In mathematical<br/>language this says that &#147;the cyclic group of order 4&#148; is<br/>the symmetry group of the square. It is a wonder that the notion<br/>of symmetry and group can be extended and enriched to explain<br/>complicated sub-atomic physical phenomena as well as solve<br/>fundamental problems in mathematics coming from areas such as<br/>cryptography. The symmetries to be considered in this conference<br/>are part of this same story. Of perhaps particular interest is<br/>the theoretical notion of supersymmetry used in the study of<br/>sub-particle physics. The founder of this notion, B. Zumino, will<br/>speak at this conference. It is presently a theoretical<br/>hypothesis that many believe to be true but which awaits<br/>experimental verification. It is one of the main goals at the<br/>European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva to use its<br/>multi-billion dollar Hadron Collider which comes on line in 2008<br/>to experimentally establish the supersymmetry hypothesis.

This is analogous to the way (singular) homology of topological spaces ""categorifies"" the Euler characteristic. Their construction involves studying the (derived) category of coherent sheaves on certain flag-like varieties. All this parallels the earlier pioneering work of Khovanov and Rozansky who discovered such categorifications using algebraic and combinatorial constructions. Using the algebraic geometric approach the investigator and his colleagues have a conjecture for how to categorify some of the remaining Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. Checking, for instance, invariance under Reidemeister move 2 involves proving that certain integral transforms between (derived) categories are equivalences.<br/>The existence of such equivalences, which include Seidel-Thomas spherical twists, is a lively area of research which is interesting in itself.<br/><br/>The simplest example of a knot is obtained by taking a tangled-up shoe lace and glueing the ends together. A fundamental question in low-dimensional topology is to determine when two such knots are different (you are allowed to move the knots around without cutting them). One way to do this is to assign a number (an invariant) to each knot so that if two knots are assigned different numbers then they must be different. How to assign such numbers is a deep problem which is related to various areas of mathematics in surprising ways. For example, the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are obtained from representation theory (which is the study of matrices). There are also constructions of such invariants using algebra and others that are inspired by physics and string theory. The proposed research suggests yet another approach using algebraic geometry (which is the study of systems of polynomial equations). This approach may extend, unify and shed more light on the other constructions.<br/>"

In addition, an extension of this project to the setup of vertex superalgebras will be obtained. The structures investigated in this part are basic ingredients for building logarithmic conformal field theories, increasingly popular among physicists. The second part involves studies of characters of vertex algebra modules, closely related pseudocharacters and modular differential equations. From these considerations the PI proposes a whole array of results  of interest to number theorists, including constant term identities and modular identities.  Finally, the PI, jointly with his collaborators, will continue to work on combinatorial aspects of vertex algebra theory. In particular, considerable attention will be devoted to ""principal subspaces"" of standard modules for affine Lie algebras, by using  primarily the theory of intertwining operators. It is expected that this will lead to new combinatorial bases of standard modules.<br/><br/>Conformal field theory and string theory have had major impact on modern mathematics. Two-dimensional conformal field theory has also important applications in condensed mater physics and statistical mechanics.  The aim of this research is to use symmetries in physical theories (through the language of representation theory) to study analytic and combinatorial properties of correlation functions and partition functions. This will, on one hand, advance our understanding  of processes in nature and, on the other, lead to new results and structures in mathematics.<br/>"

The method is especially interesting because it demonstrates that the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions contains more information on the behavior of primes than had previously been recognized. In particular, if the primes are well distributed in ""thin"" arithmetic progressions then one can prove that there are always pairs of primes with difference 16 or less. This conditional result shows that the twin prime conjecture - that there are infinitely many primes differing by 2, is approachable with this type of information. More recently the PI in joint work with Yildirim and Pintz and Sid Graham have been working on applying our method to numbers with a specific number of prime factors, especially numbers which have exactly two prime factors. The main goal of this project is to further develop our method to extract the best possible quantitative information on small gaps between primes, and in addition to investigate applications to other problems in number theory.

A fine example is the beautiful theorem that every positive integer is a sum of at most four squares. Similarly, there are important results on the representation of integers as sums of cubes, fourth powers, etc. <br/>This motivated the more general study of quadratic and higher degree forms which has had deep impact in many parts of algebra, number theory and combinatorics.  <br/><br/>During the academic year 2008-09, two international conferences will be conducted at the University of Florida: (i) Conference on higher degree forms in Fall 2008, and (ii) Conference on quadratic forms, sums of squares, theta functions, and integral lattices (and Student Workshop), in Spring 2009. The two conferences would be the first to have focus on quadratic and higher degree forms, areas that have seen dramatic progress in recent years. Most notably, in the last few years, Manjul Bhargava (Princeton) has extended the celebrated Gauss composition law for quadratic forms, to forms of higher degree. There was no progress of this nature on higher degree forms since Gauss' pioneering work on quadratic forms in the nineteenth century! Also, within the last two years, Bhargava and Jonathan Hanke have solved a conjecture of John Conway concerning the determination of all universal quadratic forms, namely quadratic forms like the sum of four squares that would represent all positive integers; the origins of the problem on universal quadratic forms can be traced to the writings of the Indian genius Srinivasa Ramanujan, who astounded the mathematical world in the early twentieth century with his remarkable discoveries. The conference on quadratic forms and related topics will be preceded by a Student Workshop which will prepare the students for the advanced topics presented at the conference. The two conferences are the highlights of a year long comprehensive program on Algebra, Number Theory and Combinatorics (ANTC) and tie in with the strength and tradition at the University of Florida in ANTC and areas related to the work of Ramanujan. <br/><br/>The conferences will provide an opportunity for students and young researchers to interact with eminent mathematicians who are making major advances on areas related to quadratic and higher degree forms. <br/>The entire program consisting of an appropriate mix of hour lectures and shorter presentations, has been planned for the benefit of students and young researchers, as well as researchers in allied disciplines like physics and computer science.

New information resulting from this study will be applied to computing  the multiplicities for the symmetric powers of representations of reductive groups, and constructing new totally positive varieties. The results of this study will be applied for solving problems emerging in the representations of discrete subgroups of reductive algebraic groups and Cherednik algebras as well as for explication and elaboration of related combinatorial and geometric structures including the ``geometric lifting'' of crystal bases as a new tool in understanding the local Langlands correspondence. <br/><br/><br/>Representation theory  is one of the most dynamically developing fields of modern Mathematics.

The inverse limit of all such groups for a given point and morphism form what we call an arboreal Galois representation.  Piecemeal results on these representations have existed for some 20 years, but the PI has recently developed a more unified theory, and discovered several new applications. These include properties of the p-adic Mandelbrot set, sets of prime divisors of non-linear recurrences, and reductions of a given point on an abelian algebraic group. The PI plans to pursue applications further, into the domain of dynamics over finite fields, which is a natural direction. Several cryptographic algorithms, including the Pollard rho algorithm, make use of dynamics over finite fields, and the research proposed here is likely to have applications in this area. Further research plans include the determination of the image of arboreal representations in certain analogues to the case of CM elliptic curves; the further development of the analogy between arboreal representations and linear Galois representations, with the ultimate goal of attaching interesting L-functions to arboreal representations; and finally, an examination of irreducibility properties of iterates of polynomials with integral coefficients.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, this projects blends ideas from two a priori different fields, number theory and dynamics.  The study of extensions of the rational numbers Q by algebraic numbers -- that is, roots of polynomials<br/>-- is one of the most basic areas of number theory.  The field of dynamics seeks to understand how processes evolve over time, and the most basic dynamical system consists of repeated application (or iteration, as it's<br/>known) of a map f from a space to itself.  The PI proposes to study the extensions of Q obtained by adjoining roots of iterates of certain polynomials.  Of particular interest are the Galois groups of such fields, namely the group of field automorphisms fixing pointwise the base field. <br/>When the Galois groups of all iterates of a single function are taken together, we term it an arboreal Galois representation.  Even in seemingly simple cases such as the polynomial x^2 - 1, this arboreal representation is not well understood.  These representations turn out to encode density information regarding a variety of dynamical phenomena.  Moreover, they furnish an interesting and potentially fruitful analogue to the well-studied case of linear l-adic Galois representations, namely the study of fields whose Galois groups embed in certain matrix groups. <br/>These have had a myriad of important applications.<br/><br/>"

The fourth annual GSCC will be held at the University of California, Davis, on April 12-13, 2008.  <br/><br/> Students all across North America will participate in an intensive weekend of student talks and meetings about current mathematical research in discrete mathematics.  Student talks will be complemented by two keynote addresses given by Arun Ram of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ron Graham of the University of California, San Diego.  The GSCC reaches a broad range of students in part due to the special nature of the field of combinatorics, which spans both pure and applied mathematics.  Pure research topics include algebra, computational biology and string algorithms, enumerative combinatorics, poset and graph theory, probabilistic combinatorics, and topological and geometric combinatorics.  <br/><br/> Combinatorics-related research leads to advances in all parts of science, including computer science, biological systems, and theoretical physics.  For example, recent advances in combinatorics have resulted in both approximation algorithms and randomized algorithms for computational problems which had no previously known practical solutions.  <br/><br/> There are two main ways the GSCC facilitates advances in combinatorics and its applications.  One way is by giving graduate students the opportunity to present their research to peers from other universities, the first such opportunity for many students.  This develops students' ability to give interesting and cutting-edge research talks.  The other way is by fostering professional relationships which carry on into post-graduate careers, bolstering communication and peer mentorship at all levels.  The GSCC is an invaluable tool for students who study combinatorics at all levels in their graduate careers.

The mathematical study of symmetry is called group theory.<br/>One of the great achievements of Twentieth Century mathematics is the complete classification of the finite simple groups, the building blocks of all finite groups.  The first major success of the local and global analysis of groups is precisely the Classification of Finite Simple Groups. The methods involved in this study arise from a tension between the properties of p-groups and those of general groups.  Exciting developments are currently taking place in this area. The restructuring and systematization of the Classification of Finite Simple Groups is progressing at an impressive rate, with different approaches being actively pursued.  Our understanding of the  finite p-groups is rapidly increasing, with important new approaches being proposed.<br/><br/>The global/local analysis of finite groups, which is the cornerstone of all work on the classification of finite simple groups, is finding unexpected applications in new areas of mathematics. This conference, in honor of George Glauberman, whose work has had a profound influence on this subject, will bring together experts and young mathematicians in these connected areas to discuss and learn about the different points of view and the different connections. <br/><br/>Broader Impact:  <br/>The purpose of this conference is to enhance research, education and training.  The conference will allow experts to keep abreast of the latest advances in these diverse areas. They will be able to exchange ideas. The conference will be especially useful for young researchers, and students, who will be able to get an overview of these interrelated fields.  The conference encourages the participation of women and minorities. It is being publicized widely through email, mailings, and a web site.<br/>"

The first project is to study the existence of rational<br/>points in algebraic families of varieties, and to build a library of<br/>diophantine subsets of the field of rational numbers, where a<br/>diophantine set in this context means the set of rational parameter<br/>values for which the corresponding variety in a family has a rational<br/>point.  In particular, the investigator will explore families whose<br/>fibers are Chatelet surfaces or more complicated conic bundles, for<br/>which the Brauer-Manin obstruction produces interesting diophantine<br/>sets.  A long-term goal of the first project is to construct a model<br/>of the integers using diophantine sets, because this would disprove a<br/>conjecture of Mazur regarding topology of rational points and<br/>simultaneously prove the undecidability of the problem of deciding<br/>whether a multivariable polynomial equation has a rational solution.<br/>The second project is to study countable unions of subvarieties over a<br/>countable algebraically closed field, such as the field of algebraic<br/>numbers, and in particular to prove that in naturally occurring<br/>situations, there exists a closed point outside the countable union,<br/>as required for various constructions.  Examples include the union of<br/>rational curves in a non-uniruled variety, the moduli space locus of<br/>abelian varieties isogenous to a Jacobian, the locus in the base of a<br/>family of varieties where the Picard number of the fiber jumps, and<br/>unions of subvarieties arising from iteration of endomorphisms of<br/>varieties.<br/><br/>Arithmetic geometry lies at the intersection of number theory and<br/>algebraic geometry: like algebraic geometry, it studies the solutions<br/>to multivariable polynomial equations, but it does so under the<br/>number-theoretic restriction that the coordinates of the solutions be<br/>integers (whole numbers like -37) or rational numbers (fractions like<br/>-3/5) or perhaps elements of some other number system different from<br/>the traditional systems of real numbers or complex numbers.  Such<br/>questions were studied for their intrinsic interest since the time of<br/>the ancient Greeks, and in the 20th century they found unforeseen<br/>applications to cryptography and error-correcting codes.

A third goal is to study deformations of complexes of modules for a profinite group.

The last goal of the project is to study which finite group actions on curves in positive characteristic can be lifted to characteristic zero.<br/><br/>The unifying theme of this project is the study of symmetries. Riemann Roch formulas quantify how symmetries of systems of equations are reflected in their solutions. One can use results of this kind to greatly constrain the Solutions. Symmetries enter into the famous problem of recognizing the shape of an object from how it reflects sound or radio waves. A variant of this problem will be studied which involves also using the lengths of certain paths on the object to try to recognize it. A basic problem in considering symmetries is to quantify how much information is needed to describe them.  This problem will be investigated in the context of describing all ways to deform an object having a set of prescribed symmetries.  Finally, obstructions will be studied to extending symmetries from a small object (a curve in positive characteristic) to a larger one (a curve in characteristic zero)."

Since then, ANTS has been held bi-annually at varying locations all around the globe.  The present meeting, ANTS-VIII, is scheduled to be held May 17-22, 2008 at the Banff Centre in Banff Alberta, Canada.<br/><br/>The ANTS meetings are devoted to algorithmic and computational aspects of number theory, including elementary, algebraic, and analytic number theory, geometry of numbers, algebraic geometry, finite fields, and cryptography. There has been a surge of activity in number theory over the last 10-15 years, with major results in the areas of algebraic, arithmetic and analytic number theory.  Many of these have additional significance due to their applications in areas such as coding theory and cryptography. The algorithmic side of number theory in particular has seen a great deal of progress in the last decade, including advances in such deep problems as integer factorization, the discrete logarithm problem in various settings, point counting on algebraic curves, and the computation of invariants of global fields. <br/><br/>These and other related questions represent the subject of intense ongoing research, much of which is published in the ANTS proceedings. The aim of ANTS is to bring together leading experts in the field as well as young researchers and graduate students for the purpose of exchanging ideas and presenting their work. Research presented at ANTS meetings and appearing in ANTS proceedings has spawned important advances in algorithmic number theory. ANTS conferences, including ANTS-VIII in 2008, will continue to have a major positive impact and lead to significant progress in the field.  The conference is geared toward researchers with some expertise in algorithmic number theory. Participants include senior and junior academics, members of government and corporate research facilities, and graduate students. The conference program will consist of five invited plenary talks and an expected 30-35 presentations by those researchers whose papers have been accepted for publication in the proceedings.  <br/><br/>This proposal seeks funds to support the travel and local expenses of about 7 conference participants who are US citizens or permanent residents.  It is expected that participants who apply for NSF funding will give a presentation (a talk or poster) at the conference.  Participants supported by this grant have not yet been chosen, but will be selected by the organizing committee based on applications which will be solicited as part of the registration process.  Selection criteria will favor postdocs, graduate students, and faculty (especially junior faculty) without grant support, in essentially that order.<br/><br/>"

Kumar will continue his research on sphere packing in high dimensions and related problems. The central question in sphere packing asks for the densest packing of Euclidean space by congruent non-overlapping spheres. The answer is known only in dimensions up to 3, and in general this is a very difficult though natural question. Cohn and Kumar have made progress in 8 and 24 dimensions, showing that the sphere packings coming from the E_8 and Leech lattices are very close to being the densest packings in these dimensions. They are investigating related problems, such as that of sphere packing on the surface of a sphere (spherical codes), hyperbolic sphere packing, and how to make these using potential energy minimization. Kumar will also work on the arithmetic of K3 surfaces: projective algebraic smooth surfaces with trivial canonical bundle and zero irregularity. Their geometry and moduli have been studied exhaustively by algebraic geometers, but questions about their arithmetic, such as rational points, connections with modular forms, etc., are not so well understood. Kumar has investigated the connection between some families of K3 surfaces and curves of genus two, with arithmetic applications such as finding elliptic curves of high rank and computing equations of Hilbert modular surfaces. <br/><br/>This project will focus on the areas of sphere packing and arithmetic geometry. The sphere packing question asks for a packing of space by equal sized non-overlapping spheres, so as to cover the maximum possible fraction of volume. Stated as a problem in geometry, it nevertheless has many connections to other parts of mathematics, such as number theory, group theory and Lie theory. It also has many important applications outside of mathematics, for instance, in coding and communication theory, and in physics. For instance, it is useful in connection with error correcting codes used on CDs, spherical codes used in cellphone signals, and radio or more general analog signals. Many related problems, such as minimization of potential energy, are of interest to physicists and materials scientists, for instance, in the self-assembly of nanoparticles. The PI, Kumar, and his collaborators have made progress in understanding sphere packing and related problems in high dimensions, and this project will continue that research. The field of arithmetic geometry applies techniques from algebra and algebraic geometry, which is the study of the geometry of sets of solutions to polynomial equations, to the field of number theory. For instance, one might wish to know the solutions in integers or rational number to a certain system of polynomial equations (such as Fermat's equation, x^n + y^n = z^n). Kumar's research focuses on the study of the arithmetic of K3 surfaces. These beautiful objects have connections to many parts of mathematics and physics, such as lattice theory and mirror symmetry. K3 surfaces and related geometric objects are of fundamental interest in string theory, which tries to understand the physical nature of the universe. This project will further the research into the number-theoretic properties of such surfaces.<br/><br/>"

The proposed projects, located within noncommutative algebra, will build up the infrastructure of and interconnections among active parts of several related areas<br/>-- noncommutative algebraic geometry, quantum groups, Poisson algebras, and ring theory. Roughly speaking, the long-term goals framing many of these projects stem from noncommutative algebraic geometry, and the basic examples come from quantum groups, while many lines of approach are recruited from ring theory. A major new drive directing the PI's research on the subject is the investigation of Poisson analogs in semiclassical limits of phenomena known or expected to hold in quantum algebras. The parallels that have arisen so far provide strong motivation for the strategy of linking up the two sides of the coin; at this point,  knowledge of one side allows the formulation of more precise conjectures for the other. A major goal is to tighten these connections.<br/><br/>A pervasive theme in the mathematical study of geometric objects is that the properties of these objects are completely encoded in the functions on them, and are often more accessible via these functions than directly. Within algebraic geometry -- the study of geometric spaces defined by polynomial equations -- it is the polynomial functions on a space that determine it. These functions form a ring (a system endowed with compatible addition and multiplication operations) which is, moreover, commutative (fg = gf always). In the 1980s, researchers in the former Soviet Union, in the process of solving certain problems in theoretical quantum physics, discovered rings which appear to enjoy all the structure of rings of functions on geometric spaces, except that the multiplication is noncommutative. In honor of their origins in quantum theory, these rings are now called ""quantized coordinate rings."" It proved very useful to treat them as if they were rings of functions (except for the noncommutativity), and the guiding principle in their study became the search for ""noncommutative versions of the geometry."" Sufficiently many common phenomena (both geometric and algebraic) have been discovered in a wide range of quantized coordinate rings to lead one to conjecture that general, axiomatizable underpinnings within this class of rings are responsible for the parallels in their behavior. The main long-term thrust of the PI's research is to uncover such general structures and decode their geometric content. In the medium term, the proposal aims to extend the range of known shared phenomena within this class of rings, in order to gain better insight into their common base.<br/>"

Fomin. This theory arose as an attempt to create an algebraic framework for the study of two classical fields: theory of total positivity, and representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. Since its inception, the theory of cluster algebras found a number of exciting connections and applications: quiver representations, preprojective algebras, Calabi-Yau algebras and categories, Seiberg dualities, discrete integrable systems, Poisson geometry, etc. The PI explores the structural properties of cluster algebras, and their connections and applications. He also develops the theory of quivers with potentials and their representations, motivated among other things, by the theory of superpotentials in theoretical physics. One of the main instruments of the study is polyhedral combinatorics.<br/><br/>This project has roots in two classical areas of mathematics: representation theory and the theory of total positivity. Representation theory is a mathematical approach to studying symmetry; more specifically, it encodes the symmetry properties of various physical and biological systems that occur in nature. Total positivity is a remarkable property of matrices (square arrays of numbers) that generalizes the familiar notion of positive numbers. Both theories find numerous applications in physics, chemistry and other sciences, as well as in other mathematical disciplines. In fact, representation theory serves as the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics, while total positivity is a major tool for explaining oscillations in mechanical systems. During the last decade, deep connections were found between the two fields, and the scope of their applications was greatly extended. This project explores the modern framework of representation theory and total positivity, with the goal of making its formalism more explicit and understandable.<br/>"

Hopf algebras are a common generalization of group algebras and Lie algebras. Many ideas from group theory and Lie theory are used to study Hopf algebras, but also Hopf algebras have been shown to be the right framework to study important problems in many areas. There have been recent advances in the subject with regard to classification problems, actions of Hopf algebras on rings, connections with noncommutative algebra, quantum groups, extensions to more general categories, invariant theory and representation theory of algebras. They have become an important tool in geometry and topology, especially knot theory, and provide a good framework for understanding invariants. They are used prominently in physics and chemistry.<br/><br/>This conference will focus especially on certain aspects that have become increasingly important in recent years. There has been progress in classifying Hopf algebras and their representations, both in the pointed case (using some analogs of Lie methods) and in the semisimple case (with using more group-theoretic analogs). In particular the notion of Frobenius-Schur indicators, studied classically for finite groups and extended to Hopf algebras with a suitable definition, has become a major topic of investigation in Hopf algebras. Indicators have been used as a new invariant to classify Hopf algebras and to study the representations of Hopf algebras. In a different direction, there have been major advances about the stability of various radicals under actions of Hopf algebra, a classical problem. This conference will bring together experts in Hopf algebras, representation theory, ring theory and group theory with common interests in Hopf algebras but different viewpoints. It is expected that this will lead to even further advances and more connections among the different fields. A further goal of the conference is to expose outstanding postdoctoral and graduate students, especially women and other under represented groups, to the plethora of techniques and important problems in the area and to have them interact with some of the top people in the field."

Already over 30 top mathematicians from the three conference fields have agreed to attend, including Spencer Bloch, Alain Connes, Alexander Goncharov, Dirk Kreimer, and Richard Melrose. The attendance for this conference is expected to be roughly 75 -- 100 mathematicians and mathematical physicists. <br/><br/>The three fields of motives, quantum field theory, and pseudodifferential operators are well established and active as independent fields, but until the past decade they have been viewed as essentially disjoint enterprises. The theory of motives was developed by Grothendieck in the 1960s as an arithmetic algebraic geometric setup incorporating diverse cohomology theories. Perturbative quantum field theory first appeared around 1945 to explain laboratory results in quantum electrodynamics and other field theories, and depends heavily on the calculation of Feynman integrals. Finally, the theory of pseudodifferential operators, dating from the 1960s, is a framework to treat all classical differential, Green's and heat operators in one setting.<br/><br/>Until recently, connections among these apparently very different fields were limited mainly to the appearance of Green's operators in quantum field theory. The unexpected appearance of multiple zeta values as values of Feynman<br/>integrals indicated a deep connection between quantum field theory and motives, the usual setting for multiple zeta functions. In addition, the Hopf algebra structure encoding the complicated combinatorics of Feynman integrals, <br/>uncovered by Connes and Kreimer, appears both in the theory of multiple zeta values and symbol calculations for pseudodifferential operators. Further research has shown that the connections are much more than coincidences, and<br/>the work of Bloch, Connes, Esnault, Kreimer, Marcolli and others points towards the possibility of a noncommutative geometry explanation or a direct motives/quantum field theory connection.<br/><br/>This is the first conference on this topic in the US. Since junior faculty and graduate students are encouraged to attend with partial NSF support, the schedule will include introductory lectures on the three conference areas and on Hopf algebras and multiple zeta functions. Other speakers will give research level talks on the conference areas, with a particular emphasis on their interactions."
