"2402553","Torsors under Reductive Groups and Dualities for Hitchin Systems","DMS","ALGEBRA,NUMBER THEORY,AND COM","07/01/2024","04/04/2024","Roman Fedorov","PA","University of Pittsburgh","Standard Grant","Tim Hodges","06/30/2027","$250,000.00","","fedorov@pitt.edu","4200 FIFTH AVENUE","PITTSBURGH","PA","152600001","4126247400","MPS","1264","","$0.00","The study of torsors (also known as principal bundles) began in the early 20th century by physicists as a formalism to describe electromagnetism. Later, this was extended to encompass strong and weak interactions, so that torsors became a basis for the so-called Standard Model - a physical theory describing all fundamental forces except for gravitation. The standard model predicted the existence of various particles, the last of which, called the Higgs boson, was found in a Large Hadron Collider experiment in 2012. In 1950's Fields medalist Jean-Pierre Serre recognized the importance of torsors in algebraic geometry. In his 1958 seminal paper he gave the first modern definition of a torsor and formulated a certain deep conjecture. The first part of this project is aimed at proving this conjecture, which is among the oldest unsolved foundational questions in mathematics. The second part of the project is related to the so-called Higgs bundles, which can be thought of as mathematical incarnations of the Higgs bosons. More precisely, the PI proposes to prove a certain duality for the spaces parameterizing Higgs bundles. This duality is a vast generalization of the fact that the Maxwell equations describing electromagnetic fields are symmetric with respect to interchanging electrical and magnetic fields. The duality is a part of the famous Langlands program unifying number theory, algebraic geometry, harmonic analysis, and mathematical physics. This award will support continuing research in these areas. Advising students and giving talks at conferences will also be part of the proposed activity.<br/><br/>In more detail, a conjecture of Grothendieck and Serre predicts that a torsor under a reductive group scheme over a regular scheme is trivial locally in the Zariski topology if it is rationally trivial. This conjecture was settled by Ivan Panin and the PI in the equal characteristic case. The conjecture is still far from resolution in the mixed characteristic case, though there are important results in this direction. The PI proposes to resolve the conjecture in the unramified case; that is, for regular local rings whose fibers over the ring of integers are regular. A more ambitious goal is to prove the purity conjecture for torsors, which is, in a sense, the next step after the Grothendieck?Serre conjecture. The second project is devoted to Langlands duality for Hitchin systems, predicting that moduli stacks of Higgs bundles for Langlands dual groups are derived equivalent. This conjecture may be viewed as the classical limit of the geometric Langlands duality. By analogy with the usual global categorical Langlands duality, the PI formulates a local version of the conjecture and the basic compatibility between the local and the global conjecture. The PI will attempt to give a proof of the local conjecture based on the geometric Satake equivalence for Hodge modules constructed by the PI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solving polynomial equations in rational numbers dates back to Diophantus in the 3rd century and has been a central subject in mathematics for generations. The modern study of Diophantine equations has incorporated the revolutionary idea of Riemann from his use of a class of special functions called ""zeta functions? or ""L-functions"". Such special functions are built up on counting the numbers of solutions of polynomial equations in the much simpler setting of modular arithmetic. In the 1960s, Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer came up with a remarkable conjecture revealing a relation between the zeros of L-functions and the solutions to a special class of polynomial equations in the rationals. Later Beilinson and Bloch conjectured that, for general  polynomial equations in the rationals, there should always be a relation between the zeros of L-functions and algebraic cycles which are ?parameter solutions to polynomial equations?.<br/> <br/>The project will study the zeros of L-functions through automorphic forms and special cycles on modular varieties. The theory of automorphic form provides a fruitful way to access the zeros of L-functions. The modular varieties are either Shimura varieties over number fields or moduli spaces of Shtukas over function fields. They play a central role in modern number theory and arithmetic geometry, and they often come with a great supply of algebraic cycles. The project aims to prove results relating zeros of L-functions and algebraic cycles on modular varieties, including new cases of the arithmetic Gan?Gross?Prasad conjecture for Shimura varieties associated to unitary groups, certain Higher Gross?Zagier formula over function fields, and the function field analog of Kudla?s program with an emphasis on the modularity of generating series of special cycles and the arithmetic Siegel?Weil formula. The project will also develop new relative trace formula, a powerful equation connecting spectral information and geometric structure, to study general automorphic period integral including the unitary Friedberg?Jacquet period. The broader impacts of this project include mentoring of graduate students and seminar organization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Now with the current technology of category theory (i.e., the study of objects and how they are transported), classical algebraic structures can be upgraded to provide information on natural phenomena that was not previously understood. This yields significant consequences in quantum physics. The work sponsored by this grant lies in the framework of monoidal categories, which are categories that come equipped with a way of combining objects and combining maps between objects. Several projects are earmarked for partial work by undergraduate and graduate students. Moreover, the PI will make significant progress on completing a three-volume, user-friendly textbook series on quantum algebra. The PI is also an active mentor for numerous members of underrepresented groups, particularly for those in groups to which the PI belongs (women, African-Americans, and first generation college students).<br/><br/>The first research theme of the projects sponsored by this grant is on algebras in monoidal categories. The PI will extend classical properties of algebras over a field to the monoidal context, and will also study properties that only have significant meaning in the categorical setting. In addition, the PI will examine other algebraic structures (e.g., Frobenius algebras) in monoidal categories, especially those tied to Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). Another theme of the PI's sponsored research work is on representations of certain monoidal categories that play a crucial role in 2-dimensional Conformal Field Theory (2d-CFTs), and that correspond to 3d-TQFTs. Of particular interest are representations of modular tensor categories, and the PI's work here will build on recent joint work with R. Laugwitz and M. Yakimov that constructs canonical representations of braided monoidal categories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This sequence could be highly structured - for instance, it could alternate periodically between 0 and 1.  Or it could be completely random, with the value of each member of the sequence having no relation whatsoever to the next.  It could also be ""pseudorandom"" - described by a deterministic algorithm, but yet statistically indistinguishable from a genuinely random sequence.  Or it could be some complex mixture of structure and (pseudo)randomness.  Can one define precisely what structure and randomness mean and describe arbitrary data as combinations of these two different components?  Such questions are of importance in cryptography, computer science, combinatorics, dynamics, and number theory, as they allow one to mathematically determine whether certain patterns in arbitrary streams of data are guaranteed to occur or not.  For instance, in 2004, Ben Green and the PI were able to settle a long-standing conjecture in number theory that the prime numbers contained arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, with the key idea being to break up the prime numbers into structured and random components and study the contribution of each component.  In computer science, this theory has led, for instance, to efficient ways to generate pseudorandom bits for several types of applications. In the subsequent twenty years, much progress has been made in quantifying more precisely what structure and randomness mean, particularly in the area of mathematics now known as higher-order Fourier analysis.  More understanding has been gained on the precise way in which number-theoretic structures, such as the primes, exhibit (pseudo-)random behavior at both large and small scales. There has been steady progress in this direction in recent years, in which the scale on which one is able to definitively demonstrate various types of pseudorandomness has narrowed over time, and further work will be carried out in this project, in particular, it is tantalizingly near to resolve (a version) of a well-known conjecture in number theory - the Chowla conjecture - which could be in turn a stepping stone to even more famous conjectures such as the twin prime conjecture. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/><br/>In this project, the PI (in conjunction with collaborators) plans to work on two related projects.  Firstly, the PI will continue recent work on developing general inverse theorems for the Gowers uniformity norms in additive combinatorics on one hand and the Host--Kra uniformity seminorms in ergodic theory on the other.  Secondly, the PI will continue building upon recent breakthroughs in the understanding of multiplicative functions, to make further progress towards the (logarithmically averaged) Chowla and Elliott conjectures for such functions, and to apply these results to related problems in analytic number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A conference on this topic is needed now, because in recent years, there have been advances on different aspects of the conjecture, while other key questions remain unsolved.  This would be the first conference to bring together all the researchers coming from these different perspectives.  The conference will feature 16 hour-long lectures, with speakers ranging from the original experts to younger mathematicians at the forefront of current research.  Some lectures will feature surveys of the field, which have educational value especially for the next generation of researchers.  The conference will also feature a problem session and many 5-minute lightning talk slots, which will give junior participants an opportunity to showcase their own research on a wide variety of relevant topics.  The award will support the travel and lodging of a variety of mathematicians including those from underrepresented groups in mathematics and attendees from colleges and universities where other sources of funding are unavailable.  Materials from the lectures, problem session, and lightning talks will be made publicly available on the website, to reach an audience broader than just conference attendees.<br/><br/>The Mordell conjecture motivated much of the development of arithmetic geometry in the 20th century, both before and after its resolution by Faltings.  The conference will feature lectures covering a broad range of topics connected with the Mordell conjecture, its generalizations, and other work it has inspired.  In particular, it will build on recent advances in the following directions: 1) nonabelian analogues of Chabauty's p-adic method; 2) the recent proof via p-adic Hodge theory; 3) uniform bounds on the number of rational points; 4) generalizations to higher-dimensional varieties, studied by various methods: analytic, cohomological, and computational.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI and his collaborators have broadened this conjecture to the so-called ""relative"" setting, which includes methods of studying special values of L-functions (also called zeta functions), such as in the prominent, and more recent, conjectures of Gan, Gross, and Prasad. The main tool for proving important instances of functoriality so far has been the trace formula, but in its current form it has nearly reached its limits. This project will examine ways to prove these conjectures by use of the idea of quantization, whose origins lie in mathematical physics. This idea will be used to construct novel ways of comparing (relative) trace formulas, drastically expanding their potential reach and applicability. The broader impacts of the project include conference organization and mentoring of graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI has already shown, in prior work, that in some low-rank cases one can establish relative functoriality via some novel ""transfer operators"" between relative trace formulas. Such non-standard comparisons of trace formulas were envisioned in Langlands's ""Beyond Endoscopy"" proposal; the ""relative"" setting allows for more flexibility, and more potential applications, for the exploration of such comparisons. Prior work was focused mostly on the case when the L-groups associated to the relative trace formulas are of rank one. The main goal of this project will be to examine ways to generalize the construction of transfer operators to higher rank. The main idea is to view a trace formula as the quantization of its cotangent stack, which in turn is largely controlled by the L-group. Using natural correspondences between such cotangent stacks, the project aims to construct transfer operators between their quantizations. On a separate track, the project will continue work on the duality of Hamiltonian spaces conjectured in the PI's recent work with Ben-Zvi and Venkatesh, with the aim of extending this duality beyond the hyperspherical setting, and exploring applications for the representation theory of p-adic groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A representation of an abstract algebraic object is a realization of the object via matrices of numbers. Often times, it is advantageous to view the entire collection of representations of an algebraic object as a structure known as a tensor category. Tensor categories consist of objects with additive and multiplicative operations like the integers or square matrices. Using the multiplicative operation, one can introduce the spectrum of the tensor category which is a geometric object (like a cone, sphere or torus). The PI will utilize the important connections between the algebraic and geometric properties of tensor categories to make advances in representation theory. The PI will continue to involve undergraduate and graduate students in these projects. He will continue to be an active member of the mathematical community by serving on national committees for the American Mathematical Society (AMS), and as an editor of a major mathematical journal.<br/><br/>The PI will develop new methods to study monoidal triangular geometry. Several central problems will utilize the construction of homological primes in the general monoidal setting and the introduction of a representation theory for MTCs. This representation theory promises to yield new information about the Balmer spectrum of the MTC. In particular, the general MTC theory will be applied to study representations of Lie superalgebras. The PI will also explore new ideas to study representations of classical simple Lie superalgebras. This involves systematically studying various versions of Category O and the rational representations for the associated quasi-reductive supergroups. One of the main ideas entails the use of the detecting and BBW parabolic subgroups/subalgebras. Furthermore, the PI will study the orbit structure of the nilpotent cone and will construct resolutions of singularities for the orbit closures. The PI will study important questions involving representations of reductive algebraic groups. Key questions will focus on the understanding the structures of induced representations, and whether these modules admit p-filtrations. These questions are interrelated with the 30-year-old problem of realizing projective modules for the Frobenius kernels via tilting modules for the reductive algebraic group, and the structure of extensions between simple modules for the first Frobenius kernel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A basic problem in dynamics is to understand how quickly a deterministic process, for example particles in a gas sampled at regularly spaced intervals, randomizes. The regular spacing amounts to sampling the system at the integers. Answering the subtler questions in this area often requires a non-trivial understanding of the properties of the integers. Conversely, a basic problem in number theory is to show that fundamental properties of the integers (e.g their prime factorization) randomize, and here techniques from dynamics can be useful. As for probability, questions from mathematical physics led to the development of techniques for the study of interacting systems, for example the macroscopic properties of a gas of electrons constrained to a surface. It has been recently understood that these techniques are applicable in a number theoretic context, for example in the study of the Riemann zeta-function, a basic function governing the finer properties of the integers. A second objective of this proposal is to develop such techniques further in a number theoretic context. The PI will continue training graduate students and mentor postdocs on topics related to this research.<br/><br/>In dynamics the focus of this project is to understand the convergence of dynamical systems over sparse sets (primes, squares) at every point in the space, with a particular focus on horocycle flow. A second goal is to reexamine the work of Elkies-McMullen on the gap distribution of square-roots of integers modulo one from the perspective of the circle method. In probability theory, the focus is on developing further connections with branching random walks and statistical mechanics, specifically by focusing on the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture and its other avatars.

In some sense the atoms of the theory are automorphic representations.  The Langlands functoriality conjecture predicts that a collection of natural correspondences preserve these atoms.  To even formulate this conjecture precisely, mathematical subjects as diverse as number theory, representation theory, harmonic analysis, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics are required.  In turn, work on the conjecture has enriched these subjects, and in some cases completely reshaped them. <br/><br/>One particularly important example of a correspondence that should preserve automorphic representations is the automorphic tensor product. It has been known for some time that in order to establish this particular case of Langlands functoriality it suffices to prove that certain functions known as L-functions are analytically well-behaved. More recently, Braverman and Kazhdan, Ngo, Lafforgue and Sakellaridis have explained that the expected properties of these L-functions would follow if one could obtain certain generalized Poisson summation formulae.  The PI has isolated a particular family of known Poisson summation formulae and proposes to splice them together to obtain the Poisson summation formulae relevant for establishing the automorphic tensor product.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A core goal in the subject deals with understanding the solutions of a system of polynomial equations, possibly in a large number of variables and with a large number of equations. Closely related to this is the concept of a free resolution. Constructing such a resolution amounts to repeatedly solving systems of polynomial equations. For many years, minimal free resolutions have been both central objects and fruitful tools in Commutative Algebra.  The idea of constructing free resolutions was introduced by Hilbert in a famous paper in 1890. The study of these objects flourished in the second half of the twentieth century and has seen spectacular progress recently. The field is very broad, with strong connections and applications to other mathematical areas. The broader impacts of the project include the writing of an expository paper, organization of professional development workshops for undergraduate students, and organization of mathematical conferences.<br/><br/>The main research goal in this project is to make significant progress in understanding the structure of minimal free resolutions and their numerical invariants. In particular, the PI will: work jointly with M. Mastroeni and J. McCullough on  Koszul Algebras;  continue work on minimal free resolutions of binomial edge ideals; study the asymptotic structure of minimal free resolutions over exterior algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, physical predictions have led to the development of mathematical invariants which count algebraic curves in spaces, and conversely, the mathematical study of these invariants has led to advances in string theory. This project further develops two curve counting techniques, the ""logarithmic gauged linear sigma model"" (log GLSM) and ""quasimaps"", and their combination, with the goal of making progress on challenging conjectures from physics, which have appeared out of reach of mathematicians until recently. This project will offer ample training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. In addition, the PI will organize a yearly intensive weekend learning workshop on a topic of interest, as well as organize events aiming to counter stereotypes in STEM.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project will result in a proof of the localization formula for log GLSM, which is of utmost importance for the application of this technique. In addition, effective invariants, which are a major ingredient of the localization formula, will be studied. In a different direction, the PI will explore applications of log GLSM to the tautological ring, to establish structural predictions observed in physics, such as the ""conifold gap condition"", for the quintic threefold and other one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to establish the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence for quintic threefolds in all genera. With regard to quasi-maps, the second main technique employed in this project, the PI will use quasi-maps for explicit computations of Gromov-Witten invariants of non-convex complete intersections. Quasi-maps appear necessary for approaching some of the more mysterious predictions from physics, and hence log GLSM will be extended to allow for quasi-maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This offers an enormous amount of flexibility in studying solutions sets in various settings, and indeed commutative algebra continues to develop a fascinating interaction with several fields, becoming an increasingly valuable tool in science and engineering. A key component of this project is the training of graduate students in topics connected with the research program.<br/><br/><br/>The focus of the research is on questions related to local cohomology, differential operators, and the property of having finite Frobenius representation type.

The interplay between automorphic forms and L-functions has a long and very fruitful history in number theory, and bridging both fields is still a very active area of research. This conference is oriented at establishing and furthering dialogue on new developments at the boundary of these areas. This will foster collaboration between researchers working in these fields.<br/> <br/>One beautiful feature of modern number theory is that many problems of broad interest, in areas of study as diverse as arithmetic geometry to mathematical physics, can be solved in an essentially optimal way if the natural extension of the Riemann hypothesis holds for L-functions associated to automorphic representations. Although many generalizations and applications around L-functions have have already been worked out, there are still various fundamental open problems among them to tackle, including bounds for and the value distribution of L-functions. The former is related to the pursuit of so-called sub-convexity bounds for L-functions. The latter is related to the Birch and Swinnterton-Dyer conjecture (another ?Millenium problem? posed by the Clay Mathematics institute). These pursuits are closely connected with the Langlands program, a ?grand unifying theory? relating automorphic forms.

A goal of this conference is to highlight research being conducted by underrepresented students in the areas of algebra and topology. At this unique meeting, attendees are exposed to a greater variety of current research, ideas, and results in their areas of study and beyond. Participants are also given the opportunity to meet and network with underrepresented professors and students who may later become collaborators and colleagues. This is particularly important for students with great academic potential who do not attend top-tier research institutions; students that are often overlooked, despite a strong faculty and graduate student population. Furthermore, USTARS promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Participants of USTARS continue to influence the next generation of students in positive ways by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events. USTARS exposes all participants to the research and activities of underrepresented mathematicians, encouraging a more collaborative mathematics community. <br/><br/>The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) is a project proposed by a group of underrepresented young mathematicians. The conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and is well-positioned to actively encourage participation by women and minorities. The symposium includes networking sessions along with research presentations. Speakers will give 30-minute parallel research talks. Graduate students will give at least 75% of these presentations. Two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour presentations and a poster session featuring invited undergraduates is also planned. Additionally, a discussion panel and creative math session will provide networking, guidance, and mentorship opportunities from past USTARS participants that have transitioned to full-time faculty positions.

The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent breakthroughs in mathematics. The AFW will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one quarter to one third of participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging ideas, and beginning new collaborations. This is the first time the AFW will meet in Oklahoma where many experts on automorphic forms and closely related topics are nearby. Thus, in addition to attracting speakers who participate annually, the workshop is likely to draw a mix of new attendees who will contribute new perspectives and energy and benefit from the workshop.  The workshop is known for its inclusive, encouraging atmosphere, particularly to early career researchers and to those from underrepresented groups in the number theory community. The workshop has traditionally been a fruitful place for these researchers to connect with potential collaborators and mentors at other institutions, working on related topics. To help achieve this goal, the 2024 AFW will feature five expository talks on various fundamental topics in the theory of automorphic forms, aimed at the graduate student level. There will also be two panel discussions focused on mathematical career questions.<br/> <br/>Automorphic forms play a central role in number theory, being integral to the proofs of many groundbreaking theorems, including Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor),  Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal).  Automorphic forms are the subject of many important ongoing conjectures, among them the Langlands program, connections to random matrix theory, and the generalized Riemann hypothesis. They also appear in many areas of mathematics outside number theory, most notably in mathematical physics. The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include elliptic, Siegel, Hilbert, and Bianchi modular forms, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular forms, quadratic forms, connections with mathematical physics, monstrous moonshine, and additional related areas of research.<br/> <br/> <br/>Additional information can be found on the conference website: http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Motivations for further study of this subject include the power of dynamical techniques in approaching problems in arithmetic geometry and the richness of dynamics as a source of compelling problems in arithmetic. The funding for this project will support the training of graduate students and early career researchers in arithmetic dynamics through activities such as courses and workshops, as well as collaboration between the PI and researchers in adjacent fields.<br/><br/>The project?s first area of focus is the setting of abelian varieties, where the PI plans to tackle various conjectures surrounding the fields of definition and S-integrality of points of small canonical height. One important component of this study is the development of quantitative lower bounds on average values of generalized Arakelov-Green?s functions, which extend prior results in the dimension one case. The PI intends to develop such results for arbitrary polarized dynamical systems, opening an avenue for a wide variety of arithmetic applications. A second area of focus concerns the relationship between Arakelov invariants on curves over number fields and one-dimensional function fields, and arithmetic on their Jacobian varieties. Here the project aims to relate the self-intersection of Zhang?s admissible relative dualizing sheaf to the arithmetic of small points on Jacobians, as well as to other salient Arakelov invariants such as the delta invariant. The third goal is to study canonical heights of subvarieties, especially in the case of divisors. A main focus here is the relationship between various measurements of the complexity of the dynamical system and the heights of certain subvarieties.

L-functions are functions on the complex plane that often encode interesting information about arithmetic objects, such as prime numbers, class numbers, or ranks of elliptic curves. For example, the Riemann zeta-function (which is one example of an L-function) is closely connected to the question of counting the number of primes less than a large number. Understanding the analytic properties of L-functions, such as the location of their zeros or their rate of growth, often provides insight into arithmetic questions of interest. The main goal of the project is to advance the knowledge of the properties of some families of L-functions and to obtain arithmetic applications. The educational component of the project involves groups of students at different stages, ranging from high school students to beginning researchers. Among the educational activities, the PI will organize a summer school in analytic number theory focusing on young mathematicians, and will run a yearly summer camp at UCI for talented high school students.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the project will investigate zeros of L-functions by studying their ratios and moments. While positive moments of L?functions are relatively well-understood, much less is known about negative moments and ratios, which have applications to many difficult questions in the field. The planned research will use insights from random matrix theory, geometry, sieve theory and analysis. The main goals fall under two themes. The first theme is developing a general framework to study negative moments of L-functions, formulating full conjectures and proving partial results about negative moments. The second theme involves proving new non-vanishing results about L-functions at special points. Values of L-functions at special points often carry important arithmetic information; the PI plans to show that wide classes of L-functions do not vanish at the central point (i.e., the center of the critical strip, where all the non-trivial zeros are conjectured to be), as well as to study correlations between the values of different L-functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first day is designed to encourage junior researchers to come and network, give talks in a friendly environment,  and participate without concern over the precise fit of their research to the narrow theme of the workshop. <br/><br/>The conference Arithmetic Quantum Field Theory, and the two-month program of the same title it concludes, are aimed at catalyzing interactions between mathematicians and physicists by disseminating exciting new connections emerging between quantum field theory and algebraic number theory, and in particular between the fundamental invariants of each: partition functions and L-functions.  On one hand, there has been tremendous progress in the past decade in our understanding of the algebraic structures underlying quantum field theory as expressed in terms of the geometry and topology of low-dimensional manifolds. On the other hand, the arithmetic topology dictionary provides a sturdy bridge between the topology of manifolds and the arithmetic of number fields. Thus, one can now port over quantum field theoretic ideas to number theory. The program will bring together a wide range of mathematicians and physicists working on adjacent areas to explore the emerging notion of arithmetic quantum field theory as a tool to bring quantum physics to bear on questions of interest for the theory of automorphic forms, harmonic analysis and L-functions, and conversely to explore potential geometric and physical consequences of arithmetic ideas.<br/>The conference website is https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event/aqftconf/ where recordings of the talks and notes from lectures will be made widely available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are two typical stages: 1) finding the general structure of representations of a given group (e.g., classifying irreducible representations), and 2) applying this to representations of particular interest (e.g., functions on a homogeneous space). This project aims to study higher representation theory, which studies the realization of groups as categorical symmetries. The emphasis of the proposal focuses on loop groups, where the theory remarkably mirrors classical harmonic analysis for p-adic groups. In particular, one finds Langlands-style decompositions here. This project focuses on understanding some key categories of interest in this framework. The investigator will study 3d mirror symmetry conjectures, representations of affine Lie algebras, and moduli spaces of bundles arising in the global geometric Langlands program. This project provides training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, 3d mirror symmetry, representations of (reductive) affine Lie algebras, and the geometric Langlands program are the three primary ways actions of loop groups of reductive groups on categories arise.

The PI will establish first cases of 3d mirror symmetry and apply the results to give coherent descriptions of some categories of primary interest in geometric representation theory. Representations of Lie algebras concern the action of a group on its category of Lie algebra representations.  The PI will extend previous work on critical level localization theory and develop a substitute for Soergel modules that will apply to poorly understood categories in the local geometric Langlands program. The applications to global geometric Langlands concern actions of loop groups of reductive groups on moduli spaces of a global nature, namely bundles with a level structure.

Algebraic geometry can be described as the study of systems of polynomial equations and their solutions, whereas topology is the mathematical discipline that studies notions such as ?shape? and ?space"" and develops mathematical techniques to distinguish and classify such objects. A notion of central importance in these areas is that of a ?moduli space? - this is a mathematical ?world map? that gives a complete inventory and classification of all instances of a particular mathematical object. The main research objective of the project is to better understand the structure of these spaces and to explore new phenomena, by importing techniques from neighboring areas of mathematics. While the primary aim is to advance knowledge in pure mathematics, developments from these areas have also had a long track record of successful applications in physics, data science, computer vision, and robotics. The educational component includes an outreach initiative consisting of a ?Math Circles Institute? (MCI). The purpose of the MCI is to train K-12 teachers from around the country in running the mathematical enrichment activities known as Math Circles. This annual 1-week program will pair teachers with experienced instructors to collaboratively develop new materials and methods to be brought back to their home communities. In addition, a research conference will be organized with the aim of attracting an international community of researchers and students and disseminating developments related to the research objectives of the proposal.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the research component is to develop new methods via topology and geometric group theory to study various moduli spaces, specifically, (1) strata of Abelian differentials and (2) families of polynomials. A major objective is to establish ?asphericality"" (vanishing of higher homotopy) of these spaces. A second objective is to develop the geometric theory of their fundamental groups. Asphericality occurs with surprising frequency in spaces coming from algebraic geometry, and often has profound consequences. Decades on, asphericality conjectures of Arnol?d, Thom, and Kontsevich?Zorich remain largely unsolved, and it has come to be regarded as a significantly challenging topic. This project?s goal is to identify promising-looking inroads. The PI has developed a method called ""Abel-Jacobi flow"" that he proposes to use to establish asphericality of some special strata of Abelian differentials. A successful resolution of this program would constitute a major advance on the Kontsevich?Zorich conjecture; other potential applications are also described. The second main focus is on families of polynomials. This includes linear systems on algebraic surfaces; a program to better understand the fundamental groups is outlined. Two families of univariate polynomials are also discussed, with an eye towards asphericality conjectures: (1) the equicritical stratification and (2) spaces of fewnomials. These are simple enough to be understood concretely, while being complex enough to require new techniques. In addition to topology, the work proposed here promises to inject new examples into geometric group theory. Many of the central objects of interest in the field (braid groups, mapping class groups, Artin groups) are intimately related to algebraic geometry.

These are geometric objects that are defined as solutions to polynomial equations with coefficients that are rational numbers. Shimura varieties have played a crucial role in settling several long standing conjectures, including the Mordel Conjecture.  The PI and his collaborators propose to work on the question of finding polynomial equations with integer coefficients which define Shimura varieties. This question is fundamental to the study of Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry and has broad applications to several important and well-known conjectures. The educational component of the project includes a workshop targeted at early-stage graduate students looking to work in Arithmetic Geometry, aimed at helping these students acquire background to start working on research problems in this field. The project also provides opportunities for undergraduate students to work on research problems, as well as thesis-problems for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The PI will work on the fundamental problems of studying integral models and the p-adic geometry of Shimura varieties.

One of the main notions used is that of a surface group representation, a concept which connects surfaces to generalizations of classical geometries such as Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. The study of surfaces has surprising applications throughout many fields of mathematics and physics. Consequently, the project lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines. In addition to cutting edge mathematical research, the project will promote the progress of science and mathematics through different workshops aimed at graduate students as well as community outreach events. The educational component will also focus on creating an engaging and inclusive place for mathematical interactions for students and early career researchers.<br/><br/>In the past decades, both the theories of Higgs bundles and Anosov dynamics have led to significant advancements in our understanding of the geometry of surface groups. Recent breakthroughs linking these approaches are indirect and mostly involve higher rank generalizations of hyperbolic geometry known as higher rank Teichmuller spaces. The broad aim of this project is to go beyond higher rank Teichmuller spaces by using Higgs bundles to identify subvarieties of surface group representations which generalize the Fuchsian locus in quasi-Fuchsian space. The cornerstone for the approach is the role of Slodowy slices for Higgs bundles. Specifically, the PI aims to establish Anosov properties of surface group representations associated to Slodowy slices in the Higgs bundle moduli space. This approach will significantly extend applications of Higgs bundles to both Anosov representations and (G,X) geometries. It will complete the component count for moduli of surface group representations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic numbers are the roots of polynomials with integer coefficients.  Symmetries inherent to these numbers are fundamental in number theory, the branch of mathematics devoted to the study of integers.  Deep conjectures of Langlands predict that the symmetries of algebraic numbers are apparent in very specific geometric spaces, known as locally symmetric spaces, which are associated to large groups of integer matrices.  Near every point, locally symmetric spaces are exceptionally symmetric, and their shapes nearby any two points are indistinguishable.  However, the large-scale geometry of these spaces is disordered and chaotic owing to one jarring geometric feature: straight lines emanating from the same point in different directions tend to diverge from each other at an exponential rate.  Additionally, the latter property makes these number theoretic worlds difficult to chart.  This project aims to systematically organize locally symmetric spaces arising from arithmetic in order to distill inherent structure thereon.  The blend of probabilistic, geometric, and algorithmic methods underlying this project lends itself well to an outreach program for middle school and high school students which the PI has piloted, designed to foster outside-the-box mathematical thinking. <br/><br/>From several perspectives, this project will probe the topology, geometry, and arithmetic of positive fundamental rank locally symmetric spaces of number theoretic origin.  First, it will chart these spaces using an expanding ball algorithm to construct point grids, akin to mapping the world by progressively building a network of cell towers and regularly transmitting signal to detect other towers nearby.  Second, it will study the bass notes of hyperbolic manifolds via relationships between spectrum and cycle complexity.  Third, it will attempt to overcome the absence of complex analytic structure on the overlying archimedean symmetric space by systematic use of associated p-adic symmetric spaces.  Construction of attendant rigid meromorphic cocycles for associated p-arithmetic groups give possible inroads to Hilbert's twelfth problem, regarding explicit class field theory, in new contexts beyond CM number fields and the classical theory of complex multiplication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of particular interest is when the set of solutions are one-dimensional, in which case it is called an algebraic curve.  Since polynomials are ubiquitous in science and engineering, such solution sets arise in many different contexts.  One important example is the interpolation problem: given a collection of general points, when is there a fixed type of algebraic curve passing through these points?  This problem has applications to cryptography and information theory.  The research projects will shed light on the possible realizations of an algebraic curve by polynomial equations, as well as new and important cases of the interpolation problem.  This will be complemented by educational and outreach activities, including a sequence of workshops designed for early-to-mid career women and nonbinary graduate students in algebraic geometry and mentoring undergraduate research.<br/><br/>More specifically, the research projects are in the following three directions.  The first focuses on the natural stratification of the space of vector bundles on a curve equipped with a fixed dominant map to another curve by the stability of the pushforward.

Because whole numbers are so fundamental, number theory has connections with all major areas of mathematics. For instance, consider the problem of finding the whole-number solutions to a given equation. One can consider the shape given by the graph of that equation, or the set of symmetries that the equation has, or the function whose coefficients come from counting the number of solutions over a variety of number systems. The geometric properties of this shape, the algebraic properties of these symmetries, and the analytic properties of this function are all intimately related to the behavior of the equation?s whole-number solutions. Number theorists use techniques from each of these mathematical areas, but also, in the process, uncover surprising connections between the areas whereby discoveries in one area can lead to growth in another. One part of number theory where the connections between geometry, algebra, and analysis are particularly strong is in the field of modular forms. The proposed research focuses on an important and well-known type of relation between different modular forms called congruence and aims to compute the number of forms that are congruent to a given modular form and uncover the number-theoretic significance of this computation. Many of the conjectures that drive this project were found experimentally, through computer calculations. The main educational objective is to contribute to the training of the next generation of theoretical mathematicians in computational and experimental methods. To achieve this, the Principal Investigator (PI) will design software modules for a variety of undergraduate algebra and number theory courses that provide hands-on experience with computation. In addition, the PI will supervise undergraduates in computational research experiments designed to numerically verify conjectures made in the project and to explore new directions.<br/><br/>Congruences between modular forms provide a link between two very different types of objects in number theory: algebraic objects, like Galois representations, and analytic objects, like L-functions. This link has been used as a tool for proving some of the most celebrated results in modern number theory, such as the Main Conjecture of Iwasawa theory. The proposed research pushes the study of congruences in a new, quantitative direction by counting the number of congruences, not just determining when a congruence exists. The central hypothesis is that this quantitative structure of congruences contains finer information about the algebraic and analytic quantities involved than the Main Conjecture and its generalizations (such as the Bloch?Kato conjecture) can provide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
