The event will take place in Paris, France from June 18, 2024, until June 21, 2024. Whole numbers are the atoms of our mathematical universe. Number theorists study why patterns arise among whole numbers. In the 1970's, Robert Langlands proposed connections between number theory and mathematical symmetry. His ideas revolutionized the field. Some of the most fruitful approaches to his ideas have come via calculus on geometric spaces. The conference funded here will expose cutting edge research on such approaches. The ideas disseminated at the conference will have a broad impact on the field. The presentations of leading figures will propel junior researchers toward new theories. The US-based participants will make a written summary of the conference. The summaries will encourage the next generation to adopt the newest perspectives. Writing them will also engender a spirit of collaboration within the research community. The summaries along with details of the events will be available on the website https://www.eventcreate.com/e/bellaiche/.<br/> <br/>The detailed aim of the conference is exposing research on modular forms and L-functions in the context of eigenvarieties. An eigenvariety is a p-adic space that encodes congruence phenomena in number theory. Families of eigenforms, L-functions, and other arithmetic objects find their homes on eigenvarieties. The conference's primary goal is exposing the latest research on such families. The presentations will place new research and its applications all together in one place, under the umbrella of the p-adic Langlands program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference is designed to unite experts in low-dimensional topology and algebraic geometry, spanning diverse career stages and affiliations. Beyond lectures delivered by internationally recognized experts, vertically integrated participation will be fostered by a poster session showcasing the contributions of early-career researchers and a Career and Mentorship Panel.<br/> <br/>The conference will investigate the intersection of low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. The roots of this interdisciplinary exploration trace back to Witten's groundbreaking work in the late 1980s and the emergence of the Jones polynomial in Chern-Simons theory. Since then, a landscape of profound connections between knot theory, moduli spaces, and string theory has emerged, due to the collective efforts of generations of mathematicians and physicists. Noteworthy developments include the deep ties between Heegaard Floer homology and the Fukaya category of surfaces, the intricate interplay revealed by Khovanov homology, and the correspondence of Gromov-Witten and Donaldson-Thomas theories. The study of moduli spaces of curves, as exemplified in Heegaard Floer homology, has played a pivotal role in several developments. The preceding three editions of the Richmond Geometry Meeting, encompassing both virtual and in-person gatherings, have showcased a wave of collaborative advancements in knot theory, algebraic geometry, and string theory. Topics such as braid varieties, Khovanov homotopy, link lattice homology, and the GW/DT correspondence in families have been explored, unveiling a nexus of interdependent breakthroughs.

This is part of an annual series hosted by Vanderbilt, known as the Shanks conference series. The main theme will be on new developments and recent interactions between the areas indicated in the title. The interplay between automorphic forms and L-functions has a long and very fruitful history in number theory, and bridging both fields is still a very active area of research. This conference is oriented at establishing and furthering dialogue on new developments at the boundary of these areas. This will foster collaboration between researchers working in these fields.<br/> <br/>One beautiful feature of modern number theory is that many problems of broad interest, in areas of study as diverse as arithmetic geometry to mathematical physics, can be solved in an essentially optimal way if the natural extension of the Riemann hypothesis holds for L-functions associated to automorphic representations. Although many generalizations and applications around L-functions have have already been worked out, there are still various fundamental open problems among them to tackle, including bounds for and the value distribution of L-functions. The former is related to the pursuit of so-called sub-convexity bounds for L-functions. The latter is related to the Birch and Swinnterton-Dyer conjecture (another ?Millenium problem? posed by the Clay Mathematics institute). These pursuits are closely connected with the Langlands program, a ?grand unifying theory? relating automorphic forms.

The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent breakthroughs in mathematics. The AFW will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one quarter to one third of participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging ideas, and beginning new collaborations. This is the first time the AFW will meet in Oklahoma where many experts on automorphic forms and closely related topics are nearby. Thus, in addition to attracting speakers who participate annually, the workshop is likely to draw a mix of new attendees who will contribute new perspectives and energy and benefit from the workshop.  The workshop is known for its inclusive, encouraging atmosphere, particularly to early career researchers and to those from underrepresented groups in the number theory community. The workshop has traditionally been a fruitful place for these researchers to connect with potential collaborators and mentors at other institutions, working on related topics. To help achieve this goal, the 2024 AFW will feature five expository talks on various fundamental topics in the theory of automorphic forms, aimed at the graduate student level. There will also be two panel discussions focused on mathematical career questions.<br/> <br/>Automorphic forms play a central role in number theory, being integral to the proofs of many groundbreaking theorems, including Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor),  Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal).  Automorphic forms are the subject of many important ongoing conjectures, among them the Langlands program, connections to random matrix theory, and the generalized Riemann hypothesis. They also appear in many areas of mathematics outside number theory, most notably in mathematical physics. The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include elliptic, Siegel, Hilbert, and Bianchi modular forms, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular forms, quadratic forms, connections with mathematical physics, monstrous moonshine, and additional related areas of research.<br/> <br/> <br/>Additional information can be found on the conference website: http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, physical predictions have led to the development of mathematical invariants which count algebraic curves in spaces, and conversely, the mathematical study of these invariants has led to advances in string theory. This project further develops two curve counting techniques, the ""logarithmic gauged linear sigma model"" (log GLSM) and ""quasimaps"", and their combination, with the goal of making progress on challenging conjectures from physics, which have appeared out of reach of mathematicians until recently. This project will offer ample training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. In addition, the PI will organize a yearly intensive weekend learning workshop on a topic of interest, as well as organize events aiming to counter stereotypes in STEM.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project will result in a proof of the localization formula for log GLSM, which is of utmost importance for the application of this technique. In addition, effective invariants, which are a major ingredient of the localization formula, will be studied. In a different direction, the PI will explore applications of log GLSM to the tautological ring, to establish structural predictions observed in physics, such as the ""conifold gap condition"", for the quintic threefold and other one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to establish the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence for quintic threefolds in all genera. With regard to quasi-maps, the second main technique employed in this project, the PI will use quasi-maps for explicit computations of Gromov-Witten invariants of non-convex complete intersections. Quasi-maps appear necessary for approaching some of the more mysterious predictions from physics, and hence log GLSM will be extended to allow for quasi-maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geometry has long been a cornerstone of mathematics, and invariants are the linchpins. Regarding Algebraic and Differential Geometry, the organizers are inviting expert speakers on topics such as the connections between projective and differential geometry. Considerations in these areas, such as questions about dimensions and defining equations of secant varieties, have led to powerful tools both within geometry and applications in areas such as computational complexity and quantum information. Likewise, the organizers are inviting application-area experts in Algebraic Complexity and Quantum Information. This natural juxtaposition of pure and applied mathematics will lead to new and interesting connections and help initiate new research collaborations. In addition to daily talks by seasoned experts, the conference will include young researchers in a Poster Session and provide networking opportunities, including working group activities, to help early career researchers meet others in the field, which will provide opportunities for new (and ongoing) research collaborations. It is anticipated that these collaborations will continue long after the meeting is over.

This subject synthesizes problems and techniques from the previously disparate areas of number theory and dynamical systems. Motivations for further study of this subject include the power of dynamical techniques in approaching problems in arithmetic geometry and the richness of dynamics as a source of compelling problems in arithmetic. The funding for this project will support the training of graduate students and early career researchers in arithmetic dynamics through activities such as courses and workshops, as well as collaboration between the PI and researchers in adjacent fields.<br/><br/>The project?s first area of focus is the setting of abelian varieties, where the PI plans to tackle various conjectures surrounding the fields of definition and S-integrality of points of small canonical height. One important component of this study is the development of quantitative lower bounds on average values of generalized Arakelov-Green?s functions, which extend prior results in the dimension one case. The PI intends to develop such results for arbitrary polarized dynamical systems, opening an avenue for a wide variety of arithmetic applications. A second area of focus concerns the relationship between Arakelov invariants on curves over number fields and one-dimensional function fields, and arithmetic on their Jacobian varieties. Here the project aims to relate the self-intersection of Zhang?s admissible relative dualizing sheaf to the arithmetic of small points on Jacobians, as well as to other salient Arakelov invariants such as the delta invariant. The third goal is to study canonical heights of subvarieties, especially in the case of divisors. A main focus here is the relationship between various measurements of the complexity of the dynamical system and the heights of certain subvarieties.

L-functions are functions on the complex plane that often encode interesting information about arithmetic objects, such as prime numbers, class numbers, or ranks of elliptic curves. For example, the Riemann zeta-function (which is one example of an L-function) is closely connected to the question of counting the number of primes less than a large number. Understanding the analytic properties of L-functions, such as the location of their zeros or their rate of growth, often provides insight into arithmetic questions of interest. The main goal of the project is to advance the knowledge of the properties of some families of L-functions and to obtain arithmetic applications. The educational component of the project involves groups of students at different stages, ranging from high school students to beginning researchers. Among the educational activities, the PI will organize a summer school in analytic number theory focusing on young mathematicians, and will run a yearly summer camp at UCI for talented high school students.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the project will investigate zeros of L-functions by studying their ratios and moments. While positive moments of L?functions are relatively well-understood, much less is known about negative moments and ratios, which have applications to many difficult questions in the field. The planned research will use insights from random matrix theory, geometry, sieve theory and analysis. The main goals fall under two themes. The first theme is developing a general framework to study negative moments of L-functions, formulating full conjectures and proving partial results about negative moments. The second theme involves proving new non-vanishing results about L-functions at special points. Values of L-functions at special points often carry important arithmetic information; the PI plans to show that wide classes of L-functions do not vanish at the central point (i.e., the center of the critical strip, where all the non-trivial zeros are conjectured to be), as well as to study correlations between the values of different L-functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On one hand, there has been tremendous progress in the past decade in our understanding of the algebraic structures underlying quantum field theory as expressed in terms of the geometry and topology of low-dimensional manifolds. On the other hand, the arithmetic topology dictionary provides a sturdy bridge between the topology of manifolds and the arithmetic of number fields. Thus, one can now port over quantum field theoretic ideas to number theory. The program will bring together a wide range of mathematicians and physicists working on adjacent areas to explore the emerging notion of arithmetic quantum field theory as a tool to bring quantum physics to bear on questions of interest for the theory of automorphic forms, harmonic analysis and L-functions, and conversely to explore potential geometric and physical consequences of arithmetic ideas.<br/>The conference website is https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event/aqftconf/ where recordings of the talks and notes from lectures will be made widely available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are two typical stages: 1) finding the general structure of representations of a given group (e.g., classifying irreducible representations), and 2) applying this to representations of particular interest (e.g., functions on a homogeneous space). This project aims to study higher representation theory, which studies the realization of groups as categorical symmetries. The emphasis of the proposal focuses on loop groups, where the theory remarkably mirrors classical harmonic analysis for p-adic groups. In particular, one finds Langlands-style decompositions here. This project focuses on understanding some key categories of interest in this framework.

The PI will establish first cases of 3d mirror symmetry and apply the results to give coherent descriptions of some categories of primary interest in geometric representation theory. Representations of Lie algebras concern the action of a group on its category of Lie algebra representations.  The PI will extend previous work on critical level localization theory and develop a substitute for Soergel modules that will apply to poorly understood categories in the local geometric Langlands program.

Algebraic geometry can be described as the study of systems of polynomial equations and their solutions, whereas topology is the mathematical discipline that studies notions such as ?shape? and ?space"" and develops mathematical techniques to distinguish and classify such objects. A notion of central importance in these areas is that of a ?moduli space? - this is a mathematical ?world map? that gives a complete inventory and classification of all instances of a particular mathematical object. The main research objective of the project is to better understand the structure of these spaces and to explore new phenomena, by importing techniques from neighboring areas of mathematics. While the primary aim is to advance knowledge in pure mathematics, developments from these areas have also had a long track record of successful applications in physics, data science, computer vision, and robotics. The educational component includes an outreach initiative consisting of a ?Math Circles Institute? (MCI). The purpose of the MCI is to train K-12 teachers from around the country in running the mathematical enrichment activities known as Math Circles. This annual 1-week program will pair teachers with experienced instructors to collaboratively develop new materials and methods to be brought back to their home communities. In addition, a research conference will be organized with the aim of attracting an international community of researchers and students and disseminating developments related to the research objectives of the proposal.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the research component is to develop new methods via topology and geometric group theory to study various moduli spaces, specifically, (1) strata of Abelian differentials and (2) families of polynomials. A major objective is to establish ?asphericality"" (vanishing of higher homotopy) of these spaces. A second objective is to develop the geometric theory of their fundamental groups. Asphericality occurs with surprising frequency in spaces coming from algebraic geometry, and often has profound consequences. Decades on, asphericality conjectures of Arnol?d, Thom, and Kontsevich?Zorich remain largely unsolved, and it has come to be regarded as a significantly challenging topic. This project?s goal is to identify promising-looking inroads. The PI has developed a method called ""Abel-Jacobi flow"" that he proposes to use to establish asphericality of some special strata of Abelian differentials. A successful resolution of this program would constitute a major advance on the Kontsevich?Zorich conjecture; other potential applications are also described. The second main focus is on families of polynomials. This includes linear systems on algebraic surfaces; a program to better understand the fundamental groups is outlined. Two families of univariate polynomials are also discussed, with an eye towards asphericality conjectures: (1) the equicritical stratification and (2) spaces of fewnomials. These are simple enough to be understood concretely, while being complex enough to require new techniques. In addition to topology, the work proposed here promises to inject new examples into geometric group theory. Many of the central objects of interest in the field (braid groups, mapping class groups, Artin groups) are intimately related to algebraic geometry. The fundamental groups of the spaces the PI studies here should be just as rich, and a major goal of the project is to bring this to fruition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cornerstone for the approach is the role of Slodowy slices for Higgs bundles. Specifically, the PI aims to establish Anosov properties of surface group representations associated to Slodowy slices in the Higgs bundle moduli space.

Algebraic numbers are the roots of polynomials with integer coefficients.  Symmetries inherent to these numbers are fundamental in number theory, the branch of mathematics devoted to the study of integers.  Deep conjectures of Langlands predict that the symmetries of algebraic numbers are apparent in very specific geometric spaces, known as locally symmetric spaces, which are associated to large groups of integer matrices.  Near every point, locally symmetric spaces are exceptionally symmetric, and their shapes nearby any two points are indistinguishable.  However, the large-scale geometry of these spaces is disordered and chaotic owing to one jarring geometric feature: straight lines emanating from the same point in different directions tend to diverge from each other at an exponential rate.  Additionally, the latter property makes these number theoretic worlds difficult to chart.  This project aims to systematically organize locally symmetric spaces arising from arithmetic in order to distill inherent structure thereon.  The blend of probabilistic, geometric, and algorithmic methods underlying this project lends itself well to an outreach program for middle school and high school students which the PI has piloted, designed to foster outside-the-box mathematical thinking. <br/><br/>From several perspectives, this project will probe the topology, geometry, and arithmetic of positive fundamental rank locally symmetric spaces of number theoretic origin.  First, it will chart these spaces using an expanding ball algorithm to construct point grids, akin to mapping the world by progressively building a network of cell towers and regularly transmitting signal to detect other towers nearby.  Second, it will study the bass notes of hyperbolic manifolds via relationships between spectrum and cycle complexity.  Third, it will attempt to overcome the absence of complex analytic structure on the overlying archimedean symmetric space by systematic use of associated p-adic symmetric spaces.

One important example is the interpolation problem: given a collection of general points, when is there a fixed type of algebraic curve passing through these points?  This problem has applications to cryptography and information theory.  The research projects will shed light on the possible realizations of an algebraic curve by polynomial equations, as well as new and important cases of the interpolation problem.  This will be complemented by educational and outreach activities, including a sequence of workshops designed for early-to-mid career women and nonbinary graduate students in algebraic geometry and mentoring undergraduate research.<br/><br/>More specifically, the research projects are in the following three directions.  The first focuses on the natural stratification of the space of vector bundles on a curve equipped with a fixed dominant map to another curve by the stability of the pushforward.  The second focuses on the interpolation problem in other settings, including when the ambient variety is a homogeneous space.  The last focuses on the rationality problem for varieties over nonclosed ground fields, and in particular upon generalizations of the intermediate Jacobian torsor obstruction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because whole numbers are so fundamental, number theory has connections with all major areas of mathematics. For instance, consider the problem of finding the whole-number solutions to a given equation. One can consider the shape given by the graph of that equation, or the set of symmetries that the equation has, or the function whose coefficients come from counting the number of solutions over a variety of number systems. The geometric properties of this shape, the algebraic properties of these symmetries, and the analytic properties of this function are all intimately related to the behavior of the equation?s whole-number solutions. Number theorists use techniques from each of these mathematical areas, but also, in the process, uncover surprising connections between the areas whereby discoveries in one area can lead to growth in another. One part of number theory where the connections between geometry, algebra, and analysis are particularly strong is in the field of modular forms. The proposed research focuses on an important and well-known type of relation between different modular forms called congruence and aims to compute the number of forms that are congruent to a given modular form and uncover the number-theoretic significance of this computation. Many of the conjectures that drive this project were found experimentally, through computer calculations. The main educational objective is to contribute to the training of the next generation of theoretical mathematicians in computational and experimental methods. To achieve this, the Principal Investigator (PI) will design software modules for a variety of undergraduate algebra and number theory courses that provide hands-on experience with computation. In addition, the PI will supervise undergraduates in computational research experiments designed to numerically verify conjectures made in the project and to explore new directions.<br/><br/>Congruences between modular forms provide a link between two very different types of objects in number theory: algebraic objects, like Galois representations, and analytic objects, like L-functions. This link has been used as a tool for proving some of the most celebrated results in modern number theory, such as the Main Conjecture of Iwasawa theory. The proposed research pushes the study of congruences in a new, quantitative direction by counting the number of congruences, not just determining when a congruence exists. The central hypothesis is that this quantitative structure of congruences contains finer information about the algebraic and analytic quantities involved than the Main Conjecture and its generalizations (such as the Bloch?Kato conjecture) can provide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Easy to visualize and appealing in their simplicity, tilings have fascinated mathematicians at all levels, artists, architects, and the general public. This goals of this project are (1) to study tilings in the context of recent mathematical developments about algebraic curves and surfaces, exploring their connections to algebra, geometry, and representation theory, (2) to disseminate mathematical ideas to a wide audience and increase aesthetic and intellectual appreciation of mathematics in the general public, and (3) to develop an active and diverse community of young researchers, postdocs, and PhD students focusing on this circle of ideas.<br/><br/>One primary area of research will be modular toroidal compactifications of spaces of K3 surfaces. This project, joint with V. Alexeev, seeks to build extensions of the universal family of polarized K3 surfaces to the boundary of a toroidal compactification, extending previous work on degree 2 and elliptic K3 surfaces. The approach employs tilings of integral-affine structures on the sphere. The second primary research topic is moduli spaces of higher differentials. This project aims to study strata of higher differentials, their volumes, and the connection with enumeration of tilings. Joint work with P. Smillie explores decompositions of flat surfaces into Penrose-like tiles. The approach is novel, requiring a generalization of Hurwitz theory to one complex-dimensional leaf spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
