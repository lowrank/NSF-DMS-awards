This conference has been running since 2008, with support from NSF in many years, including the last three in-person conferences, in 2019, 2022, and 2023. Continuing NSF support will allow  to keep the conference at a current level of more than 100 registered participants, three hour-long keynote presentations, and 40-45 contributed talks of 20-25 minutes in length. The three keynote speakers are professional mathematicians, while most of the other participants are graduate students, with some postdocs and undergraduates.<br/><br/>The conference is run by a rotating committee of graduate students, with general oversight and guidance from the P.I. and some other faculty members.  This helps  to maintain a friendly and inclusive atmosphere, to facilitate free scientific interactions at the level appropriate for the beginning researchers at various stages of their mathematical development. This also gives the graduate student organizers experience in running a larger conference, and helps them appreciate what is involved in this, when they go give talks at conferences elsewhere. The organizers make efforts to encourage diversity, both by virtue of the varied backgrounds of the organizing committee members, and by the selection of the keynote speakers, without sacrificing the scientific level of the conference.

This is achieved by studying a ?parameter space? for these structures. The overarching goal of this project is to use techniques from commutative algebra to tackle longstanding questions related to the Hilbert scheme, a parameter space for polynomials with fixed properties. The project?s broader impacts include developing new packages for the open-source computer algebra system Macaulay2, organizing local seminars, and organizing mathematical conferences. <br/><br/>The investigator will focus on three areas of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry: 1) Singularities of the Hilbert scheme of points on a threefold: The main goal is to understand the singularities of the Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth threefold. In particular, the investigator will focus on determining the smooth points and explaining some of the patterns appearing in the structure of the singularities. 2) Exploring multigraded Hilbert schemes and other moduli spaces: The investigator will study the space of branch varieties, a close analogue of the Hilbert scheme, and focus on studying the projectivity of this moduli space. 3) Varieties in weighted projective spaces: The investigator will focus on developing a set of tools to extend classical theorems in projective space, such as Macaulay?s theorem on the existence of Hilbert functions and the del Pezzo-Bertini classification of varieties of minimal degree, to weighted projective spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are two typical stages: 1) finding the general structure of representations of a given group (e.g., classifying irreducible representations), and 2) applying this to representations of particular interest (e.g., functions on a homogeneous space). This project aims to study higher representation theory, which studies the realization of groups as categorical symmetries. The emphasis of the proposal focuses on loop groups, where the theory remarkably mirrors classical harmonic analysis for p-adic groups. In particular, one finds Langlands-style decompositions here. This project focuses on understanding some key categories of interest in this framework. The investigator will study 3d mirror symmetry conjectures, representations of affine Lie algebras, and moduli spaces of bundles arising in the global geometric Langlands program. This project provides training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, 3d mirror symmetry, representations of (reductive) affine Lie algebras, and the geometric Langlands program are the three primary ways actions of loop groups of reductive groups on categories arise. A large class of 3d mirror symmetry conjectures concerns the categorical Plancherel formula for loop group actions on categories of sheaves on loop spaces of particular varieties with group actions. The PI will establish first cases of 3d mirror symmetry and apply the results to give coherent descriptions of some categories of primary interest in geometric representation theory. Representations of Lie algebras concern the action of a group on its category of Lie algebra representations.  The PI will extend previous work on critical level localization theory and develop a substitute for Soergel modules that will apply to poorly understood categories in the local geometric Langlands program. The applications to global geometric Langlands concern actions of loop groups of reductive groups on moduli spaces of a global nature, namely bundles with a level structure. The PI will extend the Satake theorem and apply the result to study Eisenstein series in the global geometric Langlands program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key tool in the project is to use the limiting geometric structure of solutions of large complexity, thereby allowing the PI to study solutions of increasing complexity in a uniform manner.  Understanding the arithmetic of varieties has many applications including to cryptography and to coding theory. This project also funds mentoring and training of early career mathematicians, particularly those from groups who have been historically excluded from mathematics. In addition to training Ph.D. students at their own institution, the PI also co-organizes the Roots of Unity workshop series and the Women in Numbers conference series.<br/><br/>More specifically, the main research focus of the proposal is to organize and, in the case of a rank 0 curve, even describe all algebraic points on a curve. This includes characterizing the local splitting behavior of the residue fields of points that appear in a fixed linear system. In addition, the PI will use the Abel-Jacobi map to package all algebraic points on a curve with rank 0 Jacobian in terms of a finite set of complete linear systems. This project builds on the PI's prior work on isolated and parameterized points and on degree sets over Henselian fields. The proposal also includes complementary projects that explore the behavior of algebraic points on surfaces. These complementary projects focus on particular classes of surfaces of negative Kodaira dimension and surfaces of Kodaira dimension 0 with a view to understanding the different phenomena that can arise for higher dimensional varieties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop centers on a series of long-standing conjectures that appear in parallel in two major fields of mathematics. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers from these two fields to discuss recent advances on these conjectures. Another goal is to train more researchers to work on these important problems and help them build connections between the two fields. The overarching goal of this award would be to increase US participation in this highly active area of research, and to foster collaborations between US mathematicians and those from other countries. The funding is aimed especially at postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, as well as participants who do not have independent funding, to attend this workshop, and it will also be used to encourage participation by individuals from underrepresented groups in mathematics. A recent workshop held in Banff, Canada in 2022 initiated this goal, and funding for this event would cement the connections already made and build new ones for younger participants. The bridges we are building will not only connect researchers located in different countries but also between those working in different areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>Algebra and topology are thriving branches of mathematics that are well represented in most math departments. Commutative algebra, as the algebraic underpinnings of algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology, with its strong focus on homology and homotopy, have occasional significant overlap in both methods and aims. The goal is to create a strong working alliance between the groups working on these conjectures and related problems, and also to get younger researchers involved in these problems. In fact, total Betti numbers appear in related, decades-old rank conjectures in commutative algebra and equivariant topology. On the topological side, Halperin and Carlsson conjectured that the total Betti number of a compact space with a free torus action or p-torus action of rank r is bounded below by 2r, which has inspired much research on the topological side of spaces with a group action. On the algebraic side, Avramov conjectured a similar lower bound for the total Betti number of finite length modules over a local ring. Recent work of Walker and VandeBogert-Walker resolves this conjecture positively for rings of prime characteristic, whereas counterexamples to a stronger conjecture show the subtlety of the questions.

The main objects of study in this project are modular forms, complex analytic functions that encode a wide variety of arithmetic information in various ways and play a major role in modern number theory, with connections to combinatorics, algebraic geometry, representation theory, topology, and mathematical physics. While the most classical modular forms are holomorphic, real-analytic modular forms have also been studied for decades and become essential tools in analytic number theory. More recently, harmonic Maass forms have appeared in many applications, for example, to indefinite theta functions, combinatorics, and elliptic curves. This project will explore the arithmetic information encoded by the harmonic Maass forms and their closely related generalizations, and ways of extending classical methods from analytic number theory to study them.  The PI will also use the grant to support the dissemination of the research ideas by the PI and her PhD students at conferences and to organize number theory seminars.<br/><br/>The PI plans to explore the connections between real-analytic modular forms and L-functions. This project will elucidate connections between values of L-functions and harmonic and polyharmonic Maass forms, and will use these connections to develop new methods of constructing modular forms and summation formulas for mock modular forms. The methods will utilize differential operators on modular forms, the spectral theory of automorphic forms, and techniques from the analytic theory of L-functions such as converse theorems. Applications to the study of Hurwitz class numbers and quadratic number fields will also be explored.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While problems in this area are often simple to state, they can be fiendishly difficult to solve. The subfield of function field number theory aims to obtain insight on these problems by considering a kind of model or parallel universe where numbers behave differently. We consider what happens when we add or multiply numbers as normal but, except, instead of carrying digits, we simply drop the excess. Certainly arithmetic is a little easier with this modified rule, but more surprisingly, some of the most important problems in number theory become easier as well, with even some of the most difficult ones becoming solvable. (Technically, we should work in binary, or any prime base, rather than our usual base 10, for this.) Alternately, we can describe this variant arithmetic as the addition or multiplication of polynomial functions in a single variable. In this setting, we can connect number-theoretic questions to geometry, by viewing the graph of the polynomial as a geometric object. In this award  the PI's research uses geometric tools to solve new problems in this area.<br/><br/>The PI's research has resolved function field analogues of classical problems in number theory, including the twin primes conjecture and Chowla's conjecture (both joint with Shusterman), cases of the Ramanujan conjecture (joint with Templier), and conjectures about moments of L-functions. In this award the PI will continue along these lines, proving additional results about the distribution of prime numbers, L-function moments, and automorphic forms, and work in further directions such as non-abelian Cohen-Lenstra heuristics. These works are all based on etale cohomology theory, where the foundational result, Deligne's Riemann Hypothesis, allows many different analytic problems (problems about proving some inequality) to be reduced to cohomology problems (problems about calculating some of the cohomology groups of a variety or sheaf). The relevant varieties are high-dimensional, and calculating the necessary cohomology groups requires techniques like vanishing cycles theory and the characteristic cycle.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, physical predictions have led to the development of mathematical invariants which count algebraic curves in spaces, and conversely, the mathematical study of these invariants has led to advances in string theory. This project further develops two curve counting techniques, the ""logarithmic gauged linear sigma model"" (log GLSM) and ""quasimaps"", and their combination, with the goal of making progress on challenging conjectures from physics, which have appeared out of reach of mathematicians until recently. This project will offer ample training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs. In addition, the PI will organize a yearly intensive weekend learning workshop on a topic of interest, as well as organize events aiming to counter stereotypes in STEM.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project will result in a proof of the localization formula for log GLSM, which is of utmost importance for the application of this technique. In addition, effective invariants, which are a major ingredient of the localization formula, will be studied. In a different direction, the PI will explore applications of log GLSM to the tautological ring, to establish structural predictions observed in physics, such as the ""conifold gap condition"", for the quintic threefold and other one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to establish the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence for quintic threefolds in all genera. With regard to quasi-maps, the second main technique employed in this project, the PI will use quasi-maps for explicit computations of Gromov-Witten invariants of non-convex complete intersections. Quasi-maps appear necessary for approaching some of the more mysterious predictions from physics, and hence log GLSM will be extended to allow for quasi-maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are numerous books on their properties and behaviors and descriptions as integrals, series, and so on.  They appear in number theory through formulas of Voronoi, Petersson and Kuznetsov.  In particular, the formula of Kuznetsov, also known as a relative trace formula, gives connections between interesting objects in analysis and algebra/geometry.  This research studies the generalizations of Kuznetsov's formula and the generalized Bessel functions that appear in such formulas, with the goal of building a body of knowledge similar to what is known about the classical Bessel functions. This will allow analytic number theorists to explore the applications of these new Kuznetsov-type formulas.  Part of the funding for the project will be used to support undergraduate and master's-level research in analytic number theory.<br/><br/>While the Kuznetsov formula for SL(2) has been the subject of intense research for the past 40 years, much less is known about its generalizations to reductive groups.  These generalizations relate the exponential sums occurring in the Fourier coefficients of Poincare series to the Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms and the integral transforms in these generalized Kuznetsov formulas can, conjecturally, be expressed as kernel integral transforms; the kernels are generalized Bessel functions.  This research aims to extend the study of Bessel functions to groups such as GL(n) and GSp(n).  The immediate goals are to study their differential equations, integral representations and give basic asymptotics of their integral transforms in low-rank groups such as GL(4) and GSp(4).  Long-term goals for the project include extending these results to arbitrary rank and applications such as the arithmetically-weighted Weyl law.  Smaller, associated projects on GL(3) include studying the Poincare series occurring in the GL(3) Fourier expansion, application of the Kuznetsov formula to the supremum norm problem as well as the relationship between vector sup norms and scalar sup norms for Maass forms with weight.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solving such systems directly often proves to be intractable. A fundamental theme in algebraic geometry is the interplay between the qualitative geometry of algebraic varieties and the quantitative analysis of solutions to polynomial equations. Central to this is the question of classifying algebraic varieties. The answer to the classification question often comes in the form of a so-called moduli space, which is a parameter space for the algebraic varieties of interest. Each point of a moduli space represents a variety, and the geometry of the moduli space reflects the ways these varieties change and deform as the parameters vary. The classification question, then, is tantamount to understanding the geometry of the corresponding moduli space. This project will develop new tools in moduli theory and use them to advance the classification of algebraic varieties. In addition, the project will provide research training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the Deligne-Mumford compactification of the space of pointed curves by pointed stable curves has been the gold standard in moduli theory. In higher dimensions, the stable pair, or KSBA, compactification serves the same role. However, its construction and geometry are considerably more intricate, and few general reults about its local and global geometry are known. This project will develop and refine techniques in the deformation theory of stable pairs and wall-crossing phenomena for higher-dimensional moduli, thereby offering a path toward developing higher-dimensional enumerative geometry. A second focus is to explore the log Calabi-Yau wall. The theory of stable pairs applies to varieties of log general type, and the theory of K-stability applies to log Fano varieties. This project will develop a moduli theory for log Calabi-Yau pairs that will bridge the gap between KSBA- and K-moduli. Finally, the project aims to use the previously developed moduli theoretic techniques to answer questions in arithmetic geometry and arithmetic statistics, namely on counting rational points of bounded height on stacks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI and his collaborators have broadened this conjecture to the so-called ""relative"" setting, which includes methods of studying special values of L-functions (also called zeta functions), such as in the prominent, and more recent, conjectures of Gan, Gross, and Prasad. The main tool for proving important instances of functoriality so far has been the trace formula, but in its current form it has nearly reached its limits. This project will examine ways to prove these conjectures by use of the idea of quantization, whose origins lie in mathematical physics. This idea will be used to construct novel ways of comparing (relative) trace formulas, drastically expanding their potential reach and applicability. The broader impacts of the project include conference organization and mentoring of graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI has already shown, in prior work, that in some low-rank cases one can establish relative functoriality via some novel ""transfer operators"" between relative trace formulas. Such non-standard comparisons of trace formulas were envisioned in Langlands's ""Beyond Endoscopy"" proposal; the ""relative"" setting allows for more flexibility, and more potential applications, for the exploration of such comparisons. Prior work was focused mostly on the case when the L-groups associated to the relative trace formulas are of rank one. The main goal of this project will be to examine ways to generalize the construction of transfer operators to higher rank. The main idea is to view a trace formula as the quantization of its cotangent stack, which in turn is largely controlled by the L-group. Using natural correspondences between such cotangent stacks, the project aims to construct transfer operators between their quantizations.

Representation theory is a branch of mathematics that studies symmetries of physical theories and mathematical objects. Often, the main objects in representation theory are only the shadows of richer structures that are recovered through deeper study. Noncommutative algebra is a related branch of mathematics that studies deformations of commutative objects found in quantum theories, representation theory, and geometry. The foci of the conferences will be on recent advances at the interface of representation theory, categorification, and noncommutative algebra; on fostering an environment for the establishment of international collaborations between Canada, Mexico, and the USA in these research areas; and on exposing graduate students, post-docs, and early-career faculty in the three countries to current developments in the field. A poster session will run through the full meeting where early-career attendees will present their research.<br/><br/>The main scientific topics for the sixth meeting in Mexico City will be geometric, algebraic, and homological methods in representation theory, representation theoretic and homological properties of noncommutative algebras, and the investigation of those problems using categorical methods. The talks will cover some of the most recent trends, including the following: cluster algebras, monoidal and additive categorifications, quantum symmetries, finite tensor categories, representations of quantized affine Kac-Moody algebras, Calabi-Yau algebras and triangulated categories, Hopfological algebra, web approaches to modular representation theory, and representation theoretic aspects of Heegaard-Floer homology.

Enumerative geometry is the study of a particular class of mathematical problems, called enumerative problems, which are fundamental to STEM fields including mathematics, particle physics, robotics, and computer vision. The main goal of this workshop is to unite experts working on problems related to enumerative geometry to increase dialogue between theory and application. There will be several talks on state-of-the-art research in computational and applied enumerative geometry, software demonstrations, and time to discuss open problems. The exchange of ideas will inform experts as they continue devising computational investigations of enumerative problems going forward. The grant supports the participation of fifteen US-based participants in the workshops. <br/><br/>Classically, an enumerative problem asks how many geometric objects have a prescribed position with respect to other fixed geometric objects. Famous examples include the problems of (a) 2 lines meeting four lines, (b) 27 lines on a cubic surface, and (c) 3264 conics tangent to five conics in the plane. A modern definition of an enumerative problem is a system of polynomial equations in variables and parameters with finitely many solutions given fixed generic parameters.  Counting solutions to such a problem is the tip of the iceberg.  Beyond enumeration lie questions of symmetries, solvability, real behavior, and computation.  Techniques from a broad range of disciplines lend themselves to the creation of algorithms and software designed to answer these questions. ""Computational Enumerative Geometry"" refers to this approach of using computers to solve, experiment with, and prove theorems about, enumerative problems.

The tools used to study L-functions draw from many fields including analysis, algebra, algebraic geometry, automorphic forms, representation theory, probability and random matrices, and mathematical physics. Many of the projects in this proposal concern the connection between problems in number theory and the distribution of zeros of L-functions. This connection is central to two of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, the Riemann hypothesis and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. This award aims to use tools from the theory of L-functions to make new progress on some classical problems in number theory as well as establish new connections between the theory of L-functions to fields such as additive combinatorics. The PI will continue training and mentoring graduate students on topics related to this research, and this project will provide research training opportunities for them.<br/> <br/>One goal of this project aims to use tools from Fourier analysis, along with input from zeros of L-functions, to study classical problems in number theory such as bounding the least quadratic non-residue modulo a prime, the least prime in an arithmetic progression, and the maximum size of modulus and argument of an L-functions on the critical line. Each of these problems requires using explicit formulae (connecting zeros of L-functions to the primes) to create a novel Fourier optimization framework and then to solve the resulting problem in analysis. This project also aims to study a number of problems concerning the L-functions associated to classical holomorphic modular forms, including studying simultaneous non-vanishing of L-functions at the central point, using sieve methods to studying non-vanishing of central values of L-functions in certain sparse (but arithmetically interesting) families, and to study the proportion of the non-trivial zeros of a modular form L-function that are simple. Using known partial progress toward the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, some of these proposed problems have applications to studying algebraic ranks of elliptic curves. Another goal of this project is to use tools from the theory of L-functions in a novel way to investigate problems in additive combinatorics such as studying sums of dilates in certain arithmetically interesting groups.<br/><br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Algebra and Number Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

L-functions are functions on the complex plane that often encode interesting information about arithmetic objects, such as prime numbers, class numbers, or ranks of elliptic curves. For example, the Riemann zeta-function (which is one example of an L-function) is closely connected to the question of counting the number of primes less than a large number. Understanding the analytic properties of L-functions, such as the location of their zeros or their rate of growth, often provides insight into arithmetic questions of interest. The main goal of the project is to advance the knowledge of the properties of some families of L-functions and to obtain arithmetic applications. The educational component of the project involves groups of students at different stages, ranging from high school students to beginning researchers. Among the educational activities, the PI will organize a summer school in analytic number theory focusing on young mathematicians, and will run a yearly summer camp at UCI for talented high school students.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, the project will investigate zeros of L-functions by studying their ratios and moments. While positive moments of L?functions are relatively well-understood, much less is known about negative moments and ratios, which have applications to many difficult questions in the field. The planned research will use insights from random matrix theory, geometry, sieve theory and analysis. The main goals fall under two themes. The first theme is developing a general framework to study negative moments of L-functions, formulating full conjectures and proving partial results about negative moments. The second theme involves proving new non-vanishing results about L-functions at special points. Values of L-functions at special points often carry important arithmetic information; the PI plans to show that wide classes of L-functions do not vanish at the central point (i.e., the center of the critical strip, where all the non-trivial zeros are conjectured to be), as well as to study correlations between the values of different L-functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A representation of an abstract algebraic object is a realization of the object via matrices of numbers. Often times, it is advantageous to view the entire collection of representations of an algebraic object as a structure known as a tensor category. Tensor categories consist of objects with additive and multiplicative operations like the integers or square matrices. Using the multiplicative operation, one can introduce the spectrum of the tensor category which is a geometric object (like a cone, sphere or torus). The PI will utilize the important connections between the algebraic and geometric properties of tensor categories to make advances in representation theory.

Several central problems will utilize the construction of homological primes in the general monoidal setting and the introduction of a representation theory for MTCs. This representation theory promises to yield new information about the Balmer spectrum of the MTC. In particular, the general MTC theory will be applied to study representations of Lie superalgebras. The PI will also explore new ideas to study representations of classical simple Lie superalgebras. This involves systematically studying various versions of Category O and the rational representations for the associated quasi-reductive supergroups.

Signals have two equivalent mathematical representations: one containing the data we care about, and a second, Fourier dual representation, as a formal mathematical sum of functions like sines and cosines. Mathematically, one can formally convert between the two pictures, but the differences between the two points of view matter in mathematics, physics, and engineering. For example, in order to ?simplify? an image, one might naively cut it in half; a better idea is to use the Fourier transform, forget some of the information, and then apply an inverse Fourier transform; this is the basis of image compression.

These conjectures have been the starting point for a great deal of interesting mathematics since; they contain profound arithmetic meaning in a non-abelian Fourier package. A geometric variant of Langlands' conjectures was later proposed by Beilinson and Drinfeld.

Algebraic numbers are the roots of polynomials with integer coefficients.  Symmetries inherent to these numbers are fundamental in number theory, the branch of mathematics devoted to the study of integers.  Deep conjectures of Langlands predict that the symmetries of algebraic numbers are apparent in very specific geometric spaces, known as locally symmetric spaces, which are associated to large groups of integer matrices.  Near every point, locally symmetric spaces are exceptionally symmetric, and their shapes nearby any two points are indistinguishable.  However, the large-scale geometry of these spaces is disordered and chaotic owing to one jarring geometric feature: straight lines emanating from the same point in different directions tend to diverge from each other at an exponential rate.  Additionally, the latter property makes these number theoretic worlds difficult to chart.  This project aims to systematically organize locally symmetric spaces arising from arithmetic in order to distill inherent structure thereon.  The blend of probabilistic, geometric, and algorithmic methods underlying this project lends itself well to an outreach program for middle school and high school students which the PI has piloted, designed to foster outside-the-box mathematical thinking. <br/><br/>From several perspectives, this project will probe the topology, geometry, and arithmetic of positive fundamental rank locally symmetric spaces of number theoretic origin.  First, it will chart these spaces using an expanding ball algorithm to construct point grids, akin to mapping the world by progressively building a network of cell towers and regularly transmitting signal to detect other towers nearby.  Second, it will study the bass notes of hyperbolic manifolds via relationships between spectrum and cycle complexity.  Third, it will attempt to overcome the absence of complex analytic structure on the overlying archimedean symmetric space by systematic use of associated p-adic symmetric spaces.  Construction of attendant rigid meromorphic cocycles for associated p-arithmetic groups give possible inroads to Hilbert's twelfth problem, regarding explicit class field theory, in new contexts beyond CM number fields and the classical theory of complex multiplication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major theme of modern number theory is to use Galois actions to gain new insight into questions about integer or rational solutions to polynomial equations that have stimulated mathematical activity since ancient times. One major way that Galois actions are applied toward these questions is to interpolate them into continuously varying families. To make an analogy, interpolation through the Galois actions can be thought of as threading a string through a set of beads. This project concerns ""degeneracies"" or ""singularities"" within these families, analogous to a knot lying at a point of convergence among strands of the string. This project aims to not only ""untie"" such degeneracies to access the information they seem to obscure, but also to reveal the additional number-theoretic information in the degeneracy itself. Funding for this project will also be dedicated to supporting mathematical activity in Western Pennsylvania, such as bringing external speakers to Pittsburgh Number Theory Days and encouraging student activity in research and outreach. As far as student research, the PI will advise graduate and undergraduate student researchers working toward the targeted research outcomes of this project. And as far as outreach, the PI will recruit and support undergraduate students working in grant-funded outreach efforts to enrich math education for elementary and middle school students. <br/><br/>Developments in the p-adic variation of Galois representations and of modular forms has fueled great progress in modern algebraic number theory. But when degeneracies occur in interpolation, notions and tools are lacking or need refinement. This project aims to resolve and apply these degeneracies in various settings using homological tools. Among the targeted outcomes are refinements of links between Galois representations and modular forms, applications of new notions of p-adically interpolated modular forms to conjectures about derived enrichments of the Langlands correspondence, and new techniques to compute rational or integral solutions to polynomial equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, the PI and his collaborator, Andrew Snowden, found a new connection between pre-Tannakian categories and model theory, a branch of mathematical logic. They were able to associate a pre-Tannakian category to an oligomorphic group, along with some additional numerical data known as a measure.   This construction has since led to a slew of new examples as well as new insights into previously known examples. Moreover, they have shown that, in fact, these oligomorphic groups are, in a sense, unavoidable when trying to study and classify pre-Tannakian categories and need to be a part of any classification story.  This project aims to continue these investigations to construct new and interesting examples of pre-Tannakian categories with exotic properties, to develop a theory for pre-Tannakian categories associated with a wider class of linear-oligomorphic groups, and to develop tools that are better suited for constructing positive characteristic versions of the categories previously constructed.

For many years, minimal free resolutions have been both central objects and fruitful tools in Commutative Algebra.  The idea of constructing free resolutions was introduced by Hilbert in a famous paper in 1890.

Decades ago, a linkage between the algebraic and analytic approaches to geometry was established, which then led to important progress on geometric problems.  The PIs will extend this linkage to situations in which information is given only on a piece of a geometric space, rather than on the entire space.  This will make it possible to solve open problems concerning the computation of currently mysterious numerical data that relate to the behavior of geometric spaces.  The approach will involve studying spaces locally in order to gain a greater insight into their overall behavior.  The PIs will also engage in activities that have broader impacts.  These include mentoring, widening the pipeline into mathematical research for people from groups traditionally underrepresented in mathematics, and communicating mathematics to a broader audience.

In addition, the PIs will work to understand the structure of the absolute differential Galois group of real rational function fields.  This work is motivated by results that they previously achieved in differential Galois theory over the complex numbers and in classical Galois theory over real function fields.

This sequence could be highly structured - for instance, it could alternate periodically between 0 and 1.  Or it could be completely random, with the value of each member of the sequence having no relation whatsoever to the next.  It could also be ""pseudorandom"" - described by a deterministic algorithm, but yet statistically indistinguishable from a genuinely random sequence.  Or it could be some complex mixture of structure and (pseudo)randomness.  Can one define precisely what structure and randomness mean and describe arbitrary data as combinations of these two different components?  Such questions are of importance in cryptography, computer science, combinatorics, dynamics, and number theory, as they allow one to mathematically determine whether certain patterns in arbitrary streams of data are guaranteed to occur or not.  For instance, in 2004, Ben Green and the PI were able to settle a long-standing conjecture in number theory that the prime numbers contained arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, with the key idea being to break up the prime numbers into structured and random components and study the contribution of each component.  In computer science, this theory has led, for instance, to efficient ways to generate pseudorandom bits for several types of applications. In the subsequent twenty years, much progress has been made in quantifying more precisely what structure and randomness mean, particularly in the area of mathematics now known as higher-order Fourier analysis.  More understanding has been gained on the precise way in which number-theoretic structures, such as the primes, exhibit (pseudo-)random behavior at both large and small scales. There has been steady progress in this direction in recent years, in which the scale on which one is able to definitively demonstrate various types of pseudorandomness has narrowed over time, and further work will be carried out in this project, in particular, it is tantalizingly near to resolve (a version) of a well-known conjecture in number theory - the Chowla conjecture - which could be in turn a stepping stone to even more famous conjectures such as the twin prime conjecture.

The notion of symmetry is fundamental in classical physics. A famed result of Emmy Noether shows that for each symmetry of the laws of nature, there is a resulting conserved physical quantity. For example, the time invariance of the laws of physics results in the law of conservation of energy. In the setting of quantum physics, the more general notion of quantum symmetries is required to understand the behavior of the system. This project concerns the study of how quantum symmetries act on certain systems, with the end goal being to fully understand and classify these actions. We refer to these actions of quantum symmetries as `higher representation theory?. Particular emphasis will be placed on the examples which are relevant to topological quantum computation. This project will involve research opportunities for undergraduate students at the University of New Hampshire.<br/><br/>More technically, the notion of quantum symmetry is characterized mathematically by a tensor category, and the actions of quantum symmetries are characterized by module categories over these tensor categories. This project will study fundamental problems on the construction and classification of module categories. The following research problems will be addressed: 1) construct and classify the module categories over the tensor categories coming from the Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theories, 2) construct new continuous families of tensor categories which interpolate between the categories coming from conformal field theories, 3) use Jones?s graph planar algebra techniques to study Izumi?s near-group tensor categories, and 4) investigate the higher categorical objects related to the module categories in 1).<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Later, this was extended to encompass strong and weak interactions, so that torsors became a basis for the so-called Standard Model - a physical theory describing all fundamental forces except for gravitation. The standard model predicted the existence of various particles, the last of which, called the Higgs boson, was found in a Large Hadron Collider experiment in 2012. In 1950's Fields medalist Jean-Pierre Serre recognized the importance of torsors in algebraic geometry. In his 1958 seminal paper he gave the first modern definition of a torsor and formulated a certain deep conjecture. The first part of this project is aimed at proving this conjecture, which is among the oldest unsolved foundational questions in mathematics. The second part of the project is related to the so-called Higgs bundles, which can be thought of as mathematical incarnations of the Higgs bosons. More precisely, the PI proposes to prove a certain duality for the spaces parameterizing Higgs bundles. This duality is a vast generalization of the fact that the Maxwell equations describing electromagnetic fields are symmetric with respect to interchanging electrical and magnetic fields. The duality is a part of the famous Langlands program unifying number theory, algebraic geometry, harmonic analysis, and mathematical physics. This award will support continuing research in these areas. Advising students and giving talks at conferences will also be part of the proposed activity.<br/><br/>In more detail, a conjecture of Grothendieck and Serre predicts that a torsor under a reductive group scheme over a regular scheme is trivial locally in the Zariski topology if it is rationally trivial. This conjecture was settled by Ivan Panin and the PI in the equal characteristic case. The conjecture is still far from resolution in the mixed characteristic case, though there are important results in this direction. The PI proposes to resolve the conjecture in the unramified case; that is, for regular local rings whose fibers over the ring of integers are regular. A more ambitious goal is to prove the purity conjecture for torsors, which is, in a sense, the next step after the Grothendieck?Serre conjecture. The second project is devoted to Langlands duality for Hitchin systems, predicting that moduli stacks of Higgs bundles for Langlands dual groups are derived equivalent. This conjecture may be viewed as the classical limit of the geometric Langlands duality. By analogy with the usual global categorical Langlands duality, the PI formulates a local version of the conjecture and the basic compatibility between the local and the global conjecture. The PI will attempt to give a proof of the local conjecture based on the geometric Satake equivalence for Hodge modules constructed by the PI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Now with the current technology of category theory (i.e., the study of objects and how they are transported), classical algebraic structures can be upgraded to provide information on natural phenomena that was not previously understood. This yields significant consequences in quantum physics. The work sponsored by this grant lies in the framework of monoidal categories, which are categories that come equipped with a way of combining objects and combining maps between objects. Several projects are earmarked for partial work by undergraduate and graduate students. Moreover, the PI will make significant progress on completing a three-volume, user-friendly textbook series on quantum algebra. The PI is also an active mentor for numerous members of underrepresented groups, particularly for those in groups to which the PI belongs (women, African-Americans, and first generation college students).<br/><br/>The first research theme of the projects sponsored by this grant is on algebras in monoidal categories. The PI will extend classical properties of algebras over a field to the monoidal context, and will also study properties that only have significant meaning in the categorical setting. In addition, the PI will examine other algebraic structures (e.g., Frobenius algebras) in monoidal categories, especially those tied to Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). Another theme of the PI's sponsored research work is on representations of certain monoidal categories that play a crucial role in 2-dimensional Conformal Field Theory (2d-CFTs), and that correspond to 3d-TQFTs.

Because whole numbers are so fundamental, number theory has connections with all major areas of mathematics. For instance, consider the problem of finding the whole-number solutions to a given equation. One can consider the shape given by the graph of that equation, or the set of symmetries that the equation has, or the function whose coefficients come from counting the number of solutions over a variety of number systems. The geometric properties of this shape, the algebraic properties of these symmetries, and the analytic properties of this function are all intimately related to the behavior of the equation?s whole-number solutions. Number theorists use techniques from each of these mathematical areas, but also, in the process, uncover surprising connections between the areas whereby discoveries in one area can lead to growth in another. One part of number theory where the connections between geometry, algebra, and analysis are particularly strong is in the field of modular forms. The proposed research focuses on an important and well-known type of relation between different modular forms called congruence and aims to compute the number of forms that are congruent to a given modular form and uncover the number-theoretic significance of this computation. Many of the conjectures that drive this project were found experimentally, through computer calculations. The main educational objective is to contribute to the training of the next generation of theoretical mathematicians in computational and experimental methods. To achieve this, the Principal Investigator (PI) will design software modules for a variety of undergraduate algebra and number theory courses that provide hands-on experience with computation. In addition, the PI will supervise undergraduates in computational research experiments designed to numerically verify conjectures made in the project and to explore new directions.<br/><br/>Congruences between modular forms provide a link between two very different types of objects in number theory: algebraic objects, like Galois representations, and analytic objects, like L-functions. This link has been used as a tool for proving some of the most celebrated results in modern number theory, such as the Main Conjecture of Iwasawa theory. The proposed research pushes the study of congruences in a new, quantitative direction by counting the number of congruences, not just determining when a congruence exists. The central hypothesis is that this quantitative structure of congruences contains finer information about the algebraic and analytic quantities involved than the Main Conjecture and its generalizations (such as the Bloch?Kato conjecture) can provide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Groups specify symmetry types; for instance, all bilaterally symmetric animals share a symmetry group, which is different from that of a starfish or of a sand dollar.  Important examples of groups arise from the study of symmetry in geometry and in algebra (where symmetries of number systems are captured by ``Galois groups'').  Groups can often be usefully expressed as finite sequences of basic operations,   like face-rotations for the Rubik's cube group, or gates acting on the state of a quantum computer.  One typical problem is understanding which groups can actually arise in situations of interest.  Another is understanding, for particular groups, whether all the elements of the group can be expressed efficiently in terms of a single element or  by a fixed formula in terms of varying elements.  The realization of a particular group as the symmetry group of n-dimensional space is a key technical method to analyze these problems. The award will also support graduate student summer research. <br/><br/>The project involves using  character-theoretic methods alone or in combination with  algebraic geometry, to solve problems about finite simple groups.  In particular, these tools can be applied to investigate  questions about solving equations when the variables are elements of a simple group.  For instance, Thompson's Conjecture, asserting the existence, in any finite simple group of a conjugacy class whose square is the whole group, is of this type.  A key to these methods is the observation that, in practice, character values are usually surprisingly small.  Proving and exploiting variations on this theme is one of the main goals of the project.  One class of applications is to the study of representation varieties of finitely generated groups, for instance Fuchsian groups.  In a different direction, understanding which Galois groups can arise in number theory and how they can act on sets determined by polynomial equations, is an important goal of this project and, indeed, a key goal of number theorists for more than 200 years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A basic problem in dynamics is to understand how quickly a deterministic process, for example particles in a gas sampled at regularly spaced intervals, randomizes. The regular spacing amounts to sampling the system at the integers. Answering the subtler questions in this area often requires a non-trivial understanding of the properties of the integers. Conversely, a basic problem in number theory is to show that fundamental properties of the integers (e.g their prime factorization) randomize, and here techniques from dynamics can be useful. As for probability, questions from mathematical physics led to the development of techniques for the study of interacting systems, for example the macroscopic properties of a gas of electrons constrained to a surface. It has been recently understood that these techniques are applicable in a number theoretic context, for example in the study of the Riemann zeta-function, a basic function governing the finer properties of the integers. A second objective of this proposal is to develop such techniques further in a number theoretic context. The PI will continue training graduate students and mentor postdocs on topics related to this research.<br/><br/>In dynamics the focus of this project is to understand the convergence of dynamical systems over sparse sets (primes, squares) at every point in the space, with a particular focus on horocycle flow. A second goal is to reexamine the work of Elkies-McMullen on the gap distribution of square-roots of integers modulo one from the perspective of the circle method. In probability theory, the focus is on developing further connections with branching random walks and statistical mechanics, specifically by focusing on the Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating conjecture and its other avatars.

Today, Poisson geometry influences and is influenced by many adjacent areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures. The theme of the 2024 conference is the immensely rich connection between Poisson geometry and representation theory, which dates back to the original works of Sophus Lie on the realization of continuous symmetry groups by canonical transformations.

This versatile language is used throughout algebra and has fueled multiple recent advances, not only in algebraic geometry itself but also in representation theory, number theory, symplectic geometry and other fields. Algebraic varieties are typically endowed with additional structures, such as vector bundles. Local sections of vector bundles are mathematical abstractions of fields in physics, making algebraic geometry indispensable for the study of physical phenomena like mirror symmetry and other dualities. A recurring theme in moduli theory is the interplay between moduli spaces of vector bundles, which parametrize them geometrically and can be studied analytically, and the derived categories of algebraic varieties, which encode algebraic and homological properties of vector bundles. Derived categories provide a bridge from algebraic geometry to the emerging field of non-commutative geometry. Indeed, functors and equivalences between derived categories are deeply related to the birational (local) geometry of algebraic varieties. This project will further the study of derived categories. The PI will deliver graduate-level mini-courses and lectures at conferences, professional development events, and summer schools for graduate students. Many sub-projects are suitable as thesis topics for graduate students. Furthermore, several problems are designed specifically for undergraduate participants in the research and training program in algebraic geometry organized by the PI.<br/><br/>In more detail, the proposed reserch is centered around two main themes. The first is the study of derived categories of moduli spaces and Fano varieties more broadly. The derived categories of Fano varieties, unlike Calabi-Yau or most canonically polarized varieties, admit semi-orthogonal decompositions; from the perspective of non-commutative geometry, Fano varieties are built from more elementary blocks. A beautiful picture emerges, where the decompositions of various Fano varieties, related by birational transformations, undergo rearrangements, which we call weaving patterns. Their construction is motivated by ideas of mirror symmetry, quantum cohomology, vanishing theorems of the minimal model program, and quantization. The PI will advance this program for a wide variety of spaces: moduli spaces of vector bundles, parabolic bundles and Higgs bundles on curves, toric varieties, flag varieties, moduli of sheaves with one-dimensional support on K3 surfaces, and fixed-point loci of anti-symplectic involutions on projective hyperkahler varieties. The second theme is to continue the study of the categorical Milnor fiber for deformations of singular algebraic varieties, describe its mirror symmetry interpretation, and find applications to moduli of algebraic surfaces of geometric genus zero, including Dolgachev surfaces and fake del Pezzo surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Number theory is an ancient branch of mathematics concerned with the whole numbers and primes.  Some basic results in number theory are the infinitude of primes and the formula which gives all the Pythagorean triples.  Topology is the study of shapes, but one doesn't remember details like length and angles;  the surfaces of a donut and a coffee mug are famously indistinguishable to a topologist.  An overarching theme in topology is to invent invariants to distinguish among shapes.  For instance, a pair of pants is different from a straw because ""number of holes"" is an invariant which assigns different values to them (2 and 1 respectively, but one has to be precise about what a hole is).  The notion of ""hole"" can be generalized to higher dimensions:  a sphere has no 1-dimensional hole, but it does have a 2-dimensional hole and even a 3-dimensional hole (known as the Hopf fibration, discovered in 1931).  There are ""spheres"" in every dimension, and the determination of how many holes each one has is a major unsolved problem in topology.  Lately, the topologists' methods have encroached into the domain of number theory.  In particular the branch of number theory known as p-adic geometry, involving strange number systems allowing for decimal places going off infinitely far to the left, has made an appearance.  The principal investigator will draw upon his expertise in p-adic geometry to make contributions to the counting-holes-in-spheres problem.  He will also organize conferences and workshops with the intent of drawing together number theorists and topologists together, as currently these two realms are somewhat siloed from each other.  Finally, the principal investigator plans to train his four graduate students in methods related to this project.<br/><br/>The device which counts the number of holes in a shape is called the ""homotopy group"".  Calculating the homotopy groups of the spheres is notoriously difficult and interesting at the same time.   There is a divide-and-conquer approach to doing this known as chromatic homotopy theory, which replaces the sphere with its K(n)-localized version.  Here K(n) is the Morava K-theory spectrum.  Work in progress by the principal investigator and collaborators has identified the homotopy groups of the K(n)-local sphere up to a torsion subgroup.   The techniques used involve formal groups, p-adic geometry, and especially perfectoid spaces, which are certain fractal-like entities invented in 2012 by Fields Medalist Peter Scholze.  The next step in the project is to calculate the Picard group of the K(n)-local category, using related techniques.  After this, the principal investigator will turn his attention to the problem known as the ""chromatic splitting conjecture"", which has to do with iterated localizations of the sphere at different K(n).  This is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle required to assemble the homotopy groups of the spheres from their K(n)-local analogues.

Euler systems and Iwasawa theory are two of the most powerful tools available to date for the study of these and related conjectured links between arithmetic and analysis.

In some sense the atoms of the theory are automorphic representations.  The Langlands functoriality conjecture predicts that a collection of natural correspondences preserve these atoms.  To even formulate this conjecture precisely, mathematical subjects as diverse as number theory, representation theory, harmonic analysis, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics are required.  In turn, work on the conjecture has enriched these subjects, and in some cases completely reshaped them. <br/><br/>One particularly important example of a correspondence that should preserve automorphic representations is the automorphic tensor product. It has been known for some time that in order to establish this particular case of Langlands functoriality it suffices to prove that certain functions known as L-functions are analytically well-behaved. More recently, Braverman and Kazhdan, Ngo, Lafforgue and Sakellaridis have explained that the expected properties of these L-functions would follow if one could obtain certain generalized Poisson summation formulae.  The PI has isolated a particular family of known Poisson summation formulae and proposes to splice them together to obtain the Poisson summation formulae relevant for establishing the automorphic tensor product.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the first and central topics in the research of number theory is to study the distribution of prime numbers. In 1853, Chebyshev observed that there seems to be more primes taking the form of a multiple of four plus three than a multiple of four plus one. This phenomenon is now referred to as Chebyshev's bias and its study led to a new branch of number theory, comparative prime number theory. As a subfield of analytic number theory, research in this area focuses on examining how prime counting functions and other arithmetic functions compare to one another. This field has witnessed significant growth and activity in the last three decades, especially after the publication of the influential article on Chebyshev's bias by Rubinstein and Sarnak in 1994.  The primary goal of this award will be to provide participant support and fund US-based early career researchers to attend this unique event, giving them the opportunity to discuss new ideas, advance research projects, and interact with established researchers.<br/><br/>The symposium will bring together many leading and early-career researchers with expertise and interest in comparative prime number theory to present and discuss various aspects of current research in the field, with special emphasis on results pertaining to the distribution of counting functions in number theory and zeros of L-functions, consequences of quantitative Linear Independence, oscillations of the Mertens sum, and the frequency of sign changes. Through this symposium, we will advertise the recently disseminated survey ""An Annotated Bibliography for Comparative Prime Number Theory"" by Martin et al which aims to record every publication within the topic of comparative prime number theory, together with a summary of results, and presenting a unified system of notation and terminology for referring to the quantities and hypotheses that are the main objects of study. Another important outcome of the symposium will be compiling and publicizing a problem list, with the hope of stimulating future research and providing young researchers with potential projects.

Solving polynomial equations in rational numbers dates back to Diophantus in the 3rd century and has been a central subject in mathematics for generations. The modern study of Diophantine equations has incorporated the revolutionary idea of Riemann from his use of a class of special functions called ""zeta functions? or ""L-functions"". Such special functions are built up on counting the numbers of solutions of polynomial equations in the much simpler setting of modular arithmetic. In the 1960s, Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer came up with a remarkable conjecture revealing a relation between the zeros of L-functions and the solutions to a special class of polynomial equations in the rationals. Later Beilinson and Bloch conjectured that, for general  polynomial equations in the rationals, there should always be a relation between the zeros of L-functions and algebraic cycles which are ?parameter solutions to polynomial equations?.<br/> <br/>The project will study the zeros of L-functions through automorphic forms and special cycles on modular varieties. The theory of automorphic form provides a fruitful way to access the zeros of L-functions. The modular varieties are either Shimura varieties over number fields or moduli spaces of Shtukas over function fields. They play a central role in modern number theory and arithmetic geometry, and they often come with a great supply of algebraic cycles. The project aims to prove results relating zeros of L-functions and algebraic cycles on modular varieties, including new cases of the arithmetic Gan?Gross?Prasad conjecture for Shimura varieties associated to unitary groups, certain Higher Gross?Zagier formula over function fields, and the function field analog of Kudla?s program with an emphasis on the modularity of generating series of special cycles and the arithmetic Siegel?Weil formula. The project will also develop new relative trace formula, a powerful equation connecting spectral information and geometric structure, to study general automorphic period integral including the unitary Friedberg?Jacquet period.

This is part of an annual series hosted by Vanderbilt, known as the Shanks conference series. The main theme will be on new developments and recent interactions between the areas indicated in the title. The interplay between automorphic forms and L-functions has a long and very fruitful history in number theory, and bridging both fields is still a very active area of research. This conference is oriented at establishing and furthering dialogue on new developments at the boundary of these areas. This will foster collaboration between researchers working in these fields.<br/> <br/>One beautiful feature of modern number theory is that many problems of broad interest, in areas of study as diverse as arithmetic geometry to mathematical physics, can be solved in an essentially optimal way if the natural extension of the Riemann hypothesis holds for L-functions associated to automorphic representations. Although many generalizations and applications around L-functions have have already been worked out, there are still various fundamental open problems among them to tackle, including bounds for and the value distribution of L-functions. The former is related to the pursuit of so-called sub-convexity bounds for L-functions. The latter is related to the Birch and Swinnterton-Dyer conjecture (another ?Millenium problem? posed by the Clay Mathematics institute). These pursuits are closely connected with the Langlands program, a ?grand unifying theory? relating automorphic forms.

A goal of this conference is to highlight research being conducted by underrepresented students in the areas of algebra and topology. At this unique meeting, attendees are exposed to a greater variety of current research, ideas, and results in their areas of study and beyond. Participants are also given the opportunity to meet and network with underrepresented professors and students who may later become collaborators and colleagues. This is particularly important for students with great academic potential who do not attend top-tier research institutions; students that are often overlooked, despite a strong faculty and graduate student population. Furthermore, USTARS promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Participants of USTARS continue to influence the next generation of students in positive ways by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events. USTARS exposes all participants to the research and activities of underrepresented mathematicians, encouraging a more collaborative mathematics community. <br/><br/>The Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) is a project proposed by a group of underrepresented young mathematicians. The conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and is well-positioned to actively encourage participation by women and minorities. The symposium includes networking sessions along with research presentations. Speakers will give 30-minute parallel research talks. Graduate students will give at least 75% of these presentations. Two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour presentations and a poster session featuring invited undergraduates is also planned. Additionally, a discussion panel and creative math session will provide networking, guidance, and mentorship opportunities from past USTARS participants that have transitioned to full-time faculty positions.

The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent breakthroughs in mathematics. The AFW will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one quarter to one third of participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging ideas, and beginning new collaborations. This is the first time the AFW will meet in Oklahoma where many experts on automorphic forms and closely related topics are nearby. Thus, in addition to attracting speakers who participate annually, the workshop is likely to draw a mix of new attendees who will contribute new perspectives and energy and benefit from the workshop.  The workshop is known for its inclusive, encouraging atmosphere, particularly to early career researchers and to those from underrepresented groups in the number theory community. The workshop has traditionally been a fruitful place for these researchers to connect with potential collaborators and mentors at other institutions, working on related topics. To help achieve this goal, the 2024 AFW will feature five expository talks on various fundamental topics in the theory of automorphic forms, aimed at the graduate student level. There will also be two panel discussions focused on mathematical career questions.<br/> <br/>Automorphic forms play a central role in number theory, being integral to the proofs of many groundbreaking theorems, including Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor),  Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal).  Automorphic forms are the subject of many important ongoing conjectures, among them the Langlands program, connections to random matrix theory, and the generalized Riemann hypothesis. They also appear in many areas of mathematics outside number theory, most notably in mathematical physics. The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include elliptic, Siegel, Hilbert, and Bianchi modular forms, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular forms, quadratic forms, connections with mathematical physics, monstrous moonshine, and additional related areas of research.<br/> <br/> <br/>Additional information can be found on the conference website: http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central focus of the conference - and the dedicated aim of its first day - is to encourage a high level of participation by women in math and physics. The first day is designed to encourage junior researchers to come and network, give talks in a friendly environment,  and participate without concern over the precise fit of their research to the narrow theme of the workshop. <br/><br/>The conference Arithmetic Quantum Field Theory, and the two-month program of the same title it concludes, are aimed at catalyzing interactions between mathematicians and physicists by disseminating exciting new connections emerging between quantum field theory and algebraic number theory, and in particular between the fundamental invariants of each: partition functions and L-functions.  On one hand, there has been tremendous progress in the past decade in our understanding of the algebraic structures underlying quantum field theory as expressed in terms of the geometry and topology of low-dimensional manifolds. On the other hand, the arithmetic topology dictionary provides a sturdy bridge between the topology of manifolds and the arithmetic of number fields. Thus, one can now port over quantum field theoretic ideas to number theory. The program will bring together a wide range of mathematicians and physicists working on adjacent areas to explore the emerging notion of arithmetic quantum field theory as a tool to bring quantum physics to bear on questions of interest for the theory of automorphic forms, harmonic analysis and L-functions, and conversely to explore potential geometric and physical consequences of arithmetic ideas.<br/>The conference website is https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event/aqftconf/ where recordings of the talks and notes from lectures will be made widely available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry can be described as the study of systems of polynomial equations and their solutions, whereas topology is the mathematical discipline that studies notions such as ?shape? and ?space"" and develops mathematical techniques to distinguish and classify such objects. A notion of central importance in these areas is that of a ?moduli space? - this is a mathematical ?world map? that gives a complete inventory and classification of all instances of a particular mathematical object. The main research objective of the project is to better understand the structure of these spaces and to explore new phenomena, by importing techniques from neighboring areas of mathematics. While the primary aim is to advance knowledge in pure mathematics, developments from these areas have also had a long track record of successful applications in physics, data science, computer vision, and robotics. The educational component includes an outreach initiative consisting of a ?Math Circles Institute? (MCI). The purpose of the MCI is to train K-12 teachers from around the country in running the mathematical enrichment activities known as Math Circles. This annual 1-week program will pair teachers with experienced instructors to collaboratively develop new materials and methods to be brought back to their home communities. In addition, a research conference will be organized with the aim of attracting an international community of researchers and students and disseminating developments related to the research objectives of the proposal.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the research component is to develop new methods via topology and geometric group theory to study various moduli spaces, specifically, (1) strata of Abelian differentials and (2) families of polynomials. A major objective is to establish ?asphericality"" (vanishing of higher homotopy) of these spaces. A second objective is to develop the geometric theory of their fundamental groups. Asphericality occurs with surprising frequency in spaces coming from algebraic geometry, and often has profound consequences. Decades on, asphericality conjectures of Arnol?d, Thom, and Kontsevich?Zorich remain largely unsolved, and it has come to be regarded as a significantly challenging topic. This project?s goal is to identify promising-looking inroads. The PI has developed a method called ""Abel-Jacobi flow"" that he proposes to use to establish asphericality of some special strata of Abelian differentials. A successful resolution of this program would constitute a major advance on the Kontsevich?Zorich conjecture; other potential applications are also described. The second main focus is on families of polynomials. This includes linear systems on algebraic surfaces; a program to better understand the fundamental groups is outlined. Two families of univariate polynomials are also discussed, with an eye towards asphericality conjectures: (1) the equicritical stratification and (2) spaces of fewnomials. These are simple enough to be understood concretely, while being complex enough to require new techniques. In addition to topology, the work proposed here promises to inject new examples into geometric group theory. Many of the central objects of interest in the field (braid groups, mapping class groups, Artin groups) are intimately related to algebraic geometry. The fundamental groups of the spaces the PI studies here should be just as rich, and a major goal of the project is to bring this to fruition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the main notions used is that of a surface group representation, a concept which connects surfaces to generalizations of classical geometries such as Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. The study of surfaces has surprising applications throughout many fields of mathematics and physics. Consequently, the project lies at the intersection of multiple disciplines. In addition to cutting edge mathematical research, the project will promote the progress of science and mathematics through different workshops aimed at graduate students as well as community outreach events. The educational component will also focus on creating an engaging and inclusive place for mathematical interactions for students and early career researchers.<br/><br/>In the past decades, both the theories of Higgs bundles and Anosov dynamics have led to significant advancements in our understanding of the geometry of surface groups. Recent breakthroughs linking these approaches are indirect and mostly involve higher rank generalizations of hyperbolic geometry known as higher rank Teichmuller spaces. The broad aim of this project is to go beyond higher rank Teichmuller spaces by using Higgs bundles to identify subvarieties of surface group representations which generalize the Fuchsian locus in quasi-Fuchsian space. The cornerstone for the approach is the role of Slodowy slices for Higgs bundles. Specifically, the PI aims to establish Anosov properties of surface group representations associated to Slodowy slices in the Higgs bundle moduli space. This approach will significantly extend applications of Higgs bundles to both Anosov representations and (G,X) geometries. It will complete the component count for moduli of surface group representations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
