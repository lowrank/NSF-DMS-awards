The intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in the PI's plan to create a theory of dynamical complex multiplication, with the goal of developing enough machinery that a proof of a Conjecture of Morton and Silverman for this family of maps is within reach.<br/><br/>    Broader impacts of the work emerge from education and outreach activities, with a focus on gender equity issues and supporting women in research mathematics.

In particular, he investigates the structure of the singularities of Shimura varieties at such primes using methods from the theory of algebraic loop groups and p-adic Hodge theory and he is developing a theory of ``local models"" for these varieties. The motivation is to obtain information that can be used in the calculation of  their Hasse-Weil zeta functions and in other number theoretic applications.  He is also studying closely connected p-adic spaces such as deformation spaces of local Galois representations, Rapoport-Zink spaces and their p-adic cohomology. In addition he is studying the representations that appear in the cohomology of arithmetic varieties with a finite group action and is developing related Riemann-Roch type theorems. In the past, the PI has obtained formulae useful for calculating equivariant Euler characteristics of varieties over the integers with an abelian group action. He is extending his work to the case of non-abelian group actions and he will apply his techniques to deduce information about Galois modules obtained from covers of modular curves. He is also developing refined versions of Riemann-Roch  type theorems that allow for calculations of torsion classes, and, in some cases, he is providing local or adelic descriptions of the isomorphisms underlying the Riemann-Roch identities. <br/><br/>This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry,a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: the geometry of shapes that can be described by the simplest equations, namely polynomials, and the study of numbers. This combination of disciplines has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having solved problems that withstood generations (such as ``Fermat's last theorem""). The proposal mainly concentrates on the study of specific polynomial equations that have many symmetries. The general field has connections with physics, the construction of error correcting codes and cryptography."

KUMUNU is an annual weekend conference anchored by the Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri-Columbia (MU) and Nebraska-Lincoln (NU), promoting interaction among researchers, post docs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines (such as algebraic geometry, K-theory and coding theory) at regional schools (which in 2009 included 23 different institutions). Although the KUMUNU triad has significant strength in these areas, geographic separation raises a hurdle to taking the most advantage of this strength. The aim of the KUMUNU conference series is to provide a cost-effective annual venue for regional researchers at various stages of their careers, including graduate students, recent Ph.D.s and faculty at non-Ph.D. granting institutions, to interact with each other, with experienced researchers based at KU, MU, NU and with a limited number of invited experts from outside the region. Travel and lodging support to facilitate participation, especially for graduate students, is a key element for KUMUNU to achieve its main goals. These include: playing a strong regional mentoring role at all levels by showcasing the research of postdocs and young faculty and by helping recent Ph.D.s and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines enrich their research programs by meeting senior researchers based at KU, MU, NU and elsewhere; and promoting research in commutative algebra by providing a venue for discussion of the latest developments in the field, for exchanging ideas and for setting the basis for future research collaborations. <br/><br/>The typical KUMUNU conference comprises 6 to 8 plenary talks accessible to graduate students by speakers representing a geographically diverse mix of senior researchers, young faculty and postdocs, with plenty of time reserved outside of talks for additional interaction. The relatively small size of the meeting and its geographic and disciplinary focus also encourage participants to establish productive collaborative relationships. In addition to enhancing the research careers of the students and early career participants, participants from non-Ph.D. granting institutions will take ideas from the conference back to their colleagues and students to enrich teaching and research at their home institutions. The 2011 meeting is special as it will be held in conjunction with the Howard Rowlee Lecture, an endowed public lecture hosted annually by the Mathematics Department at the University of Nebraska. The 2011 Rowlee Lecture will be given by David Eisenbud, past president of the American Mathematical Society, on April 1."

Mathematically, the project is devoted to  an approach to motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants based on the new mathematical object, called Cohomological Hall algebra. It was introduced in the joint work of PI and Maxim Kontsevich. Proposed work simplifies some old results in the area (e.g. it gives a transparent explanation of the so-called wall-crossing formulas which show how Donaldson-Thomas invariants depend on a stability condition). It also opens new directions of work. Some of them have already attracted attention of mathematical community (e.g. the conjecture about the structure of Cohomological Hall algebra for symmetric quiver). The approach is developed in the framework of quivers with potential. The latter give rise to 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau categories generated by critical points of the potential. Donaldson-Thomas invariants are defined in terms of the sheaf of vanishing cycles of the potential. Cohomological Hall algebra encodes the structure of the cohomology of Milnor fiber of the potential near the critical locus. This makes a link with the earlier work of the PI and Kontsevich on the approach to motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants which utilizes motivic integration. The new approach is more direct and easier. The interplay between quivers and categories mentioned above is used in both directions, e.g. in the course of study of the behavior of Donaldson-Thomas invariants with respect to mutations. This leads to an interesting application to cluster transformations. Furthermore, the analogy with Chern-Simons theory suggests a new application to topological invariants of 3-dimensional manifolds. <br/><br/>From another perspective, Cohomological Hall algebra is a mathematical incarnation of the algebra of BPS states envisioned by string theorists in the middle of 90's. Motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants correspond to refined BPS states in some supersymmetric theories. In a sense the project gives first mathematically rigorous definition of the notion of BPS state (and refined BPS state) which is ``model independent"". Wall-crossing formulas for BPS states, which play a role e.g. in the conjectures about the entropy of black holes, can be written in a new non-trivial way and proven mathematically. Maybe this is one of the reasons for the attention of different groups of physicists to the  results of the project. Growing interest to the new approach has already generated a flow of papers written by senior and young researchers in both physics and mathematics communities. Several conferences and workshops recently organized in the US, Europe and Japan were influenced by the developments related to the project."

Properties of commutative noetherian rings will be studied through numerical, algebraic, and geometric invariants generated by homological constructions.  New methods will be developed for computing such invariants, to be tested on problems that have resisted more conventional approaches.  Homological algebra will be utilized to establish further connections between the theories of commutative rings and of finite-dimensional algebras, with the goal of transferring viewpoints and adapting techiques developed in one of the fields for use in the other. <br/><br/>Commutative algebra and algebraic geometry may be thought of as studying solutions of several equations in many unknowns when, typically, the solution is not unique. The set of solutions can then be viewed geometrically, but it is often best encoded into a family of functions defined on this set.  The abstract version of such families of functions are called commutative rings.  Homological algebra brings to the study of rings methods of algebraic topology, developed to study geometric structures.  Methods for decomposing complicated objects into primitive building blocks are developed as part of a different branch of algebra, known as representation theory."

Starting from symmetric groups, cohomological versions of Schur-Weyl duality lead one to consider cohomology of algebraic groups and Frobenius kernels. Some of the cohomology that arises can then be computed using techniques from algebraic topology, specifically calculations of homology of iterated loop spaces. These calculations give new symmetric group results, which we expect to extend to the setting of braid groups and Hecke algebras. They also produce some fascinating stability results which emerge from the calculations but, at present, have no representation-theoretic or topological interpretations. They also led to the first known family of modules with nonzero cohomology but arbitrarily large ?gaps?. The homology calculations discussed above give ?generic cohomology? theorems for Young modules of the symmetric group. Seemingly unrelated Frobenius kernel cohomology results give ?generic cohomology"" results for Specht modules. We will look for a unified interpretation and extensions of these results, for example by comparing representation theory of Hecke algebras at e-th roots of unity, for e being a power of the characteristic of the representation field. Parshall and Scott proved that the celebrated Lusztig conjecture, in the case of the general linear group, is equivalent to a problem stated in terms of extensions between symmetric group modules, and is closely related to some symmetric group results of the principal investigator. We will develop this further. In other recent work we have developed combinatorial techniques to compute cohomology and discovered some character theory results relating to braid group cohomology. There is clearly much more work to be done here.<br/><br/>This proposal falls broadly in the area of mathematics known as representation theory of finite groups. Groups arise naturally from the study of symmetries of objects, and the symmetric group is the most natural of all. Representation theory has important applications in physics and chemistry. In particular, ideas used by mathematical physicists have played an important role in recent progress made in many of the areas described above. Representation theory arises naturally in many other areas, including telephone network design, robotics, molecular vibrations and error correcting codes. The PI believes this activity will have a broader impact on advanced undergraduate and graduate education. Almost all students learn about the symmetric group at some point. Many of the open problems, although very difficult, can be explained to advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. In the last two years the PI has advised four senior honors theses in representation theory. This type of early exposure to potential research problems can provide excellent motivation for future Ph.D's."

The proposed activity will provide support for the participation of early career U.S. mathematical researchers in the program.  There has been a very rapid development of ideas and techniques in the area of modularity of Galois representations and its connections with the Langlands program, following the pioneering work of Wiles and Taylor-Wiles on the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture; recent examples include the proof of the Sato--Tate conjecture by Clozel, Harris,  Shepherd-Barron, and Taylor, and the proof of Serre's modularity conjecture by Khare, Wintenberger, and Kisin.  There is every indication that these results are only the beginning of the potential harvest. The consequences of new progress in the theory of automorphic representations (e.g. the fundamental lemma, proved by Ngo), the emerging theory of a p-adic local Langlands correspondence, the theory of p-adic modular forms, and new ideas in deformation theory and the local structure of Shimura varieties, have only begun to be explored, and significant developments can be expected in the next few years.   All of these developments, both existing and potential, will be explored as part of the Fields program, and early career U.S. mathematicians will benefit greatly from the chance to learn about, and indeed to participate in, these developments.<br/><br/>Number theory is the branch of mathematics that studies phenomena related to properties of whole numbers.  A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest.  The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form.  (Number theorists refer to Langlands conjectured relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ``reciprocity law''.)  Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic methods to study his conjectures. These are methods that exploit the many symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics known as ``the Langlands program'', which is one of the central areas of modern number theory, and, indeed, of modern pure mathematics.  In Winter and Spring of 2012, the Fields Institute will run a thematic program, titled Galois Representations, Diophantine Equations, and Automorphic Forms, which will be dedicated to studying the Langlands program.  The present activity will provide support for early career U.S. mathematician to participate in the Fields program, who will thereby be provided with the opportunity both to learn about recent developments in the Langlands program, and to develop the skills necessary to help contribute to the next wave of developments."

In one direction, he will study the problem of proving the finiteness, or more generally bounding the dimension, of the set of integral points on affine varieties having many components ""at infinity"".  Results here will constitute progress towards proving the PI's conjectures for integral points on such varieties, which may be viewed as higher-dimensional versions of Siegel's theorem for integral points on affine curves.  An additional novel aspect is the PI's plan to adapt effective methods in number theory to this higher-dimensional setting.  Applications of these results to families of equations, modular varieties, and problems in arithmetic dynamics will be explored.  Among the tools used will be the Schmidt subspace theorem from Diophantine approximation, a fundamental and deep tool in number theory.  In fact, some of the techniques employed in the proofs of these results are expected to yield variations and improvements of the Schmidt subspace theorem itself, for instance to the setting of algebraic points of bounded degree. From the work of Vojta and others, it has been discovered that many statements in Diophantine approximation, when stated appropriately, bear a strong resemblance to statements in Nevanlinna theory, a branch of complex analysis.  Through the dictionary between the two subjects developed by Vojta, it is frequently possible to take statements and proofs in one subject and develop analogous statements and proofs in the other subject.  In this manner, the PI expects to prove analogous results in Nevanlinna theory, where Schmidt's theorem corresponds to Cartan's Second Main Theorem, and qualitatively, to prove results for holomorphic curves analogous to results for integral points.<br/><br/>The research proposed here revolves around one of the oldest and most fundamental problems in mathematics:  understanding the set of solutions to a system of polynomial equations in rational numbers or integers.  The proposed research would contribute substantially to understanding this difficult and basic problem by providing new results and techniques in several basic contexts.  Moreover, the research has ramifications across other areas of mathematics.  Most notably, it is expected to yield results in complex analysis, and to enrich our understanding of the deep links between complex analysis and number theory."

Mirror symmetry is an exciting and rapidly developing field that is concerned with duality between the complex and symplectic geometry of certain Calabi-Yau manifolds. The search for the underlying principles at work in mirror symmetry has driven a great deal of the research in symplectic and complex/algebraic geometry over the past two decades. Many of the ideas and techniques used to study mirror symmetry have become interesting areas of research in their own right. Examples include Gromov-Witten theory, Floer theory, Fukaya categories, derived categories, Lagrangian torus fibrations, special Lagrangian geometry, Donaldson-Thomas invariants, and tropical geometry. The breadth of ideas involved and number of approaches to the subject make it fertile ground for collaboration. The conference will exploit this by bringing together researchers studying a wide variety of the geometric and algebraic aspects of mirror symmetry.<br/><br/>The goal of the conference is to advance mirror symmetry by opening and strengthening lines of communications between researchers, finding areas for collaboration, and educating participants. The conference will have several important features in order to achieve these goals. To further the educational aims, the conference will feature a mini-course designed to educate participants on a particular topic at a high but non-expert level. The mini-course will be useful to graduate students as well as to more senior participants, both as an educational experience and as an opportunity to find areas for collaboration. There will be a poster session that will allow graduate students to show off their work. This will provide an opportunity for young researchers to communicate with more senior researchers and will provide an excellent opportunity for the transfer of knowledge. The conference will feature participants who are experts in both geometric and algebraic aspects of mirror symmetry and thus will provide an opportunity to find ways to integrate diverse ideas. Finally, mirror symmetry has its roots in string theory and high energy physics and today is an important branch of theoretical physics. The conference will increase communication between mathematicians and physicists by inviting both types of people to attend.<br/>More information can be found on the conference website:<br/>http://www.math.ksu.edu/~galston/conference/"

This is explored by studying the Euclidean analogs of two problems which were recently investigated in the context of vector spaces over finite fields. The first problem is a natural generalization of the Falconer distance problem to the study of point configurations.  The second problem is drawn from a large class of problems known as the sum-product problems.  The continuous nature of the first problem and the discrete nature of the second allows the researcher to incorporate a variety of methods from various fields in order to better illustrate the general principles involved.  These include methods drawn from arithmetic and geometric combinatorics, number theory, and classical harmonic analysis.  The juxtaposition of the methods from the Euclidean cases with the methods in the context of the finite field geometry could provide a more complete picture of the set expansion phenomenon.<br/><br/>This project involves studying the interaction between several areas of mathematics using a problem-solving approach, in which two problems are considered whose analogs have known solutions in one subfield of mathematics known as finite field geometry.  The problems are examined in two additional related subfields known as discrete and continuous Euclidean geometry.  The goal of the project is to not only find solutions to the two problems in these alternate contexts, but to explore the interplay between a variety of known methods and techniques in order to obtain a more complete understanding of the scope of the general principles involved.  The major areas of mathematics these problems are taken from include additive and geometric combinatorics, number theory, and classical harmonic analysis.  These areas have a variety of applications in encryption, data mining, signal processing, and bioinformatics."

The importance of Whittaker models in the theory of Automorphic Representations is well known. For certain groups such as GSp(4) Bessel models can serve as a substitute for those representations that have no Whittaker model. While general facts for Bessel models are known, such as the uniqueness of Bessel models, certain important questions remain unanswered and prevent a widespread deployment of these models. Amongst the unknown facts are the determination of test vectors for a given representation and a given Bessel model, and the calculation of explicit Bessel functions. This research will close these knowledge gaps, allowing for several new applications of Bessel models.<br/><br/>The activity of this proposal will promote teaching, training, and learning via the inclusion of graduate students as participants in the proposed research. The activity of this proposal will broaden the participation of under-represented groups. The PI and the Co-PI plan to continue their close contacts with the OU McNair Scholars Programs well as the Sooner Traditions Scholars program of the University of Oklahoma. These programs are comprised of undergraduate students which are either first-generation and low-income, or from underrepresented groups, or from traditionally disadvantaged high-schools in the Oklahoma City and Tulsa area. The activity of this proposal will enhance infrastructure for research and education. As part of the Automorphic Forms group at the University of Oklahoma, the PI and the Co-PI have participated, and will continue to participate, in a number of scientific activities involving researchers and students from other institutions. Amongst these activities are joint seminars with neighboring universities and conferences with a largely regional appeal. Other activities will include short- and medium-term visits from researchers from other parts of the country and also from overseas. Finally, the activity of the proposed research will lead, within the framework of the Automorphic Forms group of the University of Oklahoma, to the creation of a website with resources for students and researchers in the area of Automorphic Forms. Amongst other things, the web site will contain a comprehensive list of activities in Automorphic Forms."

The PI proposes a variety of projects (joint with David Nadler) that further the foundations of the subject and apply it to resolve classical problems in representation theory. The most far-reaching project aims to develop a geometric analog of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula, consistently enhancing vector spaces of functions to categories of sheaves (in particular providing a natural context for the work of Ngo). Other projects seek to prove general Langlands dualities (or ""nonabelian Fourier transforms"")  for categories of representations of real groups and for cohomologies of character varieties (conjectures of Soergel and Hausel--Rodriguez-Villegas, respectively). The PI also proposes (with Jonathan Block and Nigel Higson) to bridge two disparate approaches to harmonic analysis of Lie groups --- noncommutative algebraic geometry (D-modules and Beilinson-Bernstein localization) and noncommutative topology (C*-algebras and the Baum-Connes conjecture). The PI is highly committed to mathematical exposition at a variety of levels, and endeavors to convey the intuitions behind sophisticated mathematical ideas to a broad range of audiences.  The significant educational component of the proposal builds on the PI's experience and enthusiasm as an expositor.<br/><br/>The Langlands program is one of the fundamental organizing principles in modern mathematics, predicting that diverse phenomena can be understood by the systematic exploitation of hidden symmetries. Among its successes in number theory are the solution of Fermat's Last Theorem, while in physics it underlies the symmetry between electricity and magnetism and its theoretical generalizations to other fundamental forces. Recently Ngo proved the Langlands Fundamental Lemma, one of Time Magazine's  Top Ten Scientific Discoveries of 2009. This proof suggests a new link between the  apparently unrelated number theoretic and physical settings for the Langlands program. The current proposal is aimed at developing these connections, finding physical analogues of classical results in number theory while using the rich geometric intuition behind the physics to suggest new patterns in the application of symmetries. An important component is the dissemination of the exciting but often inaccessible developments in this field through development of online resources, lecture series, books and courses."

The PI proposes a new approach to attack the well-known open problem on the irreducible characters for the FULL category O for Lie superalgebras.

The focus will be on spaces where there are several natural approaches to the moduli problem, particularly via geometric invariant theory, moduli of pairs, and Hodge theory. The former two approaches provide a method where the geometry of the objects parameterized plays a central role.  The latter approach can allow for the use of arithmetic methods, including modular forms.  Specific problems to be considered include giving modular interpretations to boundary loci of arithmetic quotients, describing log-canonical models of the moduli space of curves, and investigating the local structure of compactified Jacobians. Abelian varieties and theta divisors will also be of special interest.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is the field of mathematics that focuses on the solution sets of polynomial equations.  Inasmuch as polynomial equations are ubiquitous, the subject sits at the crossroads of many different fields including complex geometry, number theory and theoretical physics. A motivating question for algebraic geometers has been to classify solution sets by their invariants.  For instance, one could try to classify those complex valued solution sets that can be identified with a torus (the surface of a donut); this would correspond to fixing the invariants known as the (complex) dimension and genus equal to the number one.  Often the collection of solution sets with fixed invariants can itself be viewed naturally as a solution set of polynomial equations. These are known as moduli spaces, and their algebraic and geometric properties yield a tremendous amount of information about the original solution sets of interest.  The PI intends to study a number of such spaces.  The proposed research will have a significant impact on a field that plays a central role in mathematics and interacts with numerous other fields."

Other areas of impact represented at the conference include include extended affine Lie algebras, and the arithmetic study of algebraic groups, and somewhat more classical applications include finite and continuous geometry, such as projective planes and bounded symmetric domains.<br/><br/>To most mathematicians or physicists, Lie algebras are the most familiar examples of nonassociative algebra, known for over a hundred years as an efficient way of algebraically dealing with rules of constraint imposed by interactions in physics. Later, another type of nonassociative algebras,  called Jordan algebras, was proposed as part of a possible alternative foundation for quantum physics . Soon, it was realized there were many different types of nonassociative algebras that might be worth studying, and in the 60s and 70s there was a serious study of these algebras for their own sake, an effort including mathematicians from Yale, Chicago, MIT, as well as the former Soviet Union. Though this original activity impacted mainly Lie algebras and bounded symmetric  domains, the subject slowly began  to have surprising new applications. This new activity took place over a period of about thirty years, beginning in the 80s, in areas not obviously related to the problems which had given it birth. While there have been, of course, conferences in the many separate areas where nonassociative algebras have been used, there have been none attempting  to draw together so many of these disparate applications, and compare them for the benefit of new generations of mathematicians.

These topics are closely related to recent developments in functional analysis, representation theory of Lie groups, and spectral geometry. The summer school is geared toward undergraduate students and graduate students followed by a conference.  The summer school consists of two weeks of program with the first week aimed at undergraduate students and the second week geared to graduate students. The summer school and the conference will promote research activities in areas of mathematics related to quantization. The organizers have selected lecturers with a broad array of interests and backgrounds, including some physicists. The summer school and conference will give graduate students access to a wide array of current research activity in quantization, and give the students an opportunity to interact with prominent researchers. A public lecture by a physicist engaged in the Large Hadron Collider project in Europe will help enhance public awareness of science, and also give mathematicians the opportunity to interact with an experimental high energy physicist. The undergraduate summer school will expose top undergraduates to important ideas in mathematical physics, and encourage them to learn more about physics. The volume of proceedings of the conference will serve as a resource for students and researchers interested in learning about quantization. <br/><br/>Quantization is an important topic in mathematics and physics. From the physics point of view, methods of quantization are procedures for building models for quantum mechanical systems from analogous and more intuitive classical mechanical systems, which provide strikingly precise experimental predictions. Much of the development of theoretical physics in the 20th century may be regarded as the process of refining quantization to give improved experimental predictions, and the search for a unified field theory is an attempt to quantize general relativity in a manner compatible with existing quantum theory. On the mathematics side, problems related to quantization and quantum mechanics provided a strong motivation for the development of functional analysis, the representation theory of Lie groups, and spectral geometry. More recent developments with much current activity include geometric quantization, deformation quantization, and quantum analogues of various classical objects. The Program on Quantization will inaugurate a new Center for Mathematics at Notre Dame. It will combine two week-long summer schools, one aimed at advanced undergraduates and one aimed at graduate students with a conference devoted to the most recent advances in the area.

He and his collaborators propose a variety of projects each involved with some aspect of L-functions. One involves a new formula with the divisor function d(n) which generalizes the classical Voronoi formula and has an application in the Nyman-Beurling approach to the Riemann Hypothesis; Conrey will develop further applications to moment formulae and to the question of understanding low degree L-functions. Conrey will use the Asymptotic Large Sieve (invented with Iwaniec and Soundararajan) to prove a conjecture about the mean square of all Dirichlet L-functions multiplied by an arbitrary Dirichlet polynomial. A third project involves Mazur.s conjecture that the symmetric power L-functions associated with an elliptic curve seldom vanish at their central point.<br/><br/>Professor Conrey's research is in the area of number theory. Modern Number Theory has surprisingly diverse applications, from enabling secure internet transactions, to the construction of optimal networks, and even to the question of cataloguing the various types of bodies in the study of low dimensional topology.

Now it, and its analogues, are ubiquitous in number theory. However, there are still some very basic properties of zeta-functions which we do not understand, and which if we did would lead to much progress. The main question is Why do all of the zeros of zeta-functions occur on just one line?  Professor Conrey's research is centered on the study of the zeros of zeta-functions. As part of this project, Professor Conrey will also continue his work with Math Teachers' Circles, which are a collection of 39 problem solving groups all across the country that involve professional mathematicians and Middle School math teachers working together to build communities of problem solvers."

First, as the PI has shown in his earlier research, viewing elements of the Brauer group as isomorphism classes of algebraic stacks gives rise to topological and geometric rigidifications of questions in classical algebra.  Using these structures, one can relate these classical questions to modern questions about local-to-global principles and to the geometry of certain moduli spaces closely related to moduli spaces of vector bundles.

Second, the PI has a list of proposed targets for testing the difference between the cohomological and Azumaya Brauer groups of algebraic spaces.

Finally, the PI will study Fourier-Mukai equivalences in positive characteristic, with an initial focus on K3 surfaces.  One important tool will be crystalline and p-adic forms of the Mukai Hodge structure, and he conjectures that the formal Brauer group will play a role in positive characteristic analogous to that played by the transcendental lattice in Mukai's classical theory.  As a special case, the PI and his graduate students will investigate the HKR isomorphism in positive characteristic and its connection with novel characteristic p deformations of moduli spaces of vector bundles of rank p on K3 surfaces coming from the tangent space to the formal Brauer group.<br/><br/>Originally devoted to the study of solutions of polynomial equations, algebraic geometry has vastly expanded its mandate in the last century to encompass a large range of interactions between algebra and geometry and a raft of applications in government and industry.  The research component of this project will advance our understanding of an algebro-geometric object with both cryptographic and theoretical significance.  The grant will fund work by the PI and the training of his graduate students.  In addition to performing research, the PI will extend high school mathematical outreach efforts throughout the Pacific Northwest, with a focus on underserved populations in urban centers and outlying rural areas.  He will give lectures and organize targeted online advertising through social networks and search engines in an effort to find and foster unusual mathematical talent, including in untraditional places and through untraditional means.  This grant will also support a conference for a cohort of new PhDs in algebraic geometry, with a focus on broadening the interests and mathematical connections within this cohort.  In an era of constrained resources and highly focused PhD training, it is essential for the future of the field that we continue to encourage a broad view of the community of algebraic geometers and promote mutual understanding among its members."

In this project the investigator and his colleagues plan to use many different techniques, including algebraic, p-adic, and analytic tools, to study various aspects of these questions. Particular questions to be studied include the distribution of Selmer ranks in families of quadratic twists of elliptic curves, refined class number formulas over number fields, and higher rank Kolyvagin systems. In previous work of the investigator Kolyvagin systems have proved to be a very useful tool for relating L-values and arithmetic.<br/><br/>Elliptic curves and abelian varieties play a central role in many parts of mathematics including its most applied areas. For example, elliptic curves are used in algorithms to encrypt data for transmission, and for efficient digital signatures. In its most basic form, an elliptic curve is a special kind of polynomial equation in two variables. Historically number theorists are interested in finding solutions of these equations in which the variables take values which are either whole numbers, or fractions. The rank of an elliptic curve is a basic invariant which measures the size of the set of solutions. The investigator and his coworkers study ranks of elliptic curves and their interrelations with other mathematical objects and concepts."

There are several main thrusts to this work, including investigating singularities via reduction to prime characteristic. Other problems deal with the uniform behavior of symbolic powers on multiple levels, from points in projective space, to primes in local rings, to square-free monomial ideals. A major effort is proposed to understand non-commutative crepant resolutions in broader classes of rings, and to answer several questions concerning the concept of height.<br/><br/>The proposed research concerns the theory of commutative rings, which are higher abstract systems where one can add and multiply. The rings arising in this proposal usually comes from a system of polynomial equations. The ring is a type of abstract model where solutions to the equations exist. By studying the properties of this model, one can then better understand the original system of equations. There are two main methods.One is to understand the theory of modules over such rings. Modules are a type of special representation of spaces where the equations hold. Studying these models has been an extremely effective way to study equations. The other main technical method is to study the same basic equations in rings which are reduced modulo a prime number. In such a system, arithmetic becomes easier. For instance modulo 2 means that every even number is thought of as 0, and all odd numbers as 1. This has a number of profound advantages which are used in this proposal."

As an example of the subject's importance, in the last works of Ramanujan, in particular his last letter to Hardy and his lost notebook, the subject of mock theta functions was introduced.  For many decades, mathematicians were unable to understand mock theta functions as part of a larger context.

Local cohomology is the common thread. For example, the study of Frobenius actions on local cohomology modules has been fruitful in the study of F-singularities, and the content of local cohomology, a notion introduced by Hochster and Huneke, has provided a number of new approaches to homological conjectures, and in the study of local cohomology, algebraic D-module theory has proven to be indispensable. The PI wants to study various aspects of local cohomology and their applications to both F-singularities and homological conjectures and to investigate a characteristic-free notion of holonomicity.<br/> <br/>This project is mainly concerned with questions in commutative algebra and their applications to algebraic geometry. Algebraic sets are sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Commutative algebra studies functions over algebraic sets (in commutative algebra, these algebraic sets can be over any commutative rings); while algebraic geometry studies the geometric or topological aspects of algebraic sets (in algebraic geometry, these algebraic sets are very often over a field). These two areas are closely related and are mutually beneficial. Questions in this proposal can be considered as questions about the existence of solutions to systems of polynomial equations and the topological or geometric nature of the solution sets."

The common point is that both versions reduce to understanding asymptotic versions of familiar invariants of singularities, such as the log canonical threshold, associated now to certain sequences of ideals. The first part of the project consists in the study of these asymptotic invariants, and of their connections to valuation theory.  The second part will be devoted to a study of valuations from a point of view relevant to this problem. The second problem concerns  connections between certain invariants of singularities in birational geometry (such as the log canonical threshold and multiplier ideals) and invariants introduced in commutative algebra, coming from tight closure theory (such as the F-pure threshold and the test ideals). There have been formulated precise conjectures regarding this correspondence via reduction to prime characteristic.  This project concerns translating such conjectures into some more established questions regarding the Frobenius action on the cohomology of reductions of smooth projective varieties to positive characteristic, and then in trying to attack some special cases of these questions.<br/><br/>Singularities appear naturally in the study of algebraic varieties, and a good understanding of singularities is important, for example, in the classification of higher-dimensional algebraic varieties.

They include the study of deformation quantizations,<br/>quantum groupoids and twisted cohomology  over differentiable stacks. The project also involves studying the Chern-Connes character map for twisted K-theory, delocalized twisted equivariant cohomology, and its ring structure.  It also aims to study C*-algebras associated  to non-abelian gerbes and 2-groupoids.<br/><br/>The idea of noncommutative geometry is to study geometry via algebras of functions on ``noncommutative manifolds''. On such a ``noncommutative manifold'', the relevant objects are no longer points in a space, but rather an associative algebra, which may not be commutative.  Many ``noncommutative spaces'' are obtained either as deformations of commutative algebras or as convolution algebras of groupoids.  The theory of deformation quantization lies on the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics. The mathematical structures of the two theories are very different, so it is challenging to understand how the transition from classical to quantum takes place. Quantization, roughly speaking, is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which is normally described by noncommutative associative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. The Kontsevich formality theorem in a certain sense  confirms that such a prediction is indeed possible, which implies that there is a deep interplay  between noncommutative algebras and geometry.  Groupoid convolution algebras, substituting for algebras of functions (on badly behaved quotient spaces), play a central role in Connes' noncommutative geometry program. They also play an important role in the study of the stringy space-time, or gerbes.  The purpose of the project, which is centered around the application of noncommutative geometry, is to investigate questions in these fields  motivated by mathematical physics.  More specifically,  it is motivated by a combination of ideas from quantum groups,<br/>representation theory, differential geometry, noncommutative geometry, and operator algebras.  Thus the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed project promotes further interaction between these fields."

It is now a deep, rich and beautiful mathematical theory and has already led to new ideas, surprising results and solutions of many mathematical problems in mathematics and physics. On the other hand, various recent developments in different areas of mathematics and physics can be recognized to be related when the language of tensor categories is used as a unifying concept. One example is  modular tensor categories which appear naturally in the study of conformal field theories and also in other related algebraic and analytic structures. Further study of the connection between conformal field theories and tensor categories will  benefit the developments of both conformal field theory and the theory of tensor categories.<br/><br/>Two dimensional conformal field theories and tensor categories are mathematical theories studied intensely in recent years by both mathematicians and physicists. It is believed that many important phenomena observed in nature and in laboratory, such as critical phenomena, quantum Hall effects, disorder phenomena and so on, can be described by these theories. More importantly, a deep understanding of these theories might lead to the development of new technologies, for example, new technology for the design of chips for what people call quantum computers, which, if constructed,  are computers running much much faster than the computers we have now. This award provides support for mathematicians and physicists, including graduate students, junior faculty, women and members of underrepresented minority groups, in the United States to attend the workshop ``Conformal field theories and tensor categories'' from June 14 to June 18, 2011, at the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research in Beijing. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers in the United States, China and other countries working on conformal field theories, tensor categories and related topics to discuss new results, exchange ideas and initiate new collaborations and research projects. In particular, one of the main goals of the workshop is to make a wealth of mathematical results and concepts that are ready to use accessible to a larger part of the theoretical physics community and to find new applications of these results. It is believed that mathematicians and physicists in the United States, China and other countries can all benefit a lot from communicating their results and from initiating new collaborations and research projects."

We are interested in the Lie groups of infinite dimensional hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras which contain affine Kac-Moody subalgebras. Some of the proposed problems are physically motivated. Our study of physical theories such as supergravity,a theory that incorporates both supersymmetry and general relativity, has revealed a number of compelling and intriguing mathematical problems, consistent with open problems in Kac-Moody group theory. The proposed work is the first mathematical initiative that aims to apply the symmetry properties of hyperbolic Kac-Moody groups to the study of supergravity models in theoretical physics. While some of these correspondences of hyperbolic Kac-Moody symmetry with supergravity theories are conjectural, developing a full mathematical theory of hyperbolic Kac-Moody groups and their symmetric spaces amenable to computation will have a significant impact on the understanding of open problems concerning the symmetry groups of supergravity.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to advance understanding in the study of algebraic symmetries underlying high energy theoretic physics. Almost all finite dimensional semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras occur in space-time symmetries and the development of the Standard Model of particle physics, which could not have progressed without an understanding of symmetries and group transformations. Infinite dimensional generalizations, known as Kac-Moody algebras and their associated groups, naturally form two distinct classes, namely affine and hyperbolic. By the 1980's the class of affine Kac-Moody algebras was shown to have wide applications in physical theories such as elementary particle theory, quantum field theory, gauge theory, conformal field theory, gravity and string theory. This project concerns Lie groups of infinite dimensional hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras which contain affine Kac-Moody subalgebras."

Applications of the spectral theory of metaplectic forms to the distribution of roots of quadratic congruences are in progress. Here the point is that the resulting estimates are valid in great uniformity with respect to the discriminant.

The first is Hodge theory.  Motivated by work of Mark Green and Phillip Griffiths on the Hodge conjecture and by work of Richard Hain and David Reed on algebraic cycles, the PI and Gregory Pearlstein have defined a sequence of metrized line bundles called biextension line bundles associated to Hodge classes in smooth,projective complex varieties.  The main goal of the proposed research is to understand the metrics and the asymptotics of the metric at infinity in the hope of gaining insight into the geometry of moduli spaces and into the Hodge conjecture.The second part of the proposed research concerns cohomological invariants associated to algebraic groups.  These are invariants associating to any torsor for an algebra group G over a field F a class in the Galois cohomology of F.  Although they seem difficult to compute explicitly, cohomological invariants are very natural objects, and one would hope that they give full information about the torsors for an algebraic group.  By an observation of Burt Totaro, the cohomological invariants of a group G are computatable in terms of the motivic cohomology of the classifying space of G.  The PI intends to use Totaro's observation to compute cohomological invariants of the spinor group and related groups.<br/><br/>The unifying theme in both proposed topics is to understand to what extent problems in algebraic geometry can be linearized and studied using cohomology.  The Hodge conjecture, which motivates the first proposed topic, asks if cohomology determines algebraic cycles. Similarly, the second proposed topic asks to what extent cohomological invariants determine torsors.  Since linear invariants are usually more tractable than non-linear ones, both topics are of fundamental importance in algebraic geometry and related subjects."

The first project involves studying the transcendental part of the Brauer group of an algebraic surface that is defined over a number field. The existence and distribution of points with rational coordinates on a variety is often hampered by cohomological obstructions arising from the Brauer group of the variety. The focus of this project is on K3 and Enriques surfaces, as these are among the simplest kind of surfaces that have nontrivial transcendental Brauer classes. The basic problem is to find unramified Azumaya algebras representing transcendental classes that arise in geometric constructions (e.g., in the twisted universal bundles of moduli spaces of stable sheaves on K3 surfaces). The Azumaya algebras must have a description that is concrete enough to determine the ramification behavior at places of bad reduction for the surface. The PI will examine the extent to which these classes explain the absence or scarcity of rational points on such surfaces. The second project focuses on an explicit study of universal torsors of smooth, projective rational surfaces. Over number fields, universal torsors have been used to prove that certain cohomological obstructions suffice to explain all failures of local-to-global principles on large classes of algebraic varieties. When finitely generated, Cox rings give rise to explicit presentations of universal torsors. The aim of this project is to catalogue classes of smooth rational surfaces with finitely generated Cox rings and give explicit presentations for these rings.<br/><br/>Arithmetic geometry is a subject that lies at the crossroads of number theory and algebraic geometry: one aim is to study the solutions of a system of multivariate polynomial equations whose coordinates are all, say, rational numbers or integers (e.g. 19/7, or -5).  Sometimes, these systems of polynomials have very few such solutions, or none at all!  This project seeks to understand the phenomena that prevent the existence of these special solutions, with restrictions on the systems of polynomials equations studied. These restrictions arise naturally from the geometry of the systems. The study of such solutions has amply documented connections to cryptography and the transmission of information on noisy channels.

Specifically, the P.I. outlines questions regarding the distribution of closed geodesics, the question of arithmetic quantum unique ergodicity, and the the strong spectral gap property on locally symmetric spaces.  The question of quantum unique ergodicity originates in the theory of quantum chaos, which studies the behavior of high energy states of quantum systems with underlying chaotic dynamics. Arithmetic surfaces, along with other arithmetic models, have proven a very fertile ground for testing predictions made in this theory. Recently there has been a great advancement in this field; application of new techniques from ergodic and analytic number theory resolved the (arithmetic) quantum unique ergodicity conjecture for arithmetic surfaces. However, for higher dimensional systems our knowledge is still very limited; for example, it is not even clear what the correct conjecture should be in this setting.<br/>The P.I. proposes to address this problem for certain higher dimensional symmetric spaces. On the other side of the spectrum, the notion of a strong spectral gap is related to the lowest energy state. This notion is crucial in many applications and in particular to the distribution of closed geodesics on these spaces. Following advancements in various mathematical disciplines, the existence and magnitude of the strong spectral gap is well understood in almost all cases. However, there are still a few cases missing in order to fully complete the picture, and it is the P.I.'s intention to work on closing this gap.<br/><br/>The problems the P.I. proposes to investigate have a long history and are still matters of active research. Although the models considered in this program are very specific and arithmetic in nature, the P.I. believes that the study of these models will lead to a better understanding of related phenomena in more general settings. In particular, results on the question of quantum unique ergodicity for arithmetic models will provide valuable insights into the behavior of other physical systems. Also, progress on the spectral gap question may lead to construction of new expanders which have uses in cryptography. Moreover, the attempts to answer these questions could lead to the development of new tools that will facilitate studying fundamental questions in number theory."

He would like to derive consequences on either the existence of indecomposable bundles of low rank on projective space, or on improved lower bounds on the holomorphic Euler characteristic of compact Kahler manifolds without irregular  fibrations, after applying the BGG correspondence to such modules. He will attempt to apply methods of this type to approach a conjecture of Carrell and Hacon-Kovacs on holomorphic one-forms on varieties of general type. He will also continue work towards the Beauville-Debarre-Ran Schottky-type conjecture predicting which principally polarized abelian varieties contain subvarieties representing minimal cohomology classes, and towards the Beauville conjecture on  filtrations on the rational Chow groups of abelian varieties induced by the Fourier-Mukai transform.<br/><br/><br/>Some of the problems the PI proposes to attack, like the invariance of cohomology groups or Hodge numbers under derived equivalences, restrictions on the total cohomology of a variety, or the study of minimal classes on abelian varieties, are among the most prominent and established problems in their respective areas and will have a high impact as proved statements. Others, like for instance the dimension of derived categories or the exterior structure on cohomology modules, are part of newly emerging theories where a better understanding will surely lead to more applications. All parts of the project will have a broad range of applications, further our knowledge in the fi eld, create interaction with people of diff^erent mathematical backgrounds, and produce problems suitable for Ph.D. students. Outside of Mathematics, the PI will continue to be involved in non-departmental activities, like his membership on the WISEST Committee devoted to creating a better environment for women in science and engineering, and on the UIC Senate. In the international mathematical community, he will be involved in organizing conferences and workshops, and editing volumes with the goal of disseminating knowledge. Funds will help the PI continue to deliver lectures at summer schools and conferences in the US and abroad; in the recent past this has led to working with students outside of the PI's base institution and getting part of their research started. In the UIC department they will be used for assisting the research and travel of graduate students, supporting seminars, and developing and improving the graduate curriculum."

The main idea is the construction of natural complex-analytic extension spaces, which make it possible to apply differential-geometric and topological methods to the above problems, and which can also be used to define numerical invariants. To date, the PI has successfully carried out one portion of this, namely the construction of complex-analytic Neron models. He proposes to use his results to describe graph closures of admissible normal functions, to carry out a local study of singularities, and to obtain a classification theorem. The PI also proposes to introduce Poincare bundles of Neron models, both to define numerical invariants for pairs of normal functions and to make progress on the question of the existence of singularities.<br/><br/>The proposed work is connected with the program of M. Green and P. Griffiths, and bears on the Hodge conjecture. The general philosophy is to understand the geometry of a complex algebraic variety with the help of differential geometry and topology. The proposed methods can be used, for instance, to study Noether-Lefschetz loci on Calabi-Yau threefolds; this example is interesting because we have very intriguing numerical predictions made by physicists for these loci."

There will be six invited speakers all from American institutions: Matthew Emerton (Northwestern), Toby Gee (Harvard and Northwestern), Kiran Kedlaya (MIT and UC San Diego), Wen-ching Winnie Li (Penn State), Tong Liu (Purdue), and Ling Long (Iowa State University). The lectures by invited speakers will happen on April 29 and 30, and May 1 is reserved for talks by participating recent PhDs and graduate students. This is part of the annual Oliver Atkin Memorial Lecture and Workshop at UIC.<br/> <br/>Modular forms and their associated Galois representations are of ubiquitous importance in modern Number theory. These objects, for example, played a prominent role in Andrew Wiles? proof of Fermat?s Last Theorem. Modular forms come in two basic flavors: the ones associated with a congruence group, and those associated with noncongruence groups; the theory of congruence modular forms is far better understood. This workshop concentrates on the more mysterious and less understood noncongruence modular forms. Even though all modular forms, congruence or not, are expected to encode deep arithmetic information, this information is not easily accessible in the case of noncongruence modular forms.  Recent progress in the arithmetic theory of Galois representations, however, has made it possible to understand noncongruence modular forms in ways that was previously impossible."

Firstly, he would like to study Teichmueller curves, which are rigid geodesics in the moduli space of curves, and hence can provide crucial information for the geometry of the moduli space. Secondly, he wants to explore moduli spaces parameterizing curves in an ambient space, focusing on the comparison between the moduli space of stable maps, the moduli space of semi-stable sheaves, Hilbert scheme and Chow variety. Finally, he plans to study the Jacobian variety of line bundles on a non-reduced curve, which may reveal geometric properties of smooth curves by deformation and degeneration techniques.      <br/><br/>This project belongs to the subject of algebraic geometry, whose main objects are algebraic varieties defined by the solution sets of polynomial equations. Moduli spaces parameterize varieties of a given type. For instance, a donut and a car tire are of the same type, because they both have one hole, but a pretzel with three holes is different. An attractive aspect is that a moduli space for its objects tends itself to be a variety. Therefore, studying moduli spaces can help us understand the classification of algebraic varieties. In addition, moduli spaces have been extensively used in many other fields. The principal investigator expects that the outcome of this project can enrich the studies of other subjects, including combinatorics, dynamics, enumerative geometry and mathematical physics."

The concept was later extended to coherent sheaves, which are a natural generalization of vector bundles, and can be thought of as a way to allow for vector bundles with singularities.  While the notion of stability for coherent sheaves depends on choices, only recently has the space of possible such choices been studied.  In particular, due to the seminal work by Bridgeland, we know that there is a manifold of stability conditions, if we are willing to extend our notion of stability from coherent sheaves to complexes of coherent sheaves, i.e., to the derived category.  This new concept of stability is motivated by string theory, and  mirror symmetry relates it closely to symplectic geometry and properties of the Fukaya category.  One focus of this proposal is to work on questions for Bridgeland stability conditions that are suggested by string theory, but don't have a satisfactory mathematical answer yet. For example, the PI will work on constructing a missing class of examples of stability conditions, whose existence is closely related to a notion of stability for D-branes in string theory. <br/><br/>Algebraic Geometry is the study of shapes arising as solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. While these are ubiquitous in mathematics, they have also become important in mathematical physics and, more specifically, in string theory.

These problems have been the interplay of several kinds of mathematics. They are, on one hand, related to counting curves over a finite field and, on the other, to the asymptotic behavior of the subgroup growth of lattices. The PI has already solved several problems in this area and would like to give a better picture. The second purpose of this proposal is to describe the ""smallest"" locally symmetric orbifolds with a given covering space, or its equivalent object in the non-Archimedean setting. This natural question had been considered by many mathematicians such as Siegel, Chinburg, Friedman, Meyerhoff, Gehring, Martin, and Lubotzky, and it is solved for lattices in SL(2) over different local fields. The PI solved this problem for most of Chevalley groups over a positive characteristic local field. The PI would like to understand structure of such orbifolds. For instance, he plans to answer  Lubotzky?s question on whether the smallest orbifold is compact. The next problem is the classification of discrete vertex transitive actions on Bruhat-Tits buildings. These actions have been of interest since the 80?s. Several mathematicians have tried to construct such actions and, so far, for large dimensions, only one family of such actions have been constructed. They have been also used to construct explicit Ramanujan complexes. These combinatorial objects are generalization of Ramanujan graphs, which are highly useful in computer science, and expected to have broad applications. The PI plans to classify such actions. The PI and Mohammadi have constructed new families of simply-transitive actions on the vertex set of the Bruhat-Tits building and gave a very strong classification theorem, and it might be possible to get new examples in positive characteristic which in turn would give us new Ramanujan complexes. The PI proposes a step toward a recent conjecture by Sarnak on equi-distribution of orbits of prime powers of a unipotent element in a finite volume homogeneous space.<br/><br/>Discrete subgroups of semi-simple groups can be considered as the connecting point of several parts of mathematics. On one hand, they are related to geometry and geometric group theory, and on the other to dynamical systems and number theory. The PI proposes several related problems on this subject. In these projects, PI would like to either count number of certain combinatorial objects with rich algebraic structure, or describe ""smallest"" models with certain descriptions, which usually have more symmetries and might be useful in computer science, or seek for other evidences of the randomness of the Mbius function. These projects consist of different parts and of various mathematical nature, e.g. Bruhat-Tits theory, mass formula, subgroup growth and sieve theory. Because of its relations with a wide range of mathematics, students at both graduate and under-graduate level can be exposed to and learn different topics. Moreover, some parts are of combinatorial or computational nature which makes them more accessible to under-graduates."

These steps include a general gluing<br/>formula for the theory of logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants<br/>and a generalization of the tropical vertex of the PI,<br/>Pandharipande and Siebert to all dimensions. In addition, the<br/>program with Siebert has led to the construction of canonical<br/>theta functions for lines bundles on (degenerating families) of<br/>Calabi-Yau manifolds. The existence of such theta functions is<br/>expected to have various applications, such as geometric<br/>compactifications of the moduli space of K3 surfaces (being<br/>pursued with P.

String theory replaces the<br/>traditional notion of the point particle with a small loop of<br/>string, moving through space-time.  To make string theory<br/>compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must be<br/>ten-dimensional. Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one<br/>expects six of these dimensions to be a very small ""curled up""<br/>geometric object.  These geometric objects are called Calabi-Yau<br/>manifolds. In the early 1990s, string theorists proposed a<br/>remarkable association between completely different Calabi-Yau<br/>manifolds: certain calculations extremely difficult to perform on<br/>one Calabi-Yau manifold could be completed by performing<br/>completely different, and much easier, calculations on a<br/>different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as mirror<br/>symmetry.  Since this time, many geometers have been trying to<br/>understand the mathematics behind this miraculous<br/>observation. New insights and explanations for this phenomenon<br/>are developing rapidly, and these insights are leading to new<br/>approaches to old problems in algebraic geometry. The proposed<br/>work aims to both further understanding of mirror symmetry and<br/>apply this understanding to produce new developments in algebraic<br/>geometry."

Earlier work of the PI, in collaboration with D. Jorgensen, has shown that vanishing of cohomology over non-complete intersection rings can have rather non-rigid behavior. The accent in the proposed work is shifted towards finding a common bridge between complete intersections and other good classes of rings. Attention will be paid to vanishing of (co)homology, properties of the minimal free resolutions of modules, Betti numbers and other homologically defined invariants. An important aspect is an effort to show that the classes of rings and the modules considered occur abundantly in a variety of situations of geometric interest.<br/><br/>Commutative algebra allows one to encode information regarding solution sets of polynomial equations into objects such as rings and modules, and further understand their structure, using algebraic tools and a recent infusion of techniques from other fields that deal with physical spaces, such as topology. This method of encoding information and its further study is relevant to almost any area of mathematics, and to theoretical physics. In particular, the classes of rings and the properties considered in this project are relevant in the field of algebraic geometry, and some of the methods and outcomes make connections with the field of non-commutative algebra."

An important subject in current physics closely connected with the topic is string theory, especially the study of mirror symmetry.  Current trends in noncommutative algebra are highly interdisciplinary and touch many other fundamental areas of mathematics.  A major workshop such as this brings together many researchers from the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere, and can be crucial to establishing new collaborations and more interactions between mathematicians studying different threads of the subject.

Interestingly, the Fourier transform is a part of a family of operators, that satisfy relations with respect to one another that can be described by a group symmetry structure, strongly related to the symplectic group. This family is called the Weil representation. The Weil representation serves as a bridge that connects classical harmonic analysis with representation theory, it also gives a powerful fresh perspective about the very nature of the theory. Furthermore, the Weil representation is governed by an object from algebraic geometry, called the geometric Weil representation. The geometric Weil representation, developed by the authors, serves as a bridge that connects between harmonic analysis and algebraic geometry, hence enables to solve analytic problems using modern cohomological techniques. The present project revolves around the following themes: canonical model of the Weil representation and its geometrization, the Weil representation in characteristic two, the Weil representation of symplectic similitudes, and applications to various fields.<br/><br/>This project will enhance our understanding of the representation theoretic and algebraic geometric structures that underlie harmonic analysis and their applications. It will also reveal new perspectives about classical statements from number theory and analysis. The PI and Co-PI have presented their work in numerous classes and seminars over the past years. They are also collaborating with people from other scientific areas, such as engineering and physics, on the applications of their results to questions outside pure mathematics. They strongly believe that their methods and results are of interest to the broader scientific community and has the potential to have radical impact on disciplines outside of mathematics."

In particular, the PI proposes to investigate the ubiquity of the property of ``potential diagonalizability'' for potentially crystalline Galois representations, which will give powerful new automorphy lifting theorems thanks to previous work of him and his collaborators.

In recent years it has become clear that there should be another general framework in which the number theoretic part of the program fits, a ``p-adic and mod p Langlands program''.

It has been understood for a long time that (special) functions, in generalized sense,  can be studied in terms of the systems of differential equations that they satisfy. To this end, a general theory of systems of linear differential equations was developed by the Sato school in Kyoto. This point of view,  in its various incarnations, is now ubiquitous in mathematics. The PI, jointly with Masaki Kashiwara, has solved the key longstanding problem in this area, the codimension three conjecture. Kashiwara and the PI will continue their collaboration towards a comprehensive understanding of holonomic regular microdifferential systems. These are the systems that most often come up in applications to other areas. The Langlands program provides means of relating areas of mathematics that often do not have a straightforward direct relationship. It implements this relationship via the symmetries of the theories by exhibiting a relationship between their  representations. A major area of this proposal is the theory of real groups. Real groups are the fundamental symmetries that occur both in number theory and physics. A key outstanding question in representation theory of real groups is the determination of the particularly important class of unitary representations . Wilfried Schmid and the PI have made far-reaching conjectures which put this question in a general mathematical context phrasing the problem in terms of Hodge theory. They are on their way to settling these conjectures and the structures of the unitary dual. The PI also proposes, in joint work with Roman Bezrukavnikov, to prove a categorical Langlands duality for real groups. <br/><br/>Differential equations are used to model various phenomena in nature. One major aspect of this project aims at a comprehensive understanding of an important class of systems of differential equations. Lie groups are the fundamental symmetries that occur in nature. They are important both in physics and number theory. A key question is to understand where these symmetries occur and it what form they occur. The second major aspect of this project will answer this question in terms of basic geometric structures called Hodge structures."

The project proposes to extend our understanding of already posed, extremely interesting mathematical questions over finite fields, questions the answers to which may well in the future have a broader societal impact. Second, the project proposes the investigation of new, extremely interesting, mathematical questions, for whose consideration there does not yet exist even a theoretical framework; any progress on such questions may point the way to the presently missing theoretical framework.  Third, the project will deepen our understanding of the analogies between the finite eld case and the number field case, analogies which have already played a important role in shaping our very thinking about the number field case."

In his address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in  1983, Gromov talked about groups as geometric objects. This followed on his proof in 1981 that finitely generated groups of polynomial growth contain a nilpotent subgroup of  finite index, which has helped to focus attention on the extent to which the asymptotic properties of a finitely generated solvable group has on its algebraic structure. This has led to a number of results dealing with the quasi-isometries and rigidity of solvable groups.Some of these results have been  motivated by ideas coming out of the theory of lie groups, where the semi-simple ones exhibit a rigidity that is not shared by the solvable ones. This ongoing geometric study of what are perhaps the simplest finitely generated solvable groups has put into sharp relief the very nature of finitely presented solvable groups. <br/><br/>Groups arise in many different areas of mathematics, in physics, in chemistry and in chrystallography among other disciplines. One of the reasons for this is that they can be used as a tool for understanding  and defining symmetry. Floor patterns in many churches display a symmetry which can be analyzed and better understood by using group theory and it is this kind of symmetry that groups capture, but in a more abstract way. Groups also display an innate symmetry of their own and in recent years efforts have been made to connect geometry to group theory. This is an important area of current research. The objective of this conference is to join the existing combinatorial and theoretical approach of group theory to the geometric approach. The latter requires a great deal of mathematical machinery.  The work that is currently being undertaken involves solvable groups introduced by Evariste Galois (who died in 1832 in a duel aged 21) to determine the nature of the solutions of everyday polynomial equations. The aim  of the conference is to make the two aspects of group theory available to graduate students, postdocs and interested professionals."

While PANTS has been predominantly held at institutions in South Carolina, SERMON has always rotated around institutions in the Southeast.  Starting in 2011 there will be one PANTS meeting held in the fall and one in December along with one SERMON meeting in the spring. The December PANTS meeting will rotate annually between Clemson University and the University of South Carolina.  The fall PANTS meeting will be held at another Southeastern school. The fall PANTS meeting is one or one and one-half days and features two plenary talks, while the December meeting is two days and features four plenary talks. Leading number theorists from outside the Southeast give the hour-long plenary talks.  The annual SERMON meeting will be held over one and one-half days with one plenary speaker that will deliver a public lecture on the Friday before the conference begins and then an hour-long plenary address during the conference.  The meetings also have 20 minute contributed talks from Southeastern participants.<br/><br/>The primary goal of PANTS/SERMON is to provide the number theory community in the Southeast with an opportunity to hear about recent research in number theory, pure and applied. PANTS/SERMON meetings attract prominent number theorists.  They also provide regional mathematicians, particularly graduate students and junior faculty, with an opportunity to speak.  PANTS/SERMON participants come from Ph.D. granting institutions, institutions whose highest degree awarded is a master's degree, and from institutions granting only baccalaureate degrees. Students and faculty at some of these schools do not have access to travel funds nor to research seminars, so PANTS/SERMON funding is especially crucial to them. The organizers will also continue to try to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and other underrepresented groups."

Interestingly, the Fourier transform is a part of a family of operators, that satisfy relations with respect to one another that can be described by a group symmetry structure, strongly related to the symplectic group. This family is called the Weil representation. The Weil representation serves as a bridge that connects classical harmonic analysis with representation theory, it also gives a powerful fresh perspective about the very nature of the theory. Furthermore, the Weil representation is governed by an object from algebraic geometry, called the geometric Weil representation. The geometric Weil representation, developed by the authors, serves as a bridge that connects between harmonic analysis and algebraic geometry, hence enables to solve analytic problems using modern cohomological techniques. The present project revolves around the following themes: canonical model of the Weil representation and its geometrization, the Weil representation in characteristic two, the Weil representation of symplectic similitudes, and applications to various fields.<br/><br/>This project will enhance our understanding of the representation theoretic and algebraic geometric structures that underlie harmonic analysis and their applications. It will also reveal new perspectives about classical statements from number theory and analysis. The PI and Co-PI have presented their work in numerous classes and seminars over the past years. They are also collaborating with people from other scientific areas, such as engineering and physics, on the applications of their results to questions outside pure mathematics.

The proposed problems have direct applications in the theory of automorphic forms and in the Langlands program. They also have analytic and geometric aspects. The problems are divided into three topics: Harmonic analysis, representation theory of groupoids and the integrability theorem. Here are brief descriptions of those topics: The PI views harmonic analysis on spherical spaces as a generalization of representation theory. His aim is to transfer certain fundamental results from representation theory to the realm of harmonic analysis on spherical spaces.<br/>The notion of a groupoid is an interesting generalization of the notion of group. The PI proposes to re-build the representation theory of p-adic groups for the case of groupoids. The integrability theorem is a theorem from the theory of D-modules which has powerful applications in the theory of invariant distributions on real manifolds, which in turn is an important ingredient of representation theory. The theory of D-modules, however, is not applicable to the p-adic case. Based on a previous partial result, the PI proposes to provide an analog of the integrability theorem for the p-adic case.<br/><br/>The propose project is about representation theory and harmonic analysis. A model example of the problems in this project can be the Fourier series. The Fourier series is a decomposition of a function on the circle as a sum of imaginary exponent (which are closely related to the trigonometric functions sine and cosine). These exponents change in a very simple way when you rotate the circle. The problems that the PI studies are, in a sense, a generalization of this construction for higher dimensional cases. In general, group theory can be viewed as the study of symmetries of mathematical objects, representation theory - as the study of symmetries of vector spaces, and harmonic analysis - as the study of spaces of functions over geometric objects that possess symmetries. The geometric objects that are studied are real and p-adic manifolds. Real manifolds are geometric objects that locally look like a line, a plain, a three dimensional space (like the one we live in) or a higher dimensional space. p-adic manifolds are certain analogues of real manifolds. Representation theory of real groups and harmonic analysis on real spaces have various applications in geometry, analysis and subsequently in physics, signal processing, image processing and biology. Both the p-adic and the real case have many important applications in number theory. More specifically, in the theory of automorphic forms and in the Langlands program."

The PI completed that program for function fields over algebraic closures of finite fields, and he plans to complete that program for function fields over algebraic closures of global fields and more general algebraically closed base fields.

In particular, to gain a better understanding of how localization processes relate via local-global principles to large fields and the Freeness Conjecture.

The two central themes are toric varieties and hyperplane arrangements. The main objects studied in toric varieties are the equivariant Chow ring, the homogenous coordinate ring of a toric variety embedded by a very ample divisor, and toric codes. The questions are to better understand how combinatorics and geometry (of the fan defining the toric variety, or of the polytope defining the divisor) manifests in the Chow ring, in the homogeneous coordinate ring, and in the associated toric code. The main object studied in hyperplane arrangements is the module of logarithmic one forms. In particular, Terao's conjecture that the freeness of this module is combinatorially determined is one of the main open questions in the field. The PI will also study the LCS and Chen ranks of the fundamental group, and their connection to resonance varieties.<br/><br/>Two of the three toric projects have significant real world applications: the Chow ring of a toric variety is simply the ring of splines: such objects are central in numerical analysis (for example, in solving partial differential equations, which are crucial to much of applied mathematics), and in geometric modelling. Toric codes are a generalization of the Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller codes used in signal processing and data compression. Advances in coding theory could lead to more efficient transmission of data over noisy communication channels. Software will be developed for the NSF sponsored Macaulay2 platform, and made publicly available, benefitting researchers in many different areas. For example, toric varieties are widely used as test cases for mirror symmetry in mathematical physics. This software will be coauthored with graduate students: the project supports 50% summer research for two Ph.D. students.

The geometry of algebraic curves underlying the structure of global fields of positive characteristic has shown its crucial role in the process of solving several fundamental questions in number-theory which are still open for global fields of characteristic zero. Some combinatorial formulas, like the equation supplying the cardinality of the set of rational points of a Grassmannian over a finite field of cardinality q are known to be rational expressions keeping a meaningful value also when q=1. The classical point of view of A. Weil and K. Iwasawa that adjoining roots of unity is a process analogous to the construction of an extension of a base field, also motivates the search of a mathematical object that is expected to be a non-trivial limit of Galois fields as the cardinality (q) of these fields tends to 1. The process of taking the limit q to 1 in the Hasse-Weil zeta function has been shown to determine the ""counting function"" N(q) of the ""absolute curve"" which is the geometric counterpart, in this basic framework, of the Riemann zeta function. Moreover, based on the Bost-Connes quantum statistical mechanical system (which originally gave the relation between noncommutative geometry and number theory) and on the corresponding geometric space (i.e. the adele class space of the global field of rational numbers) the counting function N(q) is interpreted as an intersection number closely related to both the Riemann-Weil explicit formulas and the spectral interpretation of the zeros of L-functions.The goal of the proposed research is to unveil the geometry of the adele class space and its variants, and to compare these spaces with the ""absolute curve"", using the tools of algebraic geometry, noncommutative geometry, number theory (including Iwasawa theory), and tropical geometry.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project is devoted to shape the construction and promote the study of the fundamental properties of a new geometric structure with the goal to transplant the ideas of A. Weil in number-theory, in his proof of the Riemann Hypothesis for function fields, to the case of algebraic number fields. The methods to be used come mainly from algebraic geometry, noncommutative geometry, number theory (including Iwasawa theory) and tropical geometry, with computer testing as an important tool. The broad impact of the project is to communicate to an audience of young researchers and senior scientists the need to attack the conceptual understanding of some of the main open problems in arithmetic by working on the development of new connections between the fields of number theory and noncommutative geometry which although a very new area of mathematics, has matured rapidly in the recent past few years. This research addresses central aspects and open problems that involve some of the key mathematical objects in number-theory, such as the celebrated Riemann zeta function, its generalizations (L-functions) and the p-adic counterparts in Iwasawa theory. The development of this project is also expected to solidify the interactions between noncommutative geometry, number theory and mathematics in \characteristic one"", including tropical geometry, under a unified methodology."

Recent discoveries suggest a new cross-fertilization between theoretical physics and algebraic K-theory, deepening the existing connection with topological K-theory.  To make this new connection explicit, the P.I. proposes to construct families of cycles in low-degree algebraic K-groups of Calabi-Yau varieties, and to study their behavior under degeneration and homological mirror symmetry.  This part of the project will have applications to the arithmetic of Gromov-Witten invariants. Underlying Hodge-theoretic problems which will be addressed include the classification of period subdomains parametrizing Calabi-Yau threefolds, and the determination of their Kato-Usui boundary components and automorphic cohomology.  These results will be relevant not only to Hodge theory and physics but also for automorphic forms and the Langlands program.  They will, in addition, involve the construction of new <br/>Calabi-Yau varieties.<br/><br/>Hodge theory seeks to describe the influence of integrals and differential equations on the shape of an algebraic space.  Famous conjectures including that of Hodge (which is one of the seven Clay Millenium Problems) predict that these computations, while non-algebraic a priori, are firmly governed by structures called algebraic groups and algebraic cycles.  But these latter structures are far more ubiquitous, and useful, than the conjectures suggest; the P.I. will investigate their application to related problems in number theory and physics.  For example, in the model of spacetime proposed by string theory (which purports to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity), 6 as-of-yet unobserved real dimensions are accounted for by Calabi-Yau spaces.  These spaces are linked by dualities which preserve the physical theory while completely altering the mathematics.  Incorporating algebraic cycles and their generalizations into these dualities will completely explain observed asymptotics of instanton numbers.  This is part of the thrust of an interdisciplinary BIRS workshop on ""Hodge Theory and String Duality"" (Dec. 2011) co-organized by the P.I.  Results from this project will be disseminated through such conferences, summer schools, journal articles and websites.  The project consultants brought to Washington University by the grant will contribute to the research atmosphere, and there are specialized problems related to the project which will be suitable for training graduate students."

One of these will be the subconvexity problem, in different aspects and settings, for the Rankin-Selberg convolution L-functions associated with holomorphic and Maass Hecke eigen cusp forms.  The novelty here is that both forms in the convolution will contribute to the size of the analytic conductor and therefore to the complexity of the problem.  For example, consider the case of two forms with varying co-prime levels.  The goal then is to establish subconvexity bounds for these L-functions in both levels.  Furthermore, this goal is meant to be achieved without the use of an amplifier when the levels vary at distinguishable rates.  The main idea is to take advantage of the choice in ""averaging family"" as one has several spectrally complete families to choose from.  This idea is quite general and carries over into higher degree L-functions as well.  One might even then hope to establish subconvexity bounds for the triple product L-function appearing in Watson type formulas when all involved forms are varying at certain relative rates. A result which could certainly be linked with interesting applications.  The proposer will also study sup-norms of GL(3) Maass cusp forms, extending the work of Iwaniec and Sarnak in the GL(2) case.<br/><br/>L-functions are functions constructed out of arithmetic information encoded in objects which often have a beautiful natural structure.  Many questions regarding their analytic properties, like the Riemann Hypothesis, remain open.  However, the simple fact that these L-functions are built out of local data associated with natural objects means that some exciting formulas relating deep questions in science to special values of L-functions have been established.  For example, such L-functions have appeared in formulas related to questions in quantum chaos (the study of the relations between quantum mechanics and classical chaos) and have been a crucial tool in the recent resolution of the Quantum Unique Ergodicity Conjecture of Rudnick and Sarnak.  Motivated by the significance of these L-functions, the proposer will investigate and analyze a new class of L-functions which may also have a natural interpretation in terms of dynamics and could lead to new and interesting questions in science and nature."

In applied mathematics, they form a basis of perturbative understanding of nearby problems and give a powerful calibration tool for numerical investigations. This conference will bring together the experts working on various aspects of integrability, and will aim to advance our understanding of integrable systems and their applications in algebra, geometry, and physics."

The moduli spaces that arise from consideration of analytic number theory over function fields (Hurwitz spaces, moduli spaces of holomorphic rational curves on varieties) are spaces that have already attracted a great deal of attention from topologists; it turns out that topological theorems and conjectures about the rational cohomology of these spaces translates, via the Lefschetz trace formula, into very clean asymptotic formulas for things like ""the average size of p-torsion in the class group of a quadratic imaginary field.""  Some of these formulas agree with function-field analogues of established conjectures in number theory, and thus prove those analogues; others suggest new conjectures.  Beyond this main theme, the PI will study algebro-geometric methods for Kakeya problems, applications of expander graphs in arithmetic geometry, and the arithmetic of nilpotent quotients of fundamental groups.<br/><br/>The PI is carrying out research at the interface between two fields that are quite different on the surface.  The first field is the classical subject of analytic number theory, whose central questions involve ""counting.""  For example:  what is the chance that a random number is not a multiple of any perfect square greater than 1?  The second field, much newer, is that of topology, which asks questions about abstract shapes, like curvy high-dimensional surfaces.  For instance, one can ask about the space of all sets of n different points in the plane.  It turns out, thanks to fundamental insights developed by Grothendieck in the 1960s, that topological questions about high-dimensional spaces can give us very deep insights into counting questions about whole numbers!  The PI and his collaborators are proving new topological theorems which prove some old conjectures in number theory, and suggest new conjectures; this work will help build new bridges between the two subjects.  The PI will also continue outreach work as a mathematical expositor, maintaining a popular math blog and writing articles about mathematics for national publications."

Fomin. This theory arose as an attempt to create an algebraic framework for the study of two classical fields: theory of total positivity, and representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. Since its inception, the theory of cluster algebras found a number of exciting connections and applications: quiver representations, non-commutative geometry, Seiberg dualities, discrete integrable systems, Teichmuller theory, etc. The PI explores the structural properties of cluster algebras, and their connections and applications. He also develops the theory of quivers with potentials and their representations, motivated among other things, by the theory of superpotentials in theoretical physics. <br/><br/>This project has roots in two classical areas of mathematics: representation theory and the theory of total positivity. Representation theory provides mathematical tools for studying symmetry, while total positivity is a remarkable property of matrices (square arrays of numbers) that generalizes the familiar notion of positive numbers. Both theories find numerous applications in physics, chemistry and other sciences, as well as numerous connections with other mathematical disciplines. In fact, representation theory serves as the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics, while total positivity is a major tool for explaining oscillations in mechanical systems. The cluster algebras lying in the heart of this project provide a new algebraic framework for the study of these disciplines, making their formalism more explicit and understandable."

The PI also plans to work on an algebraic version of the local trace formula, continue to study quantization of algebraic symplectic varieties in positive characteristic and its relation to non-commutative geometry and develop a relation between non-restricted representations of quantum groups at roots of unity and affine Lie algebras.<br/><br/>Representation theory is a branch of algebra studying the algebraic structure of symmetries. The basic question of representation theory is: given an abstract structure of symmetry (the idea rigorously expressed in such concepts as  a group, a Lie algebra etc.) to describe all possible ways to realize it as symmetries of a concrete algebraic object. During some hundred years of its existence representation theory found tremendously powerful applications in quantum physics, number theory, algebraic geometry and its original ""home territory"" of abstract algebra. In recent decades a lot of progress in topology, algebra and some branches of quantum physics has been obtained by applying a general concept of ""categorification"". The latter is based on the idea that some known algebraic objects should be realized as ""shadows"" of something more sophisticated but enjoying a much richer structure. An earlier work by the PI is devoted to a particular example of this strategy arising in the study of representations of finite Chevalley groups (such as the group of invertible matrices whose entries are residues modulo a given prime number). One of the goals of the current project is to apply this strategy to much more complicated, infinite dimensional, groups, known as loop groups. Quantum structures whose coefficients are residues modulo a prime are the subject of the other sections of the proposal."

A new approach to the study of canonical bases in various quantum algebras is proposed along with the study of the related cluster structures. The class of quantum algebras in which the canonical bases arise include coordinate rings of reductive algebraic groups and double Bruhat cell as well as new objects such as interval and Hankel algebras.  It has been recently discovered by the proposer that most of the above mentioned cluster and quantum cluster structures admit totally non-commutative analogues, which discovery, on the one hand, resulted in the proof of Kontsevich Cluster Conjecture and, on the other hand, provides a new transition from the rational Algebraic Geometry to its purely non-commutative counterpart. Another avenue of the research, quantum folding is a new approach to looking at the Dynkin symmetries of quantum groups that, quite surprisingly, produces the Langlands duals of the classical fixed points groups Even the simplest cases of quantum folding bring about new nilpotent Lie algebras and quantum uberalgebras that are flat deformations of both enveloping and symmetric algebras of those Lie algebras. The results of this study will be applied for solving problems such as computing the multiplicities for the symmetric powers of representations of reductive groups, computing products of Schubert classes in cohomology of the corresponding flag varieties and Grassmannians, constructing new totally positive varieties, integrable systems, and Hecke type algebras as well as for explication and elaboration of related combinatorial and geometric structures including the ``geometric lifting'' of crystal bases as a new tool in understanding the local Langlands correspondence.  <br/><br/>Representation theory  is one of the most dynamically developing fields of modern Mathematics. It has a large impact in other fields of Mathematics and numerous applications in other Natural Sciences. The concepts of  anonical and crystal bases are of great importance for the representation theory: a mere establishing of existence of such bases has helped in solving classical enumeration problems like computing multiplicities of irreducible representations or decomposing tensor products of irreducible representations. A new class of canonical bases discovered by the proposer is expected to settle an old problem of decomposing symmetric powers of representations. Therefore, any information on canonical or crystal bases would be very beneficial for the representation theory. The results of the proposer and other researchers suggest natural algebro-geometric counterparts for the purely discrete canonical and crystal bases: totally positive varieties, geometric crystals, commutative, quantum, and totally noncommutative cluster varieties. Understanding the relationship between these structures underlying the canonical bases is one of  main priorities of this proposal. This relationship has proved to be a useful tool in the study of Langlands correspondence --<br/>the most mysterious and inspiring correspondence between Algebra and Geometry of the 20th and 21st century Mathematics."

More specifically he investigates the intersection theory of geometrically defined classes on various moduli spaces related to curves. For this proposal there are roughly two major areas of research. A cluster of questions in open orbifold Gromov-Witten theory spring from the PI's previous work with Andrea Brini (University of Geneva) and his own graduate student Dusty Ross (Colorado State University). A second  group of problems in Hurwitz theory continue along the line of the PI's previous work with Hannah Markwig (Saarbrucken), Paul Johnson (Imperial College) and Steffen Marcus (Brown University) and Johnatan Wise (Stanford University). Open orbifold GW theory for toric orbifolds was defined by Brini and the PI, with the scope of giving a mathematical definition to invariants predicted by mirror symmetry and to obtain combinatorial techniques to study (ordinary) GW invariants of orbifolds. The work with Ross gave some positive evidence that open invariants could be useful tool for questions such as the Crepant Resolution Conjectures of Ruan and others. We mention some direction for future investigation in the area:<br/>- setting up a convenient formalism for open GW invariants, that may help extend the applicability of these tools to the Crepant Resolution Conjecture question beyond the Hard Lefschetz cases.<br/>- studying the algebraic structure of the orbifold topological vertex, its relation with the analogous object in Donaldson Thomas theory, and its connection with representation theory of wreath products of groups.<br/>- applying techniques of OGW to a conjecture of Bouchard-Klemm-Marino-Pasquetti relating such invariants to quantities arising in mirror symmetry via topological recursions developed by Eynard-Orantin.<br/>In Hurwitz theory the PI has investigated with Johnson and Markwig the piecewise polynomiality of double Hurwitz numbers. The three authors gave a convincing and fairly exhaustive description of the combinatorial phenomenon, including some interesting wall crossing formulas. This opens up the quest of finding a geometric interpretation for such wall crossings. The author is seeking to develop a cohomological intersection formula (along the lines of the ELSV formula for simple Hurwitz numbers) on some appropriate moduli spaces that describes the double Hurwitz numbers and explains the piecewise polynomiality either in terms of birational modification of the moduli spaces involved, or of boundary corrections to the cohomology classes involved. An ingredient that should prove extremely helpful to this scope is the description of the pushforward  to M_g-bar of the virtual fundamental class of moduli spaces of relative stable maps to the projective line in terms of standard generators of the tautological ring. This question has been investigated by the PI together with Marcus and Wise in genus 1. Richard Hain recently provides an answer for all genera but restricting to curves of compact type. The PI proposes to investigate this class on the full moduli space of curves, and exploit its polynomiality (or piecewise polynomiality) properties to prove an ELSV-type formula for double Hurwitz numbers. The PI also intends to work with Hannah Markwig to reinterpret this question tropically, with the twofold goal of obtaining better combinatorial tools to answer the question and to help the developments of the foundations of tropical moduli spaces of curves in arbitrary genus.<br/> <br/> <br/>The PI's research explores interconnections among several areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. Creating ""bridges"" and ""dictionaries"" among several scientific disciplines is often a useful way to make science progress. The proposed research is inserted in a fertile and modern area of mathematics. The PI has been participating to several workshops and conferences. Throughout the period of the proposed project, the PI intends to support graduate students and help their mathematical development. He has taken some preliminary contacts about co-organizing research schools both in Colorado and internationally. He intends to give an opportunity to his own graduate students to travel to conferences and to interact with the broader mathematical community. Finally he is interested in developing  partnership programs between Colorado State University and several international institutions, including University of Costa Rica, and University of Michoacan."

He proved that over a polynomial ring (over a field) every finitely generated module has a finite resolution. In the local and the graded cases there exists a minimal free resolution; it is unique up to an isomorphism and is contained in any free resolution of the resolved module.

It is motivated by recent conjectures relating periods of automorphic forms over spherical subgroups to Euler products of functionals arising from the Plancherel formula of a spherical variety, and expressing the support of Plancherel measure in terms of Arthur parameters. A major part of the project is devoted to creating trace formula-theoretic tools, both locally and globally, necessary to put the conjectures in the correct setting, to clarify some aspects and to prove particular instances of them. Other parts include extending previous harmonic-analytic results and developing a relative trace formula in specific cases in order to analyze the pertinent periods of automorphic forms.<br/><br/>L-functions are very central objects in various branches of number theory, and there are strong conjectures and results (in and around the Langlands program) relating most of the interesting types of L-functions to those L-functions which are called automorphic. Automorphic L-functions are studied by constructions of global harmonic analysis, that is explicit integrals of functions on the quotient of a Lie group by a discrete, arithmetic subgroup, but these constructions remain mysterious after many decades of use. A lot of them involve spherical (""large"") subgroups, and a general theory has started to emerge which connects global harmonic analysis to Euler products (and hence L-functions) via local harmonic analysis on spherical varieties. According to this theory, which for now is mostly conjectural, the local Langlands conjecture admits a generalization to the harmonic analysis of a spherical variety over a local field, where a ""dual group"" is attached to the spherical variety and describes the representations distinguished by it; and spherical periods of automorphic forms, satisfying certain assumptions, are eulerian in a very explicit way and, hence, related to L-functions or special values of those. This project aims at improving these conjectures and investigating ways for their proof, mainly by trace formula-theoretic techniques."

In the field of regular graphs, both finite and infinite, the project will systematically develop a heat kernel approach to number theory on graphs, including the Ihara zeta function.  In previous work, the PI has developed a succinct relation between Fourier coefficients of weight zero Maass forms and weight two holomorphic forms, both associated to any finite volume hyperbolic Riemann surface.  The proposal involves a continuation of this work, striving toward bounds of the Fourier coefficients.<br/><br/>Both the heat kernel and the wave kernel are mathematical objects which admit interpretations from many mathematical fields.  The heat kernel, in particular, can be viewed as a solution of a partial differential equation, as a one-parameter family of positive integrable functions, and as a function associated to probability theory and random walks.  As a result, the heat kernel provides a means by which one can employ ideas and results from one mathematical discipline in order to approach problems in another field.  The PI plans to continue this approach to study problems in number theory, analysis, and graph theory.    In addition to research interests, the PI has undertaken a number of educational endeavors striving to enhance opportunities for students.  As a faculty member at The City College of New York, the PI has developed courses in statistics and in financial mathematics for the Mathematics Department, and he works closely with the School of Education in their course offerings in teacher training programs.  In October 2010, the PI, together with J. Kramer, taught a graduate level course at the University of Sarajevo.  The proposed research includes a component of effort by the PI to enhance and further develop these teaching aspects of his mathematical interests."

Classical automorphic forms for a group G are functions on the adelic points of a reductive group G that satisfy nice transformation properties. Their arithmetic theory has yielded significant advances in the past few years:a proof Fermat's Last Theorem and a proof the Sato-Tate conjecture, to name two. The p-adic notions alluded above is a build-in concept to study congruences between these classical objects. Urban's proposal is a continuation on his work related to the construction and the study of congruences between Eisenstein series and  cuspidal automorphic forms  of various weights and levels and their links with p-adic L-functions and  certain arithmetically defined groups called Selmer groups. Urban proposes to continue to build some of the foundations of the general theory of the p-adic automorphic forms and p-adic Eisenstein series with an eye one the important applications that will result. In particular, this theory applied to the case of  unitary and symplectic groups will have important applications to the so-called p-adic Bloch-Kato conjecture.

Half of the book will be devoted to the theory for general reductive group. In the second half, he will describe some applications with examples and propose directions of future research. In particular, important conjectures of the theory will be described in detail. This book will be intended mainly to graduate student and researchers. Urban works jointly with some PhD students and recent post-doctoral mathematicians on some of his projects by organizing seminar and workshops. He also wants to enhance the training of these young mathematicians and facilitate interactions with highly qualified mathematicians he will invite on a regular basis.

Given a Lie algebra one can define a numerical invariant of 3-manifolds called the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant. It is an open problem to lift these to homological invariants of 3-manifolds. This is analogous to the way (singular) homology of topological spaces lifts the Euler characteristic. In earlier work of the PI jointly with Joel Kamnitzer they were able to do this for complements of links inside the 3-sphere when the Lie algebra is sl(n) and the link labeled by fundamental representations. To do this they used certain (derived) categories of coherent sheaves on flag-like varieties and the hope is to generalize this approach to other 3-manifolds. Their constructions were algebro-geometric but used many techniques from representation theory. Inspired by representation theory the PI plans to develop other tools to study varieties and their categories of coherent sheaves. For example, he plans to study actions of the Heisenberg Lie algebra on categories of sheaves on Hilbert schemes.<br/><br/>The simplest example of a 3-manifold is the 3-dimensional world we live in. A little more complicated is what you obtain by cutting out a doughnut or perhaps an object with more holes. However, there are even more complicated 3-manifolds which are harder to describe. A fundamental problem in low-dimensional topology is how to tell whether two given 3-manifolds are ""the same"" or not (""the same"" has a very precise mathematical definition in this case). A 3-manifold invariant is a tool for doing this. Their construction leads one to study other fields of mathematics and theoretical physics such as representation theory (the study of matrices) and algebraic geometry (the study of systems of polynomial equations). This rich connection to other fields is one of the attractive features of this problem. <br/>"

In one direction, it may help to clarify features of the tautological ring of the moduli space of curves, to which it admits a proper morphism. In a different direction, the intersection theory of the moduli space of stable quotients has close connections with the Gromov-Witten theory of Grassmannians and complete intersections in Grassmannians, which would be interesting to understand completely.

Mathematically, their study was initiated by Mumford's construction of the moduli space of stable bundles on a smooth projective curve via geometric invariant theory.

In physics, moduli spaces of vector bundles arise naturally in the fundamental investigation of gauge theories.
