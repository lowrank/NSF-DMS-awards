This workshop is the fourth in a series of research collaboration conferences for women in number theory. The format differs from a typical conference in that much of the time is reserved for collaboration in small groups. The specific goals of this conference are: produce significant and impactful research in number theory, broaden the research programs of women in number theory, especially of those who are pre-tenure, train female graduate students and postdocs by providing experience with collaborative research and the publication process, strengthen and extend a collaborative research network of women in number theory and related fields, enable women who are faculty at small colleges to participate actively in research activities, and highlight research activities of women in number theory.<br/><br/>This workshop will support the continued development of the community of women in number theory by bringing together researchers at various stages of their careers (from graduate students to senior mathematicians) for research collaboration and mentoring. The scientific focus of the workshop is on cutting-edge topics in number theory, including Apollonian circle packings, arithmetic dynamics, the Chabauty-Coleman method, computational aspects of supersingular elliptic curves, mock modular forms, Newton polygons on the Torelli locus, sieve techniques in analytic number theory, supersingular isogeny graphs in cryptography, and torsion subgroups on elliptic <br/>curves.

For the first year of this seminar series the workshops be held at Portland State University on Saturday, October 21, 2017, at Oregon State University on Saturday, February 24, 2018, and at the University of Oregon, On Saturday, April 21, 2018. Oregon Number Theory Days are targeted primarily at regional graduate students, postdocs, and faculty in number theory located in the Willamette Valley area in the state of Oregon. Each of the host institutions operates on a schedule of three terms per year, and the goal is to hold three seminars per year, one seminar per term, over the course of three years. The speakers will be distinguished researchers in number theory, or related fields of direct interest to number theorists, who are also known to be exceptional expositors. They represent an internationally diverse group of mathematicians, speaking on a wide variety of topics, including topics that are complementary to those already studied by local number theorists in Oregon. In particular, without this seminar series, these topics are harder to access by mathematicians in Oregon. Local postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students will also be invited to speak and present their most recent research in an encouraging environment. <br/><br/>Oregon is home to a growing community of researchers and students in number theory, but it is a low-population state which is geographically isolated from the traditional major centers of activity. This poses a significant financial challenge to students and postdoctoral faculty members for travel to conferences and workshops. Oregon Number Theory Days will feature presentations by high-profile international number theory experts on current research topics, which will be of great benefit to students, postdocs, and faculty residing in Oregon. In addition, it will help build a strong sense of community among the number theory researchers within the Willamette Valley area. This seminar series will host a diverse group of participants and speakers. The organizers of Oregon Number Theory Days believe that providing a broad representation of distinguished mathematicians is an important factor in the recruitment and development of underrepresented groups in academia. Oregon Number Theory Days will welcome every interested participant, and will particularly encourage graduate students to participate. This award will primarily be used to support the traveling expenses of local graduate and postdoctoral fellows to the hosting institutions."

This field has brought about unprecedented interaction between mathematics and theoretical physics. It has been extremely successful and well studied in 3-dimensions. However, since we live in 4-dimensions (including time), a full theory of quantum gravity requires an extension of these tools to 4-dimensions. An emerging mathematical philosophy known as ""categorification"" provides an avenue to uncover a hidden layer in mathematical structures, revealing a richer and more robust theory capable of describing more complex phenomenon.  This project will use the perspective of categorification to enhance one of the most successful theories in 3-dimensions to a full 4-dimensional theory.<br/><br/>This collaboration will harness the interplay between low-dimensional geometry, representation theory, and higher-dimensional gauge theory. Through this coordinated effort the PIs will make substantial progress on the problem of categorifying 3-manifold invariants. The PIs will capitalize on recent breakthroughs in theoretical physics and higher representation theory that have created new possibilities for significant progress on this problem.  Among the techniques to be employed include:  fivebrane compactifications to provide a universal description of various old and new homological invariants of 3-manifolds, the use of infinity categories for defining tensor products of higher representations of quantum groups, and the theory of Hopfological algebra for categorifications at roots of unity, as well as recent work on odd link homology theory and categorifications of Habiro's universal invariant."

The project involves the study of ""state sums"" -- a catchall term from statistical mechanics to describe certain sums of products (typically of polynomials) -- and the study of topological quantum field theory, which arose in physics and has turned out to have connections to several areas of modern mathematics. Many important quantities in algebraic combinatorics can be computed as state sums; these are often sums over all the labelings of a quadrangulated surface with compatible tiles, like assembling a jigsaw puzzle. The remarkable fact is that these totals are frequently independent of the quadrangulation, suggesting that they may have some more fundamental definition. This project investigates a source from topological quantum field theory that might unify these state sum results, while suggesting ways to probe them more deeply. Specifically, changing a quadrangulation on a surface relates to evolving it through space, which suggests exploring both higher- and lower-dimensional analogues. This program has many subprojects suitable for graduate students in mathematics and statistical mechanics, who will be involved in the research.<br/><br/>This research program comprises two projects. The first project uses inspiration from quantum field theory and geometric representation theory in an endeavor to elucidate polynomial formulae arising in algebraic combinatorics.  Formulae for interesting polynomials often take the form of sums of products of linear polynomials. For example, the ""Schubert polynomial"" associated to a permutation can be written as a sum over certain 2-d diagrams for the permutation. The project will look more deeply into these polynomial formulae, in two steps. The first step is to see a polynomial as a matrix coefficient inside a time-evolution operator in a (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theory. Since long-time-evolution is a composite of many short-time evolutions, the matrix might be expressed as a product of simpler matrices, giving exactly the sum over products. The second step is to regard the Hilbert spaces of these quantum field theories as homology groups of certain algebraic varieties, after the manner of geometric representation theory. This would naturally imply some commutation properties of these matrices, such as the Yang-Baxter equation.  The second project aims to develop a generalization of Schubert calculus to chains of linear subspaces."

The primary impacts of the conference are its enrichment of the research careers of the participants and the dissemination of recent ideas in commutative algebra research at the graduate and postdoctoral levels. In particular, the interaction and exposure to the work of their peers will benefit students from universities with small commutative algebra research groups, those who will become faculty at small institutions, women, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.

This combination of disciplines has proved extraordinarily fruitful, having solved challenges (such as the recent proof of Fermat's last theorem) that had withstood generations of effort. The field has connections with physics, and has found important applications to the construction of error-correcting codes and cryptography. This research focuses on the study of specific polynomial equations that have many symmetries. <br/><br/>This project aims to describe integral models for Shimura varieties at primes of non-smooth reduction and will study related p-adic spaces. In particular, the work continues investigation of the singularities of Shimura varieties of abelian type at such primes. The project aims to characterize these integral models via a suitable Neron extension property and, in the case of orthogonal Shimura varieties, explicitly study the local structure of their reductions. The project also intends to give a general construction and a group theoretic definition of integral models of certain Rapoport-Zink p-adic spaces and, in some cases, fully describe their special fibers. The project additionally studies the representations that appear in the cohomology of varieties over the integers with a finite group action and aims to develop very general fixed point formulae that can be used to calculate equivariant Euler characteristics. Finally, the project explores extending constructions of Iwasawa theory by employing K-theoretic methods; more specifically, obtaining information about the higher codimension primes of the Iwasawa algebra that lie on the support of an Iwasawa module."

The idea of noncommutative geometry is to study geometry using noncommutative algebras, which are mathematical objects that have operations of addition and multiplication; however, the multiplication may not be commutative: xy does not have to equal yx. The purpose of the project is to investigate a set of mathematical problems motivated by physics. More specifically, the motivation derives from a combination of ideas from quantum mechanics, string theory, and classical areas of mathematics such as algebra and geometry.  The interdisciplinary nature of the research promotes further interaction between these fields. The project provides excellent opportunities for the investigator to work with young scientists and to exchange ideas with colleagues from other countries to promote scientific collaborations.<br/><br/>In noncommutative geometry, one studies geometry via algebras of functions on noncommutative manifolds. On such a noncommutative manifold, the relevant objects are no longer points in a space, but rather a noncommutative associative algebra, or a differential graded commutative algebra.  An important class of noncommutative manifolds can be obtained as deformations of commutative algebras.  The theory of deformation quantization lies on the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics. The mathematical structures of the two theories are very different.  Quantization, roughly speaking, is the study and prediction of quantum phenomena, which are normally described by noncommutative associative algebras, from the geometry of their underlying classical counterparts. This project will focus on the study of homotopy algebra structures in noncommutative geometry using tools from deformation quantization and Lie groupoid and Lie algebroid theory.  The problems include exploring the Duflo and Todd type class, establishing a Kontsevich-Duflo type theorem, and studying Tsygan noncommutative calculi in a general framework in terms of Lie algebroids."

Algebraic geometry studies solutions of such systems. A major feature of these systems is that they vary in families by varying the coefficients of the polynomials. Some equations in the family are easier to solve, and properties of more complicated systems can be deduced from the solutions of the simpler systems. The investigators study the geometry of certain spaces defined by polynomial equations that are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics, called moduli spaces of vector bundles. They compute geometric invariants of these spaces by relating them to simpler spaces using a recent breakthrough called Bridgeland stability. The investigators are also dedicated to training the next generation of U.S. scientists and researchers. In this project, they will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers to use the new technique of Bridgeland stability. The Focused Research Group grant will support these young researchers to visit and collaborate with several senior researchers and to attend conferences and workshops on the topic. The investigators will also organize two large conferences and four workshops to help attract young talent to the area.<br/><br/>Moduli spaces of vector bundles are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry, with applications to commutative algebra, representation theory, combinatorics, and mathematical physics. In the last five years, Bridgeland stability conditions have revolutionized the understanding of moduli spaces of vector bundles on surfaces. They have allowed the computation of the ample and effective cones of divisors on these moduli spaces and led to the solution of longstanding problems such as the existence of Lagrangian fibrations on certain hyperkähler manifolds of K3 type and the higher rank interpolation problem for general sheaves on the plane. It is timely to apply these new techniques to central problems in the geometry of moduli spaces of vector bundles on surfaces and threefolds. This Focused Research Group project centers on three lines of inquiry:<br/>(1) Prove cohomology vanishing results using Bridgeland stability and consequently construct Ulrich bundles on surfaces and threefolds and effective Brill-Noether divisors on moduli spaces of vector bundles on surfaces.

The hardware of an anyonic quantum computer will be a topological phase of matter that harbors non-abelian anyons. A physical system is in a topological phase if at low energies some physical quantities are topologically invariant. Topological properties are non-local, yet can manifest themselves through local geometric properties. The success of topological quantum computation hinges on controlling topological phases and understanding their computational power. This research addresses the mathematical, physical, and computational aspects of topological quantum computation. The projects include classification of super-modular categories, vector-valued modular forms for modular categories, extension of modular categories to three dimensions, simulation of conformal field theories, topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries and symmetry defects, and universality of topological computing models. The research has potential impacts ranging from new understanding of vertex operator algebras to the development of useful quantum computers. One specific goal is a structure theory of modular categories analogous to that of finite groups. Such a theory would lead to a structure theory of two-dimensional topological phases of matter."

These consist of graduate mini-schools, career panels, poster presentations for junior participants (including undergraduate students), and events specifically targeting members of groups that are under-represented in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a sub-field of mathematical sciences that studies solution sets of polynomial equations. It has deep connections to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as topology, arithmetic, number theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and homological algebra. At the same time algebraic geometry has found important applications in applied mathematics and computer science (computer vision, geometric complexity theory, numerical methods in algebraic statistics, etc). The centerpiece research activity of each AGNES meeting will be 7-8 invited lectures given by speakers showcasing different facets of algebraic geometry. The scientific scope of AGNES will be further expanded by lectures from neighboring mathematical subjects (such as arithmetic geometry, dynamics, complex geometry, and computational geometry) and by the various supporting activities described above.

In special cases, gauge theory is believed to underlie the mathematical description of the universe; for example, the standard model for particle physics is a gauge theory in four dimensions.  The subject also has deep links with many areas of mathematics, including partial differential equations, representation theory, algebraic geometry, differential geometry and topology. However, most research in gauge theory and almost all applications so far have focused on dimensions two, three and four.   In this project, the PI intends to push the boundary of our understanding of gauge theory in higher dimensions.  The PI's results are expected to have wide implications for geometric analysis, because the fundamental system of equations that define gauge theory (the Yang-Mills equations) poses additional challenges, in terms of controlling the solutions, that are not present in lower dimensions.  The PI's work will also have impact through integrated research and training, as the PI plans to involve undergraduates in research opportunities related to his project.<br/><br/>The PI's research project consists of three parts.  The first part of the project will extend this dictionary between gauge theory and complex algebraic geometry to the context of Hermitian-Yang Mills connections with singularities, and specifically understand the fine structure at the singularities in terms of the complex algebraic geometry of the corresponding reflexive sheaves. In the second part of this project, the PI will develop a deformation theory for a certain class of Yang-Mills connections called G2-instantons with one-dimensional singular set, and use this to construct concrete examples of singular G2-instantons from algebro-geometric input. The third part of the PI's research project will further explore the role that generalized Seiberg-Witten equations (specifically the ones discovered in joint work of Andriy Haydys and the PI) play in gauge theory in higher dimensions.  As alluded to above, the main obstacle to progress in gauge theory in higher dimension is our lack of understanding of the non-compactness issues arising from the fact that the Yang-Mills equations become super-critical starting in dimension five and leading to the formation of non-removable singularities and bubbling phenomena.  <br/>"

Valuations appear naturally in many branches of mathematics. Spaces of valuations, as a whole, capture important information, for example in connection with the problem of resolution of singularities. There are many natural ways of looking at valuations and packaging them into spaces, and each provides useful tools for studying algebraic varieties. The focus of the proposed research is on two valuation spaces: the space of arcs and the Berkovich analytification of an algebraic variety. These spaces come equipped with interesting structure and can be used to answer important mathematical questions.<br/><br/>Nash investigated the space of arcs in connection to singularities; the same space serves as the underlying space in motivic integration, and has been applied to study invariants of singularities in the minimal model program. Berkovich's non-Archimedean geometry has been used in a variety of contexts, from p-adic geometry to dynamics, geometric group theory, mirror symmetry, and tropical geometry, and most recently in birational geometry. Many interesting questions about the structure of these spaces remain open, and a better understanding of their geometry will lead to new applications. One specific goal of this project is to study the local rings on the arc space of a variety, a problem motivated by Shokurov's semicontinuity conjecture on minimal log discrepancies and therefore, indirectly, by the conjecture on termination of flips, one of the missing steps in the minimal model program. Another objective proposes a new point of view on motivic integration where Berkovich spaces are used in place of arc spaces. The project also addresses some questions about links of isolated singularities, their contact structure, and their CR structure. While these are apparently unrelated questions, there is an underlying connection between the contact structure of a link and valuation theory."

Abelian varieties are especially interesting because these spaces possess the structure of an Abelian group, that is, the points of the space can be added to each other to produce other points.  Abelian varieties appear ubiquitously in mathematics as important invariants of more complicated varieties and are therefore a crucial tool in algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory, and complex analysis.  This research project aims to understand how algebraic varieties vary in families by studying the geometry of the moduli spaces that parametrize abelian varieties and related objects.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project is concerned with hyperbolicity phenomena in locally symmetric varieties.  Some such varieties can be interpreted as moduli spaces of Hodge structures, and in those cases hyperboliciity relates to the fact that the existence of variations of those Hodge structures (for example the periods of abelian varieties or hyperkähler varieties) over a base B imposes strong conditions on the birational geometry of B.  This is closely related to conjectural uniform boundedness properties of such variations over varying bases B, which in turn strongly parallel conjectural boundedness properties exhibited by Galois representations coming from geometry over arithmetic bases.  The project aims to expand upon new techniques recently developed by the investigator and collaborators to explore such phenomena, both in the geometric and arithmetic contexts."

This makes such materials prime candidates for use in a quantum computer.  Topological quantum computation is maturing at the forefront of the second quantum revolution as a primary application of topological phases of matter. The theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution remains under development, but it appears clear that algebras and their representations will play a role analogous to that played by group theory in the first quantum revolution. This focused research group aims to formulate the theoretical foundations of topological quantum computation, leading to an eventual theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution. It is anticipated that the results of the research will guide and accelerate the construction of a topological quantum computer. A working topological quantum computer will fundamentally transform the landscape of information science and technology. The project includes participation by graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The goal of topological quantum computation is the construction of a useful quantum computer based on braiding anyons. The hardware of an anyonic quantum computer will be a topological phase of matter that harbors non-abelian anyons. A physical system is in a topological phase if at low energies some physical quantities are topologically invariant. Topological properties are non-local, yet can manifest themselves through local geometric properties. The success of topological quantum computation hinges on controlling topological phases and understanding their computational power. This research addresses the mathematical, physical, and computational aspects of topological quantum computation. The projects include classification of super-modular categories, vector-valued modular forms for modular categories, extension of modular categories to three dimensions, simulation of conformal field theories, topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries and symmetry defects, and universality of topological computing models. The research has potential impacts ranging from new understanding of vertex operator algebras to the development of useful quantum computers. One specific goal is a structure theory of modular categories analogous to that of finite groups. Such a theory would lead to a structure theory of two-dimensional topological phases of matter."

Often these equations are algebraic in nature, such as those describing lines, circles, and parabolas. Typically, the equations have infinitely many solutions -- think about the equation defining a circle -- and it is usually not possible to write down a complete list of solutions. Rather, the objective is to find ways to study the structure of the collection of the solution set, which is called a variety. A fruitful approach has been to consider the (algebraic) functions on the variety. One part of this research project addresses questions that have emerged in this endeavor. Mathematics has also been remarkably successful in describing and studying phenomenon related to symmetry. This leads to a mathematical structure called a group. Intriguingly, in certain contexts, there is a way to attach a variety to a group, and in the past few years various researchers, including the investigator, have been able to solve problems related to groups using tools that had been developed to study varieties. A part of the current project deals with these aspects.<br/><br/>This research is rooted in commutative algebra, with applications also to the representation theory of finite group schemes in positive characteristic. The first part of the project concerns the homological aspects of modules over commutative rings. The problems posed range from those that have arisen from the internal developments in the subject to ones inspired by recent advances in the broader mathematical context, notably the representation theory of algebras and homotopy theory. The focus in the second part of the project is on the Hochschild cohomology of commutative algebras. Classically, Hochschild cohomology has been of interest for it is one of two main cohomology theories that capture properties of the diagonal morphism. A different aspect of Hochschild cohomology has begun to play an increasingly important role: Its action on derived categories, and various triangulated categories. The problems proposed in the second part of the project address both aspects. In recent years, notions and techniques from commutative ring theory have proved to be remarkably effective in solving problems in, and shedding new light on, the representation theory of finite groups over a field of positive characteristic. This project will develop these connections in new directions."

Some of the most important and universal examples include symmetric groups, which arise from symmetries of finite sets, and general linear groups, which arise from symmetries of finite-dimensional vector spaces; both of these examples are a particular focus for this project. Classical representation theory studies groups (and related algebras) by focusing on how they act on other mathematical objects, such as topological spaces. Informally, a representation is a snap-shot of the underlying group (or algebra) taken from a particular vantage point. In the last decade or so, the idea of categorification has become extremely important in this general area and has led to the development of what is now known as higher representation theory. This involves actions of groups on mathematical structures called categories, utilizing not only the relations between these structures (functors) but also relations between these relations (natural transformations). It is a burgeoning area with many applications inside and outside of mathematics, including finite group theory, ring theory, combinatorics, Lie theory, category theory, representation theory, knot theory, and even computer science and theoretical physics.<br/><br/>This project will study some important and rich categories appearing in representation theory arising from symmetric groups, general linear groups, and related Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras. The project reflects the recent trend towards higher representation theory. There is special emphasis on monoidal categories and categorical Kac-Moody actions. At the same time, the project is firmly rooted in important classical problems in representation theory, such as Broue's Abelian Defect Group Conjecture for finite groups, and the study of maximal subgroups of finite simple groups. Several parts of the project are concerned with the study of derived equivalences between blocks of naturally occurring categories in representation theory, and exploit braid group actions on derived categories. One part of the project is of a more foundational nature, developing the general theoretical framework of highest weight categories in a new direction."

Representation theory has been an essential tool in quantum physics almost from its inception, providing for example the structure of atomic orbitals. Gauge theories, quantum theories built directly out of the structure of local symmetry, are the language of much of high energy physics, in particular the Standard Model, which describes all the fundamental forces besides gravity. Gauge theory in turn has had a tremendous impact on low dimensional topology and geometry. This project is concerned with the reversal of the relationship between representation theory and gauge theory: applying the structure of gauge theory as a powerful organizing framework for representation theory in the abstract. In this paradigm, different representation theories are encoded by different models of gauge theory, and inherit a radically new and uniform structure from the behavior of observables and defects in gauge theory. Thus the fundamental symmetries of nature become powerful tools to understand the most abstract questions in algebra and analysis -- in particular some of the deepest structures we know in algebra (the Langlands program, responsible for the resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem) derive from the symmetry between electricity and magnetism. These connections and synergies will be developed under this project, both in the PI's research and in his extensive expository work, including writing a graduate text introducing this paradigm to a broader audience for the first time.<br/><br/>Gauge theories are quantum field theories built directly out of local Lie group symmetry. Conversely, one can view many aspects of representation theory of Lie groups through the lens of gauge theory, which provides a powerful organizing principle for representation theory through the medium of low-dimensional topology. The object of this project is to develop and disseminate the perspective of representation theory as gauge theory. The project details two primary research projects inspired by developments in gauge theory. The first is the exploitation of a new source of commutative symmetry algebras in geometric representation theory inspired by Seiberg-Witten geometry of gauge theory and uncovered in the PI's recent work. The PI will apply spectral decomposition with respect to these symmetries in a variety of contexts, including Lusztig's theory of character sheaves, the homology of character varieties of surfaces, and the geometric Langlands correspondence. The second is the development of the new ""Betti"" (or topological) form of the Geometric Langlands Correspondence introduced by the PI, which he intends to reduce to elementary building blocks by proving an ""automorphic Verlinde formula."" The case of genus one appears accessible, and has implications for much-studied topics in representation theory. In addition the PI intends to engage in extensive expository writing, including a graduate text and interdisciplinary expository work with theoretical high energy physicists."

Since noncommutative algebras have been used extensively, this project will deepen the understanding of other mathematical areas including noncommutative algebraic geometry, commutative algebra and mathematical physics.<br/><br/>A central theme of the proposal is the noncommutative McKay correspondence, a concept motivated by the classical McKay correspondence that has recently been extended to several new areas. Specific topics include noncommutative quotient singularities of Hopf algebra actions on Artin-Schelter regular algebras; skew Calabi-Yau property and the Nakayama automorphism of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras; and the noncommutative discriminant of algebras which are module-finite over their center. The PI has introduced a number of invariants with fruitful applications in the study of automorphism groups and locally nilpotent derivations of noncommutative algebras, as well as the noncommutative Zariski cancellation problem. The PI will continue to search for distinct invariants of noncommutative algebras, to develop foundations for new research directions, and to work on central open questions in the field. The noncommutative McKay correspondence is one essential guideline for the interplay between noncommutative algebra, Hopf algebra and theory of quantum groups, noncommutative invariant theory, and noncommutative algebraic geometry."

Mathematically, this is the study of invertible, property-preserving transformations from an object to itself.  It is understood that the symmetries of objects we can visualize (for instance, classical objects such as spaces or manifolds or the functions on such objects) form mathematical structures known as groups.  On the other hand, only recently has an appropriate notion of symmetry been developed for quantum objects and their noncommutative algebras of functions, which have been ubiquitous in mathematics and physics since the origin of quantum mechanics. It has been discovered that replacing group actions with actions of Hopf algebras is a natural and effective approach.  The goal of this research project is to deepen and extend understanding of such quantum symmetries.<br/><br/>This project will advance comprehensively the analysis and applications of quantum symmetry, including tackling the basic question:  for a given algebra A, when do genuine Hopf algebra actions on A exist? Moreover, ring-theoretic, homological, and representation-theoretic properties of the Hopf algebras (or quantum groups) that ""coact universally"" on A will be studied. Beyond the setting of Hopf algebra actions, the investigator will employ the framework of tensor categories to study the occurrence of quantum symmetry, as they serve as a natural categorification of Hopf algebras; one benefit of this framework is that it handles actions of generalized (e.g., weak, quasi) Hopf algebras as well."

It lays the necessary foundation for other branches of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory and algebraic topology. This conference is devoted to the recent research activities on the interplay between Noncommutative Algebra with Invariant Theory, Representation Theory, and Algebraic Geometry. Many recent conferences in these areas of algebra have focused on parts of these connections, but this conference will be unique in that it will feature talks on a large variety of topics.  The conference will feature over 20 lectures from world-renowned experts, and should attract around 75-100 participants from the international mathematics community. In addition to regular talks by experts, the conference will feature a poster session as a networking opportunity for junior participants. Funding will be prioritized for junior participants and for women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This conference will bring together research leaders in Noncommutative Algebra, whose expertise have connections to Invariant Theory, Representation Theory, and Algebraic Geometry. Focus topic areas include:  algebraic deformation theory; cluster algebras and cluster categories; Hopf algebras and their actions on algebras; noncommutative invariant theory; noncommutative projective algebraic geometry; noncommutative resolutions of singularities; and  Poisson algebras and Calabi-Yau algebras.

Oregon Number Theory Days are targeted primarily at regional graduate students, postdocs, and faculty in number theory located in the Willamette Valley area in the state of Oregon. Each of the host institutions operates on a schedule of three terms per year, and the goal is to hold three seminars per year, one seminar per term, over the course of three years. The speakers will be distinguished researchers in number theory, or related fields of direct interest to number theorists, who are also known to be exceptional expositors. They represent an internationally diverse group of mathematicians, speaking on a wide variety of topics, including topics that are complementary to those already studied by local number theorists in Oregon. In particular, without this seminar series, these topics are harder to access by mathematicians in Oregon. Local postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students will also be invited to speak and present their most recent research in an encouraging environment. <br/><br/>Oregon is home to a growing community of researchers and students in number theory, but it is a low-population state which is geographically isolated from the traditional major centers of activity. This poses a significant financial challenge to students and postdoctoral faculty members for travel to conferences and workshops. Oregon Number Theory Days will feature presentations by high-profile international number theory experts on current research topics, which will be of great benefit to students, postdocs, and faculty residing in Oregon. In addition, it will help build a strong sense of community among the number theory researchers within the Willamette Valley area. This seminar series will host a diverse group of participants and speakers. The organizers of Oregon Number Theory Days believe that providing a broad representation of distinguished mathematicians is an important factor in the recruitment and development of underrepresented groups in academia. Oregon Number Theory Days will welcome every interested participant, and will particularly encourage graduate students to participate. This award will primarily be used to support the traveling expenses of local graduate and postdoctoral fellows to the hosting institutions."

An emerging mathematical philosophy known as ""categorification"" provides an avenue to uncover a hidden layer in mathematical structures, revealing a richer and more robust theory capable of describing more complex phenomenon.  This project will use the perspective of categorification to enhance one of the most successful theories in 3-dimensions to a full 4-dimensional theory.<br/><br/>This collaboration will harness the interplay between low-dimensional geometry, representation theory, and higher-dimensional gauge theory. Through this coordinated effort the PIs will make substantial progress on the problem of categorifying 3-manifold invariants.

Among the techniques to be employed include:  fivebrane compactifications to provide a universal description of various old and new homological invariants of 3-manifolds, the use of infinity categories for defining tensor products of higher representations of quantum groups, and the theory of Hopfological algebra for categorifications at roots of unity, as well as recent work on odd link homology theory and categorifications of Habiro's universal invariant."

The basic arithmetic problems in question are finding, counting, and understanding the distribution of integer (or rational) solutions to algebraic equations that arise naturally in mathematics. The simplicity and intrinsic beauty of these problems, and the disproportionate depth and effort of their resolution, has inspired their study since ancient Greece. In many cases, the symmetries of the algebraic equations in question have a rich geometric and analytic structure. Using this structure it is possible to translate the arithmetic problems into geometric and dynamic problems on spaces of symmetries. Understanding how the arithmetic features of a problem manifest in the geometry of the corresponding space creates a link between arithmetic and geometric phenomena, and advances knowledge in both fields. The research in this proposal is complemented by educational and outreach activities, including the creation of a summer research workshop and a graduate seminar on analytic number theory.<br/><br/>The PI will study two types of problems in homogenous dynamics, both originating  from arithmetic. The first type of problems are shrinking target problems for unipotent flows on homogenous spaces. Shrinking target problems for diagonalizable group actions on homogenous spaces are very well understood. The corresponding problems for unipotent flows (as well as other slow mixing actions) are not yet understood, except for some special arithmetic cases. The PI will use methods from spectral theory and analytic number theory, in combination with methods of homogenous dynamics and ergodic theory, in order to analyze shrinking target problems for unipotent flows and their applications to the classical field of metric Diophantine approximations.  The second type of problems regards the distribution of translates of closed orbits on homogenous spaces. The study of the distribution of translates of closed subgroup-orbits is an interesting problem with many applications. When the orbits are compact, or of finite measure, there are a number of techniques to study the limiting distribution of their translates, and these can be applied to study the classical problem of distribution of integer points in algebraic varieties; they are also amenable to more analytic applications in the study of L-functions of automorphic forms. The PI will extend such results to orbits of infinite measure, with an emphasis on cases having interesting arithmetic applications."

Number theory is discrete and geometry is continuous, but continuous structures can be fruitfully approximated by discrete structures through finer and finer approximations.

In this way, number theory connects with discrete geometric structures, via packings, leading to connections with problems in materials science. Certain finite discrete models in large sizes have parallels with exactly solvable models in physics that exhibit phase transitions when a temperature parameter is varied, as between water and ice. The projects in this proposal investigate a number of specific problems related to these analogies in order to bridge the discrete and the continuous in various limits. This work will lead to fruitful interactions with researchers in geometry, physics and material science and will support the training of graduate students in number theory and in discrete geometry.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will investigate several topics relating number theory and geometry. The first, and main, topic continues the investigation of the Lerch zeta function, which is a function of three variables, that on specializing variables yields both the Hurwitz zeta function and the Riemann zeta function. This research is based on a recently discovered connection between these functions and representations of the real Heisenberg group and related solvable groups. The project will study generalizations of the Lerch zeta function to automorphic representations of various higher-dimensional Lie groups, via zeta integrals. A second topic concerns the study of various discrete finite models of arithmetic structures, typically with two variables, and the study of statistics of such models as their size increases, pursuing an analogy with integrable systems in statistical mechanics. A third topic concerns intra-universal Teichmuller theory introduced by Mochizuki. This new theory will be reformulated from a more accessible analytic perspective.

Algebraic geometry studies solutions of such systems. A major feature of these systems is that they vary in families by varying the coefficients of the polynomials. Some equations in the family are easier to solve, and properties of more complicated systems can be deduced from the solutions of the simpler systems. The investigators study the geometry of certain spaces defined by polynomial equations that are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics, called moduli spaces of vector bundles. They compute geometric invariants of these spaces by relating them to simpler spaces using a recent breakthrough called Bridgeland stability. The investigators are also dedicated to training the next generation of U.S. scientists and researchers. In this project, they will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers to use the new technique of Bridgeland stability.

It is timely to apply these new techniques to central problems in the geometry of moduli spaces of vector bundles on surfaces and threefolds.

The two areas were first linked by the surprising and still largely conjectural resemblance between the local distribution of zeros of L-functions -- these are certain functions which are of central interest in analytic number theory -- and the distribution of eigenvalues of a random matrix. In fact, distributions of this sort have been found in a diverse range of situations, and it is an important problem to understand why these distributions arise so universally. <br/><br/>In more detail, the project consists of two related parts. The first is to study the link between zeros of L-functions and eigenvalues of random matrices by making use of combinatorial decompositions of arithmetic functions; analogous decompositions can be found in a function field setting and have shed light on related problems there. The second part is to investigate the extent to which certain pseudo-random walks on compact matrix groups equidistribute in the same fashion as classical random walks do; results pertaining to this second project have recently been used to resolve open questions about the distribution of certain trigonometric polynomials. The two components of the project share in common the use they make of combinatorial representation theory and also their study of sequences of random variables that are weakly dependent, with a dependence characterized by arithmetic/combinatorial considerations."

The emphasis of the conference will be on recent spectacular developments in the theory of Drinfeld moduli spaces, Drinfeld modular forms, and their applications. It is hoped that having at the same place and time a large number of researchers  with different viewpoints on function field arithmetic will illuminate previously unnoticed connections within the area, thus facilitating future progress.

Over the last few years, there has been an explosion of activity in function field arithmetic, with many spectacular results on special values of higher derivatives of L-functions of automorphic forms, special values of Carlitz-Goss L-functions, and Drinfeld modular forms. Moreover, new tantalizing connections have been discovered between different topics of function field arithmetic, such as special values of characteristic p zeta functions, deformations of Drinfeld modular forms, and function field analogue of Fontaine's theory. In many of these works, Drinfeld moduli spaces play a prominent role. <br/>These developments, along with possible future directions of research, will be addressed by the invited speakers of this conference with the hope to inspire new generations to take part in this important and very active area of Number Theory. <br/><br/>Conference website: http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/sfb878/activities/AFF_announce.html"

More specifically, it focuses on the study of automorphic forms. Automorphic forms are a very special class of functions that form an important bridge connecting the discrete objects of algebraic number theory and the continuous objects of analytic number theory. Automorphic forms are used as tools to study number theoretic functions, e.g. by measuring their rates of growth, discovering formulas for them, or proving relations that they satisfy. Classically, special values of automorphic forms provided the solution to Kronecker's problem for extensions of the rational numbers that do not lie in the real line. More recently, automorphic forms played a pivotal role in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. This project aims to further explore the connection of automorphic forms to other mathematical structures.<br/><br/>The main object of the proposed research is to further understand and exploit the relationship between automorphic forms and quadratic number fields. This relationship is exceedingly rich and unites the study of diverse objects such as Heegner points, closed geodesics, the hyperbolic Laplacian, Kloosterman sums, L-functions and class fields. The theory for imaginary quadratic fields is in general better developed and simpler, especially in relation to class field theory. The investigators will concentrate mostly on the real quadratic case. In one direction, they will study some new geometric invariants associated to real quadratic fields that were introduced recently. These invariants are certain surfaces that are bounded by modular closed geodesics. The investigators will study the distribution of the areas of the surfaces, especially as this relates to ideal classes and also investigate some new geometric problems about the closed geodesics. They plan to express various invariants for real quadratic fields (such as surface integrals of modular functions) in terms of the Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms. This naturally leads to problems involving sums of Kloosterman sums and to extensions of recent work on uniform estimates for such sums."

The typical mathematical framework in which geometric entities (such as the 4-dimensional space-time that underlies the general theory of relativity) can be studied algebraically needs to be enlarged and generalized if it is to be reconciled with quantum phenomena. In the resulting setup, the symmetries of a physical system (in the sense of structure-preserving transformations) sometimes need to be discarded and replaced with new and more exotic notions of symmetry. The mathematical embodiment of these exotic symmetries are known as ""quantum groups,"" and they are the main focus of this project. Much of what can be taken for granted in the context of ""plain"" geometry and actions of ordinary transformations on ordinary spaces becomes problematic in the noncommutative setting. This research project aims to shed light on a number of these problems, in a range of subfields within the larger realm of noncommutative geometry. <br/><br/>This project investigates several aspects of noncommutative geometry that revolve around the notion of quantum symmetry. This involves studying quantum groups, their representation theory, and their actions on algebraic and geometric structures, as well as attendant problems in non-commutative algebraic geometry. One goal is to further understand the phenomenon of quantum rigidity, whereby certain structures admit no truly quantum symmetries. What this means is that whenever a sufficiently well-behaved Hopf algebra (which is the algebraic embodiment of a quantum group) coacts in a structure-preserving manner, the coaction factors through one by the function algebra on an ordinary group. Many special cases of this are known (integral affine algebraic varieties, certain smooth non-commutative projective algebraic varieties, compact connected smooth manifolds, certain classes of metric spaces, etc.), but the general phenomenon is poorly understood. Another goal is to attempt to transport tools and concepts specific to discrete or reductive algebraic groups (such as Borel subgroups, maximal tori, weight systems, compactifications, residual finiteness, linearity) over to quantum groups in order to further elucidate their structure and representation theory. Finally, symmetry considerations allow for the construction of new examples of smooth noncommutative projective schemes that in some sense behave generically within the moduli spaces that classify such schemes. The representation theory of the corresponding algebras would then shed light into the nature of these moduli spaces that are at the moment not well understood."

This makes such materials prime candidates for use in a quantum computer.  Topological quantum computation is maturing at the forefront of the second quantum revolution as a primary application of topological phases of matter. The theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution remains under development, but it appears clear that algebras and their representations will play a role analogous to that played by group theory in the first quantum revolution. This focused research group aims to formulate the theoretical foundations of topological quantum computation, leading to an eventual theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution. It is anticipated that the results of the research will guide and accelerate the construction of a topological quantum computer. A working topological quantum computer will fundamentally transform the landscape of information science and technology. The project includes participation by graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The goal of topological quantum computation is the construction of a useful quantum computer based on braiding anyons. The hardware of an anyonic quantum computer will be a topological phase of matter that harbors non-abelian anyons. A physical system is in a topological phase if at low energies some physical quantities are topologically invariant. Topological properties are non-local, yet can manifest themselves through local geometric properties. The success of topological quantum computation hinges on controlling topological phases and understanding their computational power. This research addresses the mathematical, physical, and computational aspects of topological quantum computation. The projects include classification of super-modular categories, vector-valued modular forms for modular categories, extension of modular categories to three dimensions, simulation of conformal field theories, topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries and symmetry defects, and universality of topological computing models. The research has potential impacts ranging from new understanding of vertex operator algebras to the development of useful quantum computers. One specific goal is a structure theory of modular categories analogous to that of finite groups. Such a theory would lead to a structure theory of two-dimensional topological phases of matter."

Indeed, parametrizations are often the most efficient way to render geometric objects as screen images. Mathematicians have developed a rich theory for deciding when such parametrizations are possible. This project will advance this theory.<br/><br/>An algebraic variety is rational if it can be obtained from projective space by a sequence of algebraic modifications. Given a family of smooth complex projective varieties, it is difficult to say which members are rational or irrational, or even to formulate qualitative results about the locus of rational members. The PI will use the technique of decomposition of the diagonal, and related tools from deformation theory, Hodge theory and classical geometry, to shed light on this question. The PI and his collaborators have recently shown that rationality is not a deformation invariant property: There are families of smooth complex projective varieties with both rational and irrational members. Despite examples, like cubic fourfolds, that have been extensively studied, there are no cases where the loci of rational and irrational members have been precisely described. The PI will refine and make effective the decomposition of the diagonal technique to clarify which members of a family are irrational - can they be expressed in Hodge-theoretic terms? At the same time, the PI will advance constructive techniques to exhibit rational and unirational parametrizations with prescribed properties."

The simplest manifestation of representation theory is in dimensional analysis, as in ""the way to combine a distance L and a time T into a quantity with dimension velocity is to take L/T;"" in this example, rescaling the units of measure becomes a symmetry. In general, analyzing symmetries of physical systems leads to a very fine-grained analysis of how different components of a system may interact. Classical representation theory gives simple and beautiful results by focusing on the question of decomposing systems into components that do not interact between themselves (semisimplicity). Another way to decompose systems is to create a hierarchy of components, with ""larger"" components affecting ""smaller"" components, but no interaction in the other direction (as in a particle with negligible mass orbiting a planet). Nowadays many examples are known of types of symmetry for which we can obtain a complete description of possible hierarchies forced by these symmetries. This project will develop new ways to understand these hierarchies and the resulting interactions.<br/><br/>In more detail, the main goal of this project is to study large categories appearing in representation theory of Lie superalgebras, algebraic supergroups, and infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, focusing on applications to the theory of abstract tensor categories. Key objectives include the construction of particular large limits of categories of representations, describing them as universal (in a certain sense) tensor categories, and extracting from universality a detailed description of these categories of representations. Via these connections with large tensor categories, categorification, and duality, this work aims to contribute to the solution of longstanding classical questions about representations of supergroups, such as the computation of characters, dimension formulae, and Kazhdan--Lusztig theory. A second goal of the project is geometric: to generalize the theory of spherical varieties to the super case. The theory of spherical varieties is a beautiful mix of algebraic geometry and representation theory. The question of developing an analogous theory for supergroups is complicated because of the lack of semisimplicity. Finally, questions of harmonic analysis, such as decomposing the space of functions and describing the spectra of invariant differential operators, are essential in modern theoretical physics. A third goal of the project is to develop an approach to these questions via theory of supersymmetric polynomials and supergeometry."

The specific parts include (respectively): (1) developing and applying analogues for smooth toric varieties of foundational homological results for projective space, (2) determining how to track and compute invariant syzygies in infinite settings with a suitable monoid or group action, and (3) generalizing a homological framework for hypergeometric systems of PDEs from the setting of a torus action to that of a reductive group. The project will yield new sets of tools for shedding light on the underlying geometry and group actions present, by aiding in the computation of important algebro-geometric and PDE invariants."

Since mid-1990s, various mathematicians have conjectured that an explicit construction of certain four-dimensional topological field theories (4d TQFTs) should exist, the discovery of which will enhance our mathematical understanding of four-dimensional quantum physics. The objective of this project is to develop an accessible approach towards explicitly realizing such 4d TQFTs. The 4d TQFTs will admit combinatorial descriptions and be computable in practice for applications. They are related to, yet more subtle than, an earlier construction in dimension three. The project naturally fits into a larger program of relating certain three-dimensional field theories and four-dimensional ones by a process called categorification, where ""shadow"" concepts in three dimensions are replaced by richer structures in four dimensions. The higher structures obtained can be utilized to resolve problems in lower dimensions. In addition, algebraic structures will be developed along the the way that it will shed new light on topics in classical algebraic studies.<br/><br/>In more detail, this is a project to investigate categorifications of quantum groups at prime roots of unity, and their categorical representation theory. This constitutes part of a long term program to categorify the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev three-dimensional topological quantum field theory, producing a four-dimensional theory. The existence of such liftings of topological quantum field theories by categorification was conjectured by Crane and Frenkel in 1994. A key ingredient in this program is to find a categorical enhancement of certain link homology theories, such as Khovanov homology, at prime roots of unity. The project will be carried out by further developing a recently introduced generalized homological algebraic theory called ""hopfological algebra."" Incorporating this newly developed hopfological theory into earlier works on categorified representation theory of quantum group at a prime root of unity will allow one to explicitly construct hopfological invariant for links and 3-manifolds, thereby explicitly lifting Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev's three-dimensional topological quantum field theorys via categorification. In the process, categorified representation theory of quantum groups a prime root of unity will be investigated, together with their new hopofological features."

Recently the PI has found a way to construct motives with exceptional Galois groups using automorphic forms and the geometric Langlands correspondence.  This idea will be systematically developed in the following years and will have applications to the classical inverse Galois problem.  The PI will also use moduli spaces of Hitchin type to study representations of rational Cherednik algebras, enumeration of Galois representations, and global analogs of Lusztig's character sheaves.<br/><br/>In mathematics, it is a general rule that the most interesting symmetries should arise geometrically.  For example, the ancient classification of Platonic solids is seen nowadays as an instance of finding all 'finite symmetries' in three-dimensional space.  With the revolution of algebraic geometry in the second half of the 20th century, we now have powerful geometric tools available to solve classical and new problems in number theory and group theory. The PI will use these geometric tools to attack problems in the Langlands program.  In the 70s, Langlands made a series of conjectures which links arithmetic invariants (e.g., solutions to Diophantine equations) to analytic invariants (e.g., modular forms).  The predictions that Langlands made, if proved, will be extremely powerful in solving classical problems (including the Fermat Problem which was solved in this way).  Through this project, the PI hopes to shed light on some problems in the Langlands program and to discover more symmetries that appear in geometry."

The research supported by this award will center on using modern degeneration techniques, especially those from the field of tropical geometry, to study classical spaces from algebraic geometry. The main goal of tropical geometry is transforming questions about algebraic varieties into questions about polyhedral complexes. A process called tropicalization attaches a polyhedral complex to an algebraic variety. The polyhedral complex, a combinatorial object, encodes some of the geometry of the original algebraic variety. The research develops further tools for the study of algebraic varieties in terms of their so called ""nonarchimedean analytification"". Overall this project will refine, abstract, and generalize these new methods and explore deeper applications to open problems in algebraic geometry. In conjunction with this research program, the PI will continue to direct the SUMRY program for undergraduate research in mathematics at Yale, providing not only research opportunities for the undergraduate participants, but also mentorship opportunities for the graduate students and postdocs leading small group projects. <br/><br/>The PI will extend the tropical independence methods developed in proofs of the Gieseker-Petri theorem and the maximal rank conjecture for quadrics, developing new notions of tropicalization of linear series and combining piecewise linear methods with reduction of rational functions to pursue further progress toward the maximal rank conjecture and strong maximal rank conjecture. He will continue his work using the combinatorial topology of moduli spaces of stable tropical curves to extract information about the top weight cohomology of moduli spaces of curves, looking for additional structures such as hidden filtrations whose graded pieces are representation stable with respect to the action induced by permutation of the marked points. The PI also aims to develop foundations for a tropical theory of vector bundles, by generalizing the theory of convergence Newton polygons for vector bundles with connection on algebraic curves to vector bundles with integrable connections on higher dimensional varieties, using toric vector bundles as a test case.  <br/><br/>"

A general form of the question asks: Given an approximate solution, is there necessarily also an exact solution that is close to the approximate solution? This question has been studied intensively in many directions, with answers depending on the specific system and the exact meaning of ""approximate solution"" and ""close."" The current research project develops such a theory for equations in sets of permutations. This case is of special interest for two reasons: Firstly, it can be interpreted as a ""local testability"" question, a subject of great interest in computer science. Namely, it is part of a series of problems of the following flavor: a very large string of letters is given, and one wants to check its properties by knowing only a few of the letters. A second reason is that it turns out that the question under study in this project is intimately related to some deep concepts in abstract algebra. It is thus a project of a very interdisciplinary nature, involving a blend of several areas of mathematics and computer science.<br/><br/>In more detail, the project deals with property testing within group theory. Property testing is a direction of research in computer science that looks for methods to check a property of a given object, say a long vector of 0's and 1's, by looking only at a small number of random bits of it.  The following question is of this type. Given a word w(X,Y) built from elements X and Y of the symmetric group of permutations on a set T, assume that for two permutations A and B, w(A,B) leaves unchanged some randomly selected elements of T. Can it be inferred that w(A,B) is the identity, or at least, that A and B are close to a pair of permutations A' and B' for which w(A',B') is the identity? It turns out that the answer to this question depends only on the structure of the (usually infinite) group whose presentation by generators and relations is given by these words. This suggests a concept of testability (or stability) in group theory. The main objective of this project is to develop a set of tools to determine which groups are testable and which are not. The project will also explore connections with amenability, Kazhdan's Property (T), and sofic groups."

The former two branches of mathematics originate from physics, while the last deals with applications of purely algebraic concepts to geometry. Representation theory concerns the study of symmetries of a vector space such as our three-dimensional space (more generally, an infinite dimensional space) with additional structures. These symmetries can be often thought of as algebraic structures. The following two cases are of particular interest: (1) the case of pair-wise commuting symmetries, when sufficiently many exist, is of central importance in the study of integrable systems; (2) the case when the underlying vector space arises from geometric objects is of central importance in geometric representation theory. In this project the principal investigator plans to explore these concepts in the particular cases of algebras known as quantum toroidal algebras and affine Yangians. These associative algebras can be viewed as deformations of Lie algebras and provide generalizations of the classical quantum affine algebras and Yangians that have been studied extensively in recent decades. <br/><br/>This project is devoted to the study of quantum toroidal algebras and affine Yangians. The PI's plan is as follows: (1) Develop shuffle realizations of all quantum toroidal/affine algebras of ADE type. (2) Unify all known different constructions of their representations and provide a wider class of shuffle type modules. (3) Study the maximal commutative subalgebras of quantum toroidal algebras via the shuffle realization, and develop a new (shuffle) approach to the well-known Bethe ansatz problem, concerning diagonalization of such maximal commutative subalgebras in interesting classes of representations. (4) Relate the aforementioned maximal commutative subalgebras to the study of quantum cohomology and quantum K-theory of Nakajima quiver varieties and affine Laumon spaces. (5) Generalize all the above to the additive case of affine Yangians. (6) Study quantizations of the shift of the argument algebras corresponding to all vertices of the ""degeneration"" rhombus and describe the relation of these algebras to the right hand sides of the KZ equation and Casimir equation rhombi."

In the last ten to fifteen years there has been a drive to understand a more general question: Find primes in integer sequences associated to infinite groups of symmetries of finite-dimensional spaces. Formulation of this general question followed the realization that many fundamental integer sequences are connected to groups of symmetries, for example the entries of Pythagorean triples, curvatures appearing in Apollonian circle packings, and the denominators of continued fractions formed using only a finite alphabet. In many important cases, the relevant group of symmetries is 'thin,' meaning that it is sparser than expected, and hence is not subject to classical techniques. As a result, new technology that draws on many different areas of mathematics has been developed to treat questions about thin groups and their associated integer sequences. The research in this project will study primes in integer sequences that arise in the study of moduli spaces. A moduli space is a mathematical object that encodes all geometric structures of a given type on an object, up to natural identifications. Moduli spaces often have associated groups of symmetries. These are built from integers, and so invite many intriguing number theoretic questions. In fact, these symmetry groups are sometimes thin, giving surprising new applications of the theory of thin groups. <br/><br/>The PI will study two types of counting problems. The first concerns the number fields associated to periodic orbits of the Teichmueller flow on moduli spaces of abelian differentials. The PI has recently generalized Selberg's 3/16 Theorem to higher genus moduli spaces. This result will be used to obtain a congruence count for periodic orbits of the Teichmueller flow. In addition, Selberg's Theorem will be extended to affine invariant submanifolds of moduli space. The second type of problem concerns the Markoff-Hurwitz affine variety and its automorphism group. The PI will study the prime factors of the coordinates of integer points on this variety by obtaining congruence lattice point counting estimates and using sieve methods. This requires understanding the orbits of the automorphism group on the points of the variety over finite fields, and extensions of this question to square-free moduli. Questions about the statistics of the series of permutations obtained by the actions of a fixed global automorphism on the points on the variety over various finite fields will be studied. These questions are related to surprising numerical results obtained in collaboration with undergraduate students."

Algebraic geometry studies solutions of such systems. A major feature of these systems is that they vary in families by varying the coefficients of the polynomials. Some equations in the family are easier to solve, and properties of more complicated systems can be deduced from the solutions of the simpler systems. The investigators study the geometry of certain spaces defined by polynomial equations that are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics, called moduli spaces of vector bundles. They compute geometric invariants of these spaces by relating them to simpler spaces using a recent breakthrough called Bridgeland stability. The investigators are also dedicated to training the next generation of U.S. scientists and researchers. In this project, they will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers to use the new technique of Bridgeland stability. The Focused Research Group grant will support these young researchers to visit and collaborate with several senior researchers and to attend conferences and workshops on the topic.

It is timely to apply these new techniques to central problems in the geometry of moduli spaces of vector bundles on surfaces and threefolds.

The celebrated proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by A. Wiles, for instance, uses early results in the Langlands program proved by Langlands and Tunnell.

The second part of the project is about converse problems. Converse problems aim to recover modular/automorphic forms from their Fourier coefficients. For example, the famous converse theorems of Hecke and Weil give sufficient conditions for a Dirichlet series to be the Mellin transform of a modular form.

Now group theorists are interested not just in decidability of various problems but in specific low-complexity estimates. Various data compression techniques (such as straight-line programs, power circuits, etc.) have found amazing applications to group-theoretic decision problems. In turn, geometric group theory has repaid in kind and produced powerful ideas that have found applications in computer science and computability theory. Thus, the notion of ""generic-case complexity"" as a way of capturing the practical behavior of an algorithm on ""most"" inputs (and distinct from average-case complexity) was born in geometric group theory. This notion has led to the development of the theory of coarse and generic computability in computational complexity, which is now transforming that subject. The ideas of CAT(0) cubical geometry, coming from geometric group theory, are finding useful applications in computational topology, robotics, and computer science. The conference aims to take stock of these developments and map possible future venues of interaction between geometric group theory, computer science and computability theory. <br/><br/>More detailed information can be found at the conference website, http://web.stevens.edu/algebraic/Schupp/"

The PI will extend their work to higher dimensions.<br/><br/>Shimura varieties have proven to be fundamental objects in modern day arithmetic geometry and number theory, with applications ranging from Langlands reciprocity to the understanding of abelian varieties and K3 surfaces to instances of the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture (through the Gross-Zagier formula). The main purpose of this project is to study a special class of such Shimura varieties, attached to orthogonal groups, which are simple enough to be accessible, yet carry rich arithmetic information. Steve Kudla, along with his collaborators, has formulated a series of wide ranging conjectures on the intersection theory of these varieties, both classical and arithmetic (in the Arakelov sense), relating them to special values and Fourier coefficients of certain L-functions and Eisenstein series (and their derivatives). The key part of this project is concerned with proving some new cases of these conjectures, through the study of integral models of orthogonal Shimura varieties and their properties. Among other things, the eventual results of the work of the PI and his collaborators should yield a proof of a conjectural formula of P. Colmez on the heights of CM abelian varieties."

AGNES is a semi-annual algebraic geometry meeting organized at a rotating location by an association of northeastern universities. A guiding goal of AGNES is to introduce graduate students to a broad spectrum of current research in algebraic geometry. While meeting this goal, AGNES has become an important center for algebraic geometry in the US. The conference has an extensive record of promoting collaboration and has developed new tools for training and mentoring future leaders in algebraic geometry. These consist of graduate mini-schools, career panels, poster presentations for junior participants (including undergraduate students), and events specifically targeting members of groups that are under-represented in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometry is a sub-field of mathematical sciences that studies solution sets of polynomial equations. It has deep connections to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as topology, arithmetic, number theory, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and homological algebra. At the same time algebraic geometry has found important applications in applied mathematics and computer science (computer vision, geometric complexity theory, numerical methods in algebraic statistics, etc). The centerpiece research activity of each AGNES meeting will be 7-8 invited lectures given by speakers showcasing different facets of algebraic geometry. The scientific scope of AGNES will be further expanded by lectures from neighboring mathematical subjects (such as arithmetic geometry, dynamics, complex geometry, and computational geometry) and by the various supporting activities described above.

An amazing fact is that collections of varieties of certain type inside another bigger one are themselves varieties. The study of such collections of varieties provides not only powerfully tools to study problems in geometry in mathematics, but also useful methods to extract invariants interesting to physicists. The main topic of this project is aimed at developing a mathematical tool to calculate these invariants from string physics. Other topics of this project focus on using the above developed tool to solve problems from geometry and number theory. <br/><br/>The major topic of this project is to study Gromov-Witten invariants via logarithmic smooth degenerations. The short term goal is to develop the theory of punctured maps which are, roughly speaking, stable logarithmic maps with ""poles"". The long term goal is to prove an effective degeneration formula which expresses Gromov-Witten invariants as a combination of invariants from punctured maps as the basic building blocks. Further topics of this project include (1) studying Teichmuller dynamics via the logarithmic compactification; and (2) studying density problem of integral points over function fields of algebraic curves. Both topics are further applications of the theory of stable logarithmic maps."

The symmetries of an object in nature or of a theoretical construct can be encoded by a group, which itself carries important information about the structure of the object. Representation theory allows one to study groups in a uniform way via their actions on vector spaces, which model common ways groups act in applications. Representation theory has been a central topic in mathematics for more than a century and has important applications in physics and chemistry, particularly in quantum mechanics and the theory of elementary particles. Finite groups and their representations have important applications in coding theory and cryptography, and play an important role in modern computation and digital communications. This project aims to advance understanding in the representation theory of finite groups and in a number of applications. <br/><br/>In more detail, this project focuses on several important questions in group representation theory and its applications. It ties together different areas of mathematics, such as finite groups and algebraic groups, permutation groups, probabilistic group theory, group cohomology, combinatorics, vertex operator algebras, and algebraic geometry, with representation theory as the main unifying ingredient. Many of the questions addressed in the project come up naturally in the study of group representations, and others are motivated by applications. The investigator will study several problems along the lines of the global-local principle, including conjectures of McKay, Alperin, Brauer, and others that extend and generalize classical results in the representation theory of finite groups. The investigator also intends to study classification of modular representations of low dimension and to develop a theory of character level, with the goal of establishing strong bounds on character values for finite quasisimple groups. It is anticipated that the results can be applied to study Aschbacher's conjecture on subgroup lattices and the Kollar-Larsen problem on exterior powers, Miyamoto's problem, problems on random walks and anti-concentration, representation varieties of Fuchsian groups, word map distributions and Waring-type problems for quasisimple groups, refinements of Holt's conjecture on second cohomology groups, and representations of quasisimple groups with special properties."

It had its roots in the idea that the geometry of space is determined by its group of symmetries. As our understanding of space has evolved, the study of Lie groups and Lie algebras (Lie theory) has become a central part of modern mathematics. The subject has also always benefited by interactions with physics and these led to two of the major developments in the last century; the definition and study of Kac-Moody algebras and quantum groups. These objects turned out to have many connections to physics, combinatorics and number theory. One of the early successes of their study was the fact that many classical identities established by the famous Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) could be recovered and interpreted in the language of the representation theory of Kac-Moody algebras. Quantum groups are deformations of Kac-Moody algebras and their study has led to important connections with knot theory and mathematical physics. One of the goals of this project it to exploit the synergy between the study of Kac-Moody algebras and their quantum analogs to study questions in representation theory and to relate them to various series of functions which appear in the work of Ramanujan.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the study of the connections between Demazure modules in an affine Kac-Moody Lie algebra and the theory of hypergeometric series, quantum affine algebras, generalized Q-systems and cluster algebras. In the simplest cases, Demazure modules are indexed by a pair of positive integers one of which is called the level of the module. It can be shown that a module of a fixed level admits a flag where the successive quotients are all higher level Demazure modules. This information can be encoded in the form of a generating series and a goal of the project is to relate them to q-hypergeometric series and to study their modularity properties. The study of Demazure modules is also important in the theory of quantum affine Kac-Moody algebras. Another goal of this project is to establish character formulae for prime representations of quantum affine algebras. The latter are known to be related to cluster algebras and the proposal will study the combinatorial problems arising from these many connections."

Since mid-1990s, various mathematicians have conjectured that an explicit construction of certain four-dimensional topological field theories (4d TQFTs) should exist, the discovery of which will enhance our mathematical understanding of four-dimensional quantum physics. The objective of this project is to develop an accessible approach towards explicitly realizing such 4d TQFTs. The 4d TQFTs will admit combinatorial descriptions and be computable in practice for applications. They are related to, yet more subtle than, an earlier construction in dimension three. The project naturally fits into a larger program of relating certain three-dimensional field theories and four-dimensional ones by a process called categorification, where ""shadow"" concepts in three dimensions are replaced by richer structures in four dimensions. The higher structures obtained can be utilized to resolve problems in lower dimensions. In addition, algebraic structures will be developed along the the way that it will shed new light on topics in classical algebraic studies.<br/><br/>In more detail, this is a project to investigate categorifications of quantum groups at prime roots of unity, and their categorical representation theory. This constitutes part of a long term program to categorify the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev three-dimensional topological quantum field theory, producing a four-dimensional theory. The existence of such liftings of topological quantum field theories by categorification was conjectured by Crane and Frenkel in 1994. A key ingredient in this program is to find a categorical enhancement of certain link homology theories, such as Khovanov homology, at prime roots of unity. The project will be carried out by further developing a recently introduced generalized homological algebraic theory called ""hopfological algebra."" Incorporating this newly developed hopfological theory into earlier works on categorified representation theory of quantum group at a prime root of unity will allow one to explicitly construct hopfological invariant for links and 3-manifolds, thereby explicitly lifting Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev's three-dimensional topological quantum field theorys via categorification. In the process, categorified representation theory of quantum groups a prime root of unity will be investigated, together with their new hopofological features."

The optimal formula, still unproved, depends on the Riemann hypothesis on the location of zeros of the zeta function. Prior to the formulation of his celebrated hypothesis, Riemann stipulated a symmetry of the zeta function in the form of a functional equation. Thanks to the development of number theory following Riemann's memoir, we know that there is a large family of functions which includes the zeta function; these functions should encode numerical information about systems of polynomial equations, such as the number of their solutions modulo a prime number as the prime number varies. These functions should satisfy a generalized form of the Riemann hypothesis as well as a functional equation. In the early 1970s, Langlands proposed a visionary program predicting that all these functions can be viewed from a radically different perspective. This project will develop new tools that will aid in the development of Langlands' program.<br/><br/>Langlands' automorphic functoriality conjecture implies both meromorphic continuation and functional equation of L-functions. The functoriality conjecture remains largely unexplored beyond the endoscopic framework. In the early 2000s, Langlands (on one side) and Braverman-Kazhdan (on the other), formulated different general strategies to attack the functoriality conjecture beyond endoscopy and the functional equation of L-functions. This project aims to combine different elements of those proposals in a formulation of a new, possibly more realistic, strategy. The focus will be on the understanding of certain conjectural Schwartz spaces proposed by Braverman-Kazhdan, spaces of orbital integrals studied by Langlands and others, and the Fourier and Hankel transforms on those spaces. It is expected that geometry of arc spaces, which are infinite dimensional, will play a major role in these studies."

Algebraic geometry studies solutions of such systems. A major feature of these systems is that they vary in families by varying the coefficients of the polynomials. Some equations in the family are easier to solve, and properties of more complicated systems can be deduced from the solutions of the simpler systems. The investigators study the geometry of certain spaces defined by polynomial equations that are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics, called moduli spaces of vector bundles. They compute geometric invariants of these spaces by relating them to simpler spaces using a recent breakthrough called Bridgeland stability. The investigators are also dedicated to training the next generation of U.S. scientists and researchers. In this project, they will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers to use the new technique of Bridgeland stability. The Focused Research Group grant will support these young researchers to visit and collaborate with several senior researchers and to attend conferences and workshops on the topic. The investigators will also organize two large conferences and four workshops to help attract young talent to the area.<br/><br/>Moduli spaces of vector bundles are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry, with applications to commutative algebra, representation theory, combinatorics, and mathematical physics. In the last five years, Bridgeland stability conditions have revolutionized the understanding of moduli spaces of vector bundles on surfaces. They have allowed the computation of the ample and effective cones of divisors on these moduli spaces and led to the solution of longstanding problems such as the existence of Lagrangian fibrations on certain hyperkähler manifolds of K3 type and the higher rank interpolation problem for general sheaves on the plane. It is timely to apply these new techniques to central problems in the geometry of moduli spaces of vector bundles on surfaces and threefolds. This Focused Research Group project centers on three lines of inquiry:<br/>(1) Prove cohomology vanishing results using Bridgeland stability and consequently construct Ulrich bundles on surfaces and threefolds and effective Brill-Noether divisors on moduli spaces of vector bundles on surfaces. Give applications to Le Potier's Strange Duality Conjecture.<br/>(2) Determine when special bundles, such as Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundles or null-correlation bundles on surfaces and threefolds, are Bridgeland stable. Apply the stability to classical problems on syzygies and Koszul cohomology.<br/>(3) Study the birational geometry of moduli spaces of Bridgeland stable objects via wall-crossing.  <br/>The investigators plan to train ten undergraduates, ten graduate students, and seven postdoctoral associates through research involvement in the project."

In number theory, which studies the integers, especially the prime numbers, there are no manifest symmetries of the kind encountered in more intuitive, geometric settings (symmetry of a square under 90-degree rotations, etc.). Nevertheless, much of our deepest knowledge of the primes comes from their connections with the ""symmetries"" of polynomial equations. This project focuses on the study of Galois representations, which are natural packages for this information about the prime numbers. One of the central programs of modern number theory, initiated by Robert Langlands, proposes new ways to ""unpack"" Galois representations by relating them to remarkably different mathematical objects arising in geometry. Although they are essentially about the prime numbers, these relations have even had reverberations in fundamental physics. This project involves both constructing new Galois representations and unpacking the information they contain in the light of Langlands' conjectures.<br/><br/>This project comprises two research programs. The first will study deformations of Galois representations valued in arbitrary reductive groups, with a view toward establishing in as great generality as possible the existence of geometric p-adic deformations of a given mod p representation.  The work is likely to furnish steps toward generalizations of Serre's modularity conjecture to general reductive groups. Such geometric p-adic representations are expected to be the (semi-simple) Galois representations occurring in the cohomology of algebraic varieties over number fields. The second program aims to study a number of questions of Fontaine-Mazur type, seeking to establish the motivic origin of certain Galois representations or, in a more geometric setting, local systems over a curve. The work will require elaborating the motivic structures underlying basic objects of the geometric Langlands program, a problem that should be of long-term independent interest even for the arithmetic Langlands program."

Historically it has played an important role in mathematics because analyzing a given mathematical object, for example a system of equations, is often dramatically simplified when the object is symmetric in a suitable abstract sense. Symplectic geometry, on the other hand, grew out of Hamiltonian mechanics and today occupies a prominent place in mathematics due to the wide range of contexts, for example in topology and algebraic geometry, where the underlying geometric structures of Hamiltonian mechanics appear. This research project aims to advance understanding of both subjects, as well as unearthing deep new connections between them, by leveraging new ideas from algebraic combinatorics, in particular the recently developed theory of cluster algebras. These connections are in turn all informed by recent advances in mathematical physics, specifically string theory and supersymmetric gauge theory.<br/><br/>On the side of representation theory, the main objects of study in this project include the affine Grassmannian and its relatives, in particular their derived categories of equivariant coherent sheaves. On the side of symplectic geometry, the main objects are categories of Lagrangian branes or microlocal sheaves in noncompact symplectic 4- and 6-manifolds. In the former context, cluster structures appear at the level of the equivariant K-rings of the geometric objects involved, and describe certain combinatorial structures inherited by these rings. In the latter, cluster structures appear on moduli spaces of Lagrangian branes in 4 dimensions, or through Hall algebra-type constructions based on Fukaya categories in 6 dimensions. Through its combinatorial nature the language of cluster algebras provides a means of isolating tractable aspects of otherwise very rich and complicated mathematical objects, as well as uncovering new relations between these objects."

Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, as people have attempted for a very long time to use algebraic tools to understand problems in geometry, and at the same time it is a field that has seen some of the most outstanding modern developments and connections with areas of pure and applied science. This project will connect parts of algebraic and complex geometry that have previously been quite disjoint; in particular, it uses new tools (called Hodge modules) to classify geometric shapes and singularities. This approach will generate numerous projects for doctoral students. The PI will continue to be involved in outreach activities, like work towards creating a better environment for women in mathematics through his involvement in the Graduate Research Opportunities for Women (GROW) program at Northwestern. <br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will continue to apply the theory of mixed Hodge modules to concrete problems in complex and birational geometry. He will pursue the development of the theory of Hodge ideals associated to divisors on smooth varieties, and its applications. This has been completed for reduced divisors, but significant new ideas will need to be brought into play in order to obtain a similar picture for Hodge ideals associated to Q-divisors or ideal sheaves. While Hodge ideals associated to reduced hypersurfaces are already a generalization of certain types of multiplier ideals, once this program is achieved, Hodge ideals will provide an enhancement of the theory of multiplier ideals in full generality. Consequently, one hopes for applications that reflect this. In recent work the PI gave applications regarding the singularities of theta divisors, and of hypersurfaces in projective space or toric varieties. In addition to further applications along these lines, the PI will use the proposed extensions to study Fujita-type problems, especially regarding the very ampleness of adjoint linear series, and also problems in local algebra. The PI has also been involved in applying the theory of Hodge modules to the study of families of smooth projective varieties, e.g. hyperbolicity questions in the sense of Viehweg. He will extend this study to families of singular varieties, especially those that appear in the theory of moduli of higher dimensional varieties, perhaps using those Hodge modules that extend variations of mixed Hodge structure. Finally, the PI will also continue working towards the classification of subvarieties with minimal cohomology class on principally polarized abelian varieties."

The AFW is an internationally recognized, well-respected conference on topics related to automorphic forms, which have played a key role in many recent breakthroughs in mathematics. Continuing a three-decade long tradition, the AFW will bring together a geographically diverse group of participants at a wide range of career stages, from graduate students to senior professors. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one quarter to one third of participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging ideas, and beginning new collaborations. In addition to the research talks, the AFW will - like in past years - have two professional development panels on topics such as good mathematical writing, early career development, and transitioning from one career stage to the next. Furthermore, for the first time at AFW, there will be a ""speed"" session in which participants (primarily junior mathematicians) present short talks about current research projects which may still be in preliminary stages. <br/><br/>Automorphic forms constitute a major area of study in number theory and related areas. One of the goals of the AFW is to promote new interactions and collaborations between researchers working in different areas concerning automorphic forms. Thus, the workshop will highlight a wide range of developments in areas including the analytic, algebraic, combinatorial, and p-adic theory of automorphic forms and related topics such as L-functions. Automorphic forms have played a key role in many breakthroughs in mathematics, including the proofs of Fermat's Last Theorem (by Andrew Wiles), Serre's Conjecture (by Chandrashekhar Khare, Mark Kisin, and Jean-Pierre Wintenberger), the Sato-Tate Conjecture (by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Michael Harris, and Richard Taylor), Serre's Uniformity Conjecture (by Yuri Bilu and Pierre Parent),the Monstrous Moonshine Conjecture (for which Borcherds was awarded the Fields Medal), and the Fundamental Lemma (for which Ngo Bau Chau was awarded the Fields Medal). The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include Bianchi, elliptic, Jacobi, Hilbert, and Siegel modular forms, elliptic curves and abelian varieties, special values of L-functions, p-adic aspects of L-functions and automorphic forms, connections with representation theory, mock modular forms, quadratic forms, and additional related areas of research.<br/><br/>Website:http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/"

One of the most fundamental and important problems in number theory is to solve Diophantine equations, that is, to find integer solutions to polynomial equations with integer coefficients. For example, the famous Fermat's Last Theorem concerns one class of Diophantine equations. In modern mathematical language, Diophantine equations can be encoded into a geometric notion, called algebraic varieties. Then the information of the solution will give rise to an arithmetic invariant of the corresponding algebraic variety. However, these algebraic varieties carry other important invariants related to the arithmetic one via the so-called L-function. It is often possible to transfer information from different invariants and achieve better understanding of all of them. This project aims to deepen understanding of fundamental relationships among such mathematical constructs.<br/><br/>The main theme of this project is to study L-functions of motives, which are a systematic generalization of algebraic varieties, via studying various aspects of Shimura varieties and the method of Arakelov geometry. The L-functions of motives play an important role in the current research in number theory, automorphic representations, and arithmetic geometry, as they encode crucial information from all these aspects. The Langlands Program predicts that motives, like rational elliptic curves, are linked with automorphic forms through L-functions. This project investigates five topics: (1) the Bloch-Kato conjecture for motives appearing in the Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture; (2) modularity of Hecke actions on special cycles on Shimura varieties; (3) potential theory on non-Archimedean spaces and its connection to Arakelov geometry; (4) a higher derivative version of the Rallis inner product formula over function fields; and (5) nearby cycles for Artin stacks over general bases."

In this project the principal investigators aim to create new algebraic and geometric tools helping to formulate ideas and methods of quantum physics in a precise mathematical way.  Specifically, the team will combine its members' past experience and achievements to construct new Topological Quantum Field Theories for manifolds with additional structures. Inspired by Witten's Chern-Simons theory and invariants of 3-manifolds that are known now as Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants, the principal investigators will explore their new Field Theories with the objective to find physical definitions for the resulting topological invariants of manifolds.  This work is stimulated by several fundamental examples and will open the door to new research avenues in algebra, topology, geometry, mathematical physics, and related areas of mathematics. The broader impacts of the project belong to two main categories: mentoring and outreach.  The members of the research team are currently mentoring a total of twelve PhD students.  They will advise graduate students on projects related to the main objectives of the grant.  The outreach component is to organize several workshops and conferences aimed at developing communication and collaborative research between participants of the project, establishing scientific connections with other mathematicians, as well as fostering broader applications of this work.<br/><br/>In 1999, Turaev introduced Homotopy Quantum Field Theories (HQFTs), which are generalizations of Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) studied by Schwartz, Witten, and Atiyah.  HQFTs produce topological invariants of manifolds furnished with extra data that add supplementary topology/geometry to the context of TQFTs.  Most of the theory of quantum invariants and HQFTs involves monoidal categories which have certain additional properties like being semi-simple.  In various collaborations started in 2005,   the team members developed a theory of re-normalized Quantum Invariants that derives non-trivial topological invariants from non-semi-simple categories.  In this project the principal investigators will further use renormalization to develop non-trivial HQFTs, based on the examples coming from the theory of unrestricted quantum group.  These new HQFTs should share the strength and the new features of the re-normalized Quantum Invariants.  The principal investigators will further search for a physical interpretation of these new invariants."

The investigation of syzygies, or the relations amongst equations, has long played a central role in algebra, with a history ranging from 19th-century invariant theory to 21st-century theoretical physics.

Geometric spaces that parametrize approximations of quantum objects by matrices are therefore an important tool in the study of several models of natural phenomena. Not surprisingly, these spaces play a crucial role in several areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. Unfortunately, such spaces are often difficult to study since they are usually not smooth enough. Intuitively speaking, this means that they have too many edges and corners.  This project is centered on a tool that refines these spaces in a way that appears to overcome many of these difficulties. The work is anticipated to lead to new insights into several questions where such spaces play a role. It also unifies several research areas by focusing on applications of this tool in different parts of mathematics, in addition to further developing this tool as an end in itself. <br/><br/>In earlier work, the investigators constructed a derived version of representation varieties of associative algebras by extending the representation functor to differential graded (DG) algebras and deriving it in the sense of non-abelian homological algebra. This gives a new homology theory for algebras, called representation homology. This project aims to give a new construction of representation homology of associative algebras in terms of classical (abelian) homological algebra and also extend it to other structures of topological nature. This should lead to various applications in geometry and topology and open the way to efficient computations. A number of precise conjectures regarding the structure of representation homology of classical spaces will be investigated. In addition, the investigators will attack some well-known hard problems in representation theory (such as the strong MacDonald conjecture) using new topological methods."

Historically it has played an important role in mathematics because analyzing a given mathematical object, for example a system of equations, is often dramatically simplified when the object is symmetric in a suitable abstract sense. Symplectic geometry, on the other hand, grew out of Hamiltonian mechanics and today occupies a prominent place in mathematics due to the wide range of contexts, for example in topology and algebraic geometry, where the underlying geometric structures of Hamiltonian mechanics appear. This research project aims to advance understanding of both subjects, as well as unearthing deep new connections between them, by leveraging new ideas from algebraic combinatorics, in particular the recently developed theory of cluster algebras. These connections are in turn all informed by recent advances in mathematical physics, specifically string theory and supersymmetric gauge theory.<br/><br/>On the side of representation theory, the main objects of study in this project include the affine Grassmannian and its relatives, in particular their derived categories of equivariant coherent sheaves. On the side of symplectic geometry, the main objects are categories of Lagrangian branes or microlocal sheaves in noncompact symplectic 4- and 6-manifolds. In the former context, cluster structures appear at the level of the equivariant K-rings of the geometric objects involved, and describe certain combinatorial structures inherited by these rings. In the latter, cluster structures appear on moduli spaces of Lagrangian branes in 4 dimensions, or through Hall algebra-type constructions based on Fukaya categories in 6 dimensions. Through its combinatorial nature the language of cluster algebras provides a means of isolating tractable aspects of otherwise very rich and complicated mathematical objects, as well as uncovering new relations between these objects."

Class numbers have been studied for 200 years, but still remain largely mysterious, although precise conjectures have been developed. Seemingly far away on the mathematical spectrum,  Radon transforms quantify the distribution of the ""mass"" of functions along lower-dimensional surfaces; they are a critical part of the theory underlying Computed Tomography medical imaging. The study of Radon transforms is a central area in harmonic analysis with far-reaching connections both to the Carleson operator, which was instrumental in answering a historic question on Fourier series, and to the new world of discrete arithmetic operators, which blends harmonic analysis with number theory.

These methods quantify shape by recording the values of parameters (such as height, thickness, time, distance, temperature, or curvature) across which the topology of the geometric object changes: holes emerge or collapse; connected components join or diverge; cavities form or fill. Current geometric methods of this sort can handle one varying parameter, but data often call for more than one.  This project develops an algebraic framework to encode and compute in the context of this multiparameter topological data analysis.  The proposed methodology is general, applicable to datasets from any scientific inquiry, but it is being developed here in service to a fundamental question in evolutionary biology: what mechanism drives the generation of topological variants in sufficient quantity for selection to act?  The model organism for this investigation is the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, specifically the pattern of veins in its wings.<br/><br/>This project develops mathematical foundations for multiparameter persistent homology.  This investigation is in service to a specific question in evolutionary biology, using fruit fly wings as the model system, but the proposed methodology is general, applying homological algebra, real algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and computational techniques to encode, control, and provide insight theoretically as well as for applied and algorithmic purposes.  The parameters are allowed to vary continuously on stratified spaces, instead of the usual discrete setup with one parameter on a simplicial complex.  As such, the project transforms the way we think about commutative algebra in two independent ways simultaneously: by considering real vectors or an arbitrary poset instead of integer vectors for multigradings, and by splicing together the augmentation maps of free and injective resolutions to get ""fringe presentations"" of modules.  The combination of techniques from free resolutions and injective resolutions also transforms how we think about topology and geometry, since it renders the new conception of multiparameter persistent homology transparent topologically -- features are described in terms of birth and death (generators and cogenerators) rather than by birth and relations between births (generators and relations) -- while greatly expanding the potential for effective computation."

One of the most basic problems in algebraic geometry is to learn how to classify and distinguish geometric properties of algebraic varieties. In addition to discrete parameters, mostly of topological nature, algebraic varieties also have continuous parameters called ""moduli"". For example, Riemann surfaces (such as a sphere or a torus) are classified topologically by the number of holes (the genus). It was known already to Riemann that they also have 3g-3 continuous complex parameters (g is the genus). Quite remarkably, these parameters can be interpreted as coordinates on the ""moduli space"": the master space that encodes all possible geometric structures of a given topological shape. The PI is an expert on moduli spaces of low-dimensional varieties (curves and surfaces). The project will focus on developing new techniques and approaches to their study. The first approach is based on convex geometry, which studies shapes defined by linear inequalities (such as polygons and polyhedra). An idea that goes back to Newton is to capture asymptotic behavior of a distinguished system of functions to construct a polyhedral approximation of a curved geometry. Another approach is linearization. Derived categories linearize geometries just like tangent lines approximate graphs of functions. The PI aims to understand derived categories of several moduli spaces. Finally, moduli spaces can be studied using number theory by reducing them modulo prime numbers. To this end, moduli spaces have to be equipped with extra data to parametrize complex and finite geometries simultaneously. In addition to advancing algebraic geometry, the proposed research program contributes to the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through recruiting, training, and supervising of graduate and undergraduate students and providing resources for their research, teaching, and professional development. In particular, the project includes three problems specifically tailored for REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) as well as several PhD thesis problems. The PI will also continue to develop graduate and undergraduate courses, including courses designed to introduce a broader public to mathematics and science.<br/><br/><br/>The PI will work on several fundamental problems in algebraic geometry with a focus on compact moduli spaces of local systems, curves and surfaces. The PI has previously developed applications of classical ""commutative"" tropicalization of subvarieties in algebraic tori to moduli spaces. Recently, classical tropical geometry was extended by the PI and his graduate student Vogiannou to a ""non-commutative"" setting and the PI proposes to use this generalization to construct a geometrically meaningful compactification of the moduli space of local systems on a punctured Riemann sphere. In collaboration with Castravet, the PI intends to verify a conjecture of Orlov and Kuznetsov on derived category of the moduli space of stable rational curves (and related spaces) and to apply this description to find its non-commutative deformations. The PI also intends to use the theory of windows as developed by Halpern-Leistner to solve some open problems about derived categories of toric and log Fano varieties. In collaboration with Freixas i Montplet, the PI proposes to systematically develop Arakelov geometry of the moduli space of curves and to apply it to questions in number theory. The PI proposes several new projects on moduli of surfaces in collaboration with Urzua, including constructions of moduli spaces of surfaces with QHD singularities (admitting smoothings with rational homology disc Milnor fiber) and families of antiflips of total spaces of deformations of cyclic quotient singularities in the direction of answering a question of Kollar. In addition there are three projects tailored for REUs: Seshadri constants on toric and elliptic ruled surfaces, and equations of log canonical  compactifications of complements of hyperplane arrangements."

Its mathematical scope involves number theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry and relates to what is now known as the Geometric Langlands Program.  Robert Langlands in the 1960's proposed a program, which is a culmination of a sequence of theorems in number theory that began with the quadratic reciprocity theorem, proved by Gauss around 1800.  Alexander Beilinson and Vladimir Drinfeld suggested a geometric version of the Langlands program, in which they brought the ideas of Langlands together with tools and ideas from other areas of mathematics and physics: algebraic geometry, sheaf theory, moduli spaces, integrable systems, and many others. Later, Anton Kapustin and Edward Witten in a breakthrough paper related the Geometric Langlands Program to supersymmetry and electro-magnetic duality. The central objects in the two projects are principal bundles for reductive algebraic groups; the PI plans to study certain questions about them in the context of the Geometric Langlands Program.<br/><br/>In the first project, partly in collaboration with Ivan Panin, the PI will apply techniques of the Geometric Langlands Program (namely, affine Grassmannians) to the local study of principal bundles.  A principal bundle (that is, a torsor) for a reductive group scheme is not necessarily trivial in the Zariski topology.  However, a conjecture of Grothendieck and Serre predicts that it is trivial if it is rationally trivial and the base is smooth.  This conjecture is already proved in certain cases, but the PI aims to prove it in wider generality.  The PI also plans to describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for extending a principal bundle over the fraction field to a neighborhood of a closed point.  The second project, partly in collaboration with Dmitry Arinkin, is aimed at proving the quasi-classical version of the categorical Langlands correspondence.  This is the equivalence between the derived category of the Hitchin integrable system for a reductive group and the derived category of the Hitchin system for the Langlands dual group.  This should be viewed as an extension of the Fourier-Mukai transform for abelian varieties to singular degenerations of abelian varieties.  There are strong indications that a proof of the duality for Hitchin systems will help with the proof of the original Geometric Langlands conjectures."

Oregon Number Theory Days are targeted primarily at regional graduate students, postdocs, and faculty in number theory located in the Willamette Valley area in the state of Oregon. Each of the host institutions operates on a schedule of three terms per year, and the goal is to hold three seminars per year, one seminar per term, over the course of three years. The speakers will be distinguished researchers in number theory, or related fields of direct interest to number theorists, who are also known to be exceptional expositors. They represent an internationally diverse group of mathematicians, speaking on a wide variety of topics, including topics that are complementary to those already studied by local number theorists in Oregon. In particular, without this seminar series, these topics are harder to access by mathematicians in Oregon. Local postdoctoral fellows and advanced graduate students will also be invited to speak and present their most recent research in an encouraging environment. <br/><br/>Oregon is home to a growing community of researchers and students in number theory, but it is a low-population state which is geographically isolated from the traditional major centers of activity. This poses a significant financial challenge to students and postdoctoral faculty members for travel to conferences and workshops. Oregon Number Theory Days will feature presentations by high-profile international number theory experts on current research topics, which will be of great benefit to students, postdocs, and faculty residing in Oregon. In addition, it will help build a strong sense of community among the number theory researchers within the Willamette Valley area. This seminar series will host a diverse group of participants and speakers. The organizers of Oregon Number Theory Days believe that providing a broad representation of distinguished mathematicians is an important factor in the recruitment and development of underrepresented groups in academia. Oregon Number Theory Days will welcome every interested participant, and will particularly encourage graduate students to participate. This award will primarily be used to support the traveling expenses of local graduate and postdoctoral fellows to the hosting institutions."

The conference will bring together leading experts with young researchers at a time of exciting developments and new breakthroughs.  Many of these recent developments were inspired by computer experiments, which are becoming more common within the fields of algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.  The workshop will focus on developing Macaulay2, a leading computer algebra system within these fields.  By helping researchers develop their own packages, there will be immediate research impact as they and others compute new examples which push the mathematical frontier.  Such examples can answer old questions and inspire new ideas, just like those that are to be presented at the scientific conference. Further information is available at the conference website: https://macaulay2.github.io/Workshop-2017-Berkeley/<br/><br/>The first two days of the meeting will be a conference on free resolutions and commutative algebra. The time is ripe for such a conference; in Summer 2016 Irena Peeva and Jason McCullough (both of whom will speak at the meeting) resolved a famous 38-year-old conjecture on free resolutions due to Eisenbud-Goto. There has also been recent progress on Stillman's question, which asks for a bound on projective dimension of an ideal, based solely on the number of generators and degrees (Mel Hochster and Craig Huneke will give talks on their work). The meeting will then switch gears, to a software development workshop for Macaulay2, one of the world's leading software systems for supporting research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. Macaulay2  is open source, and one of the key ways in which it extends its functionality is through packages, which allow researchers to write functions that utilize Macaulay2's core functions. The workshop will enhance research infrastructure by constructing packages which will be subsequently integrated into Macaulay2. It will also serve as a training ground for algebraists to use and write for Macaulay2. The workshop will build bridges and foster connections between workers on the theoretical and computational aspects of free resolutions. Macaulay2 workshops have a history of being inclusive both in terms of including underrepresented groups and for including participants from a wide variety of positions.  The organizers are committed to continuing this tradition."

Specifically, it deals with natural questions on how many geometric objects possessing given properties arising both in algebraic geometry and differential geometry do exist. Such questions are known as ""boundedness of classes of algebraic varieties."" The project is divided in two parts in which the PI will especially aim to understand different geometrical aspects related to the boundedness of certain classes of varieties (geometric objects defined as zero loci of polynomial equations) and applications of such results. The main aim is to develop methods that can be used to extend classical results in low-dimensional geometry to higher dimensions using techniques arising from the developed in the last 20 years theory known as the ""minimal model program."" Some of these results will have application to string theory in mathematical physics.<br/><br/>The first part of the project focuses on boundedness of Calabi-Yau varieties. Even though Calabi-Yau manifolds are very simple algebraic varieties from many points of view, their boundedness properties are still poorly understood. The main goal of this part of the project is to study elliptic fibered Calabi-Yau varieties. It is known that in low dimensions they satisfy interesting boundedness properties and the PI intends to extend such results in arbitrary dimension. These results have applications to the minimal model program, the classification of algebraic varieties and F-theory. The last part of this project aims to explore the implications of similar techniques to the theory of Kahler-Einstein metric with cone-edge singularities. The main motivation for this project is the study of the birational geometry of toroidal compactifications of ball quotients and more generally of higher ranks locally symmetric varieties. As part of this project, the PI intends to develop techniques that eventually will work even with compactifications of finite volume Kahler manifolds with pinched negative sectional curvature."

Physical predictions have led to the construction of new numerical invariants which provide novel insights into the geometry of different spaces. These invariants, which were initially difficult to rigorously define and calculate, can now be accessed using methods from algebraic geometry and also symplectic geometry (the study of spaces similar to phase spaces that arise in classical mechanics).  Motivated by conjectures and intuition from mathematical physics, the principal investigator (PI) plans to study new classes of enumerative invariants, their general structure, and relations between different enumerative theories.  This project, while developing new tools and methods in algebraic geometry, has at its roots conjectures originating in theoretical physics.  As such the project will help elucidate and verify physical conjectures, thus furthering understanding in this field. <br/> <br/>The goal of enumerative geometry broadly is to study a space by counting subspaces of a certain type. Gromov-Witten theory, for instance, defines invariants of a smooth complex algebraic variety X which give approximate counts of the number of complex curves in X. Another theory, Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten (FJRW) theory, is defined similarly, but gives invariants of a singularity rather than a smooth variety. Predictions by Witten and other physicists studying mirror symmetry indicate that these invariants have a rich structure and are often related to each other in surprising ways.  The recent introduction of the concept of so-called Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSMs), which simultaneously generalize Gromov-Witten theory, FJRW theory and many others, has the potential to transform the current understanding of enumerative geometry. While giving a unified framework for many different theories, defining enumerative invariants for GLSMs may provide new methods for computing Gromov-Witten invariants--a longstanding goal in both physics and mathematics--and will clarify certain mysterious correspondences between different theories such as the crepant transformation conjecture and the Landau-Ginzberg/Calabi-Yau correspondence.  The PI will give a general algebro-geometric construction of enumerative invariants associated to GLSMs, and use this new construction to realize those applications described above. The PI will also develop new computational techniques in Gromov-Witten theory, explore the recursive structure of these invariants (as predicted by the Witten-Kontsevich Theorem and the Virasoro Conjecture), and prove new correspondences related to mirror symmetry."

Geometric spaces that parametrize approximations of quantum objects by matrices are therefore an important tool in the study of several models of natural phenomena. Not surprisingly, these spaces play a crucial role in several areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. Unfortunately, such spaces are often difficult to study since they are usually not smooth enough. Intuitively speaking, this means that they have too many edges and corners.  This project is centered on a tool that refines these spaces in a way that appears to overcome many of these difficulties. The work is anticipated to lead to new insights into several questions where such spaces play a role. It also unifies several research areas by focusing on applications of this tool in different parts of mathematics, in addition to further developing this tool as an end in itself. <br/><br/>In earlier work, the investigators constructed a derived version of representation varieties of associative algebras by extending the representation functor to differential graded (DG) algebras and deriving it in the sense of non-abelian homological algebra. This gives a new homology theory for algebras, called representation homology. This project aims to give a new construction of representation homology of associative algebras in terms of classical (abelian) homological algebra and also extend it to other structures of topological nature. This should lead to various applications in geometry and topology and open the way to efficient computations. A number of precise conjectures regarding the structure of representation homology of classical spaces will be investigated. In addition, the investigators will attack some well-known hard problems in representation theory (such as the strong MacDonald conjecture) using new topological methods."

In this situation, it is often very useful to classify all solutions up to the action of these symmetries, two solutions considered equivalent if they are related by a symmetry transformation. Within the field of algebraic geometry, the theory known as geometric invariant theory provides a very good answer to this classification question. There is reason to suspect that the methods of geometric invariant theory extend to a much broader context. In particle physics, the universe is described as a set of solutions of some equations up to the action of a very large set of symmetries. This project aims to broaden the methods and results of geometric invariant theory and bring them to bear on a large set of classification problems in algebraic geometry, including some of those studied in high energy physics.<br/><br/>This project envisions a new general approach to moduli problems in algebraic geometry. The main technical tool is a special kind of stratification on an algebraic stack called a theta stratification. Theta stratifications are a common generalization of the Kempf-Ness stratification studied in geometric invariant theory and the Harder-Narasimhan stratification of the moduli space of vector bundles on a curve. Classically these stratifications were used, in the case of smooth stacks, to study the Betti numbers of the moduli stack of semistable objects. The project will pursue several generalizations of these results to situations where the stack is not necessarily smooth, and to extracting more subtle topological information about the stack. Examples include wall-crossing formulas for integrals of tautological K-theory classes, and more generally extracting information about the derived category of coherent sheaves on the stack and the semistable locus."

Numbers can be studied in two different ways that are nearly independent:  they can be used for measurement and they can be used to do arithmetic.  The interaction between these two properties has always been the basis of number theory.  The second half of the twentieth century saw the formulation of several ambitious research programs that aimed at obtaining a systematic understanding of these interactions by studying numbers and their relations with the help of symmetry.   The branch of mathematics concerned with their geometric symmetries is called arithmetic geometry; the branch concerned with their dynamical symmetries is called automorphic forms.  The Langlands program aims to unify these two branches by showing how each kind of symmetry encodes the other.  Contemporary theoretical physics has introduced the concept of higher order symmetries, based on new notions of space that themselves owe a great deal to earlier developments in number theory; more recently, higher order symmetries have been of increasing importance in the Langlands program.   This project explores the role of higher order symmetries in connection with several specific questions in the Langlands program, with the ultimate aim of contributing to the understanding of solutions of equations in whole numbers.<br/><br/>The project is a contribution to the arithmetic theory of automorphic forms, in the setting of the Langlands program, with special attention to the arithmetic of motives and their associated Galois representations, directly or by application of congruence methods.

Some combinatorial invariants have been shown to have algebraic geometric nature, that is, there are algebraic varieties associated to special combinatorial objects, and it is possible to express combinatorial invariants using the corresponding algebraic varieties. Once such algebraic geometric nature is realized, one can translate combinatorial questions into questions about algebraic varieties, with the potential to reduce them to known results in algebraic geometry. The underlying algebraic geometry structures beneath combinatorial objects can also lead to deeper understanding of the combinatorial objects. <br/><br/>Matroid theory is a fundamental subject in combinatorial geometry. The first goal of this project is to explore the algebraic geometric nature of the numerical invariants of matroids that are realizable over some field. More precisely, the project aims to express the numerical invariants in terms of the (étale or singular) cohomology ring of some associated algebraic varieties, obtaining new properties of the matroids. The more ambitious goal is to develop combinatorial generalizations of theorems in algebraic geometry and to derive properties for non-realizable matroids."

Broadly speaking, the field of representation theory deals with understanding symmetries of linear systems. The notion of ""symmetries"" is made precise by the mathematical concept of a group; given an abstract group, one can ask how that group can be realized via linear transformations on a vector space. This subject has algebraic origins, but current developments in representation theory involve input from other areas of mathematics, such as geometry and topology, as well as ideas from physics. This conference  brings together experts from diverse research backgrounds to report on new developments and exchange ideas. <br/><br/>Many current developments at the frontiers of representation theory rely on a diverse array of tools whose origins may be geometric, categorical, or homological in nature. Conversely, questions from representation theory have motivated a number of new developments in neighboring fields of mathematics and mathematical physics. This conference  features speakers whose work lies at the interface of representation theory and these neighboring subjects, and whose research programs are indicative of the directions along which representation theory may develop in the future. Specific topics include: (i) symplectic duality and mathematical physics; (ii) categorification and categorical actions; (iii) cohomological methods in representation theory; (iv) parity sheaves and Soergel bimodules. US researchers supported by this funding will have the opportunity to interact with some of the world's leading experts in the representation theory, as well as to make contacts with peer researchers from Australia and other nations.

The goal of the symposium is to promote and facilitate interdisciplinary research in mathematics and physics. The symposium will bring together talented researchers from a diverse  range of institutions and backgrounds to address pressing problems at the interface of algebraic/differential geometry, commutative algebra, and string theory. The symposium will consist of one day of invited plenary talks from leading researchers in the field, along with an afternoon of parallel sessions which will invite the contributions of junior and other researchers from around the world. The broader impacts of this event will include the training of graduate students and the increase of interdisciplinary dialog between mathematicians and physicists.<br/><br/>Since its inception in 2002 at the University of Oxford, the annual String Phenomenology conference series has grown immensely and become a focal point for researchers working across a wide range of topics in string theory, particle phenomenology, cosmology and mathematics. It provides a forum to bring together active, young researchers from around the world to address the pressing question - Can string theory provide a model of observable physics? However, any  path towards an answer to this question must lead to the cutting edge of modern mathematics. In string compactifications the unanswered questions of physics become those of geometry and lead to novel approaches to questions ranging from invariants of singular spaces to birational correspondences and the classification of algebraic varieties, from Mirror Symmetry to the Geometric Langlands program. A symposium to foster such interdsiciplinary dialog between mathematicians and physicists is timely and important. Topics covered by the symposium will include Differential Geometry, Algebraic Geometry, and Computational methods in Commutative Algebra.

A key unifying concept that links arithmetic and analysis is the notion of an L-function. There are two fundamentally different ways to define L-functions. One way is to count the number of solutions to certain polynomial equations modulo primes, and then to put the resulting numbers into a certain generating function. The other way is to start with highly symmetric solutions to certain differential equations on symmetric manifolds (automorphic forms) and then to define L-functions in terms of these solutions using analysis. The idea of reciprocity in the Langlands program is the conjecture that all L-functions defined in terms of polynomial equations can also be defined in terms of automorphic forms. This conjectural link is expected to have deep implications in both number theory and harmonic analysis.  This research project aims to further explore the reciprocity conjecture and its implications.<br/><br/>Some of the most basic interesting classes of L-functions in arithmetic arise from polynomial equations with integer coefficients in two variables (algebraic curves over the rational numbers). Associated to such a polynomial is an invariant g (the genus) which is a non-negative integer. If the genus g is zero, then the resulting L-function can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function, and reciprocity in this case follows from Riemann's work. If the genus g is one, then the reciprocity conjecture is equivalent to the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, now verified. The goal of this project is to make significant progress on the case when the genus g is two."

One powerful method of studying these spaces, which has seen exciting recent developments, is the method of degenerations. Applying this method allows to reduce complicated geometric objects to configurations of simple ones replacing some geometric aspects by combinatorial ones. Such degenerations can be useful for study of geometric problems: the very rough philosophy is that one studies the combinatorics (i.e., the discrete data) of the pieces in order to deduce things about the more complicated original space. The research supported by this award will center on using modern degeneration techniques, especially those from the field of tropical geometry, to study classical spaces from algebraic geometry. The main goal of tropical geometry is transforming questions about algebraic varieties into questions  about  polyhedral complexes. A process called tropicalization attaches a polyhedral complex to an algebraic variety. The polyhedral complex, a combinatorial object, encodes some of the geometry of the original algebraic variety. <br/><br/>The first main project involves using new techniques from tropical geometry and combinatorial topology to compute top-weight rational cohomology of the moduli space of curves, finding explicit new cohomology classes therein.  A complementary aspect of this project is to develop stack-theoretic foundations for tropical moduli spaces.  The second project studies the geometry of Brill-Noether varieties of curves, i.e. moduli spaces of linear series on curves.  The approach builds on recent advances in the moduli theory of limit linear series, and will yield a refined understanding of Brill-Noether varieties.  This project will also uncover further connections between Brill-Noether theory and the combinatorics of graphs and Young tableaux.  These connections are then amplified in the third main direction of research, which consists of several combinatorial investigations that will shed additional light on the close connection between graphs and algebraic curves."

These equations can turn out to be tremendously tricky to solve, sometimes resisting efforts for centuries.  A numerical invariant -- the genus -- of the curve can reveal quite a bit about the fundamental nature of its set of rational points.  Indeed, in 1922, Mordell conjectured that the set of rational points on curves of genus at least 2 is finite. This was proved nearly 60 years later by Faltings. However, Faltings' proof does not explicitly construct the finite set of rational points for these curves. Producing a constructive, algorithmic version of Faltings' theorem remains a challenging open problem in number theory. <br/><br/>The main aim of this project is to address this problem by giving new algorithms for explicitly finding rational points on certain higher genus curves via tools in iterated p-adic integration.  The PI will combine theoretical machinery and explicit computational techniques to prove results conjectured by the nonabelian Chabauty program.  Specifically, the PI will study methods situating the finite set of rational points in a slightly larger finite set of p-adic points coming from nonabelian Chabauty and will give practical algorithms for computing the p-adic functions cutting out these p-adic points. To facilitate this, the PI will use ideas from p-adic cohomology to produce fast algorithms for iterated p-adic integration."

More generally, a link is a collection of several such curves. Two links are equivalent if one can be transformed to another by a continuous deformation and/or stretching (without tearing). A link invariant is a quantity that does not change under the deformations of a link. Such invariants can be used to distinguish links and to study geometric properties of knots, and many powerful link invariants have been developed in recent decades. In another direction, the mathematical subject of algebraic geometry studies spaces described by polynomial equations and has applications in a wide range of fields, including statistics, control theory, and computer science. This project is focused on surprising interactions between the invariants of links and algebraic geometry that appear in two different mathematical frameworks. It is anticipated that the research will provide new perspectives on the relationships between low-dimensional topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and combinatorics.<br/><br/>In more detail, the first framework is classical: given a complex plane curve singularity, its intersection with a small sphere is a link. Similarly, for a complex surface singularity its link is a three-manifold. The investigator will the study the interactions between the algebraic properties of these curves and surfaces, and the Heegaard-Floer homology of their links. The second framework is less direct. The investigator and collaborators have conjectured that the Khovanov-Rozansky homology of links can be computed by studying the algebraic and geometric properties of the Hilbert scheme of points (the configuration space of points in four-dimensional space). The Hilbert scheme is well studied in algebraic geometry, representation theory and combinatorics, so this interpretation would yield explicit computations of Khovanov-Rozansky homology that were previously out of reach. In this project the investigator will develop the connection between knots and the Hilbert scheme, with the goals of computing these invariants for various classes of links and proving the conjecture."

Besides its original motivation, the theory of stability conditions has a much further reach, with connections to counting invariants, representation theory, homological mirror symmetry, and classical algebraic geometry. This project lies at the nexus of these areas; the theme is to apply Bridgeland stability condition techniques to solve questions arising from birational geometry and mathematical physics. A stability condition identifies a class of objects in the derived category, called stable objects, in an intrinsic way. Understanding if certain objects are stable or not gives important information on the geometry of algebraic varieties. A stability condition depends on the choice of certain parameters. Understanding how stable objects change by varying these parameters is the key to many applications of the theory and is the technical core of this project.<br/><br/>There are three main goals in the project. The first is to investigate the existence problem for Bridgeland stability conditions. A general framework for constructing Bridgeland stability conditions on threefolds was introduced by the investigator and collaborators, via certain conjectural inequalities. The new viewpoint is to look at fibrations in particular products, and to deduce such inequalities from the positivity of a certain divisor class on the base of the fibration. The second goal is to study stability conditions on non-commutative K3 surfaces and to use Bridgeland's theory to reinterpret and generalize geometric constructions, for example for cubic fourfolds, by using moduli spaces of Bridgeland stable objects. The third goal is to investigate whether such moduli spaces are ""well-behaved"" projective varieties in general and to study their local structure in the case of K3 surfaces. Applications include investigation of a conjecture on derived equivalences of birational irreducible holomorphic symplectic varieties."

It has long been known that in general one cannot hope to find exact solutions to polynomial equations, even for a single equation in one variable. Nevertheless, it is often possible to answer more qualitative questions about the set of solutions. In particular, one of the most fundamental and notoriously difficult questions in algebraic geometry is whether solutions exist at all. Motivic homotopy theory is a relatively new approach to such questions, and it has already helped solve many open problems in the past twenty years. It borrows many ideas and techniques from a different field of mathematics, topology, and successfully applies them to algebraic geometry in unexpected ways. Following this trend, this project aims to bring several fruitful ideas from topology to the world of algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>This project consists of two parts. In the first part, the PI will develop equivariant motivic homotopy theory from the point of view of parametrized homotopy theory. In the second part, the PI will study highly structured commutative algebras in motivic homotopy theory and hopes to address the problem of recognizing motivic loop spaces. More specifically, the PI will lay solid foundations for equivariant motivic homotopy theory by constructing Grothendieck's six-functor formalism for fiberwise homotopy theory over algebraic stacks. The mere existence of this formalism has interesting consequences for classical invariants of stacks, like algebraic K-theory; it can also be used to construct new well-behaved cohomological invariants of algebraic stacks, and to better understand the relations between them. In the second part of this project, the PI will introduce a motivic refinement of the notion of E_infinity ring and show that many classical cohomological invariants of algebraic varieties possess this refined multiplicative structure. The PI will also introduce the related notion of motivic E_infinity space and investigate their role in a potential recognition principle for infinite motivic loop spaces. To achieve these goals, the PI will use existing as well as new methods from equivariant algebraic geometry, ordinary motivic homotopy theory, classical algebraic topology, and higher category theory."

Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics studying geometric objects defined by polynomial equations and related mathematical structures. Classically one associates with such geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) the set of algebraic functions on them which forms a commutative ring (i.e., functions can be added and multiplied). The PI studies much more sophisticated algebraic structures associated with algebraic varieties, such as A-infinity algebras and derived categories of sheaves. In an A-infinity algebra, in addition to taking product of two elements, one has higher operations of multiplying together n-tuples of elements. These structures appeared independently in a very different way in works of Fukaya. The research is partly motivated by the desire to match different constructions of A-infinity algebras. The PI also intends to apply A-infinity structures to solve some problems in algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>The project will focus mostly on the following two topics: moduli spaces of A-infinity structures and moduli spaces related to algebraic curves. In the first part of the project the goal is to construct moduli spaces (i.e., parameter spaces) of A-infinity structures related to various moduli spaces of geometric objects (sometimes involving non-commutative geometry). In particular, the PI plans to construct moduli spaces of A-infinity algebras related to algebraic surfaces, double covers of non-commutative projective lines, noncommutative orders over curves, as well as moduli spaces of A-infinity modules related to birational transformations. The second part of the project is devoted to studying toric GIT picture for moduli spaces of curves with nonspecial divisors, as well as moduli spaces of curves with vector bundles on them and their non-commutative analogs. Also, the PI plans to study natural vector fields on the moduli spaces of curves with nonspecial divisors and use them to produce explicit rational functions on the moduli spaces of curves with no marked points."

The first problem is analyzing a conjectural geometric construction of supercuspidal representations of p-adic groups proposed by Lusztig in 1979.  Lusztig's construction can be viewed as a special case of automorphic induction.  While automorphic induction has been constructed in many special cases, the existing approaches are quite complicated and often rely on global methods.  Lusztig's construction is much more elegant, but the questions of formalizing it and comparing it to the more classical constructions of p-adic representation theory remain completely open.  It is expected that the results obtained by the principal investigator will shed light on the geometry that underlies the known cases of automorphic induction.  The second problem was formulated by M. Harris in 2002.  It asks for a construction of Bushnell-Kutzko types for the general linear group of a local field K in the cohomology of suitable analytic subspaces of the Lubin-Tate tower of K.  The principal investigator studies a family of open affinoids in the Lubin-Tate tower whose cohomology is expected to realize various special cases of the local Langlands and Jacquet-Langlands correspondences (which will partially answer Harris's question).  The relevant cohomology computations have much in common with the examples of p-adic Lusztig induction that have so far been understood.<br/><br/>The Langlands Program has dominated much of research in algebra during the last 40 years. It has connections to some of the most prominent results in number theory and other areas of mathematics, such as Fermat's Last Theorem. The principal investigator works in a branch of this field known as the local Langlands program.  It is concerned with the representation theory of the so-called p-adic groups, and the main driving force is the search for a general proof of the local Langlands correspondence.  Various special cases of this correspondence have been obtained by Henniart, Harris, Taylor and many other mathematicians.  However, most of the existing proofs are not explicit and do not provide sufficient information for the desirable applications of the local Langlands correspondence.  The principal investigator uses methods of geometric representation theory for unipotent groups, developed in his previous works, to give new explicit constructions of the local Langlands correspondence, and to simplify and clarify the existing ones.  One of the main tools is a conjectural geometric construction of representations of p-adic groups formulated by Lusztig in 1979.  Until recently this construction has remained relatively unknown because it was not clear how to compare it to the more classical constructions.  The principal investigator developed general techniques for analyzing this construction, and is currently using it to shed light on the geometry behind the local Langlands correspondence."

The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties, geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. The variation of algebraic varieties of a given type is captured by ""moduli spaces,"" whose points represent these algebraic varieties. This project is centered on moduli spaces whose points represent stable pointed rational curves, themselves algebraic varieties with a very rich structure. These moduli spaces form building blocks for more complex moduli spaces that play a key role in theoretical physics. The project has three different themes, related to the classification of algebraic varieties, establishing new connections with number theory, and deepening connections with physics. The ultimate goal is a broader understanding of algebraic varieties from three different perspectives. <br/><br/>The projects stem from open questions surrounding the moduli space M(0,n): what are its effective cycles, what is its arithmetic intersection theory, and what is its derived category. A first project concerns the birational geometry of blow-ups of toric varieties. Until recently, very little was known about the failure of the Mori Dream Space property for blow-ups of toric varieties at a single general point. With recent new techniques, there is hope for further progress towards longstanding open questions on linear systems of curves on surfaces. The investigator also aims to develop the Arakelov theory of M(0,n) and establish a connection with birational geometry. Finally, the project aims to construct equivariant, full, exceptional collections on M(0,n) and related moduli spaces. Applications include an explicit understanding of the derived category of a range of other algebraic varieties."

The Riemann hypothesis asserts that the non-integer zeros lie on a line. The Riemann Zeta function is an example of an L-function. This is a project to study zeroes of general L-functions. <br/><br/>In more detail, a Siegel zero is a type of potential counterexample to the (generalized) Riemann hypothesis on the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions connected to the study of the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions. In the main part of this project, based on Sarnak's method, a novel technique will be used to derive the standard zero-free regions for general L-functions. This new technique combines the use of Maass-Selberg relations on higher rank groups which is expected to remove the technical sieve arguments in Sarnak's work. The new technique will also shed light on the classical Siegel zero problem as mentioned above. Other projects include the study of equidistribution of Maass forms on higher rank groups and spectral identities for L-functions.

For example, the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem. While it is straightforward to find all right triangles whose side lengths are rational numbers, it perhaps surprisingly remains an unsolved problem to determine which whole numbers can be the area of a right triangle with rational sides. Number theory has many important practical applications. For instance, most cellular telephone calls are protected by a code based on elliptic curves, one of the primary objects of study in the Langlands program, the principal investigator's area of research.<br/><br/>Significant progress has been made in recent decades towards understanding Langlands's conjectural reciprocity between automorphic forms and Galois representations. Techniques for proving reciprocity laws generally require the consideration of p-adic families of Galois representations. Three projects to investigate p-adic families of Galois representations will be undertaken. The first project will produce moduli stacks of certain Galois representations in which the residual representation is allowed to vary. This will open up the possibility of proving results in the Langlands program by establishing them generically on these spaces. The second project, on Breuil's local-global compatibility conjecture for types in the p-adic Langlands program, will be a demonstration of this technique. A third project is to study the weight part of Serre's conjecture for GL(n), for n larger than 2, in non-generic cases."

Closely related to this study is the concept of a free resolution, which was first introduced by David Hilbert in two papers in 1890 and 1893. Constructing a free resolution amounts to repeatedly solving systems of polynomial equations. The study of these objects flourished in the second half of the twentieth century, and has seen spectacular progress in the last ten years.

Geometry is perhaps the oldest part of mathematics, and number theory, the study of equations and their solutions in whole numbers, is hardly younger.  Yet it is only in the very recent history of mathematics that researchers have understood just how interrelated these subjects are and how much they have to offer each other.  One example is the ""cap set problem,"" related to the popular card game Set.  In the game, one asks:  how many cards is it possible to have on the table with no legal play?  It turns out that this problem has to do with the geometry of points and lines in 4-dimensional space, with equations among numbers and their last base-3 digit, and the relation between these.  In 2016 the PI was part of a major breakthrough on this old problem, and his proposed research will continue investigating the new ideas that led to progress as well as other projects mixing number theory and geometry.<br/> <br/>The proposal covers several areas in number theory, algebraic geometry, topology, combinatorics, and applied math, in collaboration with a wide group of fellow researchers, including graduate students.  One of the central questions of arithmetic statistics is: how many number fields are there of discriminant at most X? More particularly: how many of these have Galois group G for a specified subgroup G of a symmetric group S_n? A famous conjecture of Malle proposes a description for the asymptotic behavior of this count as X grows.   Many of the major themes in contemporary number theory (e.g. Bhargava's work on counting quartic and quintic extensions, progress on Cohen-Lenstra conjectures) concern cases of this conjecture. In previous work, the PI showed that the Cohen-Lenstra conjecture over the function field F_q(t) could be approached by the methods of algebraic topology, using Grothendieck's theory of etale cohomology as the bridge between the two subjects. Now the PI proposes to prove the upper bound in the Malle conjecture in the case K = F_q(t), again using a combination of topological and arithmetic methods, but now with input from the theory of quantum shuffle algebras.   In another project, the PI proposes to investigate the analogy between Malle's conjectures and the Batyrev-Manin conjectures, which study the asymptotics for rational points with bounded height on algebraic varieties. The height is a natural notion of complexity of an algebraic point just as the discriminant is for a number field.  Here, the technical bridge is the theory of algebraic stacks; the PI will develop a theory of rational points of bounded height on Deligne-Mumford stacks, which first of all requires defining the height of a point on a stack. In particular, the discriminant of a number field is the height (in the novel sense) of a point on the classifying stack of a finite group. The PI will formulate a generalized Batyrev-Manin conjecture for stacks, which specializes to both Malle's conjecture and the Batyrev-Manin conjecture. The PI will also investigate properties of the new definition: for instance, the PI will aim to prove that the Faltings height is actually height on the moduli stack of abelian varieties in this sense.  The PI also proposes problems in additive combinatorics, the homology of FI-modules, and the geometry of machine learning."

The core idea of the Langlands phenomenon is that some basic symmetry laws that arise naturally in mathematics come in pairs, known as Langlands dual pairs. It has been observed empirically that mathematical constructions that obey one set of symmetry laws are equivalent to fundamentally different constructions for the dual symmetry laws. The goals of this project are to formalize and make mathematically rigorous the underlying structures responsible for this duality in the case of the geometric Langlands correspondence.<br/><br/>In more detail, it has become clear that in order to understand the  geometric Langlands correspondence, one should perform a quantum deformation, in which case the roles of the group and its Langlands dual become more symmetric, that is, there is no more ""automorphic vs. Galois"", but rather ""twisted automorphic vs. twisted automorphic."" After performing the quantum deformation, one sees that at the origin of the geometric Langlands correspondence should be a certain equivalence of local categories, proposed by J. Lurie and the PI several years ago: this is the equivalence of the Whittaker category (for a group G) vs the Kazhdan-Luztig category (for the Langlands dual of G).  This project will establish this equivalence and develop its consequences."

Further information on these meetings including the locations, dates, lists of speakers, lists of participants, and registration information will be linked to the conference home pages as it becomes available.  The conferences slated for 2017 will be the 28th and 29th meetings of the Palmetto Number Theory Series (http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html). PANTS is a series of number theory conferences that was founded in 2006 and is managed jointly by Clemson University and the University of South Carolina, the two flagship research institutions in South Carolina, the Palmetto State. The 31st meeting of the Southeast Regional Meeting on Numbers (http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON/) will be held in spring 2018.  SERMON is a larger regional meeting founded in 1988; SERMON rotates to schools in a larger geographical region than PANTS. Recent meetings of SERMON have averaged 40 - 60 participants. PANTS and SERMON consist of participant talks on current research in all areas of number theory, including analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms. These topics reflect the research interests of number theorists working in the Southeast. Each PANTS meeting features plenary talks by nationally and internationally recognized leaders in the field, invited talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and a larger number of contributed talks by mathematicians at all levels including undergraduate and graduate students, and junior and senior faculty.  Number theorists from outside the Southeast will give the invited and plenary talks, while regional researchers will give most of the contributed talks.  SERMON in spring 2018 will feature exclusively contributed talks.  <br/><br/>The Palmetto Number Theory Series and the Southeastern Regional Meeting on Numbers provide the Southeastern number theory community with a forum to disseminate their own research as well as to learn about new and significant results in number theory.  Students and junior faculty play a prominent role in the meetings both through delivering talks as well as by forming research collaborations to others in the region as well as plenary speakers. Funding from the NSF allows the organizers to achieve their goals at a low cost to individual participants. These meetings integrate regional mathematicians into the community who may have little or no funds for professional travel such as graduate students and faculty at institutions that do not award Ph.Ds.

The ""Functoriality Conjectures"" lie at the heart of the Langlands program. These are deep conjectures having far-reaching consequences both in number theory and the theory of automorphic forms. For instance, the celebrated proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by A. Wiles uses a case of functoriality conjectures proved earlier by Langlands and Tunnell. Although significant progress has been made towards these conjectures, in their utmost generality they are wide open. This research project aims to develop tools and techniques to prove further cases of functoriality conjectures. <br/><br/>One of the most general and power tools in the theory of automorphic forms is the Arthur-Selberg trace formula. It has been successfully used in proving cases of functoriality conjectures. In all of these cases it is a comparison between two different trace formulas that was utilized. In a recent proposal called ""Beyond Endoscopy"" Langlands proposed a new approach to attack the functoriality conjectures in general. It is a fundamentally new approach aiming to analyze poles of automorphic L-functions using the trace formula and, in particular, is non-comparative. There are various difficulties, intrinsic to the discrete part of the trace formula, that need to be addressed before utilizing it in Beyond Endoscopy.

In this project, the PI seeks to study modular forms, fundamental mathematical objects which appear in multiple branches of mathematics. The PI aims to focus his study on a newly discovered extremal instance of this object in an effort to deepen our understanding of classical modular forms akin to how understanding x-rays and radio waves allows us to deepen our understanding of visible light.<br/><br/>More precisely, the recent work of Andreatta, Iovita, and Pilloni has produced extended eigenvarities which contain additional points sitting over characteristic p weights.

For instance, he aims to deduce a characteristic p main conjecture from the characteristic 0 main conjecture, and in good situations show that these conjectures are actually equivalent."

As an example, there are eight symmetries of a square, consisting of transformations like ""rotate by 90 degrees,"" or ""reflect across a diagonal line,"" and combinations of these.  Each of these symmetries represents a transformation of the plane that leaves the square unchanged, and we say that the transformations of the plane form a representation of the symmetry group of the square. The symmetries of the square and other polygons are special examples of a family of groups called Coxeter groups, which capture and generalize the intuitive notion of a reflection group. In recent decades, mathematicians have discovered a rich theory of representations in which the object being acted on is not a plane (or some higher dimensional analogue), but rather a more structured sort of object, called a category.  This project is concerned with the categorical representation theory of Coxeter groups and some closely related objects, called Hecke algebras, and connections to other areas of mathematics, such as the study of knots and links in topology.<br/><br/>In more detail, three interrelated objects will be studied: (a) categories of Soergel bimodules, (b) Hilbert schemes of points in the plane, and (c) Khovanov-Rozansky link homology.  First, the investogator will continue to develop the theory of categorical diagonalization and apply the results to the categorified representation theory of Hecke algebras and quantum groups. This includes work on the categorified Casimir operator.  As an application of categorical diagonalization, the full-twist Rouquier complex acting on categories of Soergel bimodules will be diagonalized, extending work already accomplished in type A.  The resulting eigendecompositions present a method for approaching recent conjectures of Gorsky, Negut, and Rasmussen regarding a deep correspondence between Soergel bimodules and Hilbert schemes. The investigator will utilize categorical diagonalization, as well as recent computational breakthroughs, to work toward a proof of this correspondence.  Finally, the Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen correspondence makes several predictions regarding the structure of the triply graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology, which the investigator will explore using insights from the connection with Hilbert schemes."

It arises in many scientific inquiries, for example, in questions about the shape of the universe, symmetry of chemical structures, and in quantum computing. Cohomology is a tool that pulls apart representation-theoretic information into smaller, more easily understandable components. The PI's research in cohomology and in representation theory aims at answering hard questions about fundamental structures arising in many mathematical and scientific settings. Her research program impacts that of many other mathematicians, particularly the students and postdocs that she mentors. She leads research teams both at her university and internationally, she co-organizes conferences in her research area, and she is writing a book at an advanced graduate level.<br/><br/>This project concerns several inter-related problems on the structure of Hochschild cohomology and Hopf algebra cohomology, and on applications in representation theory and algebraic deformation theory. Hochschild cohomology of an associative ring has a Lie structure that is an important tool and yet is difficult to manage. Some of this difficulty was recently overcome through work of the PI and others in developing new techniques for understanding the Lie structure in terms of arbitrary resolutions. This opens the door to much more potential progress in understanding the structure of Hochschild cohomology, for example, to making connections to other descriptions such as by coderivations and loops on extension spaces. The PI will also work on related questions in deformation theory. Another part of this project concerns a finite generation conjecture in Hopf algebra cohomology. The PI will prove the conjecture for some important classes of Hopf algebras using a variety of techniques, including resolutions for twisted tensor products and the Anick resolution. The PI will work on related support varieties for understanding questions about representations of these Hopf algebras and related categories, using techniques she is developing with a postdoc for handling module categories over tensor categories."

Topological phases of matter, the importance of which has been recognized by scientific awards that include the 2016 Nobel prize in physics, exhibit many-body quantum entanglement. This makes such materials prime candidates for use in a quantum computer.  Topological quantum computation is maturing at the forefront of the second quantum revolution as a primary application of topological phases of matter. The theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution remains under development, but it appears clear that algebras and their representations will play a role analogous to that played by group theory in the first quantum revolution. This focused research group aims to formulate the theoretical foundations of topological quantum computation, leading to an eventual theoretical foundation for the second quantum revolution. It is anticipated that the results of the research will guide and accelerate the construction of a topological quantum computer. A working topological quantum computer will fundamentally transform the landscape of information science and technology. The project includes participation by graduate students and postdoctoral associates in the interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>The goal of topological quantum computation is the construction of a useful quantum computer based on braiding anyons. The hardware of an anyonic quantum computer will be a topological phase of matter that harbors non-abelian anyons. A physical system is in a topological phase if at low energies some physical quantities are topologically invariant. Topological properties are non-local, yet can manifest themselves through local geometric properties. The success of topological quantum computation hinges on controlling topological phases and understanding their computational power. This research addresses the mathematical, physical, and computational aspects of topological quantum computation. The projects include classification of super-modular categories, vector-valued modular forms for modular categories, extension of modular categories to three dimensions, simulation of conformal field theories, topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries and symmetry defects, and universality of topological computing models. The research has potential impacts ranging from new understanding of vertex operator algebras to the development of useful quantum computers. One specific goal is a structure theory of modular categories analogous to that of finite groups. Such a theory would lead to a structure theory of two-dimensional topological phases of matter."

For example, an infinite sequence of numbers might be compactly encoded as the values of a simple function. One such occurrence relevant to this project is the set of dimensions of a sequence of spaces. In many cases of interest, it may not be possible to directly compute these numbers, but one can instead analyze their rate of growth. An old theme in mathematics has been to understand such problems by finding some algebraic structure on the sequence. Recently, several groups of researchers have found new, exotic algebraic structures that apply to previously unexpected examples of such sequences in areas such as topology, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. The time is right for a deeper study of these structures. This project will develop such a study through targeted applications to new classes of examples which have been selected for novelty, either in settings or technical details.<br/><br/>The PI will pursue several projects that involve different kinds of categorical and classical symmetries in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The general theme of the research is to find and exploit hidden symmetries in a problem to gain new information about it. This information can take the form of a new structural property or a finiteness result about a family of invariants. This research will focus in particular on several classes of mathematical objects for which these properties or calculation of invariants have resisted more traditional means of attack. Among these are: the action of ordered injections on the homology of groups of upper-triangular matrices, the action of surjections on the cohomology of compactified moduli spaces, and Hopf ring actions on syzygies of secant varieties of varieties arising from multilinear algebra. These are three examples of variants of the recently well-studied ""FI-modules,"" which offer new technical challenges and open the door to new paradigms of ""representation stability."""
