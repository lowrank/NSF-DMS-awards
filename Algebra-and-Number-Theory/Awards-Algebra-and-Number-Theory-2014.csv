Algebraic geometry is a dynamic subject with vital connections to physics, applied mathematics, and fields such as number theory, differential geometry and representation theory. The Northeastern United States are a particular nexus, with a density of researchers and an output rivaling any region in the world. AGNES weekend workshops bring together a spectrum of algebraic geometers from the region and beyond, as well as representatives from allied fields invigorating algebraic geometry. There is diversity both in speakers and participants, from senior experts to burgeoning young researchers. There is a special emphasis on students: AGNES hosts ""students-only"" introductory pre-talks, as well as professional development sessions. Through lectures, panels, problem sessions, poster sessions, and informal discussion periods, AGNES informs the community of developments, AGNES fosters new research collaborations, and AGNES trains junior algebraic geometers.<br/><br/>Algebraic geometers study the geometry of shapes defined by the polynomial equations of Algebra. In fact, the geometric shapes occurring in nature -- in science, in engineering, etc. -- are frequently ""algebraic"", explaining the vital importance of algebraic geometry in physics and applied mathematics. This grant promotes research, dissemination and training in algebraic geometry through a series of conferences held throughout the Northeastern United States. There is an emphasis on supporting graduate students, highlighting the broad array of work in the area and its many connections to allied areas, and fostering communication in our broad research community.<br/><br/>AGNES website is available at http://www.agneshome.org/"

The PIs will build upon their previous collaborations to continue a systematic study of multiple cluster structures in coordinate rings of Poisson-Lie groups and a number of other varieties of importance in algebraic geometry, representation theory and mathematical physics and study an interaction between corresponding cluster algebras. The proposed research is linked to the development of undergraduate and graduate courses and research projects. Synergistic activities are planned with the goal to promote inter-institutional and inter-departmental cooperation, to attract graduate students from underrepresented groups and with diverse educational backgrounds, and, through community outreach, to expose high school students to mathematical research. <br/><br/>The PIs will continue their work on applications of Poisson Geometry to the theory of cluster algebras. The main goals of the project include construction and study of (i) exotic cluster structures on simple Lie groups compatible with Poisson-Lie brackets described by the Belavin-Drinfeld classification; (ii) generalized cluster structures on the Drinfeld double and the Poisson-Lie dual of a simple Poisson-Lie group; (iii) combinatorics and inverse problems for higher genus nets dual to quivers arising in cluster structures above; (iv) discrete integrable systems arising as sequences of cluster transformations and elementary transformations of higher genus networks; (v) continuous limits for directed networks with applications to moduli spaces of flat connections."

Representation theory, a method to codify information about groups and algebras through matrix realizations, has played a fundamental role in mathematics over the past one hundred years. Modern trends in representation theory have involved using tools from topology (i.e., cohomology) and algebraic geometry to package the representations of an algebraic object via the tensor product structure to connect the representation theory to ambient geometric structures. This project will use these deep interactions between the representations, the geometry, and the cohomology as a powerful device to prove new results about these algebraic structures and to answer important questions pertaining to geometric and homological invariants (like the complexity and atypicality) for these representations. The PI will organize conferences in algebra with an emphasis toward the development of junior mathematicians, and he will disseminate working knowledge of modern methods in representation theory through lectures at seminars, workshops, and summer schools.<br/><br/>This project explores central problems of interest in the representation theory of reductive algebraic groups, Lie algebras, and Lie superalgebras. This study includes discovering new conjectures about the characters of simple modules for reductive algebraic groups in positive characteristic, and classical Lie superalgebras in characteristic zero. The determination of formulas for extensions between irreducible representations for finite Chevalley groups and loop algebras will also be explored. In this investigation, the PI will make use of tensor triangulated geometry and other geometric constructions in triangulated categories to compute cohomological invariants (e.g. cohomology groups, module varieties) of representations for the aforementioned algebraic objects."

Its mathematical scope involves number theory, representation theory, and algebraic geometry and relates to what is now known as the Geometric Langlands Program.  Robert Langlands in the 1960's proposed a program, which is a culmination of a sequence of theorems in number theory that began with the quadratic reciprocity theorem, proved by Gauss around 1800.  Alexander Beilinson and Vladimir Drinfeld suggested a geometric version of the Langlands program, in which they brought the ideas of Langlands together with tools and ideas from other areas of mathematics and physics: algebraic geometry, sheaf theory, moduli spaces, integrable systems, and many others. Later, Anton Kapustin and Edward Witten in a breakthrough paper related the Geometric Langlands Program to supersymmetry and electro-magnetic duality. The central objects in the two projects are principal bundles for reductive algebraic groups; the PI plans to study certain questions about them in the context of the Geometric Langlands Program.<br/><br/>In the first project, partly in collaboration with Ivan Panin, the PI will apply techniques of the Geometric Langlands Program (namely, affine Grassmannians) to the local study of principal bundles.  A principal bundle (that is, a torsor) for a reductive group scheme is not necessarily trivial in the Zariski topology.  However, a conjecture of Grothendieck and Serre predicts that it is trivial if it is rationally trivial and the base is smooth.  This conjecture is already proved in certain cases, but the PI aims to prove it in wider generality.  The PI also plans to describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for extending a principal bundle over the fraction field to a neighborhood of a closed point.  The second project, partly in collaboration with Dmitry Arinkin, is aimed at proving the quasi-classical version of the categorical Langlands correspondence.  This is the equivalence between the derived category of the Hitchin integrable system for a reductive group and the derived category of the Hitchin system for the Langlands dual group.  This should be viewed as an extension of the Fourier-Mukai transform for abelian varieties to singular degenerations of abelian varieties.  There are strong indications that a proof of the duality for Hitchin systems will help with the proof of the original Geometric Langlands conjectures."

Many of the proposed topics of research are inspired by homotopy theory, which also serves as a source of intuition, and of techniques, for dealing with them. Broadly speaking, the recurrent theme in the project is the interplay of three topics: commutative algebra; differential graded algebras and modules; and triangulated categories. While differential graded algebras and triangulated category methods have long been used successfully in commutative algebra, the PI and his collaborators, among others, have been adapting classical constructions and methods from commutative algebra (for example, local cohomology, and derived completions) to the context of differential graded algebras and triangulated categories, with striking returns in the representation theory of finitely dimensional algebra, notably, group algebras, and in commutative algebra itself. This proposal seeks to further develop these, and in new directions.<br/><br/>A number of rather diverse algebraic structures---this means, loosely speaking, not directly involving any notions from calculus like continuity or rate of change---have been developed in mathematics to model phenomenon in the (physical) world. Two examples particularly relevant to this proposal are groups and their representations, that are remarkably well-adapted to capture phenomenon involving symmetry, and rings, especially those that arise as rings of functions on various geometric objects like manifolds or solution sets of polynomial equations. However, it was only a few years ago that it was realized that if we enhance a ring by the most primitive structure from calculus, namely, a derivative, then it becomes possible to uniformly capture much of the information encoded in these various algebraic structures. Interestingly, these still rather mysterious hybrid structures, called differential graded algebras, emerged as important tools in algebraic topology already in the early 1950s. Differential graded algebras can be seen as bridges that relate various algebraic and geometric contexts in mathematics and mathematical physics. This has had the effect that methods developed in one field have profoundly influenced a host of others, and new connections among them have been discovered. Differential graded algebras are, in general, rather complicated, but there are interesting classes that appear to be amenable to methods developed in commutative ring theory, a classical topic with a large and well-developed body of tools and techniques. The broad aim of this proposal is to investigate differential graded algebras from this perspective. Besides deepening our knowledge of them, the proposed research is expected to have impact on commutative algebra, representation theory, and related fields."

It is only recently, in the past few decades, that primes have proved useful in cryptography, where it is often important to generate large primes. For instance, one can program a computer to find the first prime with 100 digits. Knowing how long this takes in general amounts to studying the distribution of the prime numbers. This distribution is intimately connected to properties of the Riemann zeta function, the most basic example of a so-called L-function. The PI will study many of the statistical properties of the Riemann zeta function and other more general L-functions. <br/><br/>This project will study analytic properties of L-functions and automorphic forms. For instance, the PI plans to study the quantum unique ergodicity conjecture in some new contexts such as in higher rank and along an arbitrary curve. The PI has had prior success for the Eisenstein series restricted to a particular geodesic in the upper half plane. These problems fit into the general setting of how eigenfunctions of the Laplacian behave as the eigenvalue grows large, a topic of great interest in geometry, mathematical physics, etc. However, in the arithmetical setting these problems are related to quantitative analytic properties of L-functions."

For certain types of polynomials, understanding these solutions has important applications, ranging from engineering to biology to elliptic curve cryptography.  It is still a very difficult question to determine how many solutions an arbitrary polynomial equation might have, especially if one looks specifically for solutions lying in the natural numbers or the rational numbers. A simple example of this phenomenon is Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that there are no positive integer solutions to an equation of the form an n-th power is equal to the sum of two n-th powers if n is an integer larger than 2, so for example a cube of a positive integer cannot be equal to the sum of two cubes of positive integers.  While the theorem is easy to state, the method of proof involves many deep ideas in number theory and arithmetic geometry, including the idea of studying many such polynomial equations all at once (the idea of ""moduli spaces"").  The PI intends to study such spaces and use them to understand properties of certain types of polynomials and associated geometric objects, such as elliptic curves.<br/><br/>The PI works in the intersection of three fields: number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory.  The main theme of this proposal involves the use of representation theory to explicitly construct moduli spaces in algebraic geometry; these constructions also may be applied to solve counting problems in number theory by using geometry-of-numbers techniques.  The PI intends to use methods and tools developed in all of these subjects over the last hundred years, including constructions from classical algebraic geometry, ideas from Lie theory, and sieve techniques from analytic number theory."

The subject is also closely related to topics in computer science.  Fundamental questions include determining whether or not the set of integral solutions is finite, and if so how to explicitly compute the set of such solutions.  The introduction of powerful geometric ideas and concepts into the subject has led to major advances and a wide-ranging and deeper understanding of the basic problems.  From this geometric viewpoint, this research project aims to enhance our understanding of these difficult and fundamental problems by substantially extending the known results, techniques, and tools.  In addition to research activities, the PI will organize and initiate student-faculty research projects for a select group of undergraduate students at Michigan State University.  The research projects will be enhanced by an undergraduate colloquium series and funded conference travel for the undergraduate students.  The PI will continue his close involvement with graduate education and mentor graduate students and postdocs, suggesting problems related to the proposed research strands.<br/><br/>The PI will study several interrelated problems revolving around the study of integral points on varieties.  First, the PI will examine the problem of generalizing Siegel's theorem for integral points on curves to higher-dimensional varieties, along the lines of the PI's conjectures.  In a second project, the PI will study integral points of bounded degree on curves.  Then, in a different direction, aspects of the problem of effectively computing integral points on varieties will be studied, both for curves and higher-dimensional varieties.  Fundamental tools for studying integral (or rational) points on varieties come from the subject of Diophantine approximation.  One such key tool is Schmidt's Subspace Theorem.  The PI will continue his recent work on proving generalizations of Schmidt's theorem, with a Schmidt-Wirsing type conjecture for algebraic points as an ultimate goal.  The PI will study several ""uniform boundedness"" conjectures in arithmetic dynamics, a subject well-suited for applications of the above techniques and results.  Lastly, by work of Vojta and others, there exists a surprising correspondence between statements and theorems in Diophantine approximation and statements and theorems in Nevanlinna theory.  The PI plans to study the analogues of the above problems in Nevanlinna theory, with the hope of enriching both subjects."

The object of this FRG project is to generalize this theory to higher Chern classes. One component of this generalization concerns how to define higher Chern classes in a way that facilitates studying them by L-series. This will be done by extending to the context of Iwasawa theory the adelic methods of Parshin and Beilinson. Another component of the generalization has to do with connecting higher Chern class invariants to L-series.  To do this, one needs enough structure in the arithmetic problem to see into its higher codimension features using L-series. Three particular cases will be considered are (i) Greenberg's conjecture over totally real fields, (ii) Iwasawa theory for imaginary quadratic fields at split primes, and (iii) the function field case.  Concerning (i), Greenberg has conjectured that the natural Iwasawa modules have trivial support in codimension one;  the PIs will study their codimension two support using L-series. Concerning (ii), work of Rubin, and of Kings and Johnson-Leung, suggests that one should study second Chern classes via symbols in K_2 groups associated to pairs of p-adic L-series.  Concerning (iii), the PIs will study the images under Chern class maps of classes defined by Witte in the function field case inside the higher relative K-groups of Iwasawa algebras.  One further component of this project has to do with generalizing to higher Chern classes the reduction techniques used in proving first Chern class Main Conjectures. This involves generalizing to Iwasawa algebras the theory of tilting complexes and derived equivalences which is used in group representation theory and in studying Fourier-Mukai functors.<br/><br/>This proposal deals with fundamental questions about the groups of symmetries of algebraic equations.  In the 1950's, Iwasawa began a new approach to the study of such equations by considering their behavior in infinite families. Iwasawa showed that many such families have well defined asymptotic behavior. This led to fundamental conjectures concerning the numerical growth rate of the symmetry groups arising from such families.  The proof of such ""Main Conjectures"" has been one of the  central goals of abstract algebra over the last 50 years.  This proposal has to do with the refinements of these conjectures which deal with more precise measures of rates of growth.  Concerning broad impacts, work on algebraic questions of this kind  has led to the development of technology essential to society, such as the improved compression and secure transmission of data."

At the core of algebraic geometry is the quest for classification of algebraic varieties, which are sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations (or various generalizations of this concept). Classification roughly splits into two parts: birational classification, in which varieties that look alike almost everywhere are organized in the same class, and moduli theory, where continuous deformations of varieties are studied. The minimal model program is the major tool for the birational classification of algebraic varieties, and it has important applications to the theory of moduli. Designed over the model of classification of surfaces, the minimal model program has become one of the major trends in algebraic geometry, earning S. Mori the Fields Medal for work on three dimensional varieties. Recently, there has been groundbreaking progress which brings the subject very close to a complete program in all dimensions. There are however many fundamental questions that still remain unanswered, and some of these constitute the main objectives of this research project. The local study of algebraic varieties and their singularities is a natural component of this study.<br/><br/>The project has two main objectives. The first objective concerns a conjecture of Shokurov from 1988 which predicts that a certain local invariant of singularities, known as the minimal log discrepancy, varies semicontinuously. This property is closely connected to a conjecture on termination of flips which has implications to the minimal model program, and relates to a series of specific questions concerning the geometry of spaces of arcs and their connections to valuation spaces and Berkovich analytic spaces. The second objective deals with multiplier ideals on algebraic varieties. There are various notions of multiplier ideals on singular varieties, and the PI will explore a unifying approach which incorporates all theories and explains their connections. This part of the project contains various applications, from a Reider-type theorem on the global generation of twists of the dualizing sheaf of a normal surface, to the comparisons between certain notions of singularities defined in characteristic zero and in positive characteristics. The project also includes educational activities and other broader impacts. These include the participation in outreach programs, various forms of dissemination including the writing of a book on the birational geometry of algebraic varieties, and the organization of several activities at various levels, ranging from undergraduate summer schools to international conferences."

The second topic is the theory of arithmetic functions, especially as it connects with probabilistic number theory. One problem to be considered is that of obtaining error bounds in a classical theorem of Erdos and Wintner. Finally, Pollack will continue his studies of the distribution of irreducible polynomials over finite fields, with particular attention paid to problems motivated by rational prime number theory. For instance, Pollack will study special configurations of irreducible polynomials, including analogues of the prime k-tuples conjecture and the Bateman--Horn conjecture."

There are further connections of number theory with physical theories such as conformal field theory through modular forms. Number theory structure appears in some exactly solvable models of phase transitions in physical models. The proposal investigates several  possible areas of contact between fields, which may lead to fruitful interactions with researchers in physics and material sciences.

The first, and main, topic continues the investigation of  the Lerch zeta function, which is a function of three variables, that on specializing variables yields  the Hurwitz zeta function and Riemann zeta function. A connection is made with the representation theory of the Heisenberg group and related groups, and the project aims  to connect it  more closely to automorphic representations on various groups. A  second topic concerns two exploratory projects; one concerns  a certain family of virtual representations of the symmetric groups, which arises as a degenerate limit of splitting properties of polynomials (modulo p), associated to properties of the discriminant locus of the polynomial. It asks if there is an underlying geometric structure explaining the observed limit properties, possibly with an associated dynamical system. Another exploratory project   studies  polyharmonic modular forms, which are functions with modular invariance  that are annihilated by a power of the Laplacian. A   third topic is to investigate  of   circle packings on Riemann surfaces, a topic in the area of discrete geometry. It considers formulation of  scaling limits of such packings in two directions, a complex variables limit and a Diophantine approximation limit. Whether or not this can be done precisely,  special questions are proposed to initially investigate these areas, including study  of surfaces having rigid packings with a finite number of circles."

For example, Mel Hochster's direct summand conjecture, which posits the existence of some fundamental properties of regular rings, has been an important open problem in commutative algebra for over four decades; the solution to the equal characteristic case (due to Hochster from the 70s) is responsible for large swathes of modern commutative algebra, while the p-adic case remains tantalizingly open. The PI recently discovered that some ideas from p-adic Hodge theory (due to Faltings) can be used solve certain unknown cases of this conjecture. The PI intends to pursue this direction further by using powerful recent techniques --- chiefly Scholze's beautiful theory of perfectoid spaces --- from the fast evolving subject of p-adic Hodge theory to approach the direct summand conjecture and other purely algebraic problems. Conversely, previous work of the PI on the direct summand conjecture, coupled with some derived algebraic geometry, has recently proven instrumental in arriving at a significant simplification of certain geometric aspects of p-adic Hodge theory; the PI plans to develop the derived aspects more thoroughly to conceptualize the picture better.<br/><br/><br/>The study of solutions of polynomials with integer coefficients dates back to antiquity. An extremely useful technique here is to study ""approximate"" solutions first, i.e., solutions modulo primes, and then modulo powers of primes. The idea is that as the power of prime increases, the approximation becomes better. Grothendieck's revolutionization of mathematics in the last half century not only allows one to not only attach a precise meaning to the previous statement, but also provides a beautiful geometric context --- the world of p-adic geometry ---- to study such approximate solutions. This context has been at the heart of numerous recent advances in mathematics (such as Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem and other recent milestones in the Langlands program). The PI plans to contribute further to underlying geometric theory as well as develop applications to purely algebraic problems."

The purpose of this conference is to gather international experts to share experiences in how computation has impacted their research in number theory (broadly understood), to present cutting-edge results, and to discuss the future role of computation in number theory. Support from this award will partially defray the expenses of the invited speakers and invited participants from the US.<br/><br/>Calculation has always played a significant role in number theory. Beginning in the middle of the last century and continuing today, machine computation has played an increasingly prominent role.  Many important statements in number theory, like the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer and the formula of Gross and Zagier, were formulated based on extensive data collected from computation.  In situations where we lack a deeper understanding, such as in Grothendieck's theory of dessins d'enfants, the only way to gain understanding is to compute examples first.  It is hoped that this conference will shed light on how important conjectures in number theory were discovered, how to comb through numerical data to detect phenomena, how to take advantage of modern technology to assist future research, and to learn the types of problems better suited for numerical explorations. One of the goals for the conference is to broaden participation by inspiring young participants and to encourage them to build connections with people from all over the world.  A three-week course in arithmetic geometry and number theory will serve as a good prelude and preparation for the conference for graduate students.<br/><br/>Conference web site:  http://math.cts.nthu.edu.tw/Mathematics/2014ICNT.htm"

The main technique uses D-modules which encapsulate the Hamiltonian flow, built of canonical local systems on symplectic leaves.

A theme common to all of the goals of this project is the use of representation theory to study geometric spaces.  Three dimensional topological quantum field theories, quantum link invariants, and vertex operators were all developed in the 1980s and 1990s using various algebraic inputs. One main objective of this project is to lift these constructions to higher dimensions through the use of algebraic structures from representation theory.  This objective is part of a program known as categorification.<br/><br/>The program of categorification was introduced by Louis Crane and Igor Frenkel.  Generally speaking, the aim is that vector spaces should be replaced by categories and actions on vector spaces should be replaced by actions of functors on categories.  The categories involved in this project are of a representation theoretic or combinatorial nature.  New category-theoretic ideas need to be developed in order to achieve the most ambitious goals of the categorification program.  Another part of this project is the application of representation-theoretic techniques to the classification problem of certain algebraic varieties equipped with a group action.  The four areas of this project are the following:  (1) categorification of the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant, (2) categorification of the Turaev-Viro invariant, (3) categorification of Lie superalgebras, and (4) understanding the multiplicative structure of the coordinate rings of affine spherical varieties."

But many algebras arising in mathematics and quantum physics are noncommutative, and such algebras do not have a corresponding geometric space (in our current understanding of this term).  This project has two related goals: first, to better understand a certain class of algebras that should correspond to quantum versions of ordinary ""flat"" (affine) spaces, and second, to seek a suitable space-like object that should form the geometric counterpart of a noncommutative algebra.  The proposed approach will promote interaction between ring theory, functional analysis, and quantum physics.

Problems to be considered include invariants of actions on these algebras, the structure of these algebras in low dimensions, and duality theory for modules over such algebras.  The second objective is to construct a functorial invariant for noncommutative algebras that meaningfully extends the spectrum of commutative rings and algebras.  This will build upon rigorous obstructions to several natural candidates for noncommutative spectrum functors.  The initial focus will be to extend the Gelfand spectrum functor from commutative to noncommutative C*-algebras."

Extending the classical study over number fields, for example the rational numbers, to function fields, which includes  the class of simple functions such as polynomials, which is part of the PI's proposal,is useful from the geometric perspective.

To do so, we replace an action of a group on a commutative polynomial ring by an action of a Hopf algebra (or quantum group) on a noncommutative regular algebra that shares homological properties with its commutative counterpart. Although it is difficult for a Hopf algebra to act on an algebra, the PI has works in progress on actions of Hopf algebras on commutative domains, on their quantizations, and on algebras arising from NCPAG.

The object of this FRG project is to generalize this theory to higher Chern classes. One component of this generalization concerns how to define higher Chern classes in a way that facilitates studying them by L-series. This will be done by extending to the context of Iwasawa theory the adelic methods of Parshin and Beilinson. Another component of the generalization has to do with connecting higher Chern class invariants to L-series.  To do this, one needs enough structure in the arithmetic problem to see into its higher codimension features using L-series. Three particular cases will be considered are (i) Greenberg's conjecture over totally real fields, (ii) Iwasawa theory for imaginary quadratic fields at split primes, and (iii) the function field case.  Concerning (i), Greenberg has conjectured that the natural Iwasawa modules have trivial support in codimension one;  the PIs will study their codimension two support using L-series. Concerning (ii), work of Rubin, and of Kings and Johnson-Leung, suggests that one should study second Chern classes via symbols in K_2 groups associated to pairs of p-adic L-series.  Concerning (iii), the PIs will study the images under Chern class maps of classes defined by Witte in the function field case inside the higher relative K-groups of Iwasawa algebras.  One further component of this project has to do with generalizing to higher Chern classes the reduction techniques used in proving first Chern class Main Conjectures. This involves generalizing to Iwasawa algebras the theory of tilting complexes and derived equivalences which is used in group representation theory and in studying Fourier-Mukai functors.<br/><br/>This proposal deals with fundamental questions about the groups of symmetries of algebraic equations.  In the 1950's, Iwasawa began a new approach to the study of such equations by considering their behavior in infinite families. Iwasawa showed that many such families have well defined asymptotic behavior. This led to fundamental conjectures concerning the numerical growth rate of the symmetry groups arising from such families.  The proof of such ""Main Conjectures"" has been one of the  central goals of abstract algebra over the last 50 years.  This proposal has to do with the refinements of these conjectures which deal with more precise measures of rates of growth.

An example of such a realization is the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves, which can be realized as a ball quotient, where the 6 dimensional ball in question sits in the MT domain of K3 surfaces.  However, there are not many examples of this type known.  The PIs intend to look for more.  (3) The third topic involves the approach to the Hodge conjecture via normal functions and their singularities due to Green and Griffiths. The PIs will develop this approach in several directions.  For example, they will study the archimedean height function associated to a normal function, and they intend to study the non-reductive MT groups associated to normal functions.  (4) Finally, the PIs will develop a flexible theory of complex variations of mixed Hodge modules and apply it to questions arising in representation theory.  In particular, they would like to understand the structure of conformal blocks viewed as complex mixed Hodge modules on the moduli spaces of stable curves.<br/><br/>Hodge theory is a central area of algebraic geometry with roots in the the classical (19th century) theory of special functions and period integrals.  From a modern point of view, the goal of Hodge theory is to relate topological invariants of algebraic varieties to arithmetic and analytic invariants.  The central notion is that of a Hodge structure on the cohomology groups of an algebraic variety.  While the cohomology groups are purely topological, depending only on the shape of variety, the Hodge structure is a much more sensitive invariant. Consequently, the Hodge structure carries a great deal of important algebro-geometric and number-theoretical information.  The most famous unsolved problem in algebraic geometry is the Hodge conjecture, a question about the relationship between the Hodge structure of the cohomology groups of a variety and the existence of certain subvarieties.  This focus on the relationship between topological objects and finer analytic invariants is typical of Hodge theory as a whole, and it is the main motivation for the research supported by this FRG.  This research will consequently impact several areas of mathematics including number theory, algebraic geometry and representation theory.  Owing to the number of techniques involved, the PIs have a diverse set of skills and points of view.  An important component of the FRG will be devoted to conferences, which will exchange ideas between the PIs and train postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in a wide range of topics having to do with Hodge theory."

Attending and giving talks at conferences is a necessary part of every mathematician's life, but many conferences cater to established specialists. Such an environment can prove too intimidating for graduate students who wish to give talks of their own. The Binghamton University Graduate Conference in Algebra and Topology (BUGCAT) was specifically designed to meet the need for an alternative. It is a math conference run by graduate students, for graduate students. Like all conferences, BUGCAT provides a gathering place for professors and graduate students from various institutions to present their research to a wider audience, to collaborate, and to share ideas. The focus at the BUGCAT, however, is on the graduate student. The BUGCAT gives graduate students doing research in any area of algebra or topology an opportunity to practice giving talks and to network with other mathematicians sharing related research interests. At the same time, it gives graduate students an opportunity to hear talks by world renowned mathematicians doing groundbreaking work.<br/><br/>This award supports the Binghamton University Graduate Conference in Algebra and Topology, which will take place at Binghamton University on November 17-18, 2014. Now in its seventh year, the BUGCAT is a venue where algebra and topology graduate students in all stages of their research can present their work.  The graduate students who attend the BUGCAT are better equipped to find academic positions and continue research and collaboration.  Attendees are exposed to a wide variety of current research, ideas, and results, and they have ample opportunity to meet senior researchers and students of their generation who may become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging and supporting participation by women and minorities."

Algebraic geometry studies solutions of many polynomial equations in many variables.  Understanding this problem is of fundamental importance in many sciences, in engineering, and in other disciplines as well. It is often difficult to determine whether to expect any solution, finitely many solutions, or infinitely many:  in the last case  one wants to know how many degrees of freedom one has in describing the solutions. One can study the solutions  geometrically, or algebraically, by investigating certain functions on the solution space that form what is called a commutative ring.  This dual perspective creates a close  connection between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry that is very valuable. The problems proposed for study are long standing and of fundamental, central importance.  The results obtained will be disseminated by journal and book publication, lectures at  conferences and workshops, and via the internet. There is a strong educational component. The principal investigator has had thirty-nine Ph.D. students including fourteen women (and has five  other Ph.D. students currently, including four women, one of whom is African-American), and has served as mentor to fourteen junior faculty members, of whom six were women.  This level of activity will continue.  The PI will integrate undergraduate students into his research.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate several long standing questions in the theory Noetherian rings. One is to prove Stillman's conjecture bounding projective dimension, which Tigran Ananyan and Hochster have done in characteristic not 2, 3 for degree at most four.  Another is to continue the development of tight closure theory:   Neil Epstein and Hochster have developed a new version with many of the properties of the original theory that gives a smaller closure, is defined in both characteristic p and equal characteristic  0, and commutes with localization. This theory raises new questions while offering insight into existing ones. Jointly with Bhargav Bhatt, Hochster has given a new proof of the positivity of Serre intersection multiplicities over regular rings in positive characteristic using an idea that  has promise for  solving the more than fifty year old problem of settling the general case in mixed characteristic.  Other directions include the relatively recent theory of quasilength and content of local cohomology, finiteness of support of local cohomology, Lech's conjecture and generalizations, a new approach to the long standing direct summand conjecture, and the geometry of certain algebraic  sets associated with matrices. A number of these problems are intended for collaboration with graduate students and postdoctoral faculty."

It has been understood for a long time that even if one is interested in studying smooth geometric objects, singular ones naturally appear. It is thus important to be able to measure singularities, and this is done via various invariants that can be either numerical or can have a more complicated structure. The projects in this proposal are concerned with some of these invariants and with their applications to the study of algebraic varieties. These geometric objects can be studied in two contexts: in characteristic zero, which is the more familiar context, closer to our usual Euclidean space, and in positive characteristic, a context that is closer to arithmetic. However, these two settings have close connections, and sometimes one can prove results in characteristic zero by proving the corresponding results in positive characteristic. At this point, however, most of the results concerning the global properties of algebraic varieties are only known in characteristic zero. Several of the projects in this proposal are concerned with the extension of such results to positive characteristic and with the study of the more subtle phenomena that appear in this setting.<br/><br/>The common feature of the questions addressed in this proposal is the study of the connections between different invariants of singularities and the use of such invariants in the study of the global properties of algebraic varieties. The PI plans to explore relations between different points of view on singularities, such as the connection between spaces of arcs and the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity and the connection between spaces of arcs and the Decomposition Theorem. He also plans to work on questions regarding the positivity properties of adjoint linear systems in positive characteristic. Such results are already known in characteristic zero, the fundamental tool in the proofs being Kodaira's vanishing theorem and its generalizations. The main difficulty in extending these results to positive characteristic is the failure of vanishing theorems in the new setting. However, new tools based on the Frobenius homomorphism have been developed in the past few years. The PI plans to use some of these tools (for example, his work with Schwede on Seshadri constants in positive characteristic) to attack several problems in this setting."

In contrast, the K-theory of a ring or variety is built from relationships involving linear algebra using algebraic topology, so its structure reveals aspects of algebra and topology. Clarifying the relationships between these constructs will help our understanding of many phenomena that are currently understand only poorly.<br/><br/>One part of the project is to find clean proofs of major pieces of the proof of the recently-verified Bloch-Kato conjecture. This includes trying to: find a general degree formula which combines various degree formulas due to Rost, in terms of algebraic cobordism theory; establish an equivalence between models of the symmetric powers of a normal variety; and understand motivic cohomology operations better. These all play a role in the proof. This part of the project will be invaluable in training young researchers around the world. A related part of the project is to understand how Voevodsky's slice filtration is related to algebraic cobordism and other motivic spectra. The goal is to verify several of the slice conjectures, especially in finite characteristic, using homological algebra and algebraic Thom spaces. Part of this will be joint work with graduate students, contributing to their training. The project will also study the relationship between the singularities of a variety, its K-theory and its cdh-cohomology, using recently developed cohomological techniques and the relationship to cyclic homology and de Rham-Witt theory. This should shed some light on classes of singularities related to du Bois singularities.

This topic has advanced considerably during the past year due to the breakthrough work of Zhang and Maynard on small gaps between consecutive prime numbers, where previous work of Fouvry, Iwaniec, and Friedlander played a crucial role. One of the most fundamental open questions in modern mathematics is the Riemann hypothesis, which connects the distribution of prime numbers with the distribution of complex zeros of the generating zeta function. The hypothesis asserts that all these zeros lie on a single ""critical"" line. The main goal of this project is to show that a large proportion of these zeros are indeed resting there. This result will enhance our understanding of subtle behavior of the basic elements of arithmetic, the prime numbers. The PI has written expository books on several topics related to the Theory of Numbers, most recently a book on Sieve Methods, joint with John Friedlander. The PI is active in training graduate students and plans to continue to train graduate students under this award.<br/><br/>The project starts with the method of Levinson-Conrey designed for estimating the percentage of zeros of the Riemann zeta function that are on the critical line. The original construction by Conrey of a linear combination of the zeta function and its odd order derivatives is quite robust. Naturally, this needs to be mollified by a suitable Dirichlet polynomial. The longer mollifier one can handle, the more critical zeros reveal. The key innovation of the proposed approach is a special arrangement of the convolution coefficients into ""local mollifiers"" which allows applying very long global mollification, thus raising hope for substantial improvements of the existing results."

This project relates to Shimura varieties, arithmetical objects which have been indispensable for establishing local and global Langlands correspondences between representations of Galois groups on the one hand, and automorphic representations on the other hand.<br/><br/>The PI seeks to build new relations between the study of Shimura varieties and the geometric Langlands program. The Shimura varieties of interest are moduli spaces of abelian varieties with additional structure, and that additional structure can give rise to singularities when the equations are reduced modulo various prime numbers.  The PI will introduce new local models to study those singularities when the structure is pro-p Iwahori level; the local models will be generalizations of the Rapoport-Zink local models which have been so effective for studying parahoric level structure. He will relate these local models to 'pro-p' affine flag varieties and their deformations, bringing in ideas used in the geometric Langlands program in the setting of tame ramification.  This connection will permit an understanding of nearby cycles and singularities, and also of endoscopy and Hasse-Weil zeta functions, for interesting new classes of Shimura varieties.  In order to put these constructions into a very general context, the PI will work out a Tannakian theory of Bruhat-Tits buildings."

The proposed research has two mayor component projects. The first focuses on K3 surfaces: building on earlier work of the PI and his collaborators, and with a view towards arithmetic applications, the PI will pursue systematic, conceptual and practical methods to explicitly construct unramified Azumaya algebras representing transcendental Brauer classes on K3 surfaces. The second project focuses on del Pezzo surfaces:  proving new cases of a conjecture of Colliot-Thlne and Sansuc that Brauer-Manin obstructions suffice to explain failures on local-to-global phenomena for del Pezzo surfaces, efficient computation of these obstructions on low-degree surfaces, and statistics on failures of the Hasse principle.<br/><br/>An overarching theme in arithmetic geometry is the study of systems of polynomial equations in many variables, with the constraint that the coordinates of the solutions be rational numbers or integers (for example, 11/17, or -9). When no such solutions exist, one tries to understand the phenomena behind the absence of solutions. The geometry associated to a system of polynomials bears on the possible obstructions to the existence of solutions, and this project seeks to make such an intuition precise in some cases when a system of polynomial equations defines a surface. Although this project studies fundamental questions from a theoretical point of view, the structure of solutions to certain kinds of polynomial equations has well-documented applications (for example, in establishing secure protocols for the transmission of information between two parties that have never met). In addition to research activities, the PI will run a two-week program each summer for the duration of the grant. The goal of the program is to foster enrollment and persistence rates in STEM majors at the college level. The target demographic consists of rising 8th and 9th graders from the Houston Independent School District, including students from underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The content of the program is foundational material in the study of rational solutions to polynomial equations."

While there has been a lot of recent progress in our understanding of the geometry of higher-dimensional varieties, almost all of this body of work is restricted to characteristic zero, due to the use of vanishing theorems that can fail in positive characteristic.  The first goal of this collaborative research is to build tools and a framework that would allow the main results in birational geometry to be extended to positive characteristics.  This would make systematic use of the recent techniques that have been devised to exploit the Frobenius morphism.  A second goal of the project is to further develop the study of invariants of singularities and of linear series, with an eye toward the remaining problems in the minimal model program.  There have been many recent advances in this area. In particular, a conjecture of Shokurov asserting that certain invariants of singularities (the log canonical thresholds) satisfy the so-called  ACC property has been solved by some of the PIs.  This suggests that other related but harder questions might be within reach, questions whose importance comes from the connection with one of the remaining conjectures in the minimal model program, the termination of flips. The PIs propose to attack one of these problems, predicting the ACC property of another invariant, the minimal log discrepancy.  In a separate direction, the PIs plan to undertake a systematic study of examples of linear systems on algebraic varieties that exhibit a pathological behavior from the point of view of various positivity invariants.<br/><br/>The last ten years have seen major breakthroughs in the study of higher-dimensional algebraic varieties, but several important problems are still open.  A central such problem is intimately related to the study of singularities and one of the goals of this project is to make progress on understanding the properties of the invariants of singularities that appear in this setting.  Another general goal of the PIs is to develop systematically the study of algebraic varieties of dimension at least 3 in positive characteristic.  A lot less is known in this setting, where new phenomena (sometimes considered pathological) arise.  The PIs expect that cross-pollination of ideas with other areas, in particular with commutative algebra, will play an important role in making progress in this direction.  Moreover, it is likely that techniques and results in this context would have many applications to other fields (for example, in arithmetic geometry).  As part of the collaborative effort, the PIs plan several events that will bring together members of the mathematical community working on related problems and also help disseminate the results and the techniques developed as part of this project."

Another aim is to study singularities in the minimal model program by establishing a connection between Saito's theory and the filtered de Rham complex of singular varieties. In the direction of derived categories, the main topic under study is comparison of the cohomological invariants and the geometry of varieties with equivalent bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves, a topic of interest both in mirror symmetry and in birational geometry. Continuing work on the behavior of the Picard variety and of certain Hodge numbers under derived equivalence, the PI plans to address problems like the invariance of the canonical cohomology and the invariance of cohomological support loci coming from generic vanishing theory.

One natural problem which arose in the 19th century was to count the number of primes less than X for some variable quantity X. The resolution came in an unexpected way : this *discrete* counting problem turned out to be related to the properties of a *continuous*  function first studied by Euler but now known as the Riemann zeta function. The breakthrough hinged on a crucial property of this function discovered by Riemann, namely, that it had a hidden symmetry which related the value of the function evaluated at the point ""s"" to the value evaluated at the point ""1-s"". This hidden symmetry turns out to be merely the tip of the iceberg; there are a wide class of similar functions which exhibit similar symmetries (at least conjecturally), and these functions arise in many areas of mathematics and physics. By proving that a certain class of such functions had this symmetry, Andrew Wiles in 1994 was able to prove Fermat's Last Theorem. The PI's work aims to prove that a certain class of functions exhibit the same symmetry as the Riemann zeta function. More specifically, there are a natural collections of such functions indexed by a natural number g. When g is zero, there is a single function which was the one considered by Euler and Riemann. When g is one, the class of functions are exactly the ones studied by Wiles. The PI plans to study the functions arising when g is two. <br/><br/>An overarching theme of the PI's research (including collaborations with Emerton, Geraghty, and Venkatesh) has been the study of torsion classes in cohomology, both in the Betti cohomology of arithmetic groups and the coherent cohomology of Shimura varieties,  and their conjectural relationship with the Langlands program. The PI's work suggests that understanding torsion is at the heart of understanding reciprocity beyond Shimura varieties.  One of the main long term technical goals of the proposed project is to prove that L-functions attached to genus two curves satisfy the expected functional equations. For curves of genus one, this is the famous Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, now a theorem, which was first proved in many cases by Wiles. For curves of genus zero, this is a famous theorem of Riemann, namely, the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function. In order to approach this problem, the PI has (with David Geraghty) developed a generalization of the Taylor-Wiles method which may conceivably apply in this case. Much of his effort will be devoted to trying to overcome the numerous technical obstacles which are required to carry out this argument, including local-global compatibility for Galois representations, and vanishing of cohomology groups outside certain ranges.  More generally, the PI intends to further develop this general approach to modularity questions in other contexts, including Galois representations conjecturally associated to automorphic forms for GL(n) over the rationals. He also plans to study applications of these results to the Bloch-Kato conjecture and establishing links between K-theory, completed cohomology, and the Langlands program."

The proposed project aims to explore Teichmueller dynamics using tools in algebraic geometry and to develop applications to the geometry of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. The ultimate goal is to establish a correspondence between dynamical properties of these orbits and the intersection theory of their closures in the moduli space.

In a sense this is analogous to introducing coordinates in Descartes geometry. The proposed project also opens many avenues for student and postdoctoral research.

Three projects aim to use topological methods to understand the Brauer group, Azumaya algebras, and more generally torsors on schemes. (1) The PI will study the extent to which the foundational results of Jackowski, McClure, and Oliver on maps between classifying spaces of complex algebraic groups can be extended to finite approximations to these classifying spaces. Progress on this problem will enable the solution of a host of problems about when torsors for complex algebraic groups extend from the generic point of a scheme to the entire scheme. In low dimensions, early progress on this problem has been used by the PI and Ben Williams to settle an old question of Auslander and Goldman on the existence of Azumaya maximal orders in unramified division algebras, where it transpires that there are purely topological obstructions to the existence of these Azumaya maximal orders. (2) The PI will work toward computing the Chow groups and singular cohomology of the classifying spaces of special linear groups by various central subgroups. This has been done in special cases by Vezzosi and Vistoli. However, greater generality is needed for most applications. These Chow groups are fundamental objects in algebraic geometry, controlling the characteristic classes associated to certain torsors of fundamental importance in the study of the Brauer group. The computations will be directly useful to the first project, and to the following project. (3) The PI and Ben Williams previously formulated the topological period-index problem and established first results. They will continue this study, especially as it relates to the algebraic period-index conjecture. In particular, their results in low dimensions suggest a method for disproving the period-index conjecture, which would be a fundamental advance. Following this idea to its conclusion is the major aspiration of the first set of projects. A fourth project aims to continue to build a bridge between higher category theory and classical algebraic geometry, bringing the formidable techniques of the former to bear on various questions in the arithmetic of derived categories. For example, the PI is developing a toolbox using higher category theory that will allow a purely derived-category proof of Panin's computations of the K-theory of projective homogeneous spaces, once the existence of certain exceptional objects on the split forms of these spaces is known.<br/><br/>The PI proposes work in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, two areas of modern mathematics. Algebraic geometry is an ancient subject with many connections to real-world problems. Its goal is to understand the geometry of solutions sets of polynomial equations, equations of central importance in various disciplines, such as theoretical physics, cryptography, and the modeling of dynamical systems like weather. Algebraic topology on the other hand developed more recently, in the 19th century, and aims to study a general notion of shape, less rigid than the idea of shape studied in geometry. It has found striking applications in the last decade, for instance to the analysis of large data sets that occur in computer vision and cancer research, frequently finding patterns that more traditional methods of data analysis fail to find. The proposal of the PI will bring the considerable machinery and insight of algebraic topology to bear on several questions in algebraic geometry which have been identified by the community as among the most important."

The object of this FRG project is to generalize this theory to higher Chern classes. One component of this generalization concerns how to define higher Chern classes in a way that facilitates studying them by L-series. This will be done by extending to the context of Iwasawa theory the adelic methods of Parshin and Beilinson. Another component of the generalization has to do with connecting higher Chern class invariants to L-series.  To do this, one needs enough structure in the arithmetic problem to see into its higher codimension features using L-series. Three particular cases will be considered are (i) Greenberg's conjecture over totally real fields, (ii) Iwasawa theory for imaginary quadratic fields at split primes, and (iii) the function field case.  Concerning (i), Greenberg has conjectured that the natural Iwasawa modules have trivial support in codimension one;  the PIs will study their codimension two support using L-series. Concerning (ii), work of Rubin, and of Kings and Johnson-Leung, suggests that one should study second Chern classes via symbols in K_2 groups associated to pairs of p-adic L-series.  Concerning (iii), the PIs will study the images under Chern class maps of classes defined by Witte in the function field case inside the higher relative K-groups of Iwasawa algebras.  One further component of this project has to do with generalizing to higher Chern classes the reduction techniques used in proving first Chern class Main Conjectures. This involves generalizing to Iwasawa algebras the theory of tilting complexes and derived equivalences which is used in group representation theory and in studying Fourier-Mukai functors.<br/><br/>This proposal deals with fundamental questions about the groups of symmetries of algebraic equations.  In the 1950's, Iwasawa began a new approach to the study of such equations by considering their behavior in infinite families. Iwasawa showed that many such families have well defined asymptotic behavior. This led to fundamental conjectures concerning the numerical growth rate of the symmetry groups arising from such families.  The proof of such ""Main Conjectures"" has been one of the  central goals of abstract algebra over the last 50 years.  This proposal has to do with the refinements of these conjectures which deal with more precise measures of rates of growth.  Concerning broad impacts, work on algebraic questions of this kind  has led to the development of technology essential to society, such as the improved compression and secure transmission of data."

The overarching principle of the research of the PI is that certain algebraic problems can be reinterpreted directly as geometric problems in higher dimension, providing fascinating connections between objects from different parts of mathematics.  A great wealth of such connections have been found indirectly through intermediate objects of an analytic nature.  The research outlined in the proposal aims to provide a window through which well-known conjectures and statements of arithmetic may be seen in a new and more direct light.<br/><br/>The PI has conjectured an intricate but explicit relationship between modular symbols and the arithmetic of cyclotomic fields that may be viewed as refining the Iwasawa main conjecture.  Roughly speaking, this conjecture identifies class groups of cyclotomic fields with quotients of homology groups of modular curves by actions of Eisenstein ideals.  The central project of the award is the extension of this conjecture to higher dimensions and other global fields.  The expectation is that the geometry of locally symmetric spaces should explicitly determine the arithmetic of lattices in Galois representations, which is to say the structure of Selmer groups."

While there has been a lot of recent progress in our understanding of the geometry of higher-dimensional varieties, almost all of this body of work is restricted to characteristic zero, due to the use of vanishing theorems that can fail in positive characteristic.  The first goal of this collaborative research is to build tools and a framework that would allow the main results in birational geometry to be extended to positive characteristics.  This would make systematic use of the recent techniques that have been devised to exploit the Frobenius morphism.  A second goal of the project is to further develop the study of invariants of singularities and of linear series, with an eye toward the remaining problems in the minimal model program.  There have been many recent advances in this area. In particular, a conjecture of Shokurov asserting that certain invariants of singularities (the log canonical thresholds) satisfy the so-called  ACC property has been solved by some of the PIs.  This suggests that other related but harder questions might be within reach, questions whose importance comes from the connection with one of the remaining conjectures in the minimal model program, the termination of flips. The PIs propose to attack one of these problems, predicting the ACC property of another invariant, the minimal log discrepancy.  In a separate direction, the PIs plan to undertake a systematic study of examples of linear systems on algebraic varieties that exhibit a pathological behavior from the point of view of various positivity invariants.<br/><br/>The last ten years have seen major breakthroughs in the study of higher-dimensional algebraic varieties, but several important problems are still open.  A central such problem is intimately related to the study of singularities and one of the goals of this project is to make progress on understanding the properties of the invariants of singularities that appear in this setting.  Another general goal of the PIs is to develop systematically the study of algebraic varieties of dimension at least 3 in positive characteristic.  A lot less is known in this setting, where new phenomena (sometimes considered pathological) arise.  The PIs expect that cross-pollination of ideas with other areas, in particular with commutative algebra, will play an important role in making progress in this direction.  Moreover, it is likely that techniques and results in this context would have many applications to other fields (for example, in arithmetic geometry).  As part of the collaborative effort, the PIs plan several events that will bring together members of the mathematical community working on related problems and also help disseminate the results and the techniques developed as part of this project."

A formula for roots of a quadratic polynomial goes back fifteen hundred years to Brahmagupta, an Indian mathematician.  Cubic and quartic polynomial equations were solved by Italian renaissance mathematicians. Higher degree polynomials resisted until modern times, when it become clear that it is not possible to write a simple formula for their roots. Instead, mathematicians realized, polynomials can be understood by looking at permutations of their roots. Permutations of roots form a mathematical object called a group. The group is a measure of the difficulty of a polynomial. Groups were studied extensively in the 20th century and continue to be studied today. Our knowledge of groups can be in turn translated into understanding of polynomials. This is the main object of this project. In particular, we can understand large polynomials whose corresponding groups form a family called G2.  These are large and non-trivial groups, for example, the smallest has 12096 elements.<br/><br/>The PI will study groups of transformations arising from triality. In mathematics, triality refers to an interaction among three vector spaces. Perhaps the most interesting case is when the three spaces have dimension 8. Then the principle of triality gives rise to several exceptional mathematical structures:  the exceptional projective plane, where the usual axioms of Euclid hold while some expected properties do not, and exceptional groups of transformations called G2 and D4. The group G2 was discovered by german mathematicians about one hundred years ago, but has recently attracted much attention due to its role in physics and string theory, in particular.The main object of this work is to classify representations of the group G2 over local fields, as predicted by Langlands conjectures. To that end we study exceptional theta correspondences and dual pairs where one member of the dual pair is G2. The key new ingredient is a conservation principle for G2, somewhat analogous to the conservation principle for classical groups, however, with the group D4 playing the role of the Kudla-Rallis doubling trick. Thus much of the work is devoted to study of D4 and its representations."

Abstract algebra allows the study of such objects systematically.  The results of this research might lead to better algorithms dealing with linear algebra problems, which have many applications in other areas of mathematics as well as in other sciences.  Some of the published research of the investigator led to such algorithms. The PI will involve graduate students in his research.<br/><br/>This project consists of several interrelated parts. The first part is to study the structure of generic rings for finite free resolutions. The investigator proposes to develop his discovery of a link between the generic ring for resolutions of length 3 and Kac-Moody Lie algebras related to graphs T(p,q,r). In particular the generic ring is Noetherian if and only if T(p,q,r) is a Dynkin diagram.  The PI proposes to work towards an explicit description of the generators of the generic ring in the case when they are Noetherian. He also proposes to continue to generalize this approach to perfect complexes of length 3, for resolutions of Gorenstein ideals of codimension 4 and for resolutions of higher length. In a related project the PI proposes to study the role of Buchsbaum-Rim linkage which reflects the symmetry of the graphs T(p,q,r). The second part is related to calculating local cohomology. The PI plans to develop his calculation of local cohomology of the polynomial ring on generic matrix supported in the determinantal ideal. He plans to find similar results for Pfaffians of skew symmetric matrices and minors of symmetric matrices. He then plans to develop the techniques used to be able to find the free resolutions of irreducible equivariant ideals in all three cases.  The third part involves noncommutative algebra. The investigator proposes to further study quivers with potential. He plans to pursue the conjecture of David Berenstein concerning global dimension of the Jacobian algebra of a quiver with potential. He also plans to study the relation between properties of a Jacobian algebra and the corresponding completed Jacobian algebra. The PI proposes to study the noncommutative resolutions of orbit closures in Vinberg representations of type I, in particular for Pfaffians of skew symmetric matrices and minors of symmetric matrices. Finally, he proposes to study the geometry of the components of representation spaces for quivers with relations. The most interesting problem is trying to decide the representation type of a given algebra to the geometry of its representation spaces. In this context the PI is interested in normality of these components as well as in their MF and DO properties."

Over the complex numbers, the standard techniques to study adjoint line bundles include Kodaira-type vanishing theorems.  These theorems are unavailable in characteristic p > 0, thus methods of the Frobenius morphism and test ideals from commutative algebra will be employed instead.

Explicitly, it is the study of geometric objects (called algebraic varieties) made up of the solutions to polynomial equations (for example, the parabola is the solution to y = x^2).

For example, instead of simply 4 + 4 = 8, in characteristic p = 5, once we get to 5 we start counting at 1 again so that 4 + 4 = 3 (like counting hours of a clock). This type of arithmetic and related algebra and geometry is heavily employed in modern cryptography and coding theory.

It involves the study of basic symmetries that occur in nature, namely the continuous symmetries known as Lie groups, introduced by Sophus Lie in the 1880's.  One of the main goals of the project is to understand the basic building blocks of the theory, the irreducible unitary representations of Lie groups, using geometric methods.  In addition the PI will make use of geometric methods to attack several longstanding problems concerning systems of differential equations, modular representation theory, and dualities for Lie groups.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the PI and Wilfried Schmid have made far-reaching conjectures which put the problem of finding the irreducible unitary representations in a general mathematical context. The conjectures themselves go beyond their application to representation theory and involve the theory of mixed Hodge modules of Morihiko Saito.  The Langlands program provides a means of relating areas of mathematics that often do not have a straightforward direct relationship.  It implements this relationship via the symmetries of the theories by exhibiting a relationship between their representations.  In this spirit the PI has initiated a collaboration with Geordie Williamson, whose goal is to understand modular representation theory.  In particular, they want to settle the longstanding problem of understanding the irreducible characters.  Also in this direction, the PI proposes, in joint work with Roman Bezrukavnikov, to prove a categorical Langlands duality for real groups.  Many structures in mathematics can be modeled by systems of differential equations.  Of particular interest are the maximally over-determined systems.  The PI, jointly with Masaki Kashiwara, has solved the key longstanding problem in this area, the codimension-three conjecture.  Kashiwara and the PI will continue working towards a comprehensive understanding of holonomic regular microdifferential systems (these are the systems that most often come up in applications to other areas).  To understand these issues better, the PI also plans to develop a relative version of the classical theory of several complex variables."

Northwestern has a long history of successful 'emphasis years' following the broad pattern of the proposed activities.  This year's emphasis will be placed on connecting new physics to mathematics.  Recent advanced in physics pioneered by Nekrasov-Shatashvili, Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa, and Kapustin-Witten have spawned hundreds of papers and interest around the globe.  A mathematical perspective has been offered by Maulik-Okounkov and there is related work of Goncharov-Kenyon.  These results should be understood not only on their own merit, but also as a part of a broader emerging relationship between integrable systems, representation theory and quantum fields.  The workshop and conference will do just that.  The bulk of the proposed funding will support graduate students and postdocs either directly, by funding their participation, or indirectly by funding speakers at the graduate workshop.  These students will largely be US nationals from US institutions, thus furthering the goal of the solicitation to support the development of professional mathematicians in the United States.<br/><br/>The general theme of the program is to explore the interplay between symmetry groups and the physical systems in which they arise.  Physical phenomena have analogous mathematical descriptions, and vice versa:  the geometric Langlands program has an analogue in a dimensional reduction of a topologically twisted supersymmetric gauge theory, through the work of Kapustin and Witten.  The Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa conjecture relates two-dimensional conformal field theory to four-dimensional supersymmetric theories. A mathematical manifestation of this conjecture is the action of  Virasoro and W-algebras on the cohomology of moduli spaces of bundles on a complex surface constructed by Maulik and Okounkov.  Integrable systems relating to string compactification on singular Calabi-Yau threefolds have descriptions as dimer problems in statistical physics, which in turn relate to cluster integrable systems (Nekrasov-Shatashvili, Kenyon-Goncharov).  All of these phenomena will be explored in the workshop and conference.   The conference webpage is located at the following address:  http://www.math.northwestern.edu/emphasisyear/."

The PI has conjectured the existence of new structures that govern their shape (mathematically speaking their topology), which he will investigate in more detail.

The PI will study this conjecture and attempt to give evidence for it. Concerning lattices, the PI will study in particular the following questions: What is the diameter of the space of n-dimensional lattices, how do the short vectors in a typical n-dimensional lattice behave, and why does the LLL lattice reduction algorithm behave so well? A basic tool will be the analysis of automorphic forms on GL(n) for large n, and the PI will also study related questions about automorphic forms in the high-dimensional limit."

Representation theory is a branch of modern algebra studying symmetries in linear spaces. It interacts with many other areas in mathematics, mathematical physics, chemistry, and theoretical computer science. Geometric methods have become more and more fundamental in all of these areas. One of the main objectives of this conference is to introduce beginning researchers in representation theory to the power of geometric methods. The keynote speaker for this conference will be Professor Gordana Todorov from Northeastern University who will give two one-hour lectures which will be accessible to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. There will also be several expository lectures given by other well-known experts. The remainder of the lectures will be research talks given by both senior and junior mathematicians. This will include several talks by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers related to their Ph.D. theses. The conference will provide an inviting atmosphere in which new collaborations can be formed and young researchers have the possibility to learn about cutting-edge geometric methods in representation theory. Moreover,  the conference will enable junior representation theorists to present their work and interact  with the broader community, which are crucial activities in the pre-employment season in the fall.<br/><br/>Over the last 40 years, the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras has enjoyed a great impact of methods from algebraic geometry, in particular from geometric invariant theory and transformation groups. At the same time, this has allowed to feed back into geometry ideas and techniques from representation theory. One of the goals of the Conference on Geometric Methods in Representation Theory  is to help strengthen and advance this interaction of geometry and representation theory. The topics of this conference will include: geometric aspects of cluster algebras; semi-invariants for bound quivers; degenerations of modules and the geometry of orbit closures in module varieties; moduli problems for finite-dimensional algebras; universal deformation rings and their connection to moduli spaces.

KUMUNU is the annual weekend conference anchored by the University of Kansas (KU), University of Missouri (MU) and University of Nebraska  (NU). It was founded by the algebraists in these three institutions in 1999 to promote interaction among faculty, post docs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related disciplines.   The three institutions are within 5 hours driving distance and with modest travel and lodging support the weekend KUMUNU conferences continue to have significant regional impact.   KUMUNU moved to Missouri in 2012.  Last year, it was held Sept. 21-22.  The KUMUNU conference has a strong tradition of playing an important mentoring role for graduate students, recent PhDs and early career faculty in research institutions and four-year colleges. KUMUNU provides an annual venue for these groups to come together with senior researchers at KU, MU and NU along with two or three senior researchers from some institutions not so near.  Beginning in 2012, we also feature three graduate students, one each from KU, MU and NU who present their developing theses.  KUMUNU stimulates interactions by having talks on current research accessible to graduate students with ample time and opportunity for interaction outside of talks in an informal and friendly setting.  There will be six main talks by Melvin Hochster (Michigan), Daniel Erman  (Univ.  Wisconsin),  Kevin Tucker  (Univ.  Illinois at Chicago), Hilong Dao (KU),  Dale Cutkosky  (MU)  and  Thanh Wu  (NU).  There will also be three talks by graduate students at KU, MU and NU. In addition to faculty and students from KU, MU and NU, and other institutions from Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, KUMUNU draws participants from neighboring states such as Colorado,  Illinois, Indiana,  Kentucky, Michigan, Oklahoma  and North  Dakota.  One of the main goals is to showcase research of young faculty, helping enrich the research programs of recent PhDs and graduate students in commutative algebra and related fields by both formal and informal mentoring from experienced researchers.  In addition, KUMUNU serves to enhance the existing strengths at these three institutions.  The conference website is http://kumunu.missouri.edu<br/><br/>KUMUNU 2014 will provide an opportunity for mathematicians to interact and establish research connections with each other; in particular, the participants will interact with other researchers and hear and discuss recent developments in the field and its relationships with other areas.  The primary impacts of the conference will be its dissemination of recent ideas in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and stimulation and enrichment of the research careers of students and early career participants. Participants will take ideas form the conference back to their colleagues and students, stimulating further research and mathematical enrichment at their home institutions. The relatively small size of the meeting and its geographic and disciplinary focus will be particularly effective at enabling participants to establish productive collaborative relationships. Encouragement and mentoring that begins at the conference will significantly contribute to the success and professional development of early career mathematicians whether in research institutions or primarily teaching institutions."

The object of this FRG project is to generalize this theory to higher Chern classes. One component of this generalization concerns how to define higher Chern classes in a way that facilitates studying them by L-series. This will be done by extending to the context of Iwasawa theory the adelic methods of Parshin and Beilinson. Another component of the generalization has to do with connecting higher Chern class invariants to L-series.  To do this, one needs enough structure in the arithmetic problem to see into its higher codimension features using L-series. Three particular cases will be considered are (i) Greenberg's conjecture over totally real fields, (ii) Iwasawa theory for imaginary quadratic fields at split primes, and (iii) the function field case.  Concerning (i), Greenberg has conjectured that the natural Iwasawa modules have trivial support in codimension one;  the PIs will study their codimension two support using L-series. Concerning (ii), work of Rubin, and of Kings and Johnson-Leung, suggests that one should study second Chern classes via symbols in K_2 groups associated to pairs of p-adic L-series.  Concerning (iii), the PIs will study the images under Chern class maps of classes defined by Witte in the function field case inside the higher relative K-groups of Iwasawa algebras.  One further component of this project has to do with generalizing to higher Chern classes the reduction techniques used in proving first Chern class Main Conjectures. This involves generalizing to Iwasawa algebras the theory of tilting complexes and derived equivalences which is used in group representation theory and in studying Fourier-Mukai functors.<br/><br/>This proposal deals with fundamental questions about the groups of symmetries of algebraic equations.  In the 1950's, Iwasawa began a new approach to the study of such equations by considering their behavior in infinite families. Iwasawa showed that many such families have well defined asymptotic behavior. This led to fundamental conjectures concerning the numerical growth rate of the symmetry groups arising from such families.  The proof of such ""Main Conjectures"" has been one of the  central goals of abstract algebra over the last 50 years.  This proposal has to do with the refinements of these conjectures which deal with more precise measures of rates of growth.  Concerning broad impacts, work on algebraic questions of this kind  has led to the development of technology essential to society, such as the improved compression and secure transmission of data."

They have been intensively studied since the 19th century, especially in the field of algebraic geometry, but many important questions remain unsolved. This project will take a new approach to some of those questions, by investigating the properties of D-modules on abelian varieties. D-modules are basically systems of partial differential equations, in an abstract form that is useful for studying geometric questions. For example, whenever one has a mapping from another algebraic variety to an abelian variety, one gets a certain number of D-modules on the abelian variety that contain information about the original mapping. The main new idea is that interesting properties of these (and other) D-modules on abelian varieties can be revealed with the help of Fourier analysis, in the same way that interesting properties of signals (such as sound waves) can be revealed by looking at their frequency spectrum. The hope is that a good understanding of the ""spectrum"" of D-modules on abelian varieties will lead to new results about their geometry.<br/><br/>In more technical language, the research objective of the project is to give a complete characterization of Fourier-Mukai transforms of holonomic D-modules on complex abelian varieties. These transforms are complexes of coherent sheaves on the moduli space of line bundles with connection (which is a hyperkaehler manifold), and in many ways, they look remarkably similar to perverse sheaves. This suggests that Fourier-Mukai transforms of holonomic D-modules should make up an as-yet conjectural category of ""hyperkaehler perverse sheaves""; the project will make this idea precise and test some of its implications. This question is also of practical interest, because it provides a new tool for solving problems about abelian varieties and irregular varieties, similar to the generic vanishing theorem of Green and Lazarsfeld. A second objective is to make the theory of mixed Hodge modules more widely known. Building on a recent Clay Mathematics Institute workshop, the PI and others plan to write a book about mixed Hodge modules and their applications that will try to make this powerful theory accessible to non-experts."

The researchers intend to focus on four related topics: (1) Mumford-Tate (MT) domains, (2) moduli spaces, (3) algebraic cycles and the Hodge conjecture, and (4) mixed Hodge modules.  (1) MT domains are classifying spaces of Hodge structures, and, roughly speaking, the boundary components of Mumford-Tate domains parametrize degenerations of Hodge structures.  The PIs intend to advance number theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry by studying Mumford-Tate domains and their boundary components.  For example, the PIs plan to extend work of Carayol, which seeks to associate Galois representations to automorphic representations whose archimedian component is a degenerate limit of discrete series.  (2) The second topic concerns the realization of moduli spaces of geometric objects as quotients of discrete groups.  An example of such a realization is the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves, which can be realized as a ball quotient, where the 6 dimensional ball in question sits in the MT domain of K3 surfaces.  However, there are not many examples of this type known.  The PIs intend to look for more.  (3) The third topic involves the approach to the Hodge conjecture via normal functions and their singularities due to Green and Griffiths. The PIs will develop this approach in several directions.  For example, they will study the archimedean height function associated to a normal function, and they intend to study the non-reductive MT groups associated to normal functions.  (4) Finally, the PIs will develop a flexible theory of complex variations of mixed Hodge modules and apply it to questions arising in representation theory.  In particular, they would like to understand the structure of conformal blocks viewed as complex mixed Hodge modules on the moduli spaces of stable curves.<br/><br/>Hodge theory is a central area of algebraic geometry with roots in the the classical (19th century) theory of special functions and period integrals.  From a modern point of view, the goal of Hodge theory is to relate topological invariants of algebraic varieties to arithmetic and analytic invariants.  The central notion is that of a Hodge structure on the cohomology groups of an algebraic variety.  While the cohomology groups are purely topological, depending only on the shape of variety, the Hodge structure is a much more sensitive invariant. Consequently, the Hodge structure carries a great deal of important algebro-geometric and number-theoretical information.  The most famous unsolved problem in algebraic geometry is the Hodge conjecture, a question about the relationship between the Hodge structure of the cohomology groups of a variety and the existence of certain subvarieties.  This focus on the relationship between topological objects and finer analytic invariants is typical of Hodge theory as a whole, and it is the main motivation for the research supported by this FRG.  This research will consequently impact several areas of mathematics including number theory, algebraic geometry and representation theory.  Owing to the number of techniques involved, the PIs have a diverse set of skills and points of view.  An important component of the FRG will be devoted to conferences, which will exchange ideas between the PIs and train postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in a wide range of topics having to do with Hodge theory."

Particularly important are the kinds of polynomial equations that arise in fields like cryptography and computer science, where the inputs and the outputs of the polynomials are fractions or their near-cousins (elements in a ""global field""). For these equations, it is important not only to know that there are solutions in fractions, but also to know that there are many solutions, and that we can find such solutions efficiently in a finite amount of runtime (i.e., there are efficient bounds on the size of the numerators and denominators of some fraction solution). Investigating these questions is a major goal of algebraic geometry. Remarkably, ideas from geometry, particularly ideas suggested by physics, give a proof of existence of integral solutions for many special polynomial equations over global function fields. The main goal of this project is to exploit this advance and prove the veracity of certain conjectured bounds on rational solutions of these special polynomial equations (""rationally simply connected"" systems of equations) over global function fields, thus giving an efficient algorithm for finding rational solutions. In addition, there are several educational and training goals: improving the writing of math students through weekly meetings, helping with a summer math camp for high school students, and holding twice-annual one-day training workshops for math students coinciding with one an important weekend workshop series in algebraic geometry. <br/><br/>Technically, the main objective is to study the Batyrev-Manin conjecture on asymptotics of rational points of bounded height over global function fields for the special class of ""rationally simply connected"" varieties: a class that includes, for instance, the projective homogeneous varieties so ubiquitous in representation theory. Recent work relates rational points over global function fields to geometric properties of moduli spaces of rational curves on lifts of the varieties over the complex numbers. By exploiting this, there is hope to give efficient height bounds on rational points implied by the Batyrev-Manin Conjecture, and hopefully to settle the conjecture in important special cases. Secondary goals are to understand the Picard groups of these moduli spaces (roughly, the different possible ""height functions""), and to extend the amazingly successful story of Neron models to a more general class of varieties than Abelian varieties. Broader impacts include continuing and extending a mathematical writing and professional development seminar begun by the PI, to continue the partial support of the PI for the Mathematics Summer Camp at Stony Brook University, and to institute a new series of one-day training workshops for graduate students timed to coincide with the AGNES series of twice-annual weekend workshops in algebraic geometry."

They are important in geometry, physics and number theory. Moduli spaces of curves parametrize all curves of a given topological type. This type is classified by a whole number called the genus of the curve. Some questions about moduli spaces of curves of all genera can be resolved by answering the the questions in genus zero and one. This proposal focuses on understanding the interaction between the topology of moduli spaces of curves, especially in genus one and the ""arithmetic symmetries"" of topological invariants of the moduli spaces. Resolving such basic questions is important in advancing our understanding of whole numbers and of the topological symmetries of zero sets of polynomials.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to understand motivic aspects of completions of fundamental groups and path torsors of moduli spaces of curves in all genera $\ge 0$. Although motivic structures on path torsors of moduli spaces of genus 0 curves are reasonably well understood (work of Deligne-Goncharov and Brown), fundamental problems remain, such as determining the Zariski closure of the image of the absolute Galois group in the automorphism group of the unipotent fundamental group of the thrice punctured projective line (a de~Rham version of the Grothendieck-Teichmuller program), and understanding why and how classical cusp forms impose relations in the associated graded of its depth filtration. Much of the PI's attention will be focused on the genus one case as it is the most central and also because of its connection to the theory of classical modular forms.  It influences the genus 0 case by degeneration to the nodal cubic and should help explain why modular forms impose conditions on the Galois action on the unipotent fundamental group of the thrice punctured projective line. The higher genus cases can be reduced to the genus zero and one cases by results in topology that go back to Harer. This project will also clarify Manin's work on iterated Shimura integrals and arithmetic aspects of the elliptic KZB equation, which arose in physics, but plays a special role in this project."

One can also find solutions for degree three polynomials and degree four polynomials by taking radicals, but in general by the Abel-Ruffini theorem there is no formula for the roots of polynomial of degree five or higher in terms of radicals.  This theorem, first proven in the 1800's, is an indication of a profound difference between so-called solvable polynomials (those that can be solved by radicals) and nonsolvable polynomials (those that cannot be solved by radicals).  The latter are much harder to understand.  Existing techniques in the so-called Langlands program are often limited to the solvable setting.  Part of this proposal is dedicated to providing new techniques in the Langlands program that will work in nonsolvable settings.<br/><br/><br/>Though only proven in special (albeit important) cases the Langlands functoriality conjectures have become a cornerstone of modern mathematics.  The conjectures had their genesis in the area of automorphic forms, which lies at the intersection of number theory, representation theory, and harmonic analysis on Lie groups. The theory developed to understand and prove cases of the conjectures has become crucial to understanding these subjects, and has reached beyond them, leading to important applications in other areas such as topology, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.  This proposal aims to develop tools to resolve important cases of the conjectures and their analogues in other contexts.  The proposed research has two parts. First, it will investigate Langlands' so-called ``Beyond Endoscopy'' idea in settings designed to establish descent and base change of automorphic representations along nonsolvable Galois extensions. Second, it will develop relative analogues of the theory of twisted endoscopy.  This will lead to a better understanding of special cycles on Shimura varieties with a view towards establishing cases of the Tate and Beilinson-Bloch conjectures."

Transfer operators include Apollonian circle packings and dynamical systems with holes. Discrete groups include geometric rigidity for Kleinian groups and Gromov hyperbolic spaces. Conformal iterated function systems include harmonic measure, exact dimensionality, continuity of Hausdorff measure, and non--autonomous conformal iterated function systems. Holomorphic dynamics includes doubling measures and rational semigroups. Random dynamical systems include shrinking targets, dynamical rigidity in random conformal dynamical systems, random conformal iterated function systems with transversality, random rational functions, and random transcendental meromorphic functions. These subprojects will require methods from dynamical systems, ergodic theory, functional analysis, geometric measure theory, number theory, complex analysis, and probability theory. The goal of each subprojects of this proposal is to solve the major dynamical, geometric, and analytical problems related to these fields. It builds upon the methods and results the PI has obtained throughout his entire research career, focusing mainly on about 40 papers written in the past five years."

Gauge theory, in special cases, is believed to underline the mathematical description of the universe; for example, the standard model for particle physics is a gauge theory in 4 dimensions. Much mathematical research into quantum physics over the last half-century has focussed on the analysis required to make accurate experimental predictions, but what was missed until the last decade or two was that topological (distance-independent) features of the theory are governed by an underlying algebra, which has some novel and unexplored features. The PI will study fundamental questions pertaining to this algebra in low dimension.<br/><br/>The main project aims at a rigid description of topological gauge theory (the so-called A-model) by the tested technique of mirror symmetry, which converts ""soft"" topological questions, defined up to coherent systems of homotopies, into rigid questions of analytic or algebraic geometry. The PI has a proposal for the mirror of pure gauge theory in 3 dimensions, which controls the gauging and 2-dimensional gauge theories such as arise from symplectic manifolds with Hamiltonian group actions. Another component of the research involves gauge theory in 3 dimensions, specifically Chern-Simons theory, which seems to lie half-way between the soft A- and the rigid B-model. Finally, a small project involving representation theory (geometric Langlands duality for algebraic curves) will be undertaken: the construction of a generic Langlands kernel for simply laced groups, which relies on cohomological and algebro-geometric techniques, but the subject is informed and inspired by electric-magnetic duality for gauge theory in 4 dimensions."

The overall goals of the thematic semester is to highlight the current research in Lie theory and its applications to other fields. This will be achieved by having four workshops and four mini-courses.  The mini-courses are split into two winter schools and are  designed  to prepare students and postdoctoral fellows to take advantage of the workshops.  The workshops will focus on recent developments in combinatorial representation theory, Hall and cluster algebras, mathematical physics and categorification.  One of the aims is to highlight the connections between these four avenues of research.  For instance, the combinatorics of q-characters has been important in both Hall and cluster algebras and categorification.  The ideas coming from integrable systems, such as the Q-systems, has had a major impact on combinatorial representation theory and cluster algebras.  The speakers of each workshop have been chosen to reflect the synergy between  these different directions in Lie theory. <br/><br/>Lie theory is a central area of contemporary mathematics.  The structure and representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras have resulted in important applications in physics and other branches of mathematics and, in turn, Lie theory has benefited from these connections.  The Centre de Recherches Mathematiques at the University of Montreal is world renowned for its thematic semesters, scientific workshops and outreach activities and is one of Canada's national centers for fundamental research in mathematics and their applications.  This grant will foster international collaborations and to increase connections between US and Canadian researchers.  The interactions with a diverse community of mathematicians will help young mathematicians to develop a strong research program.  They will be able to take advantage of the opportunities for international collaborations.  The opportunity to speak at the workshop and/or the thematic seminar will help them to disseminate their work to senior mathematicians.  This will also help them to apply for international postdoctoral positions which frequently need a local mentor.  The interactions between the senior mathematicians from the US and international graduate students will also help to broaden the pool of applications to US graduate programs."

Some of the most impressive breakthroughs in recent decades, such as Borcherds' proof of the Moonshine Conjecture, the resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem by Wiles, and the proof of the Fundamental Lemma by Chau, are automorphic in nature. So are many other celebrated conjectures, such as those of Langlands and Bloch-Kato, which remain open, and those of Serre and Sato-Tate, whose proofs have recently been published or announced. Important new families of automorphic forms are still being discovered, such as the harmonic Maass forms and mock modular forms which lie behind Ramanujan's mock theta functions. This conference includes talks from throughout this important area of mathematics.<br/><br/>The AFW serves an important role in the community through its tradition of welcoming and mentoring junior researchers in the area. Many senior researchers have attended the workshop at some point in their career, and many mathematicians (including two of the PIs) gave one of their first conference talks as graduate students at an AFW. The workshop has led to many research collaborations and research papers, and the conference traditionally includes panel discussions on topics designed to further the mathematical careers of junior participants. Additionally, the AFW has always had a welcoming reputation towards women and members of other underrepresented groups; historically, a substantial percentage of participants have been women. The AFW attracts participants from around the world, from different career stages, and from different types of universities."

There will be approximately 20 speakers and an anticipated 200 participants. The conference will focus on number theory, with emphasis on its many relationships with analysis and spectral theory. Both (Fourier) analysis and spectral theory have their origins in understanding oscillating systems, interpreted broadly. It is very surprising, then, that they have been found to play a basic role in number theory. In his 1859 study of  primes, Riemann observed that the number of primes up to a given integer could be expressed simply as a sum of oscillating components. It was later observed that  that the ""frequencies"" occurring in Riemann's analysis show many regularities, and behave as if they were the eigenvalues of a large unitary matrix - i.e., an abstraction of the frequency spectrum of a drum.  A further link was the discovery, beginning in the work of Maass and Selberg, of highly symmetric geometries (locally symmetric spaces)  whose frequency spectrum appears to control many problems in number theory. These themes have expanded in many directions since, encompassing the field of analytic number theory as well as much of automorphic forms. The conference will examine the latest developments in these areas.<br/><br/>Topics to be highlighted include arithmetic quantum chaos, analysis of families of L-functions, arithmetic statistics, and connections with ergodic theory. These areas have seen a flurry of activity in recent years, including: the resolution by Lindenstrauss of quantum unique ergodicity for arithmetic surfaces; spectacular breakthroughs by Bhargava and his colleagues concerning the statistics of number fields and elliptic curves; detailed models and predictions for the zero and value distribution of L-functions that were inspired via connections with random matrix theory; construction and the analysis of highly efficient expander graphs; the development of additive combinatorics based on the work of Green and Tao.

Identify the elliptic Bethe algebra with the algebra of functions on the critical set of the corresponding elliptic master function; develop relations with an elliptic Schubert calculus. Identify the XXX Bethe algebra with the algebra of functions on the intersection of suitably deformed Schubert varieties. 3) Find a potential for a KZ-type connection and a Frobenius-like structure on the base of the KZ-type connection. 4) Develop a relation between the critical set of master functions associated with an affine Lie algebra and classical integrable hierarchies associated with that Lie algebra. Develop a correspondence between populations of critical points of master functions associated with a tensor product of irreducible modules over a simple Lie algebra and the decomposition of the tensor product into irreducibles. 5) In terms of discriminantal arrangements develop a geometric realization of the BGG resolution of an irreducible module over a simple Lie algebra."

The models are from a special class of models, called integrable models.  This means that due to their high degree of symmetry, they have a sufficient number of conservation laws -- generalizing conservation of energy -- that they can be solved exactly.  Such models can be found in statistical mechanics (discrete, possibly finite systems) and in quantum field theory (continuous, infinite-dimensional systems).  There are many structures in mathematics that can be studied by using techniques and results from the solutions of such systems.  They appear in combinatorics, number theory, representations of non-commutative algebras, and geometry, to name a few.  The results of this project will advance understanding in all these areas.<br/> <br/>Frequently, integrable systems such as quantum spin chains in statistical mechanics, and conformal field theories and their massive deformations, can be described in representation-theoretical terms.  For example, the transfer matrix of the Heisenberg spin chains can be given a meaning as a q-character of a finite-dimensional module of quantum affine algebras.  The Hilbert space of integrable quantum field theories can be expressed as an infinite-dimensional modules of extensions of the (deformed) Virasoro algebra.  Transfer matrices, and the characters of the Virasoro modules, satisfy difference equations or equations which can be shown to be discrete integrable equations.  The transfer matrices satisfy a discrete Hirota-type equation which have interpretations as cluster algebra mutations.  The following projects are proposed here:  (1) The study of the difference equations satisfied by the non-commutative generating functions of graded conformal blocks of WZW theories (generalizations of Demazure modules).  These generating functions are expressed in terms of the cluster variables in the quantum cluster algebra corresponding to Q-systems for characters of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules; (2) The explicit solutions of these equations as fermionic character formulas; (3) The integrable structure of the difference equations; (4) The stabilized limits of these functions which give characters of affine algebra modules or Virasoro modules;  (5) Solutions of discrete integrable equations known as T-systems and quantum T-systems (in the sense of quantum cluster algebras) and their relation to Nakajima's t,q-characters; (6) Higher-dimensional integrable difference equations, generalizing the T-systems viewed as Plucker relations, expressing the discrete structure of the higher-dimensional analogs of the pentagram maps in algebraic terms; and (7) Statistical path models which give explicit solutions for Whittaker vectors, functions and quantum Toda Hamiltonians for finite, affine and quantum algebras."

The researchers intend to focus on four related topics: (1) Mumford-Tate (MT) domains, (2) moduli spaces, (3) algebraic cycles and the Hodge conjecture, and (4) mixed Hodge modules.  (1) MT domains are classifying spaces of Hodge structures, and, roughly speaking, the boundary components of Mumford-Tate domains parametrize degenerations of Hodge structures.  The PIs intend to advance number theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry by studying Mumford-Tate domains and their boundary components.  For example, the PIs plan to extend work of Carayol, which seeks to associate Galois representations to automorphic representations whose archimedian component is a degenerate limit of discrete series.  (2) The second topic concerns the realization of moduli spaces of geometric objects as quotients of discrete groups.  An example of such a realization is the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves, which can be realized as a ball quotient, where the 6 dimensional ball in question sits in the MT domain of K3 surfaces.  However, there are not many examples of this type known.  The PIs intend to look for more.  (3) The third topic involves the approach to the Hodge conjecture via normal functions and their singularities due to Green and Griffiths. The PIs will develop this approach in several directions.  For example, they will study the archimedean height function associated to a normal function, and they intend to study the non-reductive MT groups associated to normal functions.  (4) Finally, the PIs will develop a flexible theory of complex variations of mixed Hodge modules and apply it to questions arising in representation theory.  In particular, they would like to understand the structure of conformal blocks viewed as complex mixed Hodge modules on the moduli spaces of stable curves.<br/><br/>Hodge theory is a central area of algebraic geometry with roots in the the classical (19th century) theory of special functions and period integrals.  From a modern point of view, the goal of Hodge theory is to relate topological invariants of algebraic varieties to arithmetic and analytic invariants.  The central notion is that of a Hodge structure on the cohomology groups of an algebraic variety.  While the cohomology groups are purely topological, depending only on the shape of variety, the Hodge structure is a much more sensitive invariant. Consequently, the Hodge structure carries a great deal of important algebro-geometric and number-theoretical information.  The most famous unsolved problem in algebraic geometry is the Hodge conjecture, a question about the relationship between the Hodge structure of the cohomology groups of a variety and the existence of certain subvarieties.  This focus on the relationship between topological objects and finer analytic invariants is typical of Hodge theory as a whole, and it is the main motivation for the research supported by this FRG.  This research will consequently impact several areas of mathematics including number theory, algebraic geometry and representation theory.  Owing to the number of techniques involved, the PIs have a diverse set of skills and points of view.  An important component of the FRG will be devoted to conferences, which will exchange ideas between the PIs and train postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in a wide range of topics having to do with Hodge theory."

In mathematics symmetries are described by abstract objects called groups.  Representation theory, originating in the work of mathematicians such as Issai Schur and Ferdinand Frobenius at the end of the 19th century, studies how the structure of groups can be captured by simpler, linear objects, in particular, matrices.  Apart from making groups more concrete, it has long been realized that this is critical for understanding how groups act on other objects.  For example, in physics one is interested in how the symmetry groups of nature, such as translations and rotations, act on physical systems.  This is why, starting in the 1920's, the representation theory of unitary groups, in particular, has been central to the development of quantum mechanics and particle physics.   Recently, surprising connections have also been uncovered between representation theory and problems of a seemingly very different character, such as finding the number of operations required on a computer to carry out arithmetic computations, aligning a large number of noisy images of the same molecule taken by a certain type of electron-microscope, and ranking problems in statistical machine learning.  The aim of the summer school is to engage graduate students from across the sciences in research in these exciting new areas.<br/><br/>In recent years representation theory has found new applications in a range of domains from cryo-electron microscopy, through machine learning, to holographic algorithms.  The fact that the subject is usually taught for an audience in pure mathematics makes it challenging for graduate students in more applied disciplines to learn the material. Conversely, mathematicians are often not aware of the new, exciting applications of representation theory.  This summer school attempts to bridge this gap by starting with a short introduction to representation theory, followed by a series of mini-courses on some of the most recent work on using representation theoretical ideas in imaging, signal processing, holographic algorithms, quantum computing, algebraic and geometric computational complexity theory, non-commutative Fourier transforms, and other areas.  Each of these subjects is presented by one of the leading experts in the area.

This conference aims to bring together top experts along with junior researchers and graduate students in the active fields of number theory and automorphic forms.  Distinguished speakers include Abel prize winners Jean-Pierre Serre and John Tate.  From the synergy of a gathering of researchers with related interests but complementary knowledge and skills, advances are expected in research programs for the participants, dissemination of important current work by experts to a broad audience, and professional development for junior researchers and graduate students.  <br/><br/>Number theory has long fascinated and challenged curious minds; in recent years, it is becoming an indispensable tool for many practical applications including communication, coding theory, and cryptography. In the 1960's and 70's Langlands revolutionized number theory with broad conjectures linking algebraic number theory to automorphic forms, which, if proved, would unify large areas of mathematics.  The proof of the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil conjecture and Serre's conjecture for degree-2 Galois representations over finite fields provided dramatic examples.  Applications of these results have been seen in many areas of number theory including the theory of noncongruence modular forms. The coefficients of automorphic forms, central to this theory, often appear when counting interesting mathematical objects, including integer partitions.  Among the applications of modular forms, one of the most unexpected is in the construction of expanders, which are also known as Ramanujan graphs.  In recent years, there are applications of Ramanujan graphs to coding theory and cryptography. This conference will enable direct communication between both seasoned experts and junior researchers about current progress on these topics.  This will not only encourage new collaborations and research projects, but we also expect distinguished experts to use their insights to guide the research trajectories of many junior participants. This conference will impact society in a few distinct ways.  First, we expect significant professional development, especially for graduate students and junior researchers, through contact with distinguished plenary speakers, and participation in special sessions.   In addition, we expect broad dissemination of the results of this conference both through our website, where we will post slides of talks and posters, and through a potential proceedings volume for the meeting.  Finally, we expect this conference to draw publicity to the number theory currently being done in the south, and work being done by female number theorists. <br/><br/>Conference website: https://www.math.lsu.edu/nt2014/"

The main part of this project concerns some categorical arithmetic invariants such as dimensions, exponents, Frobenius-Schur indicators, and representations of the modular group associated with modular tensor categories. These arithmetic invariants are closely related among each other, and they serve as important tools for studying these algebraic structures. A basic question is the relationship between the prime factors of the dimension of a simple object and those of the quasi-exponent of the underlying category. Any progress here would help in proving a conjecture of Kaplansky on semisimple Hopf algebras that remains open. The project also concerns the classification of Hopf algebras whose dimensions admit a simple prime factorization. Progress on the preceding basic question would also help in classifying finite-dimensional Hopf algebras.<br/><br/>The appeal of symmetry has been guidance for understanding the nature of science. Some symmetry can be described in terms of algebraic structures. For instance, the symmetry of platonic solids can be described by some finite groups of spatial rotations. Hopf algebras and tensor categories are generalizations of groups which can also describe the symmetry of some physical systems.  They appear naturally in many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics such as conformal field theory, statistical mechanics, and quantum computations. Thus, a deeper understanding of these algebraic structures is of fundamental importance and it will eventually be useful in the other areas of science."

A common theme of the PI's research is the study of parameter spaces of geometric objects and enumerative questions about them (e.g. counting how many degree 2 polynomials satisfy certain properties).  While these questions start innocuously, they quickly become complicated and the modern approach involves a combination of geometric ideas with techniques and conjectures from other areas of mathematics and physics. For example, in one of the topics for proposed research, the PI plans to investigate the relation between certain parameter spaces and questions in knot theory; in previous work, the PI proved a special case of such a relation, motivated by ideas from mathematical physics.  In the other research topics, the PI will study similar phenomena; in each case, one expects fruitful feedback in both directions and hopes that new techniques for studying these parameter spaces will develop as a consequence.  In addition to the research aspects of this proposal, the PI plans to apply support towards mathematics education at different levels. Planned support includes outreach for middle and high-school women, activities joint with Math for America, and graduate-level courses and summer-school lectures.<br/><br/>The focus of this proposal is to study topics in the enumerative geometry of moduli spaces of various objects in algebraic geometry (sheaves, curves, surfaces), as well as questions and applications coming from neighboring fields.  The first topic is Donaldson-Thomas theory, where the proposed projects involve extending techniques based on vanishing cycles, with the goal of proving longstanding geometric conjectures in the subject.  There are also proposed applications to the study of curve singularities and knot invariants.  The second topic is quantum cohomology of quiver varieties; here the PI, jointly with A. Okounkov, has a long-term project relating geometric questions to constructions from quantum groups.  The third topic is algebraic surfaces in characteristic p, where the PI plans to study the behavior of cycles in families, using the geometry of Noether-Lefschetz degrees. In this case, the objectives are motivated by understanding consequences of the Tate conjecture in arithmetic geometry."

The simplest and oldest reason for which modular forms are useful to those other fields is that many sequences of integers of interest in number theory, combinatorics, algebra and representation theory, algebraic geometry, and theoretical physics have the surprising property that their generating function satisfies a functional equation that makes it a modular form. Hence the study of the arithmetic properties of these sequences becomes a part of the study of arithmetic property of modular forms. In particular, to study divisibility or congruence properties of those sequences modulo a prime number p, one must study the theory of modular forms modulo p.<br/><br/>The project proposes a new approach to this fundamental study, based on the determination of the structure of the big Hecke algebras acting on space of modular forms modulo p, and the existence of a Galois pseudo-representation attached to every modular form, not necessarily an eigenvector for the Hecke operators. This approach should allow for a systematic theory of congruences between the coefficients of weakly holomorphic modular forms, not only producing, as was often the case isolated examples of congruences, but leading to a complete classification of such congruences. It will also allow to completely describe the asymptotic behavior of coefficients of holomorphic modular forms modulo p, which is only known in certain very particular cases as of now, and, in the more mysterious case of weakly holomorphic modular forms, to better understand the ""chaos"" that conjecturally lurks behind these congruences, in particular leading to the proof of several outstanding conjectures concerning the reduction modulo primes p of the partition function. A second aspect of the project, which is distinct from the first but uses similar tools, aims at proving important cases of the Bloch-Kato conjecture relating special values of L-functions of motives and Selmer groups, and at developing the theory of p-adic L-functions. In the long run, those two aspects should be reunited into one very large theory of universal families of automorphic forms in mixed characteristic, including at the same time the Galois, L-functions, and coefficients aspects."

The main objective is to reveal new and further explore previously known links between the moduli spaces and objects in other fields of mathematics, in particular Representation Theory and Lower Dimensional Topology. The PI will work toward a proof of the mathematical conjecture relating the topological invariants of the Hilbert scheme of points on plane singular curves and the HOMFLY knot homology of the links of the singularities of the curve (Hilb/HOMFLY formula). The conjecture also reveals unexpected symmetries of the homology of torus knots: conjecturally, they form an irreducible representation of the rational Cherednik algebra of type A. The PI will explore the generalized Hilb/HOMFLY conjecture that relates the representation theory of the symplectic reflection algebras and the rational Cherednik algebras of types other than A. Finally, the PI describes the cohomology ring of the compactified Jacobians of quasi-homogeneous singularities. The PI (jointly with Zhiwei Yum) conjectures a relation between the cohomology ring of the compactified Jacobian of the curve and the structure ring of the moduli space of the rational maps to the curve: a local variation of the Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas relation. The educational component of the project offers a new model for the UMass REU program.  <br/><br/>Knot invariants and topological invariants allow us to analyze the global structure of complicated shapes by collecting local information about the shape. Complicated shapes occur naturally in biology (e.g. proteins, DNA), theoretical physics (strings), and other areas of natural science. Thus developing new invariants and computational methods for understanding of the global structure of complex shapes is an important mathematical problem with many potential applications. The PI strives to understand the hidden symmetries of already discovered invariants, develop new invariants, and find unexpected applications of these invariants to other areas of mathematics. The PI will also involve undergraduate students in cutting edge research through a summer research program integrating mentorship by faculty and graduate students. The PI aims to attract more students from underrepresented groups to mathematical research by reserving specific spaces in the summer research program for students from two local women's colleges. The PI will prepare graduate student mentors during the year by teaching related graduate classes and a reading seminar. This new summer research program structure will increase diversity and strengthen vertical integration in academia and improve the communication and flow of ideas between different generations of present and future researchers."

Second, the PI is concerned with arithmetic statistics for in finite families of automorphic representations and their L-functions. Third, the PI is involved in a joint project to classify the automorphic representations of unitary groups with arithmetic applications in mind.

The trace formula may be viewed as a twentieth century invention to tackle such fundamental problems effectively. Automorphic forms and the Langlands program become increasingly important in theoretical physics and would possibly shed light on our understanding of the universe.

To date it is now known that there are infinitely many primes for which the next prime is at most 270 larger. This is not the case for other naturally occurring sequences of numbers; for example, the squares do not have small gaps infinitely often. <br/><br/>The series of workshops will take stock of the broad range of recent developments in the field and will catalyze further progress.  This award will help bring junior US mathematicians (students, postdoctoral fellows, and other young researchers with limited access to resources) to the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques (CRM) in Montreal to participate in four workshops in Fall 2014 on the following topics:<br/>-- Statistics and number theory, September 15-19, 2014 (http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/act/theme/theme_2014_2_en/stats_e.php): A better understanding of the distribution of important statistics in the study of arithmetic objects;<br/>-- Additive combinatorics and expanders, October 6-10, 2014 (http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/act/theme/theme_2014_2_en/combinatoire_e.php): A vibrant subject in pure mathematics today, with fundamental recent breakthroughs on prime k-tuples, and group expansion properties;<br/>-- Counting arithmetic objects, ranks of elliptic curves, November 10-14, 2014 (http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/act/theme/theme_2014_2_en/counting_e.php): The inaugural meeting on the latest developments stemming from the ideas of Manjul Bhargava; <br/>-- New approaches in probabilistic and multiplicative number theory, December 8-12, 2014 (http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/act/theme/theme_2014_2_en/nombres_e.php): An area with an exciting renaissance, led by extraordinary recent work on primes and fragmentation, moments of the Riemann zeta function, and better understanding of running times of algorithms.<br/><br/>These subjects are hot topics in number theory of a broad scope.  The meetings will provide  opportunities for junior US researchers to interact with the leading researchers in the world in their field.  Developments in Manjul Bhargava's methods have largely been well understood only by his students and a few others; with a summer school at the CRM preceding this focused year and these workshops, many more people will be included and have an opportunity to learn these techniques.

His first proposed line of investigation is to apply Arthur's endoscopic classification of automorphic representations of the classical groups to the problem of estimating the multiplicities with which nontempered Archimedean representations occur at a given level.  The PI aims to establish a number of cases of a conjecture of Sarnak and Xue on these multiplicities, and give sharp asymptotics for the growth rate of Betti number of arithmetic manifolds in congruence towers.<br/><br/>The PI's second proposed investigation is into the concentration of higher rank eigenfunctions on compact locally symmetric spaces, and in particular the question of how large the L^p norms of such an eigenfunction or its restriction to various subspaces can be.  The first step of this is to derive the correct 'convex bounds' for these L^p norms, which will be sharp in the case of non-negative curvature and for spectral clusters in the general case, by combining techniques from semiclassical analysis and representation theory.  The second component is to improve these convex bounds (in particular, to produce a saving in the exponents) in as many cases as possible by introducing arithmetic amplification as in the work of Iwaniec and Sarnak.<br/><br/>Arithmetic manifolds are central objects in number theory, as they encode information about objects which were first studied by the Greeks such as prime numbers and the solutions of polynomial equations in integers or rational numbers.  They also allow one to study special cases of questions in geometry, analysis and mathematical physics using powerful tools from number theory.  An example of this is the recent progress on the Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture of Rudnick and Sarnak, which helps us to understand the way in which quantum mechanics starts to resemble classical mechanics at high energies.  The PI's proposed investigation of the concentration of eigenfunctions would improve our understanding of this phenomenon.  In addition, the `non-tempered' automorphic forms that the PI will study play an important role in many problems of counting and dynamics, and the project may have interesting consequences in these areas."

It is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, and its methods have for millenia been based on the interaction between the divisibility properties of whole numbers and their size.  Twentieth-century number theory formalized these two properties in two different ways.  Divisibility and the measure of size can be seen both as geometric and as dynamical properties, the latter rooted in the equations of mathematical physics.  The branch of mathematics concerned with their geometric relations is called arithmetic geometry; the branch concerned with their dynamical relations is called automorphic forms.  Symmetry plays a central role in both arithmetic geometry and automorphic forms; the hypothetical Langlands correspondence unifies these two branches by showing how each kind of symmetry encodes the other. The PI proposes to use this coding to understand objects on one side of the correspondence in terms of properties of the corresponding object on the other side. A particular focus is the transfer of divisibility properties of automorphic forms to arithmetic geometry, which often leads to surprisingly precise information about solutions of equations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project is a contribution to the arithmetic theory of automorphic forms, in the setting of the Langlands program, with special attention to the arithmetic of motives and their associated Galois representations arising in the cohomology of Shimura varieties, directly or by application of congruence methods.  The long-term goals are the identification of all such motives and all such Galois representations (the modularity problem) and the proof of outstanding conjectures on the arithmetic of motives, notably Deligne's conjecture on special values of L-functions, and the conjectures of Greenberg, Coates, Perrin-Riou, and others on the existence of p-adic L-functions, for the motives obtained in this way. Special attention is given to special values of tensor product L-functions. This project fits into an international program  to use the full range of available techniques to extend to all such motives results established for  L-functions of elliptic modular forms; the PI is actively collaborating with colleagues in France, Austria, Israel, Japan, and Hong Kong, as well as in the United States and Canada.  The methods involved in the present project combine standard techniques from arithmetic geometry and automorphic forms, the differential-geometric approach to cohomological automorphic forms on which the PI has worked for many years, with p-adic analysis, and representation theory."

Algebraic geometry is the geometry of non-linear algebra; its primary objects are sets described by collections of polynomials in several variables. Such sets, which include varieties and semialgebraic sets, arise in many contexts, notably in optimization, statistics, finance, and quantitative biology. Recent advances, both in theory and in computing resources, have enabled researchers to extend some of the techniques available for linear models to non-linear models. This project develops new methodologies based on algebraic geometry for both symbolic and numerical computing to tackle problems arising in such applications. <br/><br/>Intermediate steps between linear and non-linear algebra include piecewise-linear algebra (in particular, the max-plus algebra and tropical geometry) and multilinear algebra (in particular, the study of tensors and their decompositions). This project builds on these connections. Its four main themes are maximum likelihood geometry, Euclidean distance optimization, convex algebraic geometry, and classical moduli spaces. Concrete goals include the determination of the maximum likelihood degrees of determinantal varieties, the semialgebraic characterization of matrices with bounded nonnegative rank, the development of sum of squares relaxations for the Euclidean distance degree problem, and a geometric characterization of Gram spectrahedra. The design and implementation of novel algorithms for moduli spaces, for example for del Pezzo surfaces, forms a bridge to the research communities in core algebraic geometry."

A fundamental question is to find the quantities which are conserved by the waves, and this search lies at the heart of the study of integrable systems. The classical integrable Hamiltonian systems, like the KdV equation and the non-linear Schrodinger system, have been playing a fundamental role in physical theories, like the theory of wave interactions, plasma physics, and fiber optics, to name a few. The main goal of the first part of this project is to build up a rigorous theory of integrable systems of Hamiltonian partial differential equations, based on algebraic structures that were inspired by physics. It is expected that the integrable systems discovered as a result of this project will play an important role in the study of various physical phenomena.  The second part of this project has its origins in the last letter that Ramanujan wrote to G. H. Hardy in the early 1920's, where he wrote down 17 functions that had never been studied before (and which he named mock theta functions).  The second direction of the project is to study the connections of mock theta functions to representation theory.  It is expected that this will lead to new types of mock theta functions and to applications in number theory.<br/><br/>Some of the problems to be explored related to the first direction include the following:  (a) develop a theory of non-local Hamiltonian structures and corresponding theory of integrable systems, based on the notion of a ''non-local'' Poisson vertex algebra; (b) compute the variational Poisson cohomology for not necessarily quasi-constant coefficient Poisson differential operators, developing the methods of a 2013 paper with De Sole; (c) develop further the theory of the generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies and their Dirac reductions and establish their connection to the Kac-Wakimoto hierarchies.  Some of the problems to be explored related to the second direction include the following:  (a) compute character formulas for admissible representations of affine Lie superalgebras; (b) find explicit transformation formulas for the corresponding modified non-holomorphic theta-functions, in the spirit of Zwegers; (c) using quantum Hamiltonian reduction, compute modular transformation formulas and fusion rules of new representations of superconformal algebras."

The representation theory of Lie algebras and quantum groups is a dynamically developing field of modern mathematics.  It has had a large impact in other areas of mathematics, as well as in physics.  A central theme of this proposal is to understand and investigate the properties of canonical and crystal bases, which endow certain fundamental algebras (such as quantized enveloping algebras) with an additional structure that has proven to be fruitful for understanding these algebras and their realizations as matrices.  Understanding the relationship between these bases and closely related structures, such as totally positive varieties, geometric crystals, and cluster algebras, and their quantum and totally noncommutative analogues, is a unifying theme of this proposal.<br/><br/>In one project the PI proposes a new approach to the study of Hecke algebras based on the discovery of some new Hopf algebras:  the Hecke-Hopf algebras which contain Hecke algebras and co-act on them at the same time.  The new information resulting from this study allows for the construction of new solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation.   Another project in the proposal is to explore new bases in quantized enveloping algebras which possess remarkable properties such as braid group action and the compatibility with Joseph's decomposition of the quantized enveloping algebras.  These new bases are expected to settle the problem of decomposing endomorphism algebras of representations and to help explicitly compute the center of the ambient algebra. New information resulting from this study will be applied to constructing new quantum and noncommutative cluster structures and to the proof of the quantum Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture for those algebras."

The main techniques to be employed stem from the classical method of polarization which replaces arbitrary monomials with square-free monomials in order to study problems that behave well with respect to specialization. The techniques involve a circle of new ideas developed in the PI's thesis as well as in recent works of a number of other authors, which use Schur-Weyl duality in order to translate questions about equations/coordinate rings/syzygies into a ""generic setting"" where tools from combinatorics, topology and the representation theory of symmetric groups are readily available. The PI will study the coordinate rings and syzygies of a number of classical varieties, with a view towards applications to plethysm problems in combinatorics, or to the understanding of the general asymptotic structure of syzygies of projective varieties in algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>The proposed research pertains to the field of algebraic geometry, which is concerned with the study of algebraic varieties defined by systems of polynomial equations. Syzygies of algebraic varieties are a tool to better understand the equations, as well as the varieties themselves. They are defined inductively, in increasing order of their complexity, as the relations between the equations, the relations between these relations, and so on. When the algebraic varieties come equipped with a large group of symmetries, which is often the case in nature, the syzygies will inherit some of those symmetries. The PI and his collaborators will employ a combination of methods from algebraic geometry, combinatorial topology, commutative algebra, and representation theory in order to study the equations and syzygies of natural spaces of tensors (also known as multidimensional matrices or arrays). A fundamental problem that will be addressed concerns the generalization of the familiar statement from linear algebra which states that matrices of rank less than r are defined by the vanishing of the determinants of their r x r submatrices. For multidimensional arrays of dimension larger than two a general statement like this one is unknown, and would have important applications to algebraic statistics, biology, complexity theory, signal processing etc."

The object of this FRG project is to generalize this theory to higher Chern classes. One component of this generalization concerns how to define higher Chern classes in a way that facilitates studying them by L-series. This will be done by extending to the context of Iwasawa theory the adelic methods of Parshin and Beilinson. Another component of the generalization has to do with connecting higher Chern class invariants to L-series.  To do this, one needs enough structure in the arithmetic problem to see into its higher codimension features using L-series. Three particular cases will be considered are (i) Greenberg's conjecture over totally real fields, (ii) Iwasawa theory for imaginary quadratic fields at split primes, and (iii) the function field case.  Concerning (i), Greenberg has conjectured that the natural Iwasawa modules have trivial support in codimension one;  the PIs will study their codimension two support using L-series. Concerning (ii), work of Rubin, and of Kings and Johnson-Leung, suggests that one should study second Chern classes via symbols in K_2 groups associated to pairs of p-adic L-series.  Concerning (iii), the PIs will study the images under Chern class maps of classes defined by Witte in the function field case inside the higher relative K-groups of Iwasawa algebras.  One further component of this project has to do with generalizing to higher Chern classes the reduction techniques used in proving first Chern class Main Conjectures. This involves generalizing to Iwasawa algebras the theory of tilting complexes and derived equivalences which is used in group representation theory and in studying Fourier-Mukai functors.<br/><br/>This proposal deals with fundamental questions about the groups of symmetries of algebraic equations.  In the 1950's, Iwasawa began a new approach to the study of such equations by considering their behavior in infinite families. Iwasawa showed that many such families have well defined asymptotic behavior. This led to fundamental conjectures concerning the numerical growth rate of the symmetry groups arising from such families.  The proof of such ""Main Conjectures"" has been one of the  central goals of abstract algebra over the last 50 years.  This proposal has to do with the refinements of these conjectures which deal with more precise measures of rates of growth.  Concerning broad impacts, work on algebraic questions of this kind  has led to the development of technology essential to society, such as the improved compression and secure transmission of data."

This research project stands at the interface between classical questions about whole numbers and ideas from other subjects.  In one main project, the PI and his collaborators show how results in algebraic topology, the study of high-dimensional shapes and the relations between them, translate into statements about the arithmetic of various number systems.  In another, he and another group develop a new form of representation theory (the study of symmetries of linear spaces), which sheds light on phenomena of stabilization in number theory, topology, and algebra. To a first approximation, the work answers the question: when can an infinite object be described by a finite amount of data?  The PI will also continue his work in mathematical outreach, including a general-audience book to be released in 2014.<br/> <br/>This project investigates the Cohen-Lenstra conjectures concerning the variation of the p-part of the class group of number fields, and, more generally, distributional questions about the discriminants of G-extensions for G an arbitrary finite group.  The methods used are novel -- the PI and collaborators show that the Cohen-Lenstra conjectures follow from assertions about the cohomology of certain moduli spaces of branched covers of the complex projective line, known as  Hurwitz spaces.  These spaces can be defined purely topologically, and in fact the thrust of the work has been to show that new theorems in algebraic topology imply many popular conjectures about arithmetic statistics over function fields.  What's more, the topological results serve as a kind of machine for generating conjectures, or at least heuristics, about questions concerning the distribution of G-extensions over Q which have not yet been investigated.  For instance, the results suggest that if N is a random squarefree integer chosen uniformly from a large range, and X is the number of totally real quintic extensions with discriminant N, then X has the Poisson distribution with mean 1/120.  A new aspect of the project is the theory of FI-modules, developed by the PI in collaboration with Tom Church and Benson Farb.  This theory represents a new approach to homological stability, whose natural domain of application is not sequences of unadorned vector spaces but rather sequences of vector spaces whose nth term is a representation of the symmetric group on n letters.  It turns out that there is a natural abelian category, called the category of FI-modules, which captures a broad spectrum of phenomena ranging from cohomology of moduli spaces to the coinvariant algebras arising in algebraic combinatorics to the statistics of squarefree polynomials and tori in Lie groups over finite fields.  In this research project, besides continuing investigation of the inherent structure of the category of FI-modules, it is planned to bring this work into contact with other work with Venkatesh and Westerland.  A typical question to be investigated is:  are there infinitely many cubic extensions of a rational function field over a finite field (or, better:  what is the expected number of cubic extensions, asymptotically) whose discriminant is prime (i.e. an irreducible polynomial over the finite field)?  The corresponding question over Q is a well-known open problem.  The project will also address a suite of other problems; geometric analogues of and approaches to the Kakeya problem in harmonic analysis, random matrices and the proportion of ordinary curves over finite fields, and, on the applied side, some questions about the application of geometry to problems in data science."

The solutions form a geometric object. The main idea is to study the rich and beautiful interplay between its geometric and algebraic properties. Closely related to this is the concept of a free resolution, which was introduced by the famous mathematician David Hilbert in two papers in 1890 and 1893. Constructing a free resolution amounts to repeatedly solving systems of polynomial equations. The study of these objects flourished in the second half of the twentieth century, and has seen spectacular progress in the last ten years. The field is very broad, with strong connections and applications to other mathematical areas and string theory. Recent computational methods have made it possible to compute free resolutions by computer. The main research goal in this project is to make significant progress in understanding the structure of free resolutions and their numerical invariants.<br/><br/>Free resolutions provide a method for describing the structure of finitely generated modules over a commutative noetherian ring. In the local and the graded cases there exists a minimal free resolution; it is unique up to an isomorphism and is contained in any free resolution of the resolved module. Hilbert proved that every finitely generated graded module over a polynomial ring has a finite minimal free resolution. There has been a lot of progress on the properties of finite free resolutions. Much less is known about the properties of infinite free resolutions, which occur abundantly over graded non-linear quotient rings of a polynomial ring. This project deals with infinite minimal free resolutions. It focusses on complete intersections and edge rings. The objectives are: (1) to build Boij-Soderberg Theory over graded complete intersections; (2) to explore applications of matrix factorizations; (3) to construct explicit minimal free resolutions over Clements-Lindstrom rings; (4) to provide formulas for the high differentials of a minimal free resolution over a complete intersection; (5) to study infinite minimal free resolutions over edge rings. The methods to be employed in (1), (2), and (4) are those recently introduced by Eisenbud and Peeva in their work on matrix factorizations for complete intersections. (3) is a continuation of Peeva's work on Clements-Lindstrom rings. The broader impacts of the proposed activities include advising students, organizing conferences, and the PI will continue to serve as an editor of the journal Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society."

As always with such discoveries, this understanding facilitates dialogue between previously disconnected fields, with the consequence that well understood structures in one area may be profitably translated into another.  Such confluences also offer ideal training grounds for graduate students: there are many new, exciting, and unexplored questions on which to work; at the same time, the answers clarify old and established fields of knowledge.<br/><br/>In particular the project centers around a conjecture (due to the PI and collaborators) equating certain algebrao-geometric invariants of plane curve singularities with topological invariants of knots determined by the singularities. Specifically, the former is the local contribution of the singular curve to motivic or categorified Donaldson-Thomas theory, and the latter are the Khovanov-Rozansky homologies. The research project aims at a proof by passing through two other subjects: the theory of Legendrian knots and the non-abelian Hodge correspondence. This intersection of algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and low dimensional topology is the only place in mathematics where the quantum SU(n) invariants and their categorifications have ever been seen as coming from the geometry of a knot in space, as opposed to from its planar projections. In addition, the research touches meaningfully on many subjects of present mathematical interest: enumerative geometry as influenced by string theory, the Hitchin system, Khovanov-Rozansky homology, the Cherednik algebra and its representations, legendrian knots and symplectic field theory, and 3-manifold invariants. It may be expected to advance some of these separately by exploiting their connections. In particular the project aims to make progress on the ""P = W"" conjecture in nonabelian Hodge theory, and on the question in symplectic field theory of whether all representations of the Chekanov-Eliashberg dga come from geometry.<br/><br/>The award is co-funded by the Algebra and Number Theory and the Topology programs."

In the simplest situations, these touch on beautiful constructions from classical algebraic geometry. Beyond these, one quickly encounters deep geometric problems not accessible through classical techniques.  Specific research questions will include: How to interpret moduli spaces of K3 surfaces with level structure geometrically? To what extent can these be organized using notions of derived equivalence for K3 surfaces and their twisted analogs? Can these techniques be used to evaluate Brauer-Manin obstructions explicitly? Given two derived-equivalent K3 surfaces, how are their Diophantine properties related, especially over local fields? For del Pezzo fibrations over curves, how are spaces of rational curves governed by cohomological invariants? As the numerical invariants of the fibrations vary, what inductive structures are shown by the spaces of rational curves?

Furthermore, it has become transparently evident that the higher categorical language is beautifully suited to describing cornerstone concepts in modern theoretical physics. As we head into the second decade of the 21st century, modern geometry and theoretical physics are more intertwined than ever before. The convergence of ideas from mathematics and physics is accelerating at the same time as elementary particle physics is on the cusp of a profound revolution to be brought about by the new experimental results coming out of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These will serve to identify among the multitude of theoretical possibilities currently open, which ones best address quantum field theory at the high energy scale. At the same time, a lot of mathematical work remains to be done to provide a suitable framework for the new physical theories that are being proposed. The geometric objects which we investigate today are the foundations for such a framework: homological mirror symmetry is the mathematical realization of dualities among super-symmetric theories, and higher categories are the mathematical foundation for quantum field theories. These new flavors of geometry, in which categorical structures play a primordial role, will certainly continue to play a fundamental role in 21st century theoretical physics.<br/><br/>The conference website: http://math.berkeley.edu/~auroux/miami2014.html"

This problem (the basis of the subject of knot theory) has implications in physics (quantum theory), chemistry (molecular knots) and biology (knotting of DNA).  A central tool in classifying knots, and indeed in many topological questions, is to assign an invariant to a knot:  two knots are then different if their invariants are different.  The goal is find robust invariants which can distinguish different knots.  This project explores new types of knot invariants and continues the trend of using tools from algebra to define and investigate knot invariants.  The PI will use techniques from the mathematical fields of algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and representation theory. The focus of the project is on the class of knots and links that arise from intersecting an algebraic curve in the plane with a small sphere centered at the singularity of the curve (such knots and links are called algebraic). In this project the PI will study the interaction between the topological invariants of algebraic knots and links and certain algebraic and combinatorial objects associated to the corresponding curve.<br/><br/>Quantum knot invariants have proven to be a powerful tool in low-dimensional topology.  To every knot one can associate a polynomial with integer coefficients in one variable (as in the Alexander polynomial or the Jones polynomial) or in two variables (as in the HOMFLY polynomial).  It has recently been discovered by the PI and his collaborators that for torus knots all coefficients in the HOMFLY polynomial are in fact nonnegative.  To prove this fact, certain representations of the rational Cherednik algebra were studied and it was shown that the dimensions of some graded subspaces match the HOMFLY coefficients.  Khovanov and Rozansky introduced another collection of vector spaces, called HOMFLY homology, such that the HOMFLY coefficients are presented as alternating sums of their dimensions.  The similarity of the two constructions suggests that for a torus knot Khovanov-Rozansky homology may be isomorphic to a representation of the rational Cherednik algebra, equipped with an extra grading (or filtration).  This conjecture has been verified in many examples, but remains open in general.  The PI plans to use the representation theory of rational Cherednik algebras for the construction of explicit combinatorial and geometric models for the Khovanov-Rozansky homology of torus knots, and their generalizations to algebraic knots and links.  Other knot homology theories, such as Heegaard-Floer homology, will also be studied."

This insight led to major breakthroughs and to several categories of motives. Noncommutative algebraic geometry, a recent branch of mathematics, is concerned with the study of noncommutative algebraic varieties, i.e., differential graded (=dg) categories. Recently, Kontsevich had also the motivic idea of replacing the different homology theories of noncommutative algebraic varieties (K-theory, cyclic homology, topological Hochschild homology, etc) by the ""universal"" one. Similarly, this led to several categories of noncommutative motives. The main objective of this project is to bridge the gap between the above two motivic ideas. Concretely, the Principal Investigator (PI) will construct appropriate symmetric monoidal functors relating the categories of motives and noncommutative motives. Among the manifold uses of such functors, the PI will exploit them to address the Schur/Kimura finiteness of motives as well as the rationality of motivic zeta functions.<br/><br/>The theory of motives was envisioned by Grothendieck in the sixties and greatly developed since then by Beilinson, Deligne, Voevodsky, and others.

These will enable the interchange of results, techniques, ideas, and insights between the commutative and the noncommutative world. In order to make these results accessible to the mathematical community, the PI will lecture graduate courses, disseminate them online, organize working seminars, and write the first book on the subject.

For example, the PIs plan to extend work of Carayol, which seeks to associate Galois representations to automorphic representations whose archimedian component is a degenerate limit of discrete series.  (2) The second topic concerns the realization of moduli spaces of geometric objects as quotients of discrete groups.  An example of such a realization is the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves, which can be realized as a ball quotient, where the 6 dimensional ball in question sits in the MT domain of K3 surfaces.  However, there are not many examples of this type known.  The PIs intend to look for more.  (3) The third topic involves the approach to the Hodge conjecture via normal functions and their singularities due to Green and Griffiths. The PIs will develop this approach in several directions.  For example, they will study the archimedean height function associated to a normal function, and they intend to study the non-reductive MT groups associated to normal functions.  (4) Finally, the PIs will develop a flexible theory of complex variations of mixed Hodge modules and apply it to questions arising in representation theory.  In particular, they would like to understand the structure of conformal blocks viewed as complex mixed Hodge modules on the moduli spaces of stable curves.<br/><br/>Hodge theory is a central area of algebraic geometry with roots in the the classical (19th century) theory of special functions and period integrals.  From a modern point of view, the goal of Hodge theory is to relate topological invariants of algebraic varieties to arithmetic and analytic invariants.  The central notion is that of a Hodge structure on the cohomology groups of an algebraic variety.  While the cohomology groups are purely topological, depending only on the shape of variety, the Hodge structure is a much more sensitive invariant. Consequently, the Hodge structure carries a great deal of important algebro-geometric and number-theoretical information.  The most famous unsolved problem in algebraic geometry is the Hodge conjecture, a question about the relationship between the Hodge structure of the cohomology groups of a variety and the existence of certain subvarieties.  This focus on the relationship between topological objects and finer analytic invariants is typical of Hodge theory as a whole, and it is the main motivation for the research supported by this FRG.  This research will consequently impact several areas of mathematics including number theory, algebraic geometry and representation theory.  Owing to the number of techniques involved, the PIs have a diverse set of skills and points of view.  An important component of the FRG will be devoted to conferences, which will exchange ideas between the PIs and train postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in a wide range of topics having to do with Hodge theory."

In their many applications,  differential and difference equations describe the evolution and dynamics of complex systems.  Various  methods, computational and analytic, for example, are commonly employed to understand and solve these equations. With this project, ideas from algebra and logic, especially related to the principles of definability and  tameness of structure, will be used to understand differential and difference equations.   This basic research should have consequences in mathematics and the sciences broadly due to the importance of differential and difference equations in the applications of mathematics to the sciences. <br/><br/>Concretely, with regards to differential equations, this project will extend the fundamental model theoretic results about differential fields to the class of D-fields in a more expansive sense. Secondly, the project involves a study of the fine structure of definability and dependence in D-fields. In particular, the project will extend the Zilber trichotomy (or, at least, results of a similar flavor) to infinite dimensional types, and, thus, specializing to classical theories, to underdetermined difference-differential, partial differential, and Hasse differential equations. Moreover, a goal of the project is an explicit characterization the induced structure on sets with trivial forking geometry. Thirdly, the project will develop a theory of specializations of D-rings through a model theory of valued D-fields. Fourthly, the project includes a development of general D-Galois theories based on multiple model theoretic perspectives. Finally in connection to D-fields, the project  includes an ambitious application of the theory of D-fields which may have transformative consequences; that is, to realize Borger's F-1-geometry as the study of finite dimensional definable sets relative to a certain theory of D-rings. With regards to diophantine geometry, the project will address Zhang's dense orbit conjecture and the dynamical Mordell-Lang through the model theory of difference fields and methods from o-minimality.  The project includes a program establish the decidability of complicated fragments of the theory of C(t), the field of rational functions over the complex numbers."

The Gromov-Witten invariants serve as important ingredients in the study of Calabi-Yau manifolds and string theory. Since the discovery of the Gromov-Witten invariants, new insights are developing rapidly, which also provide many interesting new approaches to classical problems from algebraic geometry. The calculation of Gromov-Witten invariants is extremely difficult to perform on Calabi-Yau manifolds. This project aims to develop a new calculation method of Gromov-Witten invariants, and to apply the developments to produce new understandings in algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>The major focus of this project is to study the degeneration of Gromov-Witten theory. This will be carried out from the perspective of stable logarithmic maps developed jointly with Dan Abramovich, and independently by Mark Gross and Bernd Siebert. In particular, the PI proposes to prove a general gluing formula of logarithmic Gromov-Witten invariants. The theory of stable logarithmic maps also provides a useful tool for the study of rational curves on quasi-projective varieties. Another part of this project is to generalize Mori's theory in the non-proper cases, and to have a further understanding of the birational geometry of quasi-projective varieties."

Mathematicians understand and quantify symmetry via symmetry groups and their actions (or representations) on objects. For example, the bilateral symmetry of many animals is encoded by a reflection operation, while one needs both rotations and reflections to describe the more elaborate symmetry of a crystal. The noncommutativity inherent in some settings such as quantum physics, that nevertheless possess some symmetry, is sometimes viewed via actions of the Hopf algebras that generalize symmetry groups. This project investigates questions about representations of Hopf algebras and related algebraic structures. Hopf algebras arise in many fields of mathematics, such as combinatorics, number theory, topology, and mathematical physics, and results on their representations are of wide interest. The research project involves many collaborators and serves as a good training ground for the many graduate students, postdocs, and other young mathematicians with whom the PI works.<br/><br/>Categories of representations of Hopf algebras are tensor categories, a rich structure arising from their coproducts. In comparison to groups, Hopf algebras can behave quite differently and surprisingly.  Tensor categories of representations can be noncommutative, in contrast to those of groups, leading to some curious behavior. This project investigates support variety theory and the triangulated category structure of these noncommutative categories of representations, with the goal of developing it much more completely, as has been done in the (commutative) case of finite groups and finite group schemes. In order to make such progress, the project will also need to advance homological understanding of (finite dimensional) Hopf algebras, whose cohomology is conjectured to be finitely generated. In work with collaborators, the PI aims to prove the conjecture for some important classes of Hopf algebras, namely the pointed Hopf algebras of diagonal type that include as a special case the small quantum groups. In contrast to the better-understood small quantum groups, many in this larger class of Hopf algebras may have noncommutative categories of representations, and one must take more care in homological work as this leads to subtle differences. Some related homological projects involve an action of a Hopf algebra on an algebra, which may be studied by constructing a larger algebra built out of  the two. The PI will study such smash product algebras and their Hochschild cohomology, in particular the Gerstenhaber algebra structure, and related deformations."

The String-Math Conferences are a series of large meetings bringing together mathematicians and physicists who work on ideas related to string theory.  The nature of interactions between mathematicians and physicists has been thoroughly transformed in recent years.  String theory, as well as quantum field theory, has contributed a series of profound ideas which gave rise to entirely new mathematical fields and revitalized older ones.  By now there is a large and rapidly growing number of both mathematicians and physicists working at the string-theoretic interface between the two academic fields.  The influence flows in both directions, with mathematical techniques and ideas contributing crucially to major advances in string theory.<br/><br/>For mathematics, string theory has been a source of many significant inspirations, ranging from Seiberg-Witten theory in four-manifolds, to enumerative geometry and Gromov-Witten theory in algebraic geometry, to work on the Jones polynomial in knot theory, to advances in symplectic topology, to recent progress in the geometric Langlands program and the development of derived algebraic geometry and n-category theory.  In the other direction, mathematics has provided physicists with powerful tools, ranging from powerful differential geometric techniques for solving or analyzing key partial differential equations, to toric geometry, to K-theory and derived categories in D-branes, to the analysis of Calabi-Yau manifolds and string compactifications, to the use of modular forms and other arithmetic techniques.

This includes transforming combinatorial systems that involve natural numbers into higher-order structures built out of vector spaces whose dimensions are those numbers, while vector spaces themselves lift to categories. Integers are consistently lifted to complexes of vector spaces. Link homology theories constitute such a lift of quantum link invariants. The latter boast deep relations to quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, and many areas of mathematics, and categorifying link homology extends these relations and produces new ones at a higher structural level. The proposal will investigate categorification at roots of unity, which should lead to such structural lifting of the Chern-Simons theory and quantum 3-manifold invariants and, eventually, parts of conformal field theory. The project also aims to enhance and unite recent discoveries of cohomological operations on link homologies. These operations rigidify link homology groups and exhibit connections to algebraic topology; in the latter some of most profound result required studying not just homology groups and their extraordinary counterparts, but entire systems of cohomological operations on them.  It is likely that understanding the full algebra of cohomological operations on link homology will significanly advance this subject as well as many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics in its proximity. <br/><br/><br/>The project will investigate categorification and link homology, find cohomological operations that rigidify link homology theories, and advance categorification at roots of unity for quantum groups, their representations, and quantum link and 3-manifold invariants.

Recent work on categorification of quantum groups at roots of unity points to existence of a deep but undeveloped theory, including an analogue of homological algebra where the role of complexes is played by p-complexes. One of the project's goals is to categorify the Jones polynomial and other quantum link invariants at prime roots of unity by further developing categorification of quantum groups and their representations within the framework of p-complexes and hopfological algebra."

And there have been many fruitful interactions between L-functions and computational methods. Such interactions started with the Riemann zeta function which, famously, Riemann computed numerically. The role of computation in analytic number theory has continued to grow since then. The proposer will investigate certain L-functions from a computational viewpoint. This includes investigating their computational complexity, the derivation of new fast algorithms, with an application to learning about integer factorization, and the use of computation as an experimental tool in the study of L-functions.<br/><br/>The proposer will study several independent topics in analytic and computational number theory. The main topic is to investigate connections between subconvexity estimates of the Riemann zeta function, on the one hand, and its computational complexity on the other. Part of the novelty here is that these two aspects are weakly related in general. However, they connect strongly for the Riemann zeta function in the critical strip, and also for Dirichlet character sums to a power-full modulus, perhaps even for more number-theoretic objects. One goal of the project is to translate recent progress between the analytic and computational viewpoints. Another topic concerns the full moment conjectures of ``families'' of L-functions with symplectic or orthogonal symmetry. The proposer aims to derive uniform asymptotics for the full moment conjectures for such families, extending previous joint work with Michael Rubinstein in the unitary case. A third topic is to develop the recent algorithm for detecting squarefree numbers that was derived in joint work with Andrew Booker and Jon Keating, especially in relation to lower bounds for the growth rate of character sums over the primes."

The foci of the conferences will be on recent advances at the interface of representation theory and non-commutative algebra; on fostering an environment for the establishment of international collaborations between the US and Mexico in this research areas; and on exposing graduate students, post-docs, and young faculty in both countries to current developments in the field. The conference series has an international component and is co-funded by the International Science and Engineering Section.<br/><br/>The PIs will organize one four-day conference each academic year that will alternate between the US and Mexico. The main scientific topics of the conference series will be algebraic, geometric and homological methods in representation theory, categorification, and non-commutative algebra. The talks will cover some of the most recent trends including: cluster algebras, quantum groups, monoidal and additive categorifications, Calabi-Yau algebras and categories, and non-commutative projective algebraic geometry."

Fundamentally, algebraic geometry is the study and classification of geometric objects described by algebraic equations through manipulation of the input data using a wide array of mathematical tools. Because of its diversity, algebraic geometry permeates such different branches of science as robotics, cosmology, and computer encryption. The origins of algebraic geometry can be traced to the works of Euclid and Pythagoras. In its modern form, the focus of algebraic geometry is on singularities, which are points that are unusual when compared to their neighbors. Examples of singularities include cusps such as the tip of a funnel cloud, or self-intersections such as the center in a figure-of-eight; they indicate states in which a given physical system becomes anomalous.  This project also contributes to the training of the next generation of researchers by engaging graduate as well as undergraduate students in research. <br/><br/>The main focus of this project is the study of singularities through cohomological methods. To a singularity defined by a set of polynomial equations one may attach several invariants; these may be of discrete type (such as the number of branches of a curve meeting in a point) or of continuous nature (such as the space of all vector fields tangent to the singularity). If one considers a family of singularities, such invariants behave in interesting ways: on one side, at special members of the family they ""jump"" (that is, get larger in some sense), and such jumps are often accompanied by an appropriate nonzero local cohomology group.  The singularities where jumps occur typically exhibit worse behavior than their neighbors. On the other side, near typical members of the family, the invariants often deform according to so-called ""hypergeometric"" differential equations. One component of this project investigates, using local cohomology and combinatorial methods, jumps and solutions of the appearing hypergeometric differential equations. The other part of the project is concerned with the study of specific invariants in families of singularities derived through either calculus (the Gauss--Manin connection and Bernstein--Sato polynomial), counting techniques (the Igusa zeta function), or deformations (cohomology of the Milnor fiber), and their interplay."

The research described in this proposal aims to understand the properties of the integer solutions to systems of polynomials, via some analytic, algebraic, and geometric tools. Recent advances in cryptography and coding theory have depended on solutions to these problems.  For instance, most cell phone calls are protected by a code based on elliptic curves over a prime, one of the primary objects of study in the PI's field.<br/><br/>The PI will continue his work on integral p-adic Hodge theory. The first aim is to improve the understanding of integral structures (lattices) in semi-stable p-adic Galois representations, and then use this improvement to study the reduction of these representations. As the expected consequences, certain parts of automorphic lifting theorems and Serre's conjecture will be extended to more general settings. The second aim is to study Galois representations associated to automorphic representations and certain algebraic varieties. In particular, the PI and his collaborators will focus on the Galois representations arising from modular forms of noncongruence subgroups and certain torsion representations constructed (by Scholze) from Shimura varieties."

These methods and applications interact with most of branches of mathematics, including differential geometry, topology, number theory, and algebra, and can be useful in mathematical physics, cosmology, cryptography, and robotics. From its origin geometry is closely related to volume. The main objects under investigation are differential forms of volume type on families and their products. The project addresses problems on polynomial finite generatedness of those forms and on estimation of degrees of generators with respect to the dimension and possibly to some other discrete invariants of members of families. New techniques are needed in dealing with differential forms on families or relative differential forms. Another novelty of the project is to develop theory of the finite generatedness based on universal mappings from moduli theory instead of traditionally used vanishing of cohomologies.<br/><br/>The project deals with fundamental problems on linear systems of divisors associated to twisted differential forms on fibered spaces. Standard problems about linear systems are problems about their base points, about singularities of their general or special members, and about correspondences with or isomorphisms to other systems. Respectively, the PI considers the semiampleness problem for moduli part of weakly log canonical families, the construction of log canonical complements for fibered varieties with applications to log canonical local and global thresholds, to a new beta invariant and to Tian's alpha invariant, and explores possibility of an isomorphism between log canonical linear systems adjoint to the discriminant curve for different conic bundles structures of a threefold with applications to birational classification of those conic bundles. Strictly fibered cases for log canonical complements and for Sarkisov's links do not cover all possible cases, they cover main cases and remaining ones are exceptional. The latter form usually bounded families up to birational isomorphisms. A new technique relevant to these problems will be developed under the project. This makes use of relative toroidal log singularities, theory of b-polarizations, theory of moduli of triples, interlaced by flops, and correspondences of those moduli. Investigation of moduli of varieties defined up to flops is natural and agrees with the spirit of current birational geometry where the minimal models are defined up to flops."

This project concerns string theory, one of the most vibrant areas of research at this interface.  As we explore the boundaries of the regime of validity of string theory and address some of its theoretical shortcomings and the conditions of its peaceful co-existence with the theory of gravity, we rely on increasingly sophisticated mathematical models. F-theory is one of the most geometric corners of string theory and relies on elliptic fibrations to geometrically engineer models for particle physics and gravity at very high energy. This project explores the mathematics that governs the physics of F-theory in order to bring new insights to the mathematics of elliptic fibrations. Elliptic fibrations are geometric spaces that locally look like a long-exposure picture of an elliptic curve moving over another space. Elliptic curves are some of the oldest but yet most prominent objects across mathematics. They are studied in algebraic geometry and number theory and play a central role in representation theory, cryptography (where they are used to secure internet's transactions), computer modeling, and theoretical physics. This multi-disciplinary project will explore connections between these mathematical and physical concepts and will also encourage graduate students both in mathematics and physics to study problems at the interface of physics and mathematics. The PI will also reach out to students from underrepresented groups to inspire them to participate in the scientific endeavor. <br/><br/>Geometric engineering is the construction of physical systems by geometric methods. This is a natural approach in the context of string theory, where the geometry of extra dimensions and the dualities between different formulation and regimes of the theory allow for a geometric formulation of many physical constraints. This project focuses on the geometry of elliptic fibrations as seen from the point of view of string theory, with strong interest in their topology, arithmetic properties, and connection to gauge theories, Grand Unified Theories, and topological defects. The research will also address the problem of resolution of singularities of Weierstrass models and its connection to Mori's theory and representation theory and will explore the structure of the singular fibers of elliptic fibrations over higher dimensional spaces. The PI will also study the physics of topological defects such as cosmic string solutions using new models of elliptic fibrations. A central theme of this project is the prominent role of singularities, their resolutions, and their topological invariants."

The conference will bring together researchers in two subjects that have a close relationship historically, yet which tend to be viewed as unrelated nowadays.  One of the themes of the conference will be to advertise and establish new connection between them.  The PIs will try to attract younger mathematicians (with a recent Ph.D.) and graduate students, as well as members of under-represented groups.  Thus, they will encourage the speakers to give some expository material in their talks. Our proposed problem session(s) will give these mathematicians (and others) a point of focus for working in the field.  The organizers intend to produce a conference proceedings that contains some expository articles.<br/><br/>To be more specific, the two subjects mentioned above are Hodge theory and L2-cohomology. The first ""modern"" proof of the Hodge theorem, asserting that on a compact Riemannian manifold the (real) cohomology is represented by harmonic forms, used L2 methods (M. Gaffney, 1955); the de Rham cohomology of the manifold is its L2-cohomology. The Hodge decomposition for complex Kaehler manifolds (in particular, for smooth projective varieties) follows.  Subsequently, L2-cohomology was investigated when the manifold is non-compact, where the former is metric dependent.  A fundamental question is whether the L2-cohomology has a topological meaning, as it does in the compact case; a typical instance of this was the Zucker conjecture from 1980 (proved in 1987).  In the opposite direction, one can ask whether a given topological cohomology group is given by L2-cohomology, e.g., the Cheeger-Goresky-MacPherson conjecture from roughly the same time.  In both given instances, the topological object is (middle) intersection cohomology. On the other hand, the term ""Hodge theory"" now refers to anything emanating from the Hodge decomposition (or Hodge structure). This covers a vast amount of mathematical turf.  The conference will serve, in a small part, to have the participants better understand the subject's roots.  However, it will offer much more in that which looks forward.  For instance, the intersection cohomology of a complex projective variety carries a ""geometric"" Hodge structure (Mo. Saito, 1988; de Cataldo, 2010), yet it is not known whether the one coming from L2-cohomology coincides with it (if there is one at all in the second instance above). The connection with Dolbeault L2-cohomology needs to be treated. Moreover, the terrain can be expanded to the role of Lp conditions for p different from 2.  The PIs expect many of the talks to proceed along these lines.  The conference should promote collaboration between people from the different groups, thereby opening new directions in research. More details about the conference can be found at http://www.mathematics.jhu.edu/new/hodgetheoryconf/."

The emphasis is on the interplay between harmonic analysis and ergodic theory. The primary focus is the analysis of Whittaker periods. Whittaker periods of automorphic forms occur very frequently in many problems. Our goal is to have a complete theory and to prove sharp results. The proposal contains three closely related projects. A project motivated by the geometry of number concerns the uniform distribution of the skewness of integral flags in euclidean space. A related analytic problem is to estimate global Whittaker periods. We shall improve significantly previous results in the literature using global methods from ergodic theory. The third problem concerns local Whittaker functions. We want to establish the conjectural asymptotic behavior of Whittaker functions at infinity. There are several outcomes of proving this conjecture as well as applications to automorphic forms. The PI will apply methods from geometry and representation theory.<br/><br/><br/>Number theory is among the oldest branches in mathematics and basic arithmetic is taught in elementary school. Applications to technology are prevalent: communication systems, data processing, cryptographic algorithms. L-functions capture fundamental information about prime numbers which appear everywhere. The Langlands program is a vast network of conjectures and results motivated by the interplay between representation theory and number theory. The proposed research will provide a new bridge between the Langlands program and several topics in analysis and representation theory. This will deepen our understanding and knowledge through identifying profound analogies and stimulate collaboration between experts in different fields. Because of its history the interface between analysis and number theory has plenty of longstanding problems; the analysis of periods and L-functions is a central theme and driving force. <br/>The proposed research provides theoretical results which can be used as prospective tools in many different problems: numerical investigations by different teams, vanishing of special values and arithmetic cycles, moments, period bounds and subconvexity problems. The PI will continue to teach and mentor students research projects: junior papers, senior and PhD thesis, disseminating knowledge and discoveries while promoting learning through the investigation of open problems."
