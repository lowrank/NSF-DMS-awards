The                        principal investigator will analyze the weak (B,N)-pairs of                     rank three corresponding to a reducible rank 2 parabolic. In                    addition, he will determine the ""small"" amalgams.                                    The classification of finite simple groups has been a                      major concern for the past several decades with implications                    for many areas of algebra. This research is concerned with                      streamlining and revising portions of this classification,                      resulting in a clearer understanding of the area.                               Simultaneously, it will provide new insights into the geometry                  of these groups."

This would mark one of                 the entrances into the attack on the notorious Generalized                      Riemann Hypothesis, perhaps the most challenging open question of               the modern theory of numbers.                                                        The field of Analytic Number Theory applies to the discrete                realm of the whole numbers the techniques of Analysis, dependent                on the notions of continuity and limit, originating in Calculus.                The idea of using continuous methods to investigate the discrete                is two centuries old, but with the work of the modern analytic                  number theorists such as Professors Conrey and Ghosh, the field                 has had a new rebirth."

Let K                 be the function field of the surface S and A a central division                 algebra over K. The principal investigator will study the                       algebra A by using cohomological techniques from algebraic                      geometry in order to understand the ramification divisor of A                   on S. The project relates properties of the Brauer group of K                   to the geometry of divisors on S and considers questions about                  the factorization of the Brauer class of A into symbols.                             This research is in the general area of algebra and is an                  interesting combination of algebra, number theory and algebraic                 geometry. Given a surface it is possible to associate with it a                 coordinate ring and with this ring a group. This project will                   examine properties of this group in an effort to determine the                  geometry of the surface."

The                 theory of quadratic forms is an aspect of number theory that is                 almost as ancient as the whole field itself, and was advanced                   especially far by the great nineteenth-century mathematician C.F.

A spline is a thin strip of wood or metal that one may                     manipulate from the ends, to produce a smooth curve. In the                     simplest (one-dimensional) case, a mathematical spline is a                     curved graph segment for which one may specify the way in which                 the endpoints are held, to produce a smooth curve. Multivariate                 splines belong to functions of several variables in the way that                the splines mentioned above belong to functions of one variable.

Moh of Purdue University. His project is to                 prove that any algebraic variety in positive characteristic may                 be desingularized. In the case of a curve in the plane, whose                   defining equation may be complicated enough that the curve                      crosses over itself, it is not hard to imagine lifting one                      intersecting branch of the curve up out of the plane so as to                   remove the selfintersections, or ""singularities"". This was done                 in the last century not only conceptually, but by algebraic                     transformations, so that the originally singular (self-                         intersecting) curve now sat in a higher-dimensional space but no                longer intersected itself. This was done also for algebraic                     spaces of any dimension, but still in the geometrically intuitive               domain of zero-characteristic, in 1964 by Hironaka. It is                       Professor Moh's aim to desingularize algebraic spaces of                        arbitrary dimension in the less intuitive and algebraically                     difficult domain of positive characteristic.                                         This research is work in the algebraic geometry of positive                characteristic. Although the field originated with notions of                   continuously varying geometric structures like lines and planes,                in this context the discrete takes over, and methods akin to                    those from the theory of whole numbers are most useful.                         Reciprocally, the algebraic geometry of positive characteristic                 is now having great influence on the Theory of Numbers, and is                  finding application in Computer Science and Coding Theory."

Group theory began in the early nineteenth century as a                    description of operations that might be done successively, and                  also undone, as a ninety-degree clockwise rotation is undone by                 the ninety-degree counterclockwise rotation. Lie groups were                    developed in the late part of that century by the path breaking                 Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, who was interested in the                   most fundamental questions concerning differential equations.                   Now, one hundred years later, group theory pervades modern                      mathematics, and the utility of Lie groups in many branches of                  mathematics, as well as in physics, has continued undiminished."

This project is concerned with the classification of                       infinite abelian groups. The structure of finite abelian groups                 has been well understood for over a century. Infinite abelian                   groups, however, have remained elusive. This investigator will                  attack this problem from a new point of view."

Partial results along               these lines have already allowed Dr. Friedberg and his                          collaborators to conclude that when the L-function of an elliptic               curve defined over the rational numbers is nonzero at the value                 1, both the group of Q-rational points and the Tate-Shafarevich                 group of the elliptic curve are finite.

These curves, seemingly so simple, carry nonetheless                an astonishing amount of deep structure, and have been the basis                of farreaching conjectures of astonishing difficulty. Among these               conjectures are those made in the 1960's by Birch and Swinnerton-               Dyer, connecting values of certain functions to the structure of                elliptic curves.

Work will also be done on                     commutative algebra and algebraic geometry from the perspective                 of free resolutions and the theory of curves.                                        The research involved in this project has great breath and                 covers some of the most significant areas of modern theoretical                 algebra. This includes commutative algebra and the integral                     representations of the general linear group; the structure                      theory of noncommutative rings and, in particular, the                          representation theory of artin algebras; and commutative                        algebra and algebraic geometry. These areas are of interest to                  many branches of mathematics."

The                    contents of the notebooks reflected much of the mathematical                    style of the man. There are unsupported conjectures, claims and                 formulas written in an unorganized manner, covering vast areas of               mathematics.  No other recorded genius is known to have practiced               mathematics like Ramanujan.  He worked in isolation with only a                 few old books at his disposal.  He was not aware - or apparently                concerned - with structured mathematics as it had developed in                  the western world during the early part of the twentieth century.               Indeed, even today, none of those who have studied his remarkable               contributions and legacy, can comprehend how he came to have such               remarkable insight with so little formal training.  It is the                   search for this insight which motivates much of the work to be                  supported by this award.                                                             The means by which this effort will be carried out is simple               to state. One goes through the notebooks statement by statement                 (there are roughly 3000 results stated without proof), verifying                or negating each one, using all the powerful mathematical tools                 now available.  This task has been going on for many years.  The                first notebook is essentially understood and the second is also                 nearly complete. As a result of this, over 40 papers and two                    definitive books have appeared. Work is now progressing on the                  third which will involve higher order transformations of                        hypergeometric series and inversion formulas stated by Ramanujan.                    Some of the deepest work and potentially most difficult                    challenges will be in the area of asymptotic expansions of                      infinite series, products and integrals.  At some later time                    attention will have to be given to brief allusions to                           generalizations in the theory of elliptic functions made by                     Ramanujan in a 1914 paper.  Any progress here is expected to be                 of considerable interest to physicists."

Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature. The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the study of Modular and Automorphic Forms is one of the most active.
