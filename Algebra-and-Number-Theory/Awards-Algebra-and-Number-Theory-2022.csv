The Langlands program is one of the most expansive and consequential research programs in today's mathematics, spanning a breathtaking range of topics, from number theory to mathematical physics, and the summer school aims to highlight connections between various subfields, and train future researchers in this demanding and multifaceted area. At its heart, the Langlands program aims to understand solutions of diophantine equations (polynomial equations with integer coefficients) by establishing connections with the frequencies of certain higher-dimensional ""drums"" called ""arithmetic manifolds."" The modularity conjecture, which led to the proof of Fermat's ""last theorem,"" is one of the instances of such connections. Many of the world's foremost experts on the subject will be speaking in the summer school; the event is taking place 45 years after a historic summer school in Corvallis, Oregon, where the experts of the time set the agenda of the Langlands program for several decades. Meeting website: https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/6909/<br/><br/>Although the Langlands program has expanded too much to be covered in its entirety, the summer school will highlight connections between the representation-theoretic, arithmetic, and geometric aspects of it. On the analytic side, there will be updates on the status of endoscopy and beyond, trace formulas, the theory of periods of automorphic forms and L-functions, and explicit methods for proving functoriality. On the geometric side, developments around local and global Shimura varieties and shtukas will be covered, together with recent breakthroughs on the Langlands conjectures over function fields, the local Langlands conjectures, and relations to the geometric Langlands program. On the arithmetic side, new geometric insights on moduli spaces of Langlands parameters and Galois representations will be discussed, together with their connections to modularity lifting theorems and derived structures<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic Geometry is broadly interpreted to be the part of mathematics that studies systems of polynomial equations and inequalities. While Algebraic Geometry has often been considered a solely pure area of mathematics, the community of researchers of CCAAGS-22 promotes its applied and computational nature. Participants of CCAAGS-22 combine Algebraic Geometry with the techniques and methods from symbolic and numeric computation, algorithms, complexity theory, as well as problems motivated by applications in multiple fields. These methods have already seen applications in biology, coding theory, cryptography, combustion, computational geometry, computer graphics, quantum computing, control theory, geometric design, complexity theory, machine learning, nonlinear partial differential equations, optimization, robotics, and statistics, among others. The interaction between algebraic geometry and any of these other disciplines is beneficial for both sides.<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers and promotes interdisciplinary work in a fast growing area. After the lack of contact during the pandemic, this is a long overdue event. It is particularly useful for junior researchers whose careers strongly depend on making connections and networking.

A typical number theoretic question is to find all the whole number solutions of some equation of interest. By synthesizing the topological and algebraic properties of the graphs of these equations, one obtains a mathematical object (a collection of mathematical data) called a Galois representation which encodes many of the properties of the originating equation. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) which anticipate a very close relationship between these Galois representations and some very different kinds of group representations, known as automorphic representations, which arise out of mathematical analysis.  The goal of this project is to make progress on Langlands's conjectures by placing them in various more structural geometric frameworks, and then to use geometric methods and perspectives to establish relationships between these two different kinds of representations (Galois and automorphic). The project provides training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of the research project is to investigate both local and global aspects of the arithmetic Langlands program.  The principal investigator, Dr. Matthew Emerton, will construct moduli stacks of global Galois representations, and study their geometric properties, as well as the properties of the global-to-local restriction maps which map them to (products of) moduli stacks of local Galois representations.   These investigations are closely related to the problem of extending the Taylor--Wiles--Kisin patching method to the residually reducible case, and to the study of the Eisenstein part of cohomology, and Dr. Emerton will pursue these relationships, especially in the context of odd two-dimensional representations, which are connected to the cohomology of modular curves.  Dr. Emerton will also develop a new approach to the mod p deformation theory of crystalline local-at-p Galois representations, via their relationship to prismatic F-crystals and gauges.  The resulting improved understanding of this deformation theory should lead to new global results, such as new cases of the weight part of Serre's conjecture and new cases of the Breuil--Mezard conjecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such groups arise as groups of symmetries of various objects and are ubiquitous across many areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, and mathematical physics. In the arithmetic context, work done over the last six decades has resulted in a well-developed theory of linear algebraic groups over the rational numbers and other similar fields. While activity in this area is still ongoing, over the last ten years various problems in Lie group theory, arithmetic geometry, and other subjects have led to significant interest in the properties of algebraic groups over fields of geometric origin. Building on previous work, the research program will investigate the arithmetic, geometric, and structural aspects of algebraic groups over such higher-dimensional fields, with a particular focus on various finiteness properties. Mentoring graduate students and developing courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be an integral part of this work. In addition, a book project will be undertaken to open up recent developments in the emerging arithmetic theory of algebraic groups over higher-dimensional fields to a broader audience. <br/><br/>The project is a multi-faceted research program in the study of algebraic groups over higher-dimensional fields. The work will focus on the following three directions: the analysis of algebraic groups with good reduction and applications to local-global principles, the study of finiteness properties of unramified cohomology, and the investigation of rigidity phenomena for abstract homomorphisms of algebraic groups. A major goal in the study of groups with good reduction will be to make progress on a finiteness conjecture for forms of reductive algebraic groups over finitely generated fields having good reduction with respect to divisorial sets of discrete valuations. This work will significantly expand the scope of previous results, which dealt mainly with groups over fraction fields of Dedekind rings, and will also have important consequences for the properness of the global-to-local map in the Galois cohomology of algebraic groups. It turns out that, for certain types of groups, this finiteness conjecture is closely related to finiteness properties of unramified cohomology. As a result, one of the objectives will be to establish the expected finiteness of unramified cohomology in degree three for surfaces and certain higher-dimensional varieties over global fields. Concerning abstract homomorphisms, the goal will be to develop a substantial generalization of methods introduced in previous work to resolve a longstanding conjecture of Borel and Tits for all absolutely almost simple groups over infinite fields of relative rank at least two.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In all those specialized areas, very complicated structures emerge that cannot be completely understood at a granular level but whose ""overall shape"" can be understood by means of a geometric invariant, called the spectrum. One feature of this theory is that the same invariant makes sense, and provides deep insight, in every one of these apparently very different settings. This versatility provides a unified methodology and builds many bridges between different sub-specialties of the mathematical landscape. The objective of this project is to analyze the ""fundamental particles"" of tensor-triangular geometry, that is, the minimal such structures and how they assemble to build much larger ones. This project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>In more detail, the main problem to be addressed in this project is the concept of ""point"" in tensor-triangular geometry, in other words, the tensor-triangular fields, of which every large tensor-triangulated category is constituted. Such tensor-triangular fields already exist in special cases, like the ordinary fields of commutative algebra in algebraic geometry, or the Morava K-theories in stable homotopy theory. A main component of the program is to bring new techniques to bear on the problem of constructing such tensor-triangular fields in other settings, like representation theory, circumventing the shortcomings of so-called pi-points, or more ambitiously in motivic theory, where no candidates for the role of fields are known yet. Judging from the importance of (residue) fields in algebraic geometry for defining ranks, counting multiplicities, etc., a deeper understanding of tensor-triangular fields is expected to similarly generate many applications throughout tensor-triangular geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These functions arise both in the study of solutions to polynomial equations and in the study of highly-symmetric functions known as automorphic forms. A central insight is that the symmetry properties of automorphic forms may be used to prove properties of L-functions. The so-called relative Langlands program now gives us a conjectural framework describing the relationship between L-functions and certain invariants of automorphic forms known as periods. Analyzing these objects has combined tools from harmonic analysis, algebraic geometry, representation theory, and mathematical physics. In this project, the PI will develop and generalize a novel theory, known as endoscopy, to further study these period integrals of automorphic forms. The project will also support the PI as he mentors graduate and undergraduate students, organizes conferences and workshops, and contributes to the Automorphic Project. <br/><br/>The relative trace formula is a central tool in the relative Langlands program for studying automorphic periods. Despite this, its theory has not yet been developed to meet the needs of the broader theory, and it has largely been used in contexts with strong multiplicity-one properties. This project will develop a novel theory of endoscopy and stabilization for relative trace formulae. This can be seen as a generalization of the Langlands-Shelstad-Kottwitz program of stabilization of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula, and will open the technique of comparison of trace formulas to periods where local multiplicity one may fail. The main goals of the project are: (1) to pre-stabilize the elliptic part of the relative trace formula associated to a large family of periods, (2) to develop a robust local and global theory of endoscopy in this setting and consider the stabilization of the relative analogues of the Hitchin fibration following the work of Ngo, (3) establish the central harmonic-analytic conjectures to affect new global comparisons of relative trace formulae in several cases of interest to arithmetic applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central aspect of these fields is the study of polynomials in many variables - or multivariate polynomials.  Multivariate polynomials appear in a wide range of applications such as mechanical engineering, robotics, computer-aided design, and numerical partial differential equations.  The research will be clustered in three interconnected areas where multivariate polynomials play an essential role.  The first is configurations of linear subspaces, such as lines in the plane.  The second is interpolation, which involves fitting data with a polynomial model.  The third is piecewise polynomial functions, or splines, such as the Bezier splines common in drawing programs.  Each of these fields have major unsolved conjectures revolving around the impact of combinatorics and geometry on corresponding algebraic objects.  A recurring theme of the project is to use rigidity theory, which has its origins in structural engineering, to elucidate this impact.  Several lines of inquiry are a collaborative effort among the disparate communities of numerical analysis, rigidity theory, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry. The project includes training opportunities for graduate students.  This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project focuses on problems where the interactions between geometry, combinatorics, and algebra are not well-understood.  A first goal is to use rigidity theory to systematically produce line arrangements with fixed combinatorics whose module of derivations has changing structure based on the geometry, generalizing an example of Ziegler.  Understanding these examples sheds additional light on Terao's conjecture, which proposes that freeness of an arrangement is combinatorial. A second goal involves searching for a counterexample to a conjecture in numerical analysis using a hybrid of symbolic and numerical methods based on techniques analogous to rigidity theory.  This conjecture, which is long-standing, proposes a formula for the dimension of the space of smooth cubic splines on triangulations.  A third goal is to study asymptotic containments between symbolic and regular powers of ideals, with an eye toward highly structured examples where recent connections to combinatorial optimization and linear programming give good prospects for progress.  Despite their differences, the three focus areas allow for a rich exchange of techniques.  For example, homological methods connect hyperplane arrangements and splines to rigidity, while Macaulay inverse systems link splines to symbolic powers.  The projects are computational in nature and will include the development of code in symbolic software (Macaulay2) and numerical software (Bertini).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This provides a valuable dual perspective.  The project will yield a deeper understanding of central, fundamental notions in this area, several of which have been used recently to make progress on long-standing conjectures.  The results will give both quantitative and qualitative information about the nature of the solution sets of equations and are expected to lead to significant progress on a number of long-standing questions. The project is multi-faceted and will provide many opportunities for collaboration with graduate students and postdoctoral faculty that will foster their growth as researchers. Some portions of the project will be suitable for training undergraduates to do research.<br/><br/>The project will explore applications of the strength of a polynomial.  This notion of strength was recently introduced by the PI, in joint work with a collaborator, and proved to be a critical element in their proof of Stillman's conjecture. The project will use polynomial strength to answer several remaining questions, for example, about obtaining bounds for primary decomposition--independent of the number of variables--that are as sharp as possible.  Another direction is to use ideas from perfectoid geometry to construct a tight closure theory, valid in all characteristics, that has both persistence and a satisfactory theory of test elements.  Perfectoid techniques have already led to a great deal of progress in this area. The PI will also continue to work on the theory of lim Cohen-Macaulay modules, aimed at resolving a long-standing conjecture about the behavior of intersection multiplicities. Other directions include the study of: finiteness of minimal primes of local cohomology modules; filtration theorems for local cohomology that can be used to investigate strongly F-regular rings; a long-standing conjecture of Eisenbud, Green, and Harris on the behavior of Hilbert functions of ideals in polynomial rings; and the uniform comparison of ordinary and symbolic powers of ideals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the major advances of modern physics has been the revelation that groups are not sufficient to capture the symmetries of a quantum system. It is now understood that the symmetries of a quantum system can be captured on its algebra of observables (a von Neumann algebra). The mathematical tool which describes these generalized symmetries is known as a tensor category.

The questions that the Principal Investigator (PI) will examine in this project will use theoretical concepts and techniques from a wide range of mathematical areas, including number theory, group theory, and arithmetic geometry. More specifically, this project will focus on studying patterns in the number of solutions of polynomial equations over finite fields, and how these patterns can be understood through the study of related algebraic structures called Sato-Tate groups. Through this project, the PI will contribute to the broader community with two initiatives: co-organizing a research workshop that will support participants from groups that are historically underrepresented in mathematics; and conducting research with undergraduates at her home institution. <br/><br/>Solutions to the polynomial equations yield points on algebraic curves, and Sato-Tate groups play an important role in the study of L-polynomials of these curves. The generalized Sato-Tate conjecture predicts that the limiting distributions of coefficients of the normalized L-polynomial of a curve converge to the distributions of traces in the Sato-Tate group associated with the Jacobian of the curve. These distributions are well-understood for genus 1 and 2 curves, and there has been significant work in genus 3. The PI will expand on the literature by further developing the theory of Sato-Tate groups and distributions for higher genus curves and their Jacobian varieties. In genus greater than 3, certain degeneracies can occur for the Hodge groups, Hodge rings, and Mumford-Tate groups associated with the Jacobian varieties, and this can affect both the identity component and the component group of the Sato-Tate group. The PI will develop new techniques for determining Sato-Tate groups in these degenerate cases.

Both fields are used throughout mathematics and touch regularly on daily life via algorithms used in computer vision (for instance in cell phone cameras), satellite communications (error-correcting codes), and secure messaging (cryptography using elliptic curves). The project also uses higher category theory developed over the last two decades, which makes it possible to systematically deal with subtle, loosely defined objects. This extra flexibility leads to new control over the basic objects used in algebraic geometry. Even more recently, some work on condensed mathematics raises the possibility of extending this new control to closely related areas of analysis.

First, the PIs aim to find complete noncommutative categorical invariants and to find a bridge directly from the topological invariants to the categorical ones.  No known noncommutative categorical invariant suffices to reconstruct an algebraic variety. In good cases, work of the PIs and collaborators shows that the underlying space is enough for such a reconstruction. Next, to clarify the role of commutative objects inside noncommutative objects, the PIs will study the deformations and local systems of dg categories in an attempt to settle Orlov's geometricity conjecture. Third, the PIs will study the p-adic cohomology of algebraic varieties via higher categorical invariants such as topological Hochschild homology, applied to the derived category.

The theory of quaternion algebras, examples of these structures, was utilized throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and the theory of relativity, with current applications in fields such as aerospace modeling, computer graphics, robotics, and wireless communication.  In mathematics, central simple algebras and the associated Brauer group have provided a bridge for techniques to be exchanged between diverse areas of research, from number theory and arithmetic geometry, to topology and algebraic geometry.  This project aims to broaden a relatively new frontier between the splitting fields of central simple algebras and the arithmetic of elliptic curves, which are themselves important mathematical objects.  The project will also support new pedagogical tools, opportunities for public outreach and engagement, early career mentoring and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and cross-disciplinary collaboration.<br/><br/>More precisely, this project centers around three main problems: the period-index problem for the Brauer group, the problem of splitting central simple algebras by genus one curves, and explicit presentations of moduli spaces of elliptic curves.  The techniques utilized---toroidal geometry, deformation theory, and Hilbert schemes---are widely employed in algebraic geometry, but less systematically so in pure algebra.  While much recent progress in the period-index problem for the Brauer group has been through leveraging tools from algebraic geometry to control ramification splitting, this project adopts novel tools such as reciprocity sequences to achieve improved results as well as indicate long-term conjectural targets.  The problem of whether any Brauer class is split by the function field of a genus one curve, while having only gained attention in the past decade, turns out to have surprising and deep connections to other important problems in algebra, number theory, and algebraic geometry.  The project initiates a wide-ranging program exploiting connections between this problem, the classical open problem of cyclicity of central simple algebras in prime degree, the period-index problem for abelian variety torsors, the arithmetic of modular curves, and the problem of explicit constructions of moduli spaces of elliptic curves.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One way to study this random invariant is to construct a random model which contains key parameters and use the model to simulate the distributions of class groups.

This project addresses key problems about the properties and symmetries of noncommutative objects, as well as the representations of the corresponding noncommutative algebras. The latter area of representations theory investigates noncommutative algebras through all possible ways to present them in terms of matrices. Three major approaches are used: (1) Poisson geometry--geometry arising from the deformation of commutative objects to noncommutative ones, (2) cluster algebras--a combinatorial approach based on intricate internal transformations of the objects, called cluster mutations and (3) monoidal triangulated categories--general abstract algebraic structures arising from considering all representations of an algebra simultaneously.

Broadly speaking, methods for finding simultaneous solutions to multiple equations have significant implications for progress in physics, computer science, and engineering. These solutions may be expressed in terms of the intersection of certain geometric spaces. The motivating question in enumerative geometry is to predict the number of geometric figures with specified properties that satisfy a list of conditions. For example, we may seek the number of curves that contain a set of points and are tangent to a list of lines. Surprisingly, while it can be very difficult to determine the precise list of figures that satisfy the conditions, it is often possible to predict the number of such figures. The search for exact formulas for the number of solutions in enumerative geometry is an active area of research with relations to numerous fields, including geometry, combinatorics, representation theory, complexity theory in computer science, and mirror symmetry in theoretical physics. This grant will support continued work in these areas by the investigators and their graduate students. <br/> <br/>An effective approach to solving enumerative geometric problems is to understand the intersection theory of moduli spaces of geometric figures. The field of Schubert calculus loosely applies to these investigations among large classes of varieties in homogeneous spaces. Various cohomology theories can be used to extract enumerative information. For example, singular cohomology is useful for counting the number of points in intersections of geometric figures, quantum cohomology is designed for counting curves meeting other figures, and equivariant cohomology produces more general geometric invariants that depend on a group action. Cohomology theories of spaces with group actions often have naturally defined bases, and geometric invariants related to such bases tend to possess intriguing positivity properties, often related to beautiful combinatorial structures that capture the essential aspects of the geometry. The investigators will study these phenomena in the context of several geometric spaces, including flag varieties and their cotangent bundles, bow varieties, and Hessenberg varieties. Techniques include intersection theory, equivariant localization, symmetric functions, Hecke algebra actions, and geometric representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In commutative algebra, one studies formal systems in which the rules for manipulating equations are the same as in high school algebra but done in more general settings. The field is related to many other areas of pure mathematics, such as number theory, the study of properties of the integers, and algebraic geometry, the study of geometric properties of solutions to systems of polynomial equations. Homological algebra is a branch of algebra related to the field of algebraic topology and is the study of topological spaces, that is, ""shapes."" A central object of study in homological algebra is that of a complex of modules, which can be thought of an abstraction of the notion of a topological space. This project aims to settle various open conjectures, including one on the possible values of Euler characteristics of certain types of complexes. Here, the Euler characteristic of a complex is a generalization of the integer invariant for polyhedra. The grant will also support graduate students working on affiliated topics.<br/><br/>The project involves four main topics: (1) lengths of modules of finite projective dimension and Dutta multiplicities of ""tiny complexes,"" (2) Ulrich modules and lim Ulrich sequences of modules, (3) cones of Betti tables and cohomology tables, (4) the nc-Hodge-conjecture for matrix factorizations. The central goal of (1) is to prove the conjecture that a module of finite projective dimension over a local ring must have length at least as large as the multiplicity of the module. This conjecture admits a generalization involving Euler and Dutta multiplicities of ""tiny complexes"". Part (2) concerns a primary tool used in tackling these conjectures: Ulrich modules, which are maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules whose multiplicities equal their minimal numbers of generates, and lim Ulrich sequences of modules?sequences of modules that asymptotically approximate the former. The central goal is to construct such things for a larger class of rings than previously known. Part (3) concerns the cones of Betti tables of modules over local rings and cones of cohomology tables of coherent sheaves on projective varieties. Ulrich sheaves and lim Ulrich sequences of sheaves?sheaf theoretic analogues of the module versions of these notions?play an essential role here. The central aim of Part (4) is to prove the non-commutative analogue of the classical Hodge conjecture for the category of matrix factorizations of a hypersurface with an isolated singularity.

It also explores the fruitful connections between decorated character varieties, quantum groups, and Legendrian knots, finding new results in all directions. In more detail, the project will touch on four topics. (1) It will provide a rigid cluster model realizing quantum groups, obtaining new interpretations of many properties of quantum groups from the perspective of cluster algebras.

Rather than study these phenomena in the traditional contexts of number fields or algebraic curves, the PI sets the Langlands program in the realm of 3-dimensional topology - a rich and active area of research in its own right. In this setting, these deep ideas become much more accessible than was previously possible. For example, one component of the project is about observing Langlands phenomena by comparing different ways to count knots in a given 3-dimensional space. Such methods open up the Langlands program to a wider mathematical world and provide pathways to involve a new generation of students in this fundamental research area.

Representation Theory emerges from people?s attempt to solve algebraic equations. The subject matured in the 20th century and is still fast developing. It studies the symmetries of objects and has applications to almost all branches of mathematics, physics, cosmology and material science. This project will explore some major conjectures in these two areas. Additionally, this award will support graduate students in the PI's institution. <br/><br/>In the 1960s Langlands formulated a series of profound conjectures relating representation theory and number theory, and these conjectures have become guiding principles for number theorists and representation theorists since then. In the 1990s, Gross and Prasad formulated several conjectures on representation theory of the orthogonal groups, guided by the philosophy of Langlands. Together with Gan, they extended these conjectures to include all classical groups. These conjectures and their refinement and arithmetic counterparts stand at the crossroads of number theory, representation theory, and arithmetic geometry. The goal of the project is to study these conjectures. In more detail,  we study the following two problems (1) the local Gan--Gross--Prasad conjecture for real orthogonal groups; (2) the archimedean counterpart of the arithmetic fundamental lemma arising from an arithmetic version of the Gan--Gross?Prasad conjecture. For the first problem we apply the method of theta correspondences, and a relative version of Shahidi?s local coefficients which is our main point of innovation. This method also gives an inductive construction of L-packets for orthogonal groups, which are themselves important objects of study in the conjectures of Langlands. For the second problem, we make use of an inductive structure of the relevant orbital integrals and spherical characters.

The conference will be an opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to interact with each other and with mathematicians from a wide range of mathematical disciplines. This broad perspective from some of the leading experts will be invaluable to early career researchers.<br/><br/>Integrable systems were originally studied in physics in order to describe the integrals of motion arising in classical mechanics. The ideas and methods of integrable systems have since had a wide influence in many areas of mathematics.  For example, the Schottky problem, a classical problem in the theory of Riemann surfaces, is deeply connected to the study of various integrable hierarchies, the Korteweg-De Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The Korteweg-De Vries equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation, is notable for having soliton solutions, which are a type of nonlinear wave. More recently, the Korteweg-De Vries equation has appeared in the Witten conjectures on the enumerative geometry of the moduli space of compact Riemann surfaces of genus g. These conjectures were solved by Kontsevich, Okounkov-Pandharipande, and Mirzakhani, and led to surprising connections with dynamical systems, hyperbolic geometry, and Gromov-Witten theory. Other aspects of integrable systems connect to symmetry groups and to more general algebraic structures such as quantum groups, loop groups, and Cherednik algebras. In terms of the original physical motivation, integrable systems control the behavior of various supersymmetric quantum field theories and random matrices. The goal of the conference is to bring together these many different strands of mathematics and mathematical physics. <br/><br/>The conference website can be found at https://math.columbia.edu/~agmps22/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Going back to its founders, Frobenius, Schur, Burnside, and Brauer, who first developed the subject over a century ago, the standard approach is to decompose a linear space with its symmetry into a sum of ""simple ones,"" and then classify the simple ones into coherent and (relatively) comprehensible lists and families. The ""Atlas of Finite Groups: Maximal Subgroups and Ordinary Characters for Simple Groups"" is a classical and fundamental example of this strategy in action.  In this project, the PI turns to the study of symmetries which do not subject themselves to such nice decompositions as in the classical case, which live in the world of ""wild"" representation theories. Such theories are ubiquitous in mathematics. They arise in algebra, topology, math physics, combinatorics, and, of course, representation theory itself. The PI will employ the new and rapidly developing subject of tensor triangular geometry, which combines topological, homological, and categorical techniques, to induce some structure in this wild representation territory, thus advancing our general understanding of this complicated world of symmetries. This project will provide research and training opportnities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, this projects will advance knowledge in several new directions within the realm of tensor triangular geometry. It builds on PI's expertise in support theories in modular settings and branches out to different areas where the representation theories to be studied differ from the setting of finite groups in one or more significant aspects. The most interesting is when the theory is monoidal but not symmetric, such as for small quantum groups and their Borel subalgebras. Besides quantum groups, the PI will study and develop further the tensor triangular picture for complex Lie superalgebras, Nichols algebras of diagonal type, Schur algebras, Frobenius kernels, and finite supergroup schemes. The PI will also study local properties of some representation categories associated to Gorenstein algebras and the cohomology of finite dimensional Hopf and Nichols algebras.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broadly speaking, methods for finding simultaneous solutions to multiple equations have significant implications for progress in physics, computer science, and engineering. These solutions may be expressed in terms of the intersection of certain geometric spaces. The motivating question in enumerative geometry is to predict the number of geometric figures with specified properties that satisfy a list of conditions. For example, we may seek the number of curves that contain a set of points and are tangent to a list of lines. Surprisingly, while it can be very difficult to determine the precise list of figures that satisfy the conditions, it is often possible to predict the number of such figures. The search for exact formulas for the number of solutions in enumerative geometry is an active area of research with relations to numerous fields, including geometry, combinatorics, representation theory, complexity theory in computer science, and mirror symmetry in theoretical physics. This grant will support continued work in these areas by the investigators and their graduate students. <br/> <br/>An effective approach to solving enumerative geometric problems is to understand the intersection theory of moduli spaces of geometric figures. The field of Schubert calculus loosely applies to these investigations among large classes of varieties in homogeneous spaces. Various cohomology theories can be used to extract enumerative information. For example, singular cohomology is useful for counting the number of points in intersections of geometric figures, quantum cohomology is designed for counting curves meeting other figures, and equivariant cohomology produces more general geometric invariants that depend on a group action. Cohomology theories of spaces with group actions often have naturally defined bases, and geometric invariants related to such bases tend to possess intriguing positivity properties, often related to beautiful combinatorial structures that capture the essential aspects of the geometry. The investigators will study these phenomena in the context of several geometric spaces, including flag varieties and their cotangent bundles, bow varieties, and Hessenberg varieties. Techniques include intersection theory, equivariant localization, symmetric functions, Hecke algebra actions, and geometric representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such objects, called varieties, play a fundamental role throughout mathematics as well as in applications in science and engineering. Motivated by a question that originates with mathematician Henri Poincaré in 1891, the investigators will study the relationship between local properties of a variety and global features of tangents at points of the variety, as these points vary. They will also work on implicitization, a classical question in pure mathematics that is of much interest to scientists in geometric modelling and computer aided design. Given any geometric object, such as a curve or surface, the goal is to find the system of polynomial equations that has the geometric object as a solution set; knowing these 'implicit' equations provides insight into the geometric object. The PIs will involve graduate students and postdoctoral visitors in the project, and they will facilitate scientific exchange by organizing international programs, conferences, and national online seminars.<br/><br/>The investigators will work on projects pertaining to algebraic vector fields, the implicitization problem for Rees rings, equisingularity theory, and residual intersections. The PIs will use tools from commutative algebra to investigate how the types of singularities and the global invariants of a variety are reflected in properties of the vector fields that are tangent to the variety. In particular, they wish to establish a correspondence between the types and constellation of the singularities of a projective plane curve on the one hand and the graded Betti numbers of the module of derivations of its homogeneous coordinate ring on the other. Determining the implicit equations defining the graph and image of a rational map between projective spaces is a classical problem in elimination theory. The PIs will concentrate on the case of Cremona maps, where the implicit equations of the graph also provide a parametrization of the inverse map. For dominant rational maps they will investigate the relationship between the projective degrees of the rational map and the number and bidegrees of the equations defining the graph. In equisingularity theory, one seeks fiberwise multiplicity-based criteria for a family of analytic spaces to be Whitney equisingular and hence topologically trivial. The PIs plan to devise such a criterion for analytic spaces with arbitrary singularities by using a new notion of multiplicity inspired by intersection theory.

Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, which are solution sets for systems of polynomial equations.

Since the tangent line at the origin (0,0) is not defined for the algebraic variety defined by xy=0, we say that this variety has a singularity at the origin (0,0). The first goal of the present project is to further develop the theory of singularities of algebraic varieties and more general objects. The second goal is to build the tools and techniques necessary for this research program, which would have applications to other fundamental open questions in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.<br/><br/>The research will investigate singularities of algebraic varieties over arbitrary fields, or more generally of arbitrary Noetherian rings and schemes.

Number theorists are interested in classifying number fields whose symmetry groups (called Galois groups) have the commutative property, and in producing formulas to generate these special number fields.  Modern methods have demonstrated the connection between number fields and certain associated functions called L-functions, whose values encode many of the most important conjectures in number theory.  The principal investigator, Dr. Samit Dasgupta, has made important progress on these topics in recent work, and the current proposal aims to push further in this direction. Dr. Dasgupta also plans to continue and expand his activities to disseminate mathematics to students and academics of all age groups and career stages. Dr. Dasgupta gives expository lectures for undergraduates in various math clubs, teaches minicourses for graduate students, is involved in graduate and postdoctoral advising, is involved in local conference organizing, and is on the editorial board of several journals. All these activities connect to Dr. Dasgupta?s goal to promote mathematics holistically in society, with a particular view toward supporting various groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. <br/><br/>More technically, Dr. Dasgupta?s work is motivated by two central problems in modern algebraic number theory: the expression of special values of classical and p-adic L-functions as regulators of algebraic objects, and the generation of abelian extensions of number fields through analytic means intrinsic to the ground field, as codified in Hilbert's 12th problem.  Dr. Dasgupta?s prior work has made significant progress on the Brumer-Stark Conjecture, the Gross-Stark Conjecture, and the explicit analytic construction of class fields of totally real fields.  Dr. Dasgupta will continue his explorations in this direction with five specific questions on the connections between Stark units, L-functions,  modular forms, and Galois representations.  All these projects will advance our knowledge in a significant way on the relationship between special values of L-functions and associated algebraic objects. Firstly, he will complete the proof of the Brumer-Stark conjecture by handling the localization at p=2. Next, he will extend his work with Kakde to prove the Equivariant Tamagawa Number Conjecture for the minus part of CM abelian extensions of totally real fields, including at the prime 2.  In joint work with Spiess, Dr. Dasgupta will prove their joint conjecture on the characteristic polynomial of Gross's regulator matrix.  Separately, he will work with Darmon and Charollois on expanding the strategy of Darmon, Vonk, and Pozzi for real quadratic fields to give a purely p-adic analytic proof of Dr. Dasgupta's explicit analytic formula for Brumer-Stark units over arbitrary totally real fields.

In recent years, many important classical questions have seen spectacular advances based on new techniques; conversely, methods developed in analytic number theory have led to the solution of striking problems in other fields. The main goal of this research project is to make progress on the distributional properties of primes and other related arithmetic objects, by developing further the classical analytic tools and the more modern additive combinatorial tools, and by understanding how to effectively combine these two different tools together. It is hoped that the need for stronger results to cater for applications in analytic number theory will drive the development of additive combinatorics, and vice versa.

These works will involve developing both analytic tools and combinatorial tools. On the analytic side, the PI will continue to investigate the theory of Gowers norms for multiplicative functions and for the von-Mangoldt function, which are higher-order extensions to classical exponential sum estimates involving these functions. On the combinatorial side, the PI expects to develop tools from additive combinatorics for locating arithmetic structures within dense sets of integers and discover new mechanisms for using them to exhibit such structures in the primes. The additive combinatorial ideas behind these tools, such as pseudorandomness and Gowers uniformity norms, have a strong link with topics in theoretical computer science such as extractors and expanders, property testing, and error-correcting codes.

This symbiotic relationship has played a significant role in these disciplines for centuries.  For instance, Newton's discovery of gravity necessitated his development of calculus.  While the interactions between mathematics and physics have evolved over time, some of the deepest aspects of these fields are still intertwined.  In particular, the discovery of quantum physics in the twentieth century led mathematicians to study difficult problems in analysis, topology, and algebra.  In turn, solutions to these questions have then been reinterpreted by physicists, and have led to new physics questions.   Understanding how gravity fits into our quantum mechanical universe remains one of the most important open questions in physics and mathematics.  Recent advances in these areas will be presented at this conference.  A primary goal of the meeting is to introduce a young generation of researchers, including those from typically underrepresented groups, to these fundamental mathematical and physical problems. For more information see the conference website: http://scgp.stonybrook.edu/archives/34420<br/><br/>The conference will highlight progress in the areas of vertex operator algebras, conformal field theory,  categorification, low dimensional topology and representation theory of affine Lie algebras, loop groups, and quantum groups.  String theory gave rise to the mathematical theory of vertex operator algebras, which led to the construction of representations of affine Lie algebras and the Moonshine module of the Monster group.  These mathematical constructions have in turn led to ideas about 3-dimensional quantum gravity.  In another direction, the discovery of the Jones polynomial led to a physical construction of 3-dimensional TQFTs, which in turn led to many mathematical discoveries in quantum groups and low dimensional topology.  Crane and Frenkel introduced the categorification program with the goal of upgrading 3-dimensional TQFTs coming from representation theory of quantum groups to 4-dimensional TQFTs.  They suggested that one should try to construct categorical quantum group actions to achieve this aim.  These ideas led to the discovery of Khovanov homology.  Other link homologies have been constructed from representation-theoretic, algebraic-geometric, combinatorial, and physical structures.  Consequently, categorification has become a truly interdisciplinary subject.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One feature of low dimensions is the existence of deep structures known as TQFTs (Topological Quantum Field Theories), many originating in quantum physics and having applications to condensed matter, statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The Prinicipal Investigator will be studying such topological theories of more general type, where the theory is known on topological objects without boundary (closed objects) and extended canonically to objects with boundary. These constructions proved fruitful for explicit combinatorial construction of link homology theories, where topological objects are foam-like two-dimensional structures embedded in 3-space. The author has recently shown that a semi-linear version of this construction in dimension one extends so-called finite state automata and regular languages, which is a classical subject in computer science. This opens possibility of many generalizations, including exploring connections between more general languages and topological theories and possible relations between two-dimensional theories and cellular automata. Further studies of topological theories and related topics of foams and link homology should lead to fruitful discoveries in low-dimensional topology and related fields.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project has three major goals. The first major goal is to further develop the theory of foams, their evaluations and applications in link homology and categorification. Foams are two-dimensional CW-complexes with generic singularities. They have proved instrumental in combinatorial approaches to GL(N) link homology theories and boast tantalizing connections to instanton Floer homology for orbifolds. The PI will further develop topological theories related to foams, with an eye towards technically difficult problems, such as computation of Kronheimer-Mrowka homology of embedded trivalent graphs and finding combinatorial counterpart of that homology. The second goal is to find approaches to several link homology theories, including Cautis, Webster and Qi-Sussan homologies, to establish their functoriality and extend to tangles and tangle cobordisms. A number of important link homology theories, including triply-graded HOMFLYPT homology, Webster, Cautis, and Qi-Sussan homology, are missing a functorial extension to tangle cobordisms and, in most cases, a related extensions to tangles. The PI will develop new approaches to these homology theories to redefine them, repair functoriality where necessary, and extend them to link cobordisms. The third goal is to understand universal theories in low dimensions. The PI will continue studying universal construction of topological theories, motivated by recent successes such as the interpretation of finite state automata and regular languages via one-dimensional topological theories with defects and taking values in the Boolean semiring B, where a regular language and a circular regular language give rise to a rigid symmetric monoidal B-linear category.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since its founding in 1997, the primary activity of the Southwest Center is the Arizona Winter School (AWS), an annual meeting which has become a prominent national event and provides high-level training and research experience for graduate students in arithmetic geometry and related areas. The AWS is organized around a different central topic each year and features a set of courses and accompanying research projects carefully designed and delivered by leading and emerging experts. The result is a unique fusion of traditional mathematics conference and intensive research workshop: the speakers organize courses of four or five lectures and propose research projects for graduate students to work on during the meeting. Nightly working sessions on these projects and on separate problem sets are run by the speakers and postdoctoral fellows. On the last day, students present their findings to the participants of the meeting. The result is a particularly intense and focused five days of mathematical activity for everyone involved. This cycle the Southwest Center will expand its programming to include Preliminary Arizona Winter School (PAWS).  This virtual program aimed at advanced undergraduates and junior graduate students from underrepresented groups will feature two six-week-long courses during the fall semester organized around the same topic as the AWS. Participants will engage in weekly problem sessions run by advanced graduate students and participate in community building and mentorship activities. At both AWS and PAWS, connections among peers are formed, and mentoring relationships between students and senior researchers are developed. Subsequent collaborations between participants at all levels are the norm. Students make concrete strides toward becoming research mathematicians, post-doctoral assistants gain valuable mentoring experience in their academic careers, and faculty develop new interests and see new connections that lead to important published results. The Southwest Center website shares reusable content from both AWS and PAWS, including lecture notes, project descriptions, and audio and video of lectures. Through these thorough records, the efforts of the Southwest Center participants are made freely available to all. More information about the upcoming and past Arizona Winter School programs can be found at the Southwest Center's website: http://swc.math.arizona.edu/<br/><br/>In 2022-2023, PAWS and AWS will be on ""Unlikely Intersections."" This topic concerns the expected finiteness of certain rare arithmetically or geometrically interesting intersections. For example, given a curve and a countable collection of ""special"" points in its ambient space, one expects the intersection of the curve with this set of points to be finite unless the curve is also ""special."" There has been substantial recent progress on the main conjectures and complementary problems of this field, especially on the André-Oort/Lang-Manin-Mumford/Zilber-Pink conjectures and analogues from arithmetic dynamics. This work draws together not just classical tools from algebraic and arithmetic geometry, but also tools from logic, heights, analytic number theory, dynamics, and p-adic geometry. The program will introduce students to the central problems, applications, and unique tools of this flourishing field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mathematics, those symmetries provide a common ground for many different theories such as Geometry, Number Theory, Mathematical Physics, Algebra, and Analysis, especially through functions known as Automorphic Forms.  Hence, the modern theory of automorphic forms provides the organizing principle for further research in these areas. This project will establish basic structures and yield substantial contributions to the modern theory of automorphic forms, and the related Langlands program. For broader impacts, the PI will continue to train graduate students and postdocs, give lectures on his research to a broader community, including public lectures, primary lectures and research talks in various settings, and organize research programs and zoom-seminars for the international mathematics community. <br/><br/>The PI will continue his research on the discrete spectrum of square-integrable automorphic forms, L-functions, and the Langlands functoriality conjectures. The basic problems that the PI will investigate are refined structures of the discrete spectrum of automorphic forms on classical groups, analytic and arithmetic properties of automorphic L-functions, and explicit Langlands functorial transfers for square-integrable automorphic forms via automorphic integral transforms, in particular, using twisted automorphic descents. On the one hand, the PI intends to study refined structure based on the existence of endoscopy. On the other hand, the PI intends to construct explicit modules for the cuspidal automorphic forms via integral transform with automorphic kernel functions, so that the endoscopic transfers can be realized via automorphic integral transforms. Meanwhile, the PI will also develop the local theory, relating basic problems in harmonic analysis of groups over a local field to the arithmetic data that are given by the local Langlands conjecture.

Harmonic analysis involves breaking up a mathematical object such as a function into pieces that are easier to understand.  The beauty of this area is that the pieces are oftentimes simple, yet represent the whole with accuracy.  Number theory involves deceptively simple statements about the integers, easy to test, yet often difficult to prove.  Though seemingly disparate, analysis and number theory share many interactions. For instance, one can use intricate analysis of complex functions to answer fundamental questions about prime numbers.  This project explores a variety of problems at the interface of these two areas.  In particular, the PI will consider discrete variants of operators in analysis, which enjoy applications in fields such as medical imaging and cosmology.  To analyze these operators, continuous techniques often fail, and one has to develop number theoretic techniques adapted to the underlying geometry of the analytic problem. The PI seeks to provide new bounds, new techniques, sharper analysis and broader connections.  The PI also plans to bring Fourier analysis, a fundamental decomposition of the time-frequency domain, such as that used to understand waves, into the emerging field of arithmetic statistics.  Here she seeks to provide sharp counts of a wide variety of objects of arithmetic interest, such as elliptic curves used in cryptography.  As a broader impact, the PI will spark new mathematical conversations between analysts and number theorists and also improve the educational and scientific climate for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project addresses several fundamental questions at the interface of analysis and number theory.  Firstly, the PI pursues bounds for discrete variants of continuous operators in harmonic analysis that involve integration over a curved subvariety.  These bounds provide quantitative distributional facts about the underlying Diophantine equations that define these varieties, which makes them different from their continuous counterparts.  In particular, since continuous techniques usually do not carry over in this setting, the PI will develop refined number theoretic techniques to bound several operators, including multilinear spherical variants, variants defined over the primes, and higher codimensional analogues.  In particular, the higher codimensional study should open new avenues of problems as very little is known in this setting. Solving these problems has connections to discrete geometry, lattice point counts of surfaces, and Falconer's distance conjecture.  In another series of problems, the PI will pursue ""sparse bounds"" for both continuous and discrete operators.  Sparse bounds are a refinement of Lebesgue space bounds that allow one to deduce weighted estimates.  Finally, the PI plans to pursue a far reaching program in arithmetic statistics.  This is an area greatly developed on the algebraic side recently. The PI plans to inject Fourier analytic techniques to obtain precise lattice point counts that are adaptable to take advantage of the power of the algebraic techniques and push those bounds even further.  In particular, the PI hopes to obtain counts on certain objects such as elliptic curves, with an eye to not only developing techniques, but also fostering interactions between number theorists and analysts in new ways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work in this project will advance the paradigmatic Langlands program, which drives a lot of the current research in modern number theory. This has broad implications which might also be useful to applications of number theory where reciprocity laws can  provide  a powerful computational tool. The project provides training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>One of the broad themes of algebraic number theory is to prove reciprocity laws which give a way to understanding the splitting behavior of primes in number fields, or L-functions of varieties, in terms of more computable and apparently unrelated objects like automorphic forms. Such reciprocity laws go back to Gauss and his Law of Quadratic Reciprocity,  and have a continuing life in current mathematics in the guise of the Langlands program. The methods of this proposal will prove novel cases of such reciprocity laws and establish new relations between the much studied triad of motives, Galois representations and automorphic forms.

For example, certain instances of the Langlands correspondence connect the prime numbers dividing integer values of a polynomial to vibrational frequencies of a very symmetric surface (like the fundamental tones of a musical instrument). For applications to number theory, it is useful to study these very symmetric surfaces and related higher dimensional shapes not only with classical geometry but also with an alternative theory of geometry built up from an unusual notion of size and distance that detects divisibility by a fixed prime number. This is called p-adic geometry. The basic shapes in p-adic geometry look more like fractals such as the Cantor set than like the shapes we encounter in our day to day lives in the physical world, but it is still fruitful to try to reinterpret geometric concepts like curvature so that they can be used also in the p-adic world. The recent theory of perfectoid spaces provides a perspective on p-adic geometry that is very well suited to studying the p-adic shapes that are most important in the Langlands correspondence. This project aims to carry over ideas from calculus to the study of perfectoid spaces in order to uncover new structural properties of the Langlands correspondence that will ultimately help us understand basic questions about the integers and prime numbers.<br/><br/>More precisely, the theory of diamonds (which are quotients of perfectoid spaces by very nice equivalence relations) furnishes a very broad foundation for p-adic geometry that includes most classical and modern objects of interest but is in many ways more similar to the theory of topological manifolds than it is to the theory of complex analytic spaces. The goal of this work is to introduce a good notion of analytic structures on diamonds and then apply this theory to study representation theoretic aspects of p-adic automorphic forms as they arise in the Langlands correspondence. A special emphasis is thus put on understanding the analytic structure on the p-adic spaces which are analogs of the universal covers of complex locally symmetric spaces that appear in the complex geometry of the Langlands correspondence. In the complex setting the analytic structure can be transported directly between the base and the universal cover because the fibers are discrete, but in the p-adic setting this is obstructed by is a non-trivial interaction between the profinite topology of the fibers and the rigid analytic topology of the base. A crucial new insight in this project is that in many cases this interaction can be understood locally by embedding the total space inside of a rigid analytic variety as a locally closed subdiamond. This gives rise in some cases to a new construction of Banach-Colmez tangent spaces via a naive notion of profinite paths, and suggests a natural criterion for perfectoidness, with potential applications to cohomological vanishing. The PI will analyze concrete examples in order to elucidate the general shape of this analytic theory while also connecting some very recent and previously disjoint ideas in the theory of p-adic automorphic forms, the p-adic geometry of Shimura varieties, and the p-adic Langlands correspondence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inspired by the study of spaces with a metric satisfying certain Einstein field equations, the main aim of the proposal is to provide a new framework to understand varieties which are positively curved, in both global and local settings.

The language we have in mind is the language of polynomial equations, the same polynomial equations one first encounters in an Algebra class in high school.  Despite its basic nature this language possesses enormous complexity and descriptive power which were not always well-understood by mathematicians.   About fifty years ago it was proved that no computer program can determine whether a certain kind of statement in this language is true even when the objects being described are sets of natural numbers, quite familiar to everyone since childhood.  In other words, no computer program can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables has a solution in integer numbers. On the other hand, if one asks the same question about rational numbers, one is confronted with one of the many basic questions concerning polynomial equations to which the answer is unknown.  Understanding and trying to tackle this question and other related ones requires interaction of and input from several fields of Mathematics such as Logic, Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and Topology.  At the same time, the questions and methods developed for the study of the language of polynomial equations lead to new results and research directions in the areas of Mathematics mentioned above. This project involves graduate student training and it will develop an online collaboration platform.<br/> <br/> <br/>This project considers several problems in definability and computability over arithmetically significant fields, that is fields of importance to Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Model Theory, Computability Theory and Valuation Theory.

Another set of related problems concerns computability and definability over function fields and rings of all characteristics.  Some of the main outstanding questions in the area concern extensions of Hilbert?s Tenth Problem to the field of rational numbers and rings of algebraic integers, decidability of the first-order theory of the largest abelian extension of rational numbers, definability of valuation rings in function fields over global and local fields, algebraically closed fields, and other classes of arithmetically significant base fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI will apply this principle to study the geometry of spaces that are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics, namely moduli spaces of vector bundles. Using a novel technique called Bridgeland stability, the PI will investigate fundamental geometric properties of these spaces. The results will have a wide range of applications in algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, topology, and mathematical physics. The PI is also dedicated to educating the next generation of mathematicians and building a strong workforce in STEM in the US. Towards this goal, the PI actively supervises numerous PhD students and postdocs, as well as high school students and undergraduate students in related research. The grant will provide partial support to the graduate students. <br/><br/>The moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces play a fundamental role in mathematics and physics. They carry essential information about linear series and Chow groups and are key players in Donaldson?s theory of four manifolds, combinatorics, representation theory and mathematical physics. In the last decade, Bridgeland stability has revolutionized our understanding of moduli spaces of sheaves. Using this novel technique, the PI will advance understanding of moduli spaces of sheaves. Specifically, the PI will compute the cohomology of the general stable sheaf on a surface using Bridgeland stability and wall-crossing.  In cases where the generic cohomology is already understood, such as minimal rational surfaces and K3 surfaces, the PI will initiate a systematic study of the cohomology jumping loci and compute the cohomology of the tensor product of two general stable sheaves. In addition, the PI aims to prove a conjecture due to the PI and Woolf that states that the Betti numbers of the moduli spaces of sheaves stabilize as the discriminant tends to infinity and the stable Betti numbers are independent of the rank and polarization. Finally, the PI will also study the stability of normal bundles of curves on algebraic varieties with a view towards applications to hyperbolicity, Lang conjectures and separable rational connectedness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Noncommutative algebra historically arose in the algebraic study of symmetry, in linear algebra, and perhaps most profoundly in quantum mechanics. Since the advent of algebraic geometry, commutative algebra has been revolutionized by geometric ideas. In a similar way, the development of noncommutative geometry over the past several decades has stimulated many new ideas and perspectives in noncommutative algebra, but to date it has posed more challenges than it has solved. For instance, many noncommutative algebras are expected to be well-behaved due to the geometric nature of their construction, but we lack the algebraic tools to prove that this is the case. Furthermore, noncommutative geometry largely remains a collection of loosely related frameworks that are not directly compatible with one another, which can make the field especially difficult for newcomers. This project will directly address these fundamental problems by creating new techniques to deduce good algebraic properties for geometrically constructed noncommutative algebras and providing new tools to represent geometric structures corresponding to noncommutative algebras. The project will involve research and training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The first part of this project focuses on homological problems in noncommutative algebraic geometry. The PI and collaborators will use methods of Koszul duality and the representations of finite-dimensional algebras to attack a longstanding conjecture that Artin-Schelter (AS) regular algebras are domains. Related techniques will be used to understand when generalized AS regular algebras that are not necessarily connected, such as graded Calabi-Yau algebras, are prime rings. The second part of this project is focused on spectral problems in noncommutative geometry. The PI will use a variety of approaches to understand noncommutative discrete spaces and utilize them to construct noncommutative spectrum functors for both rings and C*-algebras. Topics to be investigated include structure sheaves for noncommutative spaces, methods to characterize dual coalgebras, discretization of C*-algebras, and a projective representation theory for rings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of these, one of the most striking is the invention of modern curve-counting invariants and the understanding that their computation can be understood in terms of solutions of certain differential equations related to the geometry of so-called mirror spaces. The ideas for doing this originated in physics, through the fields of string theory and mirror symmetry, but are now a major part of modern algebraic geometry. Costello introduced in 2005 a categorical generalization of curve-counting invariants, defined for all genera, called categorical enumerative invariants (CEIs). Despite considerable interest, little is known about them, primarily due to a range of difficulties that arise when trying to compute them. The first calculation of CEIs, for the universal family of elliptic curves, was achieved by the PI in 2017, in joint work with Junwu Tu. This computation led to work by Costello, Tu, and the PI which laid out a new foundation for the definition of CEIs, in a way that is explicitly computable. In addition, the PI will direct undergraduate research projects and train graduate students. <br/><br/>A crucial ingredient in the above computations is a choice of a splitting of the non-commutative Hodge filtration. The general theory of CEIs does not specify which particular splitting to use, but in order to obtain geometrically meaningful invariants special choices must be made. In previous work the choices were guided, via mirror symmetry, by the symplectic geometry of the A-model. However, many of the choices appear ad hoc, and a general theory of splittings of the non-commutative Hodge filtration is largely missing. In this project the PI will expand our understanding of the role played by the spltting of the Hodge filtration in the definition of the categorical invariants. The main application will be to compute CEIs not only for geometric spaces, but also replace the actual spaces with algebraic structures called categories of matrix factorizations. This is of independent interest in itself: the invariants of these categories should be closely related to the Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariants, but such a relationship is not explicitly known.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symmetry groups arise frequently in physics (e.g. rotations of a sphere), chemistry (e.g. crystallography), and other scientific fields. Data related to the objects possessing symmetry can often be encoded in an object called a representation. Mathematicians study the relationships between representations, and how bigger representations can be built from simple, indivisible ones, much as a molecule is built from indivisible atoms. Many properties of these simple representations, such as their dimensions, are unknown and the topic of intense research. The representations and their structure can be packaged in a collection called a category. An extremely fruitful tool of the last half century has been to identify categories in representation theory with categories from algebraic geometry, allowing the use of powerful geometric tools. But geometry also has its limits, especially when it comes to matters of explicit computation. In past work, the PI has found new and explicit descriptions of categories from representation theory and geometry, using diagrammatic methods. In diagrammatics, a very large matrix or a structure from geometry could be encoded as a picture and manipulated graphically. These descriptions make once-difficult categories accessible computer algebra systems. Computer calculations performed by the PI's collaborator Williamson have led to the first breakthroughs in computing dimensions of simple representations in decades. The PI will continue to develop diagrammatic methods to study representation theory and geometry, providing explicit constructions of new categories, structures, and tools which are beyond the current scope of other approaches. This project provides research training opportunities for students.<br/><br/>More concretely, this proposal will support four related projects. The first is to provide general tools for studying generically semisimple monoidal categories diagrammatically using a cellular basis called the branching basis, akin to several bases previously constructed by the PI and collaborators. These tools will then be applied to the categories of singular Soergel bimodules,  representations of symplectic groups, and representations of McKay groups. The second project is to introduce K-theoretic Soergel bimodules and to study their relationship to the quantum geometric Satake equivalence. The third is to produce a generalization of Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras, which has the potential to categorify other Nichols algebras.

In many situations, these counting problems can be understood in terms of families of random matrices.  A major idea is to study error-correcting codes from an algebraic perspective, focusing on the interplay between codes, polynomials over finite fields, and the algebraic varieties that they define.

The PI will consider problems about families of random lattices, focusing on lattices with algebraic structure.  An important tool here comes from the theory of zeta functions of groups and rings.  In certain cases this additional algebraic structure will lead to very different behavior.  Reed-Muller codes are multivariable analogues of Reed-Solomon codes and are some of the most fundamental examples in coding theory.

In this project, the PI aims to describe as explicitly as possible the Betti numbers of some well-known systems of polynomial equations by making use of the inherent symmetries of the underlying varieties. The study will rely on computer algorithms previously developed by the PI for this specific purpose.

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole or rational number solutions of some equation of interest.  (For example, the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle are related by the Pythagorean theorem. While it is straightforward to find all right triangles whose side lengths are rational numbers, it perhaps surprisingly remains an unsolved problem to determine which whole numbers can be the area of a right triangle with rational sides.) The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. One approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, p-adic methods have begun to be unified with Langlands's ideas into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, primarily of a geometric nature, and to use them to establish new instances of Langlands's conjectures.

The research focuses on the study of discrete invariants of Jacobians in positive characteristics and of their behavior as the prime varies.

The minimal representations topics discussed at the conference have played a central and unifying role in mathematics for over fifty years, where they find applications to quantum mechanics and communication theory, and within mathematics to number theory.  Theta correspondences use minimal representations to connect disparate mathematical objects.  Work on theta correspondences has accelerated recently, with the full proof of Howe's Duality Conjecture published just a few years ago. The award will allow U.S. scholars to continue working on minimal representations and theta correspondences on the global stage, with an international community of researchers, as well as introduce a new generation of mathematicians to the material.<br/><br/>Minimal representations have applications to automorphic forms, harmonic analysis, for example, the Fourier transforms on basic affine spaces, and mathematical physics, for example, scattering amplitudes in string theory.  They originate in the Weil representation of the metaplectic group, where they are connected to Schrödinger's formulation of quantum mechanics via wave functions.  Within mathematics, the most profound applications of minimal representations are through theta correspondences -- a generalization of Howe's duality correspondence.  Newer ""exceptional"" theta correspondences have been vital in the Langlands program and arithmetic.  This conference is a timely event, bringing participants up-to-date on recent breakthroughs on minimal representations and theta correspondences.  The ESI workshop will bring together the top scholars from around the world to showcase the latest progress in this field of mathematics and the grant will allow U.S. scholars to travel to Austria and attend this important event.

Methods from geometry have been very successful in solving problems in representation theory. One of the main goals of the project is to study questions in representation theory using geometric methods. In this project the PI will develop and use geometric tools to attack several longstanding problems on: Higgs bundles and representations of the fundamental group, representations of Lie groups and symmetric varieties, and the Langlands program. The education component of the project will create a vertically integrated learning environment for representation theory, number theory, and algebraic geometry at the University of Minnesota, from which students and researchers at all levels will benefit.

Representation theory, another equally influential branch of mathematics, quantifies symmetries of geometric objects (such as a square or a hydrogen atom), and has important uses in physics.  Though seemingly unrelated, these two areas are intimately linked by the Langlands Program, a vast set of conjectures that allows for the transfer of results and theorems between number theory and representation theory.  It is of paramount importance to understand these conjectures, since  tools from one discipline can be imported to tackle previously intractable problems in another (the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem being a prime example).  This has pushed the Langlands Program to the forefront of current research.  The present project seeks to establish instances of a local version of the Langlands Program with mod p coefficients, so that information from representation theory can be transferred into arithmetic data.<br/><br/>The setting of the current project lies within the representation theory of p-adic reductive groups (such as GL_2(Q_p)) on mod p vector spaces.  Such representations are exceedingly intricate, and one of the main goals is to use derived categories in order to more precisely relate such representations to modules over differential graded Hecke algebras.  This will allow for the use of new tools to understand the relationships between Langlands correspondences for varying groups.  In addition to this, the PI and his collaborators plan to use known instances of automorphic base change and the global theory of automorphic forms to develop a mod p Langlands correspondence for p-adic unitary groups.

In the second research project, the PI will generalize a result of Elkies by proving that certain curves of genus four have infinitely many primes of supersingular reduction.  This project will be centered on special families of cyclic covers of the projective line branched at four points, and their associated Hurwitz spaces and unitary Shimura varieties.  The strategy will use uniformization, quadratic forms, complex multiplication, and reduction techniques.

The principle of symmetry has played a crucial role in mathematics since Galois's study of roots of polynomials, and in physics since Einstein?s development of special relativity. Over the past 50 years, new instances of the very idea of symmetry have been discovered: supersymmetry, and later quantum symmetry, expressed in the form of the quantum groups. Representation theory comes into the picture as the way to understand the notion of quantum symmetry, but the very idea of quantum symmetry and its geometric origins remain elusive. ALong these lines, this project concerns the study on systems of linear differential equations of one complex variable, with algebraic coefficients and arbitrary singularities. One of the main objects of study is the space of solutions of such differential equations (and their generalizations), Stokes data, reflecting asymptotic properties of solutions. The PI will investigate quantization of these moduli spaces and its connections with representation theory and theoretical physics. Quantum geometry of moduli spaces of Stokes data provides a new geometric approach to quantum symmetries. It embeds quantum groups and their key properties into a much more general and geometric framework of the quantized moduli spaces of Stokes data. This project will provide training and research opportunities for graduate students in this area of research.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will study the quantum geometry of various moduli spaces, using the theory cluster Poisson varieties as the main tool, and applications to algebraic geometry, representation Theory, and mathematical physics. In addition, the PI will study classical and quantum polylogarithms and quantum Hodge field theory. The main priorities of the project are the following: a) To give a comprehensive treatment of the cluster structure of moduli spaces of meromorphic connections with possibly irregular singularities on Riemann surfaces and apply the results to quantization of these moduli spaces. b) To develop cluster quantization at roots of unity with applications to representations of DeConcini-Kac quantum groups and invariants of threefolds. c) To develop the theory of quantum multiple polylogarithms, providing a quantum deformation of the periods of the pro-unipotent completion of the motivic fundamental group of the punctured projective line. d) To further develop quantum Hodge field theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Various phenomena across science and engineering can be modeled by systems of polynomial equations, which leads to natural interactions with other fields such as applied mathematics, biology, computer science, and mathematical physics. For systems of polynomial equations, one studies its sets of solutions, called varieties, and the corresponding shapes they describe in high-dimensional spaces. As the number of equations and variables grow larger, one useful approach to understand these shapes is to study the algebraic functions defined on them. Using this approach, many properties such as smoothness and degrees of varieties can be translated into algebraic terms. One such strategy is to study properties of varieties by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of sequences of algebraic objects called ideals. This project contributes to this line of research with problems originating from two directions that involve the study of these properties of ideals. The PI will also be involved in mentoring students and in organizing academic events, focusing on benefiting graduate students and underrepresented groups in mathematics.<br/><br/>The symbolic powers of an ideal encode important algebraic and geometric information of the ideal and the variety it defines. The PI will investigate the asymptotic behavior of homological invariants of symbolic powers such as, the number of generators, the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, and the projective dimension. For the sequence of numbers of generators, the PI intends to investigate if it always has polynomial complexity, building of previous results by the PI and his collaborators. A general result in this direction would have important consequences on the arithmetic rank, Frobenius complexity, and Kodaira dimension of divisors. For the other two sequences, regularities and projective dimensions, the PI will focus on regular rings of positive characteristic. In such rings, a new class of ideals is defined for which it has been previously shown the limit of these sequences exist; this class includes several types of determinantal ideals, as well as the square-free monomial ideals. The PI will investigate the existence of these limits for more general classes of ideals. The relation between multiplicities and convex bodies is an important research topic lying in the interaction of Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry, and Combinatorics. In recent years, this line of research has gained much activity due to the introduction of Newton-Okounkov bodies and mixed multiplicities of filtrations of ideals. The PI and his collaborators intend to find conditions for the non-vanishing of mixed multiplicities of multigraded algebras.  The PI will also investigate a notion of mixed multiplicities for filtrations of not necessarily zero dimensional ideals and the relation of these new multiplicities with the mixed volumes of certain Newton-Okounkov bodies.<br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two of the main sources of motivation for investigating these geometries are the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum physics and abstract algebra in mathematics. The conference will provide a setting for two largely distinct groups of researchers to come together, exchange ideas, and learn about recent developments. A central aim of the conference is to provide early-career mathematicians perspective and an entry point into this exciting and fast-moving field.<br/><br/>Noncommutative geometry is a general viewpoint in which one seeks to apply tools, perspectives, and intuition from geometry to noncommutative algebraic structures in the absence of a direct spectral interpretation as rings of functions.

The conference will include participants who can illuminate different aspects of this overarching theme. The meeting is designed to provide a unique opportunity for an exchange of ideas and a stock-taking on the state of the field as a whole. The gathering is aimed at bringing together early-career researchers, primarily graduate students, postdocs and early-stage faculty, and introducing them to a broad vision and providing opportunities for forming new connections and collaborations. Attention will be paid to diversity, not only in the application process, but also in the funding of participants and creating a welcoming environment for traditionally underrepresented groups.

Such objects, called varieties, play a fundamental role throughout mathematics as well as in applications in science and engineering. Motivated by a question that originates with mathematician Henri Poincaré in 1891, the investigators will study the relationship between local properties of a variety and global features of tangents at points of the variety, as these points vary. They will also work on implicitization, a classical question in pure mathematics that is of much interest to scientists in geometric modelling and computer aided design. Given any geometric object, such as a curve or surface, the goal is to find the system of polynomial equations that has the geometric object as a solution set; knowing these 'implicit' equations provides insight into the geometric object. The PIs will involve graduate students and postdoctoral visitors in the project, and they will facilitate scientific exchange by organizing international programs, conferences, and national online seminars.<br/><br/>The investigators will work on projects pertaining to algebraic vector fields, the implicitization problem for Rees rings, equisingularity theory, and residual intersections. The PIs will use tools from commutative algebra to investigate how the types of singularities and the global invariants of a variety are reflected in properties of the vector fields that are tangent to the variety. In particular, they wish to establish a correspondence between the types and constellation of the singularities of a projective plane curve on the one hand and the graded Betti numbers of the module of derivations of its homogeneous coordinate ring on the other. Determining the implicit equations defining the graph and image of a rational map between projective spaces is a classical problem in elimination theory. The PIs will concentrate on the case of Cremona maps, where the implicit equations of the graph also provide a parametrization of the inverse map. For dominant rational maps they will investigate the relationship between the projective degrees of the rational map and the number and bidegrees of the equations defining the graph. In equisingularity theory, one seeks fiberwise multiplicity-based criteria for a family of analytic spaces to be Whitney equisingular and hence topologically trivial. The PIs plan to devise such a criterion for analytic spaces with arbitrary singularities by using a new notion of multiplicity inspired by intersection theory.

Most of the points of an algebraic variety are smooth in the sense that their neighborhoods look like n-dimensional linear spaces. However, certain points called ?singularities? do not have this smooth property, for example the vertex of a cone. There is a plethora of complicated possible singularities, and their understanding has applications in physics, robotics, and economics. A key tool to study singularities is assigning calculable discrete invariants (for example numbers or sequences of numbers) to them in such a way that the discrete invariant encodes some of the geometric properties of the singularity. On type of these discrete invariants are what are called ""characteristic classes,"" which come in many variants and flavors. Remarkably, a recently discovered characteristic class of singularities, called a ""stable envelope,"" also appears in string theory in theoretical physics. The relation to string theory suggests a so-far hidden symmetry of characteristic classes. Namely, it predicts that there are pairs of seemingly unrelated algebraic varieties whose stable envelopes of singularities coincide. The main goal of the project is to prove this statement in its mathematical setting and derive geometric applications. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The PI will generalize the concept of stable envelopes from Nakajima quiver varieties to a broader class of varieties called Cherkis bow varieties. The algebraic combinatorics underlying the geometric study of bow varieties are NS5-D5 brane configurations, which are more complete than that of quiver varieties or homogeneous spaces. This fact gives rise to new operations on bow varieties: Hanany-Witten transition and combinatorial 3d mirror symmetry. The PI will utilize these operations to build a Hall algebra structure on the elliptic cohomology of bow varieties, generalizing cohomological and K theoretic Hall algebras of quivers. The elliptic Hall algebra structure complements the geometric study of singularities, and the two together will be used to organize an inductive proof of a three-dimensional mirror symmetry statement. The cohomological and K-theoretic limits provide coincidences among motivic invariants of singularities. Dimension count arguments of the same elliptic Hall algebra promise Donaldson-Thomas invariants, as well as identities among elliptic functions that generalize quantum dilogarithm identities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The language we have in mind is the language of polynomial equations, the same polynomial equations one first encounters in an Algebra class in high school.  Despite its basic nature this language possesses enormous complexity and descriptive power which were not always well-understood by mathematicians.   About fifty years ago it was proved that no computer program can determine whether a certain kind of statement in this language is true even when the objects being described are sets of natural numbers, quite familiar to everyone since childhood.  In other words, no computer program can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables has a solution in integer numbers. On the other hand, if one asks the same question about rational numbers, one is confronted with one of the many basic questions concerning polynomial equations to which the answer is unknown.  Understanding and trying to tackle this question and other related ones requires interaction of and input from several fields of Mathematics such as Logic, Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and Topology.  At the same time, the questions and methods developed for the study of the language of polynomial equations lead to new results and research directions in the areas of Mathematics mentioned above.

Since then, it has been a deep mystery appearing in many frontiers of mathematics. In general, it appears to be a hidden relation between symplectic geometry, which is the natural framework for describing classical mechanics, and complex algebraic geometry. More recent discoveries link it with several other areas of mathematics and physics. Still, as of today, there is no systematic understanding of mirror symmetry. The main goal of this focused research group is to establish a universal tool to study mirror symmetry and related geometric questions arising in modern frontiers of geometry and topology.

As understanding has evolved, mirror symmetry has been identified as the Laplace transform in certain cases, which provides an effective mechanism of computing quantum invariants of a space from the complex geometry of its mirror. In general, it is a higher categorical relation between symplectic geometry and complex algebraic geometry. In a gauge theoretic context, mirror symmetry appears in the form of the Langlands duality among algebraic groups. More recent discoveries link it with quantum knot invariants. The main goal of the project is to establish complex Lagrangian geometry as a universal tool to study geometric questions and quantization arising in modern frontiers of geometry and topology and to construct models in which we can see all aspects of mirror symmetry, including the real symplectic-complex algebraic duality, the Langlands duality, the Laplace transform, and a relation to three-manifold invariants. In Lagrange's formulation many non-linear problems can be solved via integrable systems, an approach which is widely applicable, extending far beyond its classical origins to high-energy particle physics and string theory. This project aims to advance understanding of the complex integrable systems that arise in such situations, together with their quantum mechanical counterparts, by considering concrete models constructed on Hitchin integrable systems.

Studying perfect fusion categories will enable mathematicians to understand weakly integral fusion categories and would yield, for example, insights into the detection of universal anyons by experimental physicists.

The mirror symmetry phenomenon asserts that Calabi--Yau manifolds come in mirror pairs X and Y which determine the same physics, implying surprising relations between geometric properties of X and Y. Birational geometry is the study of surgeries of spaces obtained by cutting out a subspace of lower dimension and gluing another in its place. The moduli space of a space Y parametrizes all possible spaces obtained by deforming Y. If X and Y are a mirror pair, then the birational geometry of X determines the structure of the moduli space of Y near a certain limit point. Based on this heuristic, Morrison conjectured that a Calabi--Yau manifold X admits only finitely many possible surgeries up to symmetries of X. The PI aims to show the conjecture is false in general, but a weaker statement sufficient for applications to moduli holds, as suggested by recent work of the PI with graduate students on unbounded Calabi--Yau manifolds. The PI will also study positively curved spaces called Fano manifolds and singularities that arise at limit points of the moduli space of Calabi--Yau manifolds via mirror symmetry. These projects will be pursued together with graduate students supported by the grant. The PI will also organize seminars and a conference focused on training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI will study Morrison's cone conjecture and applications to birational geometry and moduli, joint with a collaborator. Morrison conjectured that the automorphism group of a Calabi--Yau manifold acts on its nef cone with rational polyhedral fundamental domain, so that a neighborhood of a cusp of the moduli space of the mirror manifold admits a compactification determined by this data via a construction of Looijenga. Recent work of the PI with graduate students on log Calabi--Yau manifolds and mirror deformations of singularities suggests that the conjecture does not hold in general, but a weaker version sufficient for applications to moduli should hold. The PI will study mirror symmetry for Q-Fano 3-folds and applications to classification and non-arithmetic curves on moduli of K3 surfaces, joint with a graduate student. Q-Fano 3-folds arise as end products of the minimal model program and so are basic to our understanding of 3-folds. Mirror symmetry heuristics suggest that the mirror of a Q-Fano 3-fold is a K3 fibration over the affine line with monodromy at infinity that is maximally unipotent after a finite base change. The mirror corresponds to a rigid rational curve on a moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces.  Computations suggest that these curves are not Shimura curves but are uniformized by non-arithmetic groups. The PI will study mirror symmetry for Milnor fibers of surface singularities and applications to symplectomorphism groups and moduli of surfaces, a project that joint with others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More specifically, the Langlands reciprocity conjectures seek to uncover mysterious identities relating functions of arithmetic/number-theoretic nature with functions of analytic/representation-theoretic nature. Such identities reveal hidden symmetries in the objects that give rise to the functions, and each instance of such identities usually has deep consequences. For example, a special case of Langlands' reciprocity conjectures was proved by Wiles and his school, finally resulting in a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Fermat's Last Theorem concerned integer solutions of a particular polynomial equation. More general solution sets of polynomials are called algebraic varieties, and among those, Shimura varieties have been central in establishing cases of Langlands' vision. Their study brings together techniques from diverse fields and challenges mathematicians from many different directions. This project centers on the study Shimura varieties as a testing ground of Langlands' reciprocity conjectures. Along the way, the PI will involve his PhD students and Postdocs, and will continue his work on disseminating fundamental science, and on building interactions between different mathematics departments and between mathematicians with diverse fields of expertise.<br/><br/><br/>More specifically, the PI will study Shimura varieties from a geometric and representation-theoretic viewpoint, using recent breakthroughs in various domains, in order to express Hasse-Weil zeta functions of very general Shimura varieties in terms of automorphic L-functions. The focus will be on Shimura varieties of abelian type, and the PI will solve various difficulties arising from the presence of singularities on these varieties. These bad reduction issues are easiest to study in the case of parahoric level structure, which will be investigated first, building on prior work of the PI along with recent methods of Kisin-Shin-Zhu in the good reduction (no singularities) cases. The PI will also address deeper level structure situations, bringing in new p-adic geometry techniques due to Scholze and Fargues-Scholze. Of particular importance will be the Fargues-Scholze geometrization of the local Langlands correspondence, and the way this interacts with the PI's ideas on implementing the Langlands-Kottwitz method for deeper level Shimura varieties.

The language we have in mind is the language of polynomial equations, the same polynomial equations one first encounters in an Algebra class in high school.  Despite its basic nature this language possesses enormous complexity and descriptive power which were not always well-understood by mathematicians.   About fifty years ago it was proved that no computer program can determine whether a certain kind of statement in this language is true even when the objects being described are sets of natural numbers, quite familiar to everyone since childhood.  In other words, no computer program can determine whether an arbitrary polynomial equation in several variables has a solution in integer numbers. On the other hand, if one asks the same question about rational numbers, one is confronted with one of the many basic questions concerning polynomial equations to which the answer is unknown.  Understanding and trying to tackle this question and other related ones requires interaction of and input from several fields of Mathematics such as Logic, Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and Topology.  At the same time, the questions and methods developed for the study of the language of polynomial equations lead to new results and research directions in the areas of Mathematics mentioned above. This project involves graduate student training and it will develop an online collaboration platform.<br/> <br/> <br/>This project considers several problems in definability and computability over arithmetically significant fields, that is fields of importance to Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Model Theory, Computability Theory and Valuation Theory.

While the methods employed are for the most part (though most definitely not always) algebraic or geometric in nature, the questions originate in Logic.  More specifically, the Principal Investigators intend to study computability and definability in the first-order and/or existential language of rings over number fields, their rings of integers and their infinite algebraic extensions.  Another set of related problems concerns computability and definability over function fields and rings of all characteristics.  Some of the main outstanding questions in the area concern extensions of Hilbert?s Tenth Problem to the field of rational numbers and rings of algebraic integers, decidability of the first-order theory of the largest abelian extension of rational numbers, definability of valuation rings in function fields over global and local fields, algebraically closed fields, and other classes of arithmetically significant base fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will bring together leading international experts and early career researchers from mathematics and physics to share techniques and advances in quantum symmetry. It will take place at the Centre de Recherches Mathématiques (CRM), Montreal, Canada, from October 10 to November 4, 2022, and will feature three weeks of lectures courses and a one-week international conference. For more information, see the conference website: http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/2022/Quantum22/index_e.php<br/><br/>The topics of this event are important both in mathematics and physics. In mathematics, the latest developments in the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity bring new results to this well-developed subject. Related developments in topological quantum field theory (TQFT) and vertex algebras (VA) clarify the structure of ""non-semisimple"" TQFT and VA. Many recent conferences in these areas of research have focused on parts of these connections, but this conference will be unique in the sense that it will feature talks on each of the following topics: conformal field theories, vertex operator algebras, Hopf algebras and fusion categories, tensor categories in positive characteristic, constructions of modular categories, cohomological aspects of tensor categories, and more.  These activities will connect communities working on different sides of the rich research area that is quantum symmetry. Other important aims include the training of the next generation of mathematical scientists and creating opportunities to meet with other researchers working on related problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When considered as parts of larger and more abstract number systems, for example those containing imaginary numbers, there are several ways primes may factor. The splitting behavior of prime numbers is a fascinating and mysterious part of nature, and number theory is concerned with studying it systematically, especially by connecting it with the arithmetic of polynomials and the geometry of their solution sets. Over the past several decades, the Langlands program has revealed striking connections between these solution sets of polynomials and sets of symmetries that naturally occur in infinite-dimensional spaces. It has been especially fruitful in the Langlands program to consider the way these symmetries deform within families, and this project approaches two outstanding problems in this area by using the framework of Whittaker models to make them more concrete, or to turn them into explicit computational problems.<br/><br/>Spaces of Whittaker functions of automorphic forms are called Whittaker models. Symmetries in Whittaker models capture what is needed to construct L-functions in the Langlands program, in many cases. This project will study the deformation theory of Whittaker models in order to understand the behavior of Langlands reciprocity with respect to congruences modulo prime numbers, and with respect to deformation in families. The first goal is to generalize Ihara?s lemma by controlling congruences between automorphic forms in terms of their local Whittaker models. The approach is to use a computer to test, in many examples, the congruences that can occur in the action of the local Iwahori-Hecke algebra on a non-Eisenstein integral eigenform. The second goal is to formulate, and prove in the banal case, a local Langlands conjecture in families for reductive groups other than the general linear group, especially quasi-split groups that split over a tame extension. The approach is to construct a moduli space of Langlands parameters, study its geometry, and use converse theorems to connect it to the integral Bernstein center.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typical examples include SU(2), the group of 2x2 unitary complex matrices, and O(3,R), the group of orthogonal 3x3 matrices with real entries.  Broadly speaking, the subject of representation theory deals with how such groups can act on a complex vector space via linear transformations.  One can then ask what happens if we replace the complex numbers by a finite field (or the algebraic closure of a finite field).  Modular representation theory is concerned with matrix groups with entries in such a field, acting on vector spaces over the same field.  This research will use geometric methods to make advances in modular representation theory. Many of the anticipated results are motivated by known facts in complex representation theory, but new tools and techniques must be developed in the modular case.  In connection with this research, the P.I. will also undertake research-training activities aimed at Ph.D. students and other early-career researchers. <br/> <br/>The past few years have seen the emergence of powerful new tools for applying geometric methods to the representation theory of algebraic groups in positive characteristic, including ""parity sheaves"" and the ""mixed modular derived category."" This research will build on these developments with projects on three different topics: (i) the topology of global Schubert varieties; (ii) Kazhdan-Lusztig cells, tensor ideals, and tilting modules; and (iii) ""silting"" complexes of coherent sheaves. Topic (i) has connections to number theory and to a potential ""modular ramified Satake equivalence"".  Topic (ii) has the most direct links to classical questions in representation theory, while topic (iii) is expected to lead to new avenues of research in K-theory and categorification, for instance in the context of symmetric spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM) conferences aim to be a main vehicle in the exploration of the broad interface between mathematics and contemporary computation, a subject area of importance both intellectually and for practical applications. It is expected that about 500 researchers will attend the conference from around the world, and about a third of them will be from the US. This project will partially cover travel and lodging costs for a diverse group of US researchers attending the conference. The majority of the funds will be distributed on a competitive basis to junior US participants, including graduate students, postdocs, and tenure track faculty.<br/><br/>The conference will follow the format of former FoCM conferences: plenary lectures in the mornings and theme-centered parallel workshops in the afternoons. Each workshop extends over three days, and the conference will consist of three periods, each period featuring 7 mathematically diverse but interconnected workshops, with 21 workshops in total. These activities combined with poster sessions and informal interactions among participants all synthesize forefront research with mentoring and training opportunities for young participants, helping them develop networks that include the world?s leading researchers. A number of themes connect the diverse workshop topics, such as learning from computation to automate, adapt and optimize the computational process which by itself becomes an analysis tool, ties from homotopy methods used in computational algebraic geometry for systems of algebraic equations and interior point methods in continuous optimization to numerical methods for differential equations and aspects of differential geometry, machine learning and signal processing cast as very large and challenging convex optimization problems, common themes among symbolic algorithms used for the solution of algebraic and differential equations, and relationships between decidability and tractability in real/complex arithmetic computational models and the Turing machine models considered in the context of combinatorics and intractability as well as discrete optimization.

Broadly speaking, methods for finding simultaneous solutions to multiple equations have significant implications for progress in physics, computer science, and engineering. These solutions may be expressed in terms of the intersection of certain geometric spaces. The motivating question in enumerative geometry is to predict the number of geometric figures with specified properties that satisfy a list of conditions. For example, we may seek the number of curves that contain a set of points and are tangent to a list of lines. Surprisingly, while it can be very difficult to determine the precise list of figures that satisfy the conditions, it is often possible to predict the number of such figures. The search for exact formulas for the number of solutions in enumerative geometry is an active area of research with relations to numerous fields, including geometry, combinatorics, representation theory, complexity theory in computer science, and mirror symmetry in theoretical physics. This grant will support continued work in these areas by the investigators and their graduate students. <br/> <br/>An effective approach to solving enumerative geometric problems is to understand the intersection theory of moduli spaces of geometric figures. The field of Schubert calculus loosely applies to these investigations among large classes of varieties in homogeneous spaces. Various cohomology theories can be used to extract enumerative information. For example, singular cohomology is useful for counting the number of points in intersections of geometric figures, quantum cohomology is designed for counting curves meeting other figures, and equivariant cohomology produces more general geometric invariants that depend on a group action. Cohomology theories of spaces with group actions often have naturally defined bases, and geometric invariants related to such bases tend to possess intriguing positivity properties, often related to beautiful combinatorial structures that capture the essential aspects of the geometry. The investigators will study these phenomena in the context of several geometric spaces, including flag varieties and their cotangent bundles, bow varieties, and Hessenberg varieties. Techniques include intersection theory, equivariant localization, symmetric functions, Hecke algebra actions, and geometric representation theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum field theory has led to a unification of many seemingly disparate areas of mathematics during the past half century, including geometry, representation theory, algebra, combinatorics, and number theory. The purpose of this conference is to bring together active researchers in these areas with the goal of strengthening ties, fostering communication, and generating new ideas at the interface of physics and various areas of mathematics. This proposal is part of an ongoing effort directed at understanding all aspects of topological mirror symmetry and string theory at mathematical levels of rigor, transmitting this understanding to both mathematicians and physicists, and creating the infrastructure for intensive interactions between these two groups within a single, flourishing subject. <br/> <br/>Mirror symmetry, discovered by physicists in the 1990s, reveals a deep duality between symplectic and complex geometries. It transforms Gromov-Witten invariants, which are difficult to compute in general, to period integrals in complex analysis, which are computable and satisfy certain PDEs. For a given Calabi-Yau manifold, it is a longstanding problem to construct its mirror. The celebrated Strominger-Yau-Zaslow program proposed that a Calabi-Yau manifold has a special Lagrangian torus fibration, and its mirror can be constructed by taking the dual of the torus fibers. Vertex operator algebra (VOAs) are algebraic structures that arose from conformal field theory, and were axiomatized by Borcherds. Certain VOAs can be realized geometrically as algebras of operators on the cohomology rings of moduli spaces. A key example is the action of the Y-algebras of Gaiotto and Rapcak on the moduli space of spiked instantons of certain toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. A vast generalization of this picture has been proposed by Rapcak, Soibelman, Yang, and Zhao, and is based on the action of the Hall algebra on the cohomology of moduli spaces. On the other hand, the quiver formulation of some toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and their nc deformations can be constructed from the Fukaya category via mirror symmetry. Thus the Hall algebra action has an interesting meaning in symplectic geometry. This conference will provide a forum for researchers in these fields to communicate in the hope of resolving these conjectures and finding further connections between mirror symmetry and representation theory.

Symmetric organisms persist through evolution in nature, symmetric protagonists are perceived as especially beautiful in art, and symmetric components are critical to engineering structures that can withstand powerful forces. The set of symmetries of a particular physical object enjoys a rich algebraic structure, because symmetries are operations that can be composed together.  This group of all symmetries can then be conveniently studied by encoding each symmetry as a rectangular array of numbers called a matrix.  This process of passing from a symmetric object in the natural world to a related collection of matrices is the hallmark of the mathematical field of representation theory. Representation theory thus reduces the complex study of symmetry in nature to questions in the well understood area of mathematics called linear algebra. As such, the proposed projects have broad potential to substantially impact our understanding of many symmetric structures occurring throughout the mathematical and natural sciences. This project also provides opportunities for directly involving undergraduate students in mathematical research, with a focused goal of supporting the development and recruitment of women in mathematics.<br/><br/>This project will address two topics in the algebra, geometry, and representation theory of reductive algebraic groups over non-archimedean local fields.  First, applying techniques from geometric group theory to the associated Bruhat-Tits building, the investigator will provide a global approach to understanding the conjugacy classes of any affine Weyl group.  Second, this geometric perspective will also be applied to reinterpret the K-theoretic generalization of Peterson's isomorphism from the equivariant homology of the affine Grassmannian to the equivariant quantum cohomology of a finite flag variety.  Specific objectives include a complete description of an affine conjugacy class in terms of the underlying finite Weyl group, and new representatives for the Schubert classes in the equivariant K-homology of the affine Grassmannian.  As such, the research will stimulate new interactions among the mathematical subfields of representation theory, arithmetic geometry, enumerative geometry, algebraic combinatorics, geometric group theory, and mathematical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
